The zinc finger transcription factor, Snail, functions as a potent repressor of E-cadherin expression that can, acting alone or in concert with the Wnt/β-catenin/T cell factor axis, induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Although mechanisms that coordinate signaling events initiated by Snail and Wnt remain undefined, we demonstrate that Snail displays β-catenin-like canonical motifs that support its GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation, β-TrCP-directed ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, Wnt signaling inhibits Snail phosphorylation and consequently increases Snail protein levels and activity while driving an in vivo epithelial-mesenchymal transition that is suppressed following Snail knockdown. These findings define a potential mechanism whereby Wnt signaling stabilizes Snail and β-catenin proteins in tandem fashion so as to cooperatively engage transcriptional programs that control an epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

E-cadherin, the prototypic member of the cadherin singlepass transmembrane glycoprotein family, regulates cell adhesion in epithelial cells in a Ca2+-dependent manner via homotypic interactions with E-cadherin molecules on opposing cell surfaces (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). The adhesive function of E-cadherin is dependent on its binding to the cytoplasmic α- and β-catenin proteins, which serve to tether the cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). During embryonic development, down-regulation of E-cadherin function marks the onset of a complex program wherein epithelial cells adopt a fibroblast-like phenotype and display tissue invasive activity, a process termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 1The abbreviations used are: EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; GSK, glycogen-synthase kinase; TCF, T cell factor; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane.1The abbreviations used are: EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; GSK, glycogen-synthase kinase; TCF, T cell factor; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane.

Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Likewise, E-cadherin repression is thought to play a major role in the abnormal manifestation of EMT in epithelial-derived cancer types (3Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia De Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, 4Cano A. Perez-Moreno A.M. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F.

In both development and cancer, the zinc finger transcription factor, Snail, has been implicated in E-cadherin repression via its binding to elements in the E-cadherin promoter (6Nieto M.A. Nat. Rev./Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Indeed, during development, Snail plays a required role in driving the EMT programs that mark gastrulation as well as neural crest development (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 3Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia De Herreros A. Nat.

Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). In a similar, but misdirected fashion, neoplastic cells co-opt Snail function to adopt a mesenchymal cell-like invasive phenotype that characterizes their aberrant behavior (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 3Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia De Herreros A. Nat.

Hinoda Y. Imai K. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Gen. 2004; 36: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Of note, independent of its well defined role in E-cadherin-dependent adhesion, β-catenin also participates in Wnt signaling (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In the absence of a Wnt signal, cytosolic β-catenin is normally phosphorylated by glycogen-synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) at one or more serine or threonine residues in its N-terminal domain (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The N-terminally phosphorylated β-catenin is then recognized and ubiquitinated by a multiprotein complex containing the F-box protein β-TrCP, with resultant degradation of the poly-ubiquitinated β-catenin in the proteasome (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a subset of the 19 known Wnt genes found in mammals (e.g. Wnt-1) can activate a pathway that inhibits the ability of GSK3β to phosphorylate target substrates via a process dependent on the protein Dvl (disheveled) with resultant increases in β-catenin levels (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The stabilization of β-catenin consequently leads to both enhanced nuclear accumulation and enhanced binding to members of the T cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In turn, β-catenin·TCF complexes regulate the expression of a panoply of gene products that direct cell fate, polarity, and proliferation (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Although Wnt signaling could conceivably stabilize the pool of cytosolic β-catenin that is released from E-cadherin-bound sites as a consequence of Snail-mediated E-cadherin repression (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin.

Cell. 2001; 1: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), direct interplay between the Wnt and Snail systems has remained a subject of conjecture. Herein, we demonstrate that the Snail transcript encodes a series of β-catenin-like canonical motifs that support its GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation, β-TrCP-directed ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation via a Wnt-1-regulatable process. Because increasing evidence indicates that Wnt signals can impact on multiple cell functions in neoplastic tissues (12Uematsu K. He B. You L. Xu Z. McCormick F. Jablons D.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7218-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 13He B. You L. Uematsu K. Xu Z. Lee A.Y. Matsangou M. McCormick F. Jablons D.M.

Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), these findings support a model wherein activation of the Wnt-GSK3β signaling cascade regulates carcinoma cell phenotype by controlling β-catenin· TCF- and Snail-dependent transcriptional programs in tandem fashion. Plasmids—A human Snail cDNA with a C-terminal FLAG (Flg) epitope tag was subcloned into three expression vectors: pCR3.1, to generate pCR3.1-Snail-Flg; a bicistronic pCMS-EGFP, to generate pCMS-EGFP-Snail-Flg; and the retroviral vector pBabePuro (5Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y.S. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). A human Snail cDNA with both a His6 and Flg C-terminal epitope tag was cloned into the vector pET21 to generate pET21-Snail-His for expression of recombinant Snail protein in Escherichia coli. Snail mutant proteins with Flg epitope tails, including the S100A, S104A, S107A, S100A,S104A, S104A,S107A, S100A,S107A, and S96A mutants, were constructed by PCR-based methods using a wild-type Snail cDNA as a template, followed by subcloning into the pCR3.1 vector. His6/Flg-tagged Snail mutants (i.e. S104A,S107A and Δ81–109) were also generated by PCR-based methods for expression in bacteria using the pET21 construct. The E-cadherin reporter gene constructs Ecad(-108)-Luc and Ecad(-108)/EboxA.MUT/EboxB.MUT/EboxC.MUT-Luc were described previously (5Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y.S. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). A β-TrCP cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR-based methods, using the total mRNA of 293 cells and the β-TrCP cDNA subcloned into pCR3.1. The dominant negative mouse β-TrCP vector (dN-β-TrCP-myc) was kindly provided by Dr. Z. J. Chen (University of Texas-Southwestern, Dallas) (44Spencer E. Jiang J. Chen Z.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 1: 284-294Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A pCR3.1 expression vector encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin was generated by reverse transcription-PCR-based methods using HeLa total RNA. HA-tagged Wnt-1 retroviral expression vector (pLNCX-mWnt-1-HA) was a gift from O. MacDougald (University of Michigan). To generate the pSUPER-Snail-shRNA, annealed oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCAGGCCTTCAACTGCAAATAGTGTGCTGTCCTATTTGCAGTTGAAGGCCTTTTTTTGGAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAAGGCCTTCAACTGCAAATAGGACAGCACACTATTTGCAGTTGAAGGCCTG-3′ were inserted into pSUPER-retro vector (OligoEngine). The 19-nt human Snail target sequence (indicated by underline) was designed and verified to be specific for Snail by Blast search against the human genome and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. A control shRNA oligonucleotide was used to generate pSUPER-control. Cell Culture and Retroviral Gene Expression—The MCF-7 and 293 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum. pBabePuro-Snail-Flg or pLNCX-mWnt-1-HA were used to generate retroviral stocks in 293 cells for subsequent infection of MCF-7 cells. The stable transfectants MCF-7-Snail-Flg and MCF-7-Wnt-1-HA were obtained from pooled clones selected with 1.0 μg/ml puromycin or 400 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Recombinant His6 Fusion Protein and in Vitro Phosphorylation— Recombinant His and Flg double-tagged Snail protein was expressed in pET21-transformed BL21 E. coli and purified by nickel-charged agarose affinity chromatography and imidazole elution, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Two μg of protein was used for in vitro phosphorylation with 500 μCi/μmol [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), and 75 units of recombinant GSK3 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) for 2 h at 25 °C. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Snail-Flg proteins were detected by anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma), Snail-His/Flg proteins were detected with either anti-His6 or anti-FLAG antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and phosphorylated Snail proteins were detected with anti-phosphoserine antibody (Upstate USA, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). β-TRCP (SC-15354) and GSK3 (4G-1E) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Upstate USA, Inc., respectively. For immunoprecipitation, whole cell Triton X-100 lysates were incubated with FLAG-M2 agarose (Sigma) and washed with lysis buffer. The proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system (Pierce) (41Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). For detecting endogenous Snail, β-catenin, and E-cadherin, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol; NucBuster Protein Extraction Kit, Novagen) were prepared from MCF-7 cells. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected with either an anti-Snail polyclonal (5Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y.S. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar), anti-β-catenin (BD Bioscience), anti-E-cadherin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or anti-β-actin (BD Bioscience) antiserum. Pulse-Chase Analysis—MCF-7 cells or 293 cells were transiently transfected with 1.0 μg of pCR3.1-Snail-Flg (FuGENE 6; Roche Applied Science). After 12 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated in standard medium for an additional 48 h, at which point, the cells were pulse-labeled with 50 μCi/ml of [35S]Met/Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min, washed, and incubated in complete medium for the indicated times. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose beads, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. siRNA and shRNA Targeting—293 cells were electroporated with 100 nm siRNA duplexes directed against human GSK3β or a scrambled mock siRNA (Upstate) 24 h after being transfected with 1.0 μg of pCMS-EGFP-Snail-Flg. The cells were harvested 48 h later, and GSK3 and Snail protein levels were determined by immunoblotting with anti-GSK3 and anti-FLAG-M2 antibodies. MCF-7-Wnt-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with 1 μg of pSUPER-Snail-shRNA or pSUPER-control, and 0.5 μg of a pCMS-EGFP plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech). The cells were collected 24 h after transfection. In Vitro Translation and in Vitro Binding Assay—[35S]β-TrCP protein was obtained by in vitro transcription and translation from the pCR3.1-β-TrCP vector, using the TnT in vitro translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) with 10 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Lysates from 293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant Snail were immunoprecipitated with FLAG-agarose beads, and equivalent amounts of the Snail proteins (normalized by semi-quantitative immunoblot analysis) were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]β-TrCP for an additional 2 h at 25 °C. Specifically bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting. In Vivo Ubiquitination—HA-tagged ubiquitin was co-transfected with each FLAG-tagged Snail construct. After 48 h, the lysates were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with α-Flg or anti-HA antibodies. Wnt Treatment—The cell and extracellular protein extracts from Wnt-1 expressing RAC-311 and control MV7 cells (both cell lines kindly provided by L. R. Howe) were prepared from a 0.4 m NaCl buffer extract as described previously (45Howe L.R. Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar) and added to cells at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. Reporter Gene Assays—MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with 1.0 μgof reporter gene Ecad(-108)-Luc or Ecad(-108)/EboxA.MUT/EboxB.MUT/EboxC.MUT-Luc, 25 ng of wild-type, or mutant Snail expression vectors; MCF-7-Snail-Flg or MCF-7-Wnt-1-HA cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of reporter gene only (5Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y.S. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter gene activities were measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) 48 h after transfection and normalized by measuring β-galactosidase activities of co-transfected pSV-gal (0.25 μg; Clontech) with a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). Reporter gene activities were presented as relative light units to that obtained from mock transfected cells. The results are expressed as the averages of the ratio of the reporter activities. Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Invasion Assay—Control transfected MCF-7 cells, wild-type Snail-transfected cells, or mutant Snail-transfected cells labeled with fluoresbrite carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences) were cultured atop the CAM of 11-day-old chick embryos for 3 days (25Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For analyses of MCF-7-Wnt-1-expressing cells, invasion of the GFP/siRNA co-transfected cells was monitored by GFP fluorescence in place of the fluorescent beads. Immunofluorescence—MCF-7 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton-100, and immunostained with anti-E-cadherin antibody and Alexa-Fluoro-488-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR). FLAG-tagged Snail was stained with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma; 1:500) and Alexa-Fluoro-594 labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probe). CAM type IV collagen was identified with a chick-specific monoclonal antibody (IIB12) provided by J. Fitch and T. Linsenmayer (Tufts University). Following retroviral transduction of MCF-7 cells with a vector encoding a FLAG epitope-tagged form of human Snail (Snail-Flg), the cells displayed a morphology consistent with that seen in a typical EMT, and E-cadherin protein expression was strongly suppressed (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether Snail can trigger tissue invasive activity in a manner consistent with the acquisition of a mesenchymal cell-like phenotype, fluorescently labeled MCF-7 cells were cultured atop the chick chorioallantoic membrane. Whereas mock transduced MCF-7 cells were confined to the upper surface of the CAM, the Snail-expressing MCF-7 cells perforated the underlying basement membrane and invaded into the CAM interstitium (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, when the Snail protein was recovered from transfected MCF-7 (or 293) cells, it migrated as a closely spaced doublet, suggesting post-translational modifications (Fig. 1C). Although treatment with O- or N-glycanase failed to alter the migration pattern of Snail (data not shown), treatment of protein extracts with λ protein phosphatase resulted in the loss of the more slowly migrating Snail isoform (Fig. 1C), consistent with notion that Snail is phosphorylated in MCF-7 as well as 293 cells (Fig. 1C). The human Snail amino acid sequence contains in excess of 20 serine and/or threonine residues, but the search for Snail domains that might be phosphorylated was considerably narrowed given that preliminary studies indicated that a mutant form of Snail lacking amino acids 92–120 migrated as a single band (data not shown). Of note, inspection of this region of the Snail protein revealed a 92SX2DSGX2SX3SX2S107 motif with considerable similarity to the GSK3β-sensitive N-terminal phosphorylation motif found in β-catenin (Fig. 1D) (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Further, this region of the Snail protein also contained the DSGXXS destruction motif recognized by β-TrCP in β-catenin as well as the IκB protein (Fig. 1D) (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Consistent with the possibility that Snail, like β-catenin, is recognized and bound by GSK3β (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 2Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitates of Snail-Flg recovered from transfected 293 cells contained endogenous GSK3β (Fig. 2A). In light of the existence of multiple potential phosphorylation sites within the amino acid 92–120 region of Snail, a series of single, or double, Ser → Ala substitutions were generated in the Snail-Flg expression vector. The constructs encoding the Snail mutants were then expressed in 293 cells, and the electrophoretic mobility of the Snail-Flg proteins was examined prior to and following λ protein phosphatase treatment of the cell extracts. Although single Ser → Ala substitutions at Ser100 (S100A), Ser104 (S104A), or Ser107 (S107A) or double substitutions at Ser100/Ser104 (S100A,S104A) or Ser100/Ser107 (S100A,S107A) did not affect the λ protein phosphataseinduced gel shift, dual Ser → Ala mutations at Ser104 and Ser107 (S104A,S107A) ablated the gel shift associated with λ protein phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2B). A key role for the Ser104 and Ser107 residues was further corroborated by data showing that recombinant GSK3β directly phosphorylated wild-type Snail via a LiCl-sensitive process in vitro (17Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) but not the S104A,S107A double mutant form of Snail (Fig. 2C). Indeed, whereas pulse-chase analysis demonstrated wild-type Snail was rapidly degraded in the course of a 4-h chase period, expression levels of the S104A,S107A mutant remained stable (Fig. 2D). The inability of GSK3β to phosphorylate the S104A,S107A mutant Snail protein in vivo could conceivably reflect nonspecific alterations in the conformation of the mutant Snail (18Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev./Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). However, consistent with the notion that Snail is phosphorylated in vivo by GSK3β, phosphorylation of wild-type Snail in 293 cells was blocked by treatment of the cells with the GSK3β inhibitor, LiCl (Fig. 2E) (17Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 18Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev./Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Coincident with the LiCl-dependent inhibition of Snail phosphorylation, steady state levels of wild-type Snail were also increased in LiCl-treated cells (Fig. 2E). Additionally, pulse-chase data indicated that LiCl treatment prolongs the half-life of the faster migrating and presumably hypophosphorylated or nonphosphorylated form(s) of Snail (Fig. 2E). Using a siRNA knockdown approach to reduce endogenous GSK3β levels in 293 cells engineered to ectopically express Snail, the steady state levels of Snail protein were likewise increased (Fig. 2F). To further determine whether GSK3β regulates the endogenous level of Snail in a fashion similar to that observed for the exogenously expressed protein, MCF-7 cells were cultured in the presence of either LiCl or the GSK3-specific inhibitor, CHIR99021 (19Ring D.B. Johnson K.W. Henriksen E.J. Nuss J.M. Goff D. Kinnick T.R. Ma S.T. Reeder J.W. Samuels I. Slabiak T. Wagman A.S. Hammond M.E. Harrison S.D. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). As expected, GSK3 inhibition by either reagent induced significant increases in the steady state nuclear levels of endogenous Snail in tandem with similar increases in β-catenin (Fig. 2G). In vivo, a subset of Wnt family members trigger largely undefined pathways that lead to the inhibition of GSK3β activity (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 20Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Because Wnt expression occurs frequently in a temporal fashion coincident with developmental EMT programs (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 20Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 21Shimamura K. Hirano S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of Snail could be inhibited by Wnt-1. Indeed, the phosphorylation of ectopically expressed wild-type Snail was suppressed markedly by treatment of the cells with Wnt-1-conditioned medium, and in concert, Snail half-life was increased (Fig. 3, A and B). Although Wnt-1 also increased the steady state expression levels of wild-type Snail, no effect was observed on the levels of the S104A,S107A mutant (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the premise that GSK3β regulates Snail and β-catenin levels in a cooperative fashion, Wnt-1 signaling mediated tandem increases in the nuclear levels of endogenous Snail as well as β-catenin (Fig. 3D). Following the GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, a 32DpSGXXpS motif in th"

It plays a key regulatory role in various cytokine-controlled cellular processes such as acute phase and immune responses, differentiation, proliferation, and cell survival (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 2Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, Stat3 can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at a single site close to the C terminus (Tyr-709). This phosphorylation is required for Stat3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding (3Levy D.E. Lee C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Stat3 has been implicated in cancer processes (4Bromberg J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 5Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Canc. 2004; 4: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). In fact, constitutive activation of Stat3 has been detected in many cancer cells and tissues as well as in a variety of experimental malignancies, including those of multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, lung, prostate, and gastric cancers (4Bromberg J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 5Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Canc. 2004; 4: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 6Benekli M. Baer M.R.

Jove R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In these malignancies, Stat3 has been described as mediating largely a survival function by activating antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-X (4Bromberg J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 10Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that Stat3 is activated by tyrosine kinases, mostly the Jak1 kinase upon stimulation. Activated Stat3 then dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds specific promoter sequences of target genes and induces transcription (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 2Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The dimerization is through the interaction between the SH2 domain of one Stat3 and the tyrosine-phosphorylated tail segment of the other Stat3. Both the ability to translocate into the nucleus and the ability to bind DNA are attributed to this dimerization. Although numerous studies support this model (reviewed in Ref. 11Braunstein J. Brutsaert S. Olson R. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34133-34140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a number of recent studies have provided evidence suggesting that Stat3 exists as a dimer prior to its activation (11Braunstein J.

Furthermore, studies on Dd-STATb, a Dictyostelium Stat protein with a highly aberrant SH2 domain, demonstrated that the activation of Dd-STATb did not rely on orthodox SH2 domain:phosphotyrosine interaction (15Zhukovskaya N.V. Fukuzawa M. Tsujioka M. Jermyn K.A. Kawata T. Abe T. Zvelebil M. Williams J.G. Development. 2004; 131: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that other types of activation mechanisms may exist. Histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 are important transcriptional coactivators capable of regulating many cellular processes. They can interact with a wide range of DNA binding transcription factors, including p53, E2F, AP-1, MyoD, and NF-κB (16Schuringa J. Schepers H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Specifically, CBP/p300 has been reported to interact with Stat proteins and regulate their function (16Schuringa J.

The C-terminal transactivation domain of Stat3 interacts with CBP/p300 and activates transcription of its target genes (16Schuringa J. Schepers H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W.

Here, we report that CBP/p300 can directly acetylate Stat3 protein in its C terminus both in vitro and in vivo. Acetylation of Stat3 increases its DNA binding ability and transactivation activity. Interestingly, cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors display an increase of Stat3 in the nucleus. Our data suggest that acetylation may provide an alternative mechanism for Stat3 activation. Culture Medium and Reagents—HEK293 and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human IL-6, TSA, and nicotinamide were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Stat3 (F-2, C-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-acetylated-lysine antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Detecting Stat3 Acetylation in Cells—In a transiently transfected Stat3 acetylation assay, HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of FLAG-Stat3 plasmid DNA, 10 μg of CMV-p300, or 10 μg of CMV-CBP plasmid DNA. 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed in a FLAG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% sarkosyl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.8) containing fresh protease inhibitors, 10 μm TSA, and 5 mm nicotinamide. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 beads (Sigma). After elution with the FLAG peptide, the proteins were resolved by either 8 or 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blot with anti-acetylated lysine or anti-Stat3 antibodies. For endogenous Stat3 acetylation assay, HepG2 cells were treated with 5 ng/ml IL-6 alone or treated with 1 μm TSA and 5 mm nicotinamide for 6 h before harvest. Cell pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.025% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with mild sonication. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat3 (C-20) antibody and protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer five times and eluted by SDS sample buffer. The samples were further analyzed by Western blot with anti-acetylated lysine or anti-Stat3 (F-2) antibodies. In Vitro Acetylation Assay—GST-Stat3NT, M, CT constructs were a gift from Dr. J. Jung (Harvard Medical School). GST-Stat3CT1, CT2, CT3, CT3–1, CT3–2 constructs were made by inserting the PCR fragments into the pGEX2TL vector. All plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 competent cells. The proteins were induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C overnight, extracted with buffer BC500 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and purified by GST beads (Novagen). Acetylation assays were performed essentially as described (24Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In the standard assay, 20-μl reactions contain 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA (55 mci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), about 2.0 μg of GST fusion proteins, and 100 ng of p300-(1195–1810) were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE gels and autoradiography. Gels containing 14C-labeled proteins were fixed with 10% glacial acetic acid and 40% methanol for 30 min and were enhanced by a fluorography enhancing solution (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Gels were then dried, and autoradiography was performed at -70 °C for 1–3 days. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA was carried out essentially as described (25Luo J. Li M. Tang Y. Laszkowska M. Roeder B. Gu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The probe (24 bp) was generated by annealing the single-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-gatccttctgggaattcctagatc-3′ and its complementary sequence. The probe was 32P end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by Micro-Spin G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA binding reactions (20 μl) contain 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) and proteins as indicated. Reaction mixtures were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min before a 32P-labeled DNA probe was added and then further incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixtures were then resolved on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C followed by autoradiography. Dual Luciferase Assay—HepG2 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method after 24 h with pLucTKS3 (26Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), pRL-TK, and different Stat3 and CBP plasmids as indicated. 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml IL-6 for 1 h and then lysed in 500 μl of passive lysis buffer and subjected to the dual luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's menu (Promega). Experiments were performed in triplicate and at least five independent times. Immunofluorescence Assays—Cells were seeded onto duplicated sterile coverslips in a 6-well tissue culture plate at 20–30% confluence. The next day, cells were treated with the IL-6, TSA, and nicotinamide, as indicated, for 6 h. Immunofluorescence was performed as reported previously (27Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Puskas N. Qin J. Gu W. Cell. 2003; 112: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, rehydrated for 5 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Fisher) for 10 min. Cells were incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma)/phosphate-buffered salt solution for 30 min. Primary anti-Stat3 antibody (1:250 dilution of C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min at room temperature. After washing with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, rhodamine Red-X-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize the nuclei. Coverslips were mounted in Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences), and the slides were examined under an Olympus IX71 microscope. Stat3 Is Acetylated by CBP/p300 in Vivo—To test whether Stat3 could be acetylated by CBP/p300, we first used a transient transfection assay. As indicated in Fig. 1A, a high level of acetylated Stat3 was found in the cells cotransfected with either Stat3 and p300 or Stat3 and CBP (lanes 2 and 3). However, there was no detectable acetylated Stat3 in overexpressed Stat3 alone in the transfected cells (lane 1). We further tested whether the endogenous Stat3 can be acetylated in vivo. HepG2 cells were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous Stat3 protein. In unstimulated HepG2 cells, no obvious acetylated Stat3 was detectable (Fig. 1B, lane 1). After stimulation of HepG2 cells with IL-6, the acetylation of Stat3 can be clearly detected (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–6). Stat3 acetylation can be detected as early as 20 min after stimulation (Fig. 1B, lane 2), indicating that acetylation is an early event in Stat3 signal transmitting upon stimulation. Our previous study on p53 acetylation showed that maximum induction of p53 acetylation requires inhibition of both category I (HDAC1) and category III (Sir2) histone deacetylase activity by treatment with TSA (for HDAC1) and nicotinamide (for Sir2 (28Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar)). Here, we tested the ability of these drugs to increase the endogenous Stat3 acetylation level. As indicated in Fig. 1C, an increased level of acetylated Stat3 was evident when cells were treated with IL-6, TSA, and nicotinamide when compared with acetylation level from IL-6 treatment alone (lane 3 versus lane 2). Thus, these data indicate that Stat3 can be acetylated in vivo after stimulation. Furthermore, inhibition of histone deacetylase activity increases the level of Stat3 acetylation. Mapping Stat3 Acetylation Site—To map the p300-dependent acetylation site of the Stat3 protein, we used an in vitro acetylation assay that has been successfully used to identify the p53 acetylation site (24Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The Stat3 protein consists of an N-terminal domain, a coiled-coil domain, a DNA binding domain, a linker, an SH2 binding domain, and a C-terminal domain (29Chung Y.H. Cho N.H. Garcia M.I. Lee S.H. Feng P. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6489-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We first used GST-Stat3NT-(1–407), GST-Stat3M-(465–585), and GST-Stat3CT-(586–770) fusion proteins (Fig. 2A) with the bacterial purified p300-(1195–1810) containing the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) domain (24Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) and [14C]acetyl-CoA for the in vitro acetylation assay. The GST-Stat3CT has clearly been acetylated (Fig. 2B, lane 3), whereas no detectable acetylation on GST-Stat3NT or GST-Stat3M was found (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). To further narrow down the acetylation region, we divided the Stat3CT into three fragments and made three GST fusion proteins, GST-Stat3CT1-(512–603), GST-Stat3CT2-(596–680), and GST-Stat3CT3-(680–770) (Fig. 2A), followed by the in vitro acetylation assay. Only the GST-Stat3CT3-(680–770) can be acetylated (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Further analysis of the Stat3CT3 sequence revealed that only three lysine residues are in this region at positions 685, 707, and 709. Thus, we further divided this region into two separate GST fusion proteins, GST-Stat3CT3–1-(680–706) and GST-Stat3CT3–2-(706–770). GST-Stat3CT3–1 contains Lys-685, whereas GST-Stat3CT3–2-(706–770) contains Lys-707 and Lys-709 (Fig. 2A). The in vitro acetylation assay was performed on these proteins, and the GST-Stat3CT3–1 was clearly acetylated (Fig. 2B, lane 7), whereas the GST-Stat3CT3–2 has no detectable acetylation (Fig. 2B, lane 8). Because the GST-Stat3CT3–1 only contains one lysine residue at position 685, we conclude that Stat3 protein is acetylated by p300 in a single site at lysine 685 in vitro. To confirm that Stat3 is acetylated by p300 at position Lys-685 in vivo, we made two FLAG-tagged mutant proteins, Stat3K685R and Stat3K685Q. Using these two Stat3 mutants and a wild-type Stat3 expression vector, we performed transient transfection acetylation assay. We detected the acetylation of wild-type Stat3 when cotransfected with p300 (Fig. 2C, lane 2), whereas we only detected weak acetylation on both K-R and K-Q mutants (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 6). Acetylation of these mutants may result from dimerization of these mutants with the wild-type endogenous Stat3. Consequentially, immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged mutant Stat3 co-precipitates the endogenous Stat3 protein. Another possibility is that a weak acetylation site exists in another lysine residue. Nevertheless, we have mapped that the Stat3 major acetylation site by p300 is at the lysine 685. Stat3 Acetylation Augments Its Sequence-specific DNA Binding—To examine the effect of acetylation on site-specific DNA binding, we tested the DNA binding activities of acetylated Stat3 on a 24-bp oligonucleotide probe containing consensus binding site for Stat3 (for the sequence, see “Experimental Procedures”). The unmodified Stat3 can bind to its sequence-specific DNA probe in an EMSA (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4, and 3B), whereas significantly enhanced binding was observed with acetylated Stat3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–7, and 3B). This result indicates that acetylation of Stat3 is capable of enhancing its DNA binding activity. We further examined this DNA binding enhancement by acetylation with the constant amount of Stat3 proteins and the cold competitor oligonucleotide for competition assay. A different amount of cold competitor was preincubated with Stat3 proteins for 30 min before the labeled probe was added to the binding mixture for a 30-min incubation. As expected, the unacetylated Stat3 DNA binding activity was reduced to 58% in 20× cold probe and to 34% in 100× cold probe competition assay (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4, and 3D). In contrast, acetylated Stat3 DNA binding activity was more dramatically reduced in the same assay, with 45% remaining in 20× cold probe and 5% remaining in 100× cold probe assay (Fig. 3C, lanes 5–7, and 3D). These results indicate that acetylated Stat3 protein binds to its target DNA more tightly than the unacetylated Stat3 once the acetylated Stat3 protein binds to cold DNA competitors; it is more difficult for the hot probe to compete the acetylated Stat3 for binding. A previous study on p53 acetylation found that replacing the lysine residue of p300-dependent acetylation sites with glutamine residues (K-Q mutant) strongly enhances the ability of p53 to bind DNA (25Luo J. Li M. Tang Y. Laszkowska M. Roeder B. Gu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The glutamine residue mimics the acetylated lysine residue with the similar structure and the neutralization of the positive charge (30Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50607-50611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We tested whether the K-Q mutant on Stat3 can also enhance its ability to bind DNA. Both FLAG-tagged Stat3K685R (mimics unacetylated Stat3) and FLAG-tagged Stat3K685Q expression vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells, purified on anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody affinity columns, and tested for DNA binding to the Stat3 probe. As expected, comparing with the Stat3K685R (Fig. 3E, lanes 2–4), which mimics the unacetylated Stat3 protein, the Stat3K685Q showed stronger DNA binding ability than the Stat3K685R mutant (Fig. 3E, lanes 5–7, and 3F). This result confirms that acetylation of lysine 685 enhances the DNA binding ability of Stat3 protein. Acetylation of Stat3 Increase Its Transcription Activity—To test the effect of acetylation on Stat3 transcriptional activity, we cotransfected HepG2 cells with the Stat3 and CBP expression vectors, along with a reporter construct pLucTKS3, which contains seven copies of a Stat3-specific binding site (26Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). After IL-6 treatment, CBP strongly enhanced Stat3 transactivation activity (Fig. 4A). This enhancement could be the effects of both Stat3 acetylation and histone acetylation. To further investigate the role of acetylation on Stat3 transactivation, the Stat3 acetylation mutants described above were used in the same reporter assay. The Stat3K685Q mutant that mimics the acetylated Stat3 strongly enhanced its transactivation activity when comparing with the Stat3K685R mutant that mimics the unacetylated Stat3 (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrated that the acetylation on Stat3 indeed can activate its transactivation activity. Acetylation of Stat3 Increases Its Nuclear Localization—To further explore the physiological consequence of Stat3 acetylation, we examined the effect of acetylation on Stat3 cellular localization. The Stat3 protein is predominately located in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells. It can be activated at cytokine receptors by tyrosine phosphorylation and rapidly translocated into the nucleus (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 2Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar, 3Levy D.E. Lee C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were used for immunostaining to examine the effect of acetylation on Stat3 cellular localization. As reported previously (31Bhattacharya S. Schindler C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the Stat3 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells (Fig. 5a). However, after IL-6 stimulation, the Stat3 protein accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 5b). The Stat3 nuclear localization level was also increased when we treated unstimulated cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors TSA and nicotinamide (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, when stimulated cells were treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors, which enhance the Stat3 acetylation level in the cell (Fig. 1C, lane 3), we observed a significant increase of Stat3 in the nucleus (Fig. 5d). We found that 60.5% of cells treated with IL-6 alone showed an accumulation of Stat3 in the nucleus. Moreover, 85.5% of cells treated with both IL-6 and histone deacetylase inhibitors displayed an accumulation of Stat3 in the nucleus (Fig. 5e). These observations suggest that acetylation of Stat3 can increase Stat3 nuclear localization in line with its increased DNA binding activity. CBP/p300 is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates Stat3 activity in vivo (16Schuringa J. Schepers H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8004-8011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. We show here 1) that Stat3 is acetylated by p300 both in vitro and in vivo, 2) that the major Stat3 acetylation site is located at its C-terminal position lysine 685, 3) that acetylation on Stat3 enhances its DNA binding activity and transactivation activity, and 4) that in vivo acetylation of Stat3 protein increases its nuclear localization. These results suggest a possible alternative mechanism for transducing intracellular signals within the Jak-Stat pathway or at least to complement its tyrosine phosphorylation pathway. Previous studies on Stat6 acetylation have shown that IL-4 induces Stat6 acetylation in addition to phosphorylation, and both reactions are required for translational activation of the 15-LOX-1 gene (32Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Conceivably, acetylation on Stat3 plays a critic role after Stat3 is phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus, where the CBP/p300 located. Acetylated Stat3 strongly binds to DNA and may prevent the nuclear export of Stat3 and increase its transcriptional activation. Additionally, acetylated Stat3 may recruit the CBP/p300 acetyltransferase to the promoter of its target DNA, resulting in acetylation of the core histone. This recruitment plus chromatin modification may further activate expression of its target genes. Unlike p53, which has multiple acetylation sites on its C-terminal lysine residues, we found that Stat3 protein is acetylated by CBP/p300 at a major site of lysine 685. This makes Stat3 acetylation difficult to detect both in vitro and in vivo. In fact, the in vitro acetylation assay shows that the Stat3 acetylation level is much weaker than the p53 acetylation level (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 6, and 7 versus lane 9) in the same assay. Nevertheless, it seems that the single lysine acetylation is sufficient for its functional regulation, especially to increase its target DNA binding and transactivation activity. The investigation for more functional consequence on the Stat3 acetylation is underway. Several recent studies have showed that Stat3 forms a dimer without tyrosine phosphorylation (11Braunstein J. Brutsaert S. Olson R. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34133-34140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Novak U. Ji H. Kanagasundaram V. Simpson R. Paradiso L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Haan S. Kortylewski M. Behrmann I. Mueller-Esterl W. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Biochem.

J. 2004; 377: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, the acetylation site lysine 685 located between SH2 domain and transactivation domain (TAD, 2) suggests that it is possible that acetylation may regulate the formation of a Stat3 dimer. Furthermore, Stat3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 705. Both acetylation and phosphorylation may act in synergy to regulate Stat3 activity. In fact, the study on Stat6 acetylation found that inhibition of Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation by genistein reduced Stat6 acetylation levels in A549 cells (32Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Further studies on the regulation of Stat3 activity by acetylation and phosphorylation cross-talk are underway. Careful regulation of Stat3 subcellular distribution makes it ideal for rapidly transducing signals from the receptor to its targets. Stat3 predominately resides in cytoplasm of unstimulated cells; upon stimulation, it quickly translocates into the nucleus and binds to the DNA of target genes, inducing their expression. The nuclear export of Stat3 protein ensures that the signal transmitted by Stat3 is transient. A few hours after stimulation, most of Stat3 protein has been exported into cytoplasm (31Bhattacharya S. Schindler C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This export prepares Stat3 protein for the next round of signal transmitting. The finding of Stat3 protein maintaining a basal level in the nucleus and Stat3 protein shuttles continuously between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in unstimulated cells (31Bhattacharya S. Schindler C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Pranada A.L. Metz S. Herrmann A. Heinrich P.C. Muller-Newen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15114-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5a) indicates the dynamic regulation of Stat3 nuclear import and export. A fungal toxin leptomycin B blocks Stat3 nuclear export and results in the accumulation of Stat3 protein in the nucleus of unstimulated cells (31Bhattacharya S. Schindler C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our data show that treating cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors to increase Stat3 acetylation levels (Fig. 1C, lane 3) results in increased Stat3 protein in the nucleus (Fig. 5, c and d). This suggests that acetylation of Stat3 may block Stat3 export into the cytoplasm. Therefore, the deacetylation of Stat3 is necessary for its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Similar to regulation on Stat3 signal transduction by tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, Stat3 acetylation is also regulated by cellular histone deacetylase and acetyltransferase activities. The acetylation level of Stat3 protein is likely the balance of activity of acetyltransferase CBP/p300 and histone deacetylases. Studies on p53 acetylation found that p53 can be deacetylated by both PID/MTA2/HDAC1 (34Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and mammalian Sir2 (28Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar). Similar to p53, inhibition of these deacetylase activities in cells indeed increased the level of Stat3 acetylation (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Moreover, treating stimulated or unstimulated cells with TSA and nicotinamide showed an increase in the accumulation of Stat3 in the nucleus (Fig. 5, c and d). These data suggest that the balance of Stat3 nuclear import and export in these cells has been disrupted. Conceivably, the basal level of Stat3 proteins in the nucleus has been acetylated when histone deacetylases have been inhibited. This acetylation prevents the export of Stat3 into the cytoplasm and results in an accumulation of acetylated Stat3 in the nucleus. The precise mechanism of acetylation of transcription factors to facilitate DNA binding activity remains unclear. In general, a conformational change occurs in the protein that exposes its DNA binding domain and facilitates binding to its target sequences. Our data show that acetylation on Stat3 increases its DNA binding activity (Fig. 3), transactivational activity (Fig. 4), and nuclear localization (Fig. 5). It is logical to infer that the increase of Stat3 transactivation activity by acetylation could be the result of the tight DNA binding and increased Stat3 nuclear localization. On the other hand, CBP/p300-mediated transcription activation by Stat3 may also involve nucleosomal histone acetylation at the promoter region, and the acetylated Stat3 may be involved in recruiting CBP/p300 to the target promoter for histone acetylation. Our results indicate that acetylation of Stat3 may contribute, at least in part, to activate Stat3 target genes in vivo by increasing its sequence-specific DNA binding activity and its nuclear localization. Although the steady state level of acetylated Stat3 is low in stimulated cells (Fig. 1C, lane 2), we found that Stat3 can be fully acetylated at the CBP/p300 site in stimulated cells when the cellular deacetylase activity is inhibited (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Thus, it is possible that acetylation of Stat3 plays a critical role in initiating and maintaining the binding of Stat3 to its target DNA sequences. In conclusion, acetylation of Stat3 may act through multiple mechanisms to affect DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear export and to synergistically regulate transcriptional activation in vivo.

A Web server HSLPred (www.imtech.res.in/raghava/hslpred/ or bioinformatics.uams.edu/raghava/hslpred/) has been designed to predict subcellular localization of human proteins using the above approaches. The successful completion of a human genome project has yielded huge amount of sequence data. Analysis of this data to extract the biological information can have profound implications on biomedical research. Therefore, mining of biological information or functional annotation of piled up sequence data is a major challenge to the modern scientific community. Determination of functions of all of these proteins using experimental approaches is a difficult and time-consuming task. Traditionally, the similarity search-based tools has been used for functional annotations of proteins (1Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). This approach fails when unknown query protein does not have significant homology to proteins of known functions. The functions of the proteins are closely related to its cellular attributes, such as subcellular localization and its association with the lipid bilayer (subcellular localization) (2Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1994: 1255-1272Google Scholar, 3Lodish H. Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipursky S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 3rd Ed. Scientific American Books, New York1995: 739-777Google Scholar); hence, the related proteins must be localized in the same cellular compartment to cooperate toward a common function (4Nair R. Rost B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 13: 3337-3340Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, information on the localization of proteins with known function may provide insight about its involvement in specific metabolic pathways (5Himmelreich R. Hilbert H. Plagens H. Pirkl E. Li B.C. Herrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4420-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 6Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Proteins. 1991; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 7Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Therefore, an attempt has been made to predict subcellular localization of proteins to elucidate the function.Several methods have been devised earlier to predict the subcellular localization of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins using different approaches and data sets (8Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The most commonly used approach utilizes alignment or similarity search against an experimentally annotated data base. But this approach fails in the absence of significant similarity between the query and target protein sequences (1Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Another popular approach is based on identification of sequence motifs such as signal peptide or nuclear localization signal (9Fujiwara Y. Asogawa M. Genome Inform. Ser. Workshop Genome Inform. 2001; 12: 103-112PubMed Google Scholar). This approach has been limited by the observation that all of the proteins residing in a compartment do not have universal motif. To overcome these limitations, several machine learning technique-based methods, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs), 1The abbreviations used are: SVM, support vector machine; MARS, multivariate adaptive regression splines; RI, reliability index.1The abbreviations used are: SVM, support vector machine; MARS, multivariate adaptive regression splines; RI, reliability index. have been developed to predict the subcellular localization of proteins. These methods are based on the several features of protein sequences such as recognition of N-terminal sorting signals or the composition of amino acids. These methods predict subcellular localization either for prokaryotic or eukaryotic proteins, such as PSORT (10Bannai H. Tamada Y. Maruyama O. Nakai K. Miyana S. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and TargetP (11Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar) for eukaryotes and SubLoc (8Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and NNPSL (1Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with good accuracy (>70%). Recently, our group has also developed a new hybrid approach-based method, ESLPred, which predicts the four major subcellular localizations (nuclear, cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and extracellular) of eukaryotic proteins with an overall accuracy of 88% (12Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, there is no method for the prediction of subcellular localization of human proteins. Availability of sequence data of human genes in recent years demands a reliable and accurate method for prediction of subcellular localization of human proteins.In the present study, a systematic attempt has been made to develop a method for the subcellular localization of human proteins. The SVM modules based on different features of the proteins such as amino acid composition and dipeptide composition of proteins have been constructed. In addition, a similarity search-based module, HuPSI-BLAST, has also been developed, using PSI-BLAST to predict the localization of human proteins. Further, SVM module “hybrid1” has been developed using amino acid composition, traditional dipeptide composition, and results of PSI-BLAST prediction. The SVM modules based on higher order dipeptide compositions (i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4) and combinations of various feature-based modules have also been constructed. Here we have also compared the performance of the present organism-specific method (HSLPred) with ESLPred (12Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a general method for prediction of subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins. In addition, the performance of HSLPred has also been assessed on various mammalian and nonmammalian genomes and on an independent data set. It was observed that this method can predict the subcellular localization of human proteins and proteins from related genomes with high accuracy. In other words, our method can also be used for the prediction of subcellular localization of mammalian proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe Data Set—The data set of human proteins with experimentally annotated subcellular localization has been derived from release 44.1 of the SWISSPROT data base (13Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). Of 10,777 human proteins available in the data base, subcellular localization information was available for 7910 sequences. These 7910 sequences were screened strictly in order to develop a high quality data set for predicting subcellular localization of human proteins. The sequences annotated as “fragments,” “isoforms,” “potential,” “by similarity,” or “probable” were filtered out from the data set. Further, sequences residing in more than one subcellular location (such as a protein sequence labeled with “nuclear and cytoplasmic” or “mitochondrial and cytoplasmic”) were also excluded from the data set. The sequence redundancy of data set was further reduced by using PROSET software (14Brendel V. Math. Comput. Modelling. 1991; 16: 37-43Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) such that no two sequences had >90% sequence identity in the data set. The final data set consists of 3780 protein sequences that belong to 11 subcellular locations as shown in Table I. The number of sequences for the last seven subcellular locations was not sufficient for developing a prediction method. Therefore, a method was developed for only four major subcellular locations of human proteins (840 cytoplasmic, 315 mitochondrial, 858 nuclear, and 1519 plasma membrane).Table INumber of sequences within each subcellular location groupSubcellular locationNumber of sequencesCytoplasm840Mitochondria315Nuclear858Plasma Membrane1519Endoplasmic Reticulum63Extracellular48Peroxisome25Lysosome51Golgi32Centrosome8Microsome21Total3780 Open table in a new tab Support Vector Machines—An excellent machine learning technique support vector machine has been used for the prediction of subcellular localization of human proteins.

The prediction of subcellular localization is a multiclass classification problem. Therefore, N SVMs for N class classification have been constructed. Here, the class number was equal to four for human proteins. The ith SVM was trained with all of the samples in the ith class with positive label and negative label for proteins of remaining subcellular localizations. This kind of SVM is known as one versus rest SVM (1-v-r SVM) (8Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In this way, four SVMs were constructed for the subcellular localization of human proteins. An unknown sample was classified into the class that corresponds to the SVM with highest output score. We have adopted different approaches based on different features of a protein, such as amino acid composition and dipeptide composition, in the fixed length format.Amino Acid Composition—Amino acid composition is the fraction of each amino acid in a protein. This representation completely misses the order of amino acids. The fraction of all 20 natural amino acids was calculated using Equation 1,Fraction of amino acid i=Total number of amino acid iTotal number of amino acids in protein(Eq. 1) where i can be any amino acid.Traditional Dipeptide Composition (i + 1)—Dipeptide composition was used to encapsulate the global information about each protein sequence, which gives a fixed pattern length of 400 (20 × 20). This representation encompassed the information of the amino acid composition along with the local order of amino acids. The fraction of each dipeptide was calculated using Equation 2.Fraction of dep (i+1)=Total number of dep (i+1)Total number of all possible dipeptides(Eq. 2) where dep (i + 1) is one of 400 dipeptides. In addition, to observe the interaction of the ith residue with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th residue in the sequence, higher order dipeptides such as i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4, respectively (Fig. 1), were generated using Equation 3,Fraction of (i+n)dep=Total number of(i+n)depTotal number of all possible dipeptides(Eq. 3) where n = 2, 3, or 4, and dep (i + n) is one of 400 dipeptides.Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines—In this study, we also made an attempt to use a simple and reliable machine learning technique, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), for predicting subcellular localization of human proteins. It has been shown previously that MARS performs as well as other machine learning techniques such as neural networks. In addition, MARS also provides information about the relative importance of different input variables for the classifications or predictions (18Friedman J.H. Ann. Stat. 1991; 19: 1-141Crossref Google Scholar, 19Friedman J.H. Tukey J.W. IEEE Trans. Comput. 1974; 23: 881-890Crossref Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have downloaded the XTAL regression software package that incorporates the Xmars version of MARS for the SUN workstation (available on the World Wide Web at www.ece.umn.edu/groups/ece8591/xtal.html). This version of MARS uses a maximum of 10 predictable input variables. Thus, we have used compositions of amino acid properties for the prediction rather then amino acid and dipeptide compositions.Compositions of Amino Acid Properties—We have used five commonly used properties of amino acids: (i) nonpolar aliphatic amino acids (Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, and Pro), (ii) polar uncharged amino acids (Ser, Thr, Cys, Met, Asn, and Gln), (iii) aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, and Trp), (iv) negatively charged amino acids (Asp and Glu), and (v) positively charged amino acids (Lys, Arg, and His). In order to obtain the composition of a property, we added compositions of its residues (e.g. compositions of negatively charged residues would be compositions of Asp and Glu).HuPSI-BLAST—A module HuPSI-BLAST was designed to predict subcellular localization of human proteins, in which the query sequence was searched against data base of human proteins using PSI-BLAST. The data base consists of 3532 sequences belonging to four major subcellular locations (cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, nuclear, and plasma membrane). The subcellular localization of these proteins has been proven experimentally. The PSI-BLAST was used instead of the normal standard BLAST to search the data base, because it has the capability to detect remote homologies (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar). It carries out an iterative search in which the sequences found in one round of search are used to build a score model for the next round of searching. Three iterations of PSI-BLAST were carried out at a cut-off E value of 0.001. This module could predict any of the four localizations (cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, nuclear, or plasma membrane), depending upon the similarity of the query protein to the proteins present in the data base. The module would return “unknown subcellular localization” if no significant similarity was obtained.Hybrid SVM Modules—Recently, our group has introduced the concept of a hybrid SVM module for the prediction of subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins (12Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, an attempt has been made to elaborate the concept of hybrid modules by designing hybrid modules based on different approaches. The description of the approaches used to develop different hybrid modules is described below.Hybrid1 SVM Module—The hybrid1 SVM module encapsulates the information of amino acid composition, traditional dipeptide composition, and PSI-BLAST output (Fig. 2a). SVM was provided with an input vector of 425 dimensions that consisted of 20 for amino acid composition, 400 for dipeptide composition, and 5 for PSI-BLAST output. The PSI-BLAST output was converted to binary variables using the representation shown in Equation 4.(Cytoplasmic→1 0 0 0 0Mitochondrial→0 1 0 0 0Nuclear→0 0 1 0 0Plasma membrane→ 0 0 0 1 0Unknown→0 0 0 0 1)(Eq. 4) Fig. 2a, the hybrid1 SVM module incorporates the features of a protein (amino acid and traditional dipeptide composition) and output of the HuPSI-BLAST module. b, the hybrid2 SVM module constructed using normal and higher order dipeptide compositions. c, the hybrid3 SVM module developed using a vector of 20 dimensions of amino acid composition, 1600 for traditional and higher order dipeptide compositions, and 5 of HuPSI-BLAST output. d, the SVM cascade consists of two layers of SVM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hybrid2 SVM Module—The hybrid2 SVM module was constructed using all higher order dipeptide compositions (i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4) along with traditional dipeptide composition (i + 1). This hybrid2 module was provided with an input vector of 1600 dimensions, 400 from each dipeptide composition (Fig. 2b).Hybrid3 SVM Module—The hybrid3 SVM module was constructed using amino acid composition, traditional dipeptide composition (i + 1), higher order dipeptide compositions (i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4), and similarity search-based results (Fig. 2c). The module was provided with input vector of 1625 dimensions, comprising 20 for amino acid compositions, 1600 for the above four types of dipeptide compositions, and 5 for PSI-BLAST output.Evaluation of HSLPred—The performance of SVM modules constructed in this report was evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation technique. In this technique, a relevant data set was partitioned randomly into five equal sized sets. The training and testing was carried out five times, each time using one distinct set for testing and the remaining four sets for training. To assess the predictive performance, the accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient were calculated as described by Hua and Sun (8Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), using Equations 5 and 6,Accuracy(x)=p(x)Exp(x)(Eq. 5) MCC(x)= p(x)n(x)−u(x)o(x)(p(x)+u(x))(p(x)+o(x))(n(x)+u(x))(n(x)+o(x))(Eq. 6) where x can be any subcellular location (cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, nuclear, or plasma membrane), Exp(x) is the number of sequences observed in location x, p(x) is the number of correctly predicted sequences of location x, n(x) is the number of correctly predicted sequences not of location x, u(x) is the number of underpredicted sequences, and o(x) is the number of overpredicted sequences.Reliability Index—The reliability index (RI) is a commonly used measure of prediction that provides confidence about the predictions to the users. The RI assignment is a useful indication of the level of certainty in the predictions for the particular sequence. The strategy used for assigning the RI is similar to that used in the past by our group (12Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The RI was assigned according to the difference (Δ) between the highest and second highest SVM output scores. The reliability index for the hybrid1 approach-based module was calculated using Equation 7.RI = {INT(Δ*5/3+1if 0≤Δ < 4,5if Δ ≥ 4.(Eq. 7) In order to validate the performance of HSLPred and to compare with other methods such as ESLPred (12Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), two other data sets were also used. A brief description is as follows.Independent Data Set—Techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping are routinely used for evaluating the performance of any method. Still, the best way of testing the performance of a newly developed method is to test it on an independent data set that contains the patterns used neither during training nor during testing of the method. Independent data were derived from the latest release, 45.2, of the SWISSPROT data base (13Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). This data set contained 164 human proteins (30 cytoplasmic, 11 mitochondrial, 60 nuclear, and 63 plasma membrane) and was not used in the training and testing of the HSLPred method.ESLPred Data Set—To compare the performance of the present method (HSLPred) with ESLPred, another method developed by our group for subcellular localizations of eukaryotic proteins (12Bhasin M. Raghava G.P.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the data set of ESLPred was used. ESLPred was trained on 2427 eukaryotic proteins (1097 nuclear, 684 cytoplasmic, 321 mitochondrial, and 325 extracellular). This data set was further divided into two main sets: (a) mammalian and (b) nonmammalian (eukaryotic proteins other then mammalian) proteins, to assess the performance of HSLPred on these two different systems.In addition, the data sets of other mammalian genomes such as rat, rabbit, bovine, and sheep have also been downloaded from the latest release, 45.2, of the SWISSPROT data base (13Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar), to check the generalizability of HSLPred on other closely related genomes. The data set used is shown in Table S6 of the Supplementary Material.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHuman genome sequencing has produced sequences of more than >40,000 genes. Amazingly, genes are simple, consisting of four types of nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) and get translated into far more complex proteins that are made up of 20 different types of amino acids. The four types of nucleotides in various different orders carry information for making the specific proteins that direct the make up of each human being. Among many other things, proteins control human development and physiology and provide resistance to diseases. In order to perform its appropriate functions, each protein must be translocated to its correct intra- or extracellular compartments. Hence, subcellular localization is a key step characteristic of each functional protein.Since 1991, numerous algorithms have been developed to predict subcellular localization of proteins, based on amino acid compositions (21Chou K.C. Proteins. 1995; 21: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), neural network (1Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), covariant discriminant algorithm (22Chou K.C. Elrod D. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), Markov chains (23Yuan Z. FBBS Lett. 1999; 451: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and support vector machines (8Hua S. Sun Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 24Chou K.C. Cai Y.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45765-45769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Recently, Gardy et al. (25Gardy J.L. Spencer C. Wang K. Ester M. Tusnady G.E. Simon I. Hua S. deFays K. Lambert C. Nakai K. Brinkman F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 13: 3613-3617Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar) have developed a tool, PSORT-B, that combines several methods for the prediction of subcellular localization for Gram-negative bacterial proteins. In general, artificial intelligence-based techniques such as SVM and artificial neural networks are considered as elegant approaches for the prediction of subcellular localization of proteins.The performance of all of the SVM modules developed in this study has been evaluated through a 5-fold cross-validation technique. The SVM training has been carried out by the optimization of various kernel function parameters and the value of the regularization parameter C. The detailed results obtained using various kernel function parameters have been shown in the Supplementary Material, Table S1. It has been observed that the RBF kernel performs better than linear and polynomial kernels in the case of the amino acid composition-based SVM module. Thus, for all of the SVM modules developed in the present study, the RBF kernel has been used.The amino acid composition-based SVM module (kernel = RBF, γ = 300, C = 2, j = 1) has been able to achieve an overall accuracy of 76.6% for all of the four subcellular localizations (Table II). Further, to implement information about frequency as well as the local order of residues, an SVM module based on traditional dipeptide compositions has been constructed. The traditional dipeptide (i + 1) composition-based SVM module has achieved the best results (77.8%) with the RBF kernel (γ = 50, C = 6, j = 1). This accuracy is nearly 1% better than the amino acid composition-based SVM module. The detailed performance of amino acid- and traditional dipeptide composition-based SVM modules in assigning different subcellular localizations has been shown in Table II.Table IIDetailed performance of various SVM modules developed using different features of a protein and PSI-BLASTApproaches usedCytoplasmMitochondriaNuclearPlasma membraneAverageACCaACC, accuracy.MCCbMCC, Matthews correlation coefficient.ACCMCCACCMCCACCMCCACCMCCComposition-based (A)63.50.5246.00.5276.20.6790.30.7876.60.67PSI-BLAST (B)56.940.668.292.073.3Dipeptide-based i + 1 (C)58.30.5248.30.5280.20.7193.40.8077.80.69Hybrid1 (A + B + C)75.40.6769.80.6882.40.7994.80.8984.90.80a ACC, accuracy.b MCC, Matthews correlation coefficient. Open table in a new tab The homology of a protein with other related sequences provides a broad range of information about the protein. Hence, similarity search-based module HuPSI-BLAST has been constructed to encapsulate evolutionary information of the proteins. During 5-fold cross-validation, no significant hits have been obtained for 671 of 3532 proteins. Therefore, the performance of this module is poorer in comparison with amino acid composition- as well as dipeptide composition-based modules. This module has predicted cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, nuclear, and plasma membrane subcellular localizations with 56.9, 40.6, 68.2, and 92% accuracy, respectively, and achieved an overall accuracy of 73.3% (Table II). It proves that compositions (amino acid and dipeptide) can annotate the data more reliably in comparison with the similarity search-based tool.To further, enhance the prediction accuracy, methodologies such as “hybrids” have been devised to encapsulate more comprehensive information of the proteins. The first hybrid SVM-based module, hybrid1, has been constructed using amino acid composition, traditional dipeptide composition, and PSI-BLAST results. The hybrid1 module with the RBF kernel (γ = 50, C = 2, j = 1) has achieved striking overall accuracy of 84.9%, which is significantly better then rest of the modules developed in this study. These results confirm that prediction accuracy of subcellular localization of proteins can be increased using a wide range of information about a protein.In addition, higher order dipeptide (i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4) composition-based SVM modules have been constructed to examine the effect of different positions of amino acids on the subcellular localization. The overall performance of higher order dipeptide compositions in predicting subcellular localization is shown in Fig. 3. The (i + 2) dipeptide composition-based SVM module has achieved an overall accuracy of 79.7%, ∼2% higher in comparison with"
https://openalex.org/W2082152349,"Two transcriptional activators, Aft1 and Aft2, regulate iron homeostasis in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. These factors induce the expression of iron regulon genes in iron-deficient yeast but are inactivated in iron-replete cells. Iron inhibition of Aft1/Aft2 is abrogated in cells defective for Fe-S cluster biogenesis within the mitochondrial matrix (Chen, O. S., Crisp, R. J., Valachovic, M., Bard, M., Winge, D. R., and Kaplan, J. (2004) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 279, 29513–29518). To determine whether iron sensing by Aft1/Aft2 requires the function of the mitochondrial Fe-S export and cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly systems, we evaluated the expression of the iron regulon in cells depleted of glutathione and in cells depleted of Atm1, Nar1, Cfd1, and Nbp35. The iron regulon is induced in cells depleted of Atm1 with Aft1 largely responsible for the induced gene expression. Aft2 is activated at a later time in Atm1-depleted cells. Likewise, the iron regulon is induced in cells depleted of glutathione. In contrast, repression of <i>NAR1</i>, <i>CFD1</i>, or <i>NBP35</i> fails to induce the iron regulon despite strong inhibition of cytosolic/nuclear Fe-S protein assembly. Thus, iron sensing by Aft1/Aft2 is not linked to the maturation of cytosolic/nuclear Fe-S proteins, but the mitochondrial inner membrane transporter Atm1 is important to transport the inhibitory signal. Although Aft1 and Aft2 sense a signal emanating from the Fe-S cluster biogenesis pathway, there is no indication that the proteins are inhibited by direct binding of an Fe-S cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2017592559,"Heparanase is an endo-β-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Heparanase, overexpressed by most cancer cells, facilitates extravasation of blood-borne tumor cells and causes release of growth factors sequestered by HS chains, thus accelerating tumor growth and metastasis. Inhibition of heparanase with HS mimics is a promising target for a novel strategy in cancer therapy. In this study, in vitro inhibition of recombinant heparanase was determined for heparin derivatives differing in degrees of 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation, N-acetylation, and glycol splitting of nonsulfated uronic acid residues. The contemporaneous presence of sulfate groups at O-2 of IdoA and at O-6 of GlcN was found to be non-essential for effective inhibition of heparanase activity provided that one of the two positions retains a high degree of sulfation. N-Desulfation/ N-acetylation involved a marked decrease in the inhibitory activity for degrees of N-acetylation higher than 50%, suggesting that at least one NSO3 group per disaccharide unit is involved in interaction with the enzyme. On the other hand, glycol splitting of preexisting or of both preexisting and chemically generated nonsulfated uronic acids dramatically increased the heparanase-inhibiting activity irrespective of the degree of N-acetylation. Indeed N-acetylated heparins in their glycol-split forms inhibited heparanase as effectively as the corresponding N-sulfated derivatives. Whereas heparin and N-acetylheparins containing unmodified d-glucuronic acid residues inhibited heparanase by acting, at least in part, as substrates, their glycol-split derivatives were no more susceptible to cleavage by heparanase. Glycol-split N-acetylheparins did not release basic fibroblast growth factor from ECM and failed to stimulate its mitogenic activity. The combination of high inhibition of heparanase and low release/potentiation of ECM-bound growth factor indicates that N-acetylated, glycol-split heparins are potential antiangiogenic and antimetastatic agents that are more effective than their counterparts with unmodified backbones.

HS and the structurally related heparin are present in most animal species. They are glycosaminoglycans constituted by repeating disaccharide units of a uronic acid (either d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) or l-iduronic acid (IdoA)) and d-glucosamine (either GlcNAc or d-glucosamine N-sulfate (GlcNSO3)) and bear sulfate substituents in various positions (22.Parish C.R.

Although derived from the common biosynthetic precursor N-acetylheparosan (-GlcA-GlcNAc)n, HS and heparin have different structures: HS is less sulfated and more heterogeneous than heparin. The two glycosaminoglycans also have different locations in tissues: whereas HS is a component of the ECM and of the surface of most cells, heparin is stored in granules of mast cells and co-released with histamine into the circulation upon cellular degranulation mainly in cases of allergic and inflammatory reactions and anaphylactic stress. On the other hand, exogenous heparin is widely used as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic drug and is of increasing interest for novel therapeutical applications (24.Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 25.Lindahl U. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26.Lever R. Page C.P.

As an analog of the natural substrate of heparanase, heparin is commonly considered to be a potent inhibitor of heparanase (20.Vlodavsky I. Mohsen M. Lider O. Svahn C.M. Ekre H.P. Vigoda M. Peretz T.

This activity is attributed, in part, to its high affinity interaction with the enzyme and limited degradation, serving as an alternative substrate. Early reports (20.Vlodavsky I. Mohsen M. Lider O.

J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mode of action, heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) were reported to exert a beneficial effect in cancer patients (33.Altinbas M. Coskun H.S. Er O. Ozkan M. Eser B. Unal A. Cetin M. Soyuer S.A. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 1266-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), stimulating research on the potential use of modified, non-anticoagulant species of heparin and HS in cancer therapy. Screening of heparin derivatives has permitted the identification of some of the structural features of heparin associated with inhibition of the enzyme. As a general trend, the heparanase-inhibiting activity increases with increasing degrees of O-sulfation. However, N-sulfates seems to exert little effect since they can be replaced by N-acyl (N-acetyl, N-succinyl, or N-hexanoyl) groups without substantial loss of inhibitory activity (20.Vlodavsky I.

No significant differences were found between the currently used unfractionated heparins and low molecular weight heparins and a tetradecasaccharidic fragment (34.Ishai-Michaeli R. Svahn C.M.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2080-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 2-O-Desulfated derivatives were shown to retain the inhibitory activity, whereas N-desulfated, N-acetylated derivatives displayed a reduced activity (35.Lapierre F.

In the present study, relationships between structure and heparanase-inhibiting activity of heparin were studied using a larger number of heparins and heparin derivatives, including some with various degrees of 6-O-sulfation of GlcN and 2-O-sulfation of IdoA residues as well as “glycol-split” derivatives obtained by controlled periodate oxidation/borohydride reduction of natural (36.Casu B.

Glycol splitting of C-2–C-3 bonds of nonsulfated uronic acid residues was suggested to interfere with the biological interactions of heparin by providing flexible joints between protein binding sequences (37.Casu B.

However, they prevented activation of FGF-2 and FGF-2-induced angiogenic activity (37.Casu B. Guerrini M. Guglieri S. Naggi A. Perez M. Torri G. Cassinelli G. Ribatti D. Carminati P. Giannini G.

The present study shows that glycol splitting enhances the heparanase-inhibiting activity of heparin. Based on the observation that N-acetyl groups do not prevent and may even assist recognition by heparanase (40.Sandbäck-Pikas D.S. Li J.-p. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2080-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we prepared and tested heparins with various degrees of N-acetylation/N-sulfation together with some of their glycol-split derivatives. N-Acetylated, glycol-split heparins were shown to inhibit heparanase more efficiently than the corresponding non-glycol-split N-acetylated heparins. All chemicals were of reagent grade from Sigma and were used as supplied. Heparins were commercial preparations from pig mucosa (H-1 to H-3 from Laboratori Derivati Organici, Trino Vercellese, Italy, and H-6 from Hepar), from beef mucosa (H-4 and H-5, Laboratori Derivati Organci), and from beef lung (H-7, The Upjohn Co.). The corresponding contents of major sulfate groups, as evaluated by 13C NMR spectroscopy (42.Casu B. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Torri G. De Ambrosi L. Boveri G. Gonella S. Cedro A. Ferro L. Lanzarotti E.

The weight average molecular weights (M̄w, by GPC-HPLC (43.Bertini S. Bisio A. Torri G. Bensi D. Terbojevich M.

Sample desalting was carried out by dialysis against water with 1000-Da cut-off tubes or by fractionation on a 2.5 × 100-cm Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) using 10% ethanol in water as eluent and UV detection at 210 nm. Molecular weight determinations were performed by GPC-HPLC on a Viscotex instrument equipped with a VE1121 pump, Rheodyne valve (100 μl), and triple detector array 302 equipped with IR, viscosimeter, and 90° light-scattering systems. Two 300 × 7.8-mm TSK GMPWXL Viscotek columns were used with 0.1 m NaNO3 as eluent (flow, 0.6 ml/min). Samples were dissolved in the eluent solution at the concentration of 15 mg/ml (43.Bertini S. Bisio A. Torri G. Bensi D. Terbojevich M. Biomacromolecules. 2005; 6: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz for 1H and 125 MHz for 13C with a Bruker AMX spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 1H/X inverse probe. The spectra were obtained at 45 °C from D2O solutions (15 mg/0.5 ml D2O, 99.99% D). Chemical shifts, given in parts per million down field from sodium-3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate, were measured indirectly with reference to acetone in D2O (δ 2.235 for 1H and δ 30.20 for 13C). The 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 300 or 400 MHz with a Bruker AC-300 or AMX-400 spectrometer. Recombinant enzymatically active heparanase was purified from heparanase-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (4.Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Briefly Chinese hamster ovary cells were harvested with trypsin and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was suspended in 20 mm citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.4. The suspension was subjected to four cycles of freeze/thaw (–70/37 °C, 5 min each), the cell extract was centrifuged (18,000 rpm, 15 min, 2–8 °C), and the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The filtrate was applied onto a Source 15 S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The column was washed (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, followed by 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), and heparanase was eluted with a linear gradient (0–35%) of 8 column volumes of 1.5 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Active fractions were pooled and applied onto a Fractogel EMD SO–3 (Merck) column equilibrated with 20 mm citratephosphate buffer, pH 5.4. Heparanase was eluted with a linear gradient (0–22%) of 1 column volume followed by 10 column volumes (22–25%) of 1.5 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Finally heparanase eluted from the Fractogel column was applied onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 1 column volume (0–20%) and 15 column volumes (20–28%) of 1.5 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Eluted fractions were analyzed by gradient SDS-PAGE, stained with Gelcode® (Pierce), and pooled according to their purity. An at least 90% pure, highly active heparanase preparation was obtained, containing the active 50- and 8-kDa heparanase subunits and, to a lower extent, the 65-kDa proheparanase (8.Levy-Adam F. Miao H.Q. Heinrikson R.L. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Active recombinant human heparanase was also produced in insect cells as described previously (7.McKenzie E. Young K. Hircock M. Bennett J. Bhaman M. Felix R. Turner P. Stamps A. McMillan D.

The construct encoding the 8- and 50-kDa heparanase subunits was kindly provided by Dr. E. McKenzie (Oxford GlycoSciences Ltd., Abingdon, Oxon, UK) (7.McKenzie E. Young K. Hircock M. Bennett J.

Procedure A—An extensively 6-O-desulfated heparin also partially (∼15%) 2-O-desulfated (716OdeS-H(A) where the superscript denotes the degree of 6-O-desulfation), M̄w 16,000, was prepared according to Nagasawa et al. (44.Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), starting from the pyridinium salt of heparin H-1, under solvolytic conditions (10 mg/ml in Me2SO:water 9:1) at 100 °C for 2.5 h followed by resulfation of free amino groups with sulfur trioxidetrimethylamine complex in alkaline aqueous medium (45.Lloyd A.G. Emberg G. Fowler L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 637Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Procedure B—6-O-Desulfated-heparins (776OdeS-H(B), M̄w 19,000; 736OdeS-H(B), M̄w 17,700; and 466OdeS-H(B), M̄w 20,400) were prepared according to Matsuo et al. (46.Matsuo M. Takano R. Kamei-Hayashi K. Hara S. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 241: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by O-desulfation through activation with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide or N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl)acetamide without N-desulfation. Heparin H-1 (200 mg) was converted into its pyridinium salt and soaked in pyridine (20 ml). After addition of 4 ml of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, the solution was heated for 4 h at 80 °Cto yield 736OdeS-H or for 8 h at 60 °C to yield 776OdeS-H. Heparin (H-1) was converted into its pyridinium salt and soaked in pyridine (30 ml). After addition of 6 ml of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, the solution was heated for 2 h at 60 °C to yield 466OdeS-H. Procedure A—2-O-Desulfated heparin in the IdoA form (H, IdoA(A), M̄w 17,700) was prepared according to Jaseja et al. (47.Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1456Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Heparin (500 mg) was simply dissolved in 500 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, and the solution was frozen and lyophilized. The residue dissolved in 500 ml of distilled water was dialyzed, and the product was isolated by evaporation under reduced pressure. Its 13C NMR spectrum closely corresponded to the one reported in the literature (48.Piani S. Casu B. Marchi E.G. Torri G. Ungarelli F. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1993; 12: 507-521Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating an essentially complete conversion of the original IdoA2SO3 residues into IdoA residues. Procedure B—2-O-Desulfated heparin in the GalA form (H, GalA(B), M̄w 12,600) was prepared by a modification of methods used by Jaseja et al. (47.Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1456Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and Rej and Perlin (49.Rej R.N. Perlin A.S. Carbohydr.

Chem. 1993; 12: 507-521Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Heparin (500 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of 1 m NaOH and then heated at 85 °C for 1 h. After cooling below 30 °C, the solution was brought to pH 7 with 0.1 m HCl and heated at 70 °C for 48 h to give (after cooling, dialysis, and freeze-drying) the GalA derivative with a typical 13C NMR spectrum (48.Piani S.

https://openalex.org/W2064169979,"The coupling between receptor-mediated Ca2+ store release and the activation of “store-operated” Ca2+ entry channels is an important but so far poorly understood mechanism. The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of channels contains several members that may serve the function of store-operated channels (SOCs). The 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole derivative, BTP2, is a recently described inhibitor of SOC activity in T-lymphocytes. We compared its action on SOC activation in a number of cell types and evaluated its modification of three specific TRP channels, canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3), TRPC5, and TRPV6, to throw light on any link between SOC and TRP channel function. Using HEK293 cells, DT40 B cells, and A7r5 smooth muscle cells, BTP2 blocked store-operated Ca2+ entry within 10 min with an IC50 of 0.1–0.3 μm. Store-operated Ca2+ entry induced by Ca2+ pump blockade or in response to muscarinic or B cell receptor activation was similarly sensitive to BTP2. Using the T3–65 clonal HEK293 cell line stably expressing TRPC3 channels, TRPC3-mediated Sr2+ entry activated by muscarinic receptors was also blocked by BTP2 with an IC50 of <0.3 μm. Importantly, direct activation of TRPC3 channels by diacylglycerol was also blocked by BTP2 (IC50 ∼ 0.3 μm). BTP2 still blocked TRPC3 in medium with N-methyl-d-glucamine-chloride replacing Na+, indicating BTP2 did not block divalent cation entry by depolarization induced by activating monovalent cation entry channels. Whereas whole-cell carbachol-induced TRPC3 current was blocked by 3 μm BTP2, single TRPC3 channel recordings revealed persistent short openings suggesting BTP2 reduces the open probability of the channel rather than its pore properties. TRPC5 channels transiently expressed in HEK293 cells were blocked by BTP2 in the same range as TRPC3. However, function of the highly Ca2+-selective TRPV6 channel, with many channel properties akin to SOCs, was entirely unaffected by BTP2. The results indicate a strong functional link between the operation of expressed TRPC channels and endogenous SOC activity. The coupling between receptor-mediated Ca2+ store release and the activation of “store-operated” Ca2+ entry channels is an important but so far poorly understood mechanism. The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of channels contains several members that may serve the function of store-operated channels (SOCs). The 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole derivative, BTP2, is a recently described inhibitor of SOC activity in T-lymphocytes. We compared its action on SOC activation in a number of cell types and evaluated its modification of three specific TRP channels, canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3), TRPC5, and TRPV6, to throw light on any link between SOC and TRP channel function. Using HEK293 cells, DT40 B cells, and A7r5 smooth muscle cells, BTP2 blocked store-operated Ca2+ entry within 10 min with an IC50 of 0.1–0.3 μm. Store-operated Ca2+ entry induced by Ca2+ pump blockade or in response to muscarinic or B cell receptor activation was similarly sensitive to BTP2. Using the T3–65 clonal HEK293 cell line stably expressing TRPC3 channels, TRPC3-mediated Sr2+ entry activated by muscarinic receptors was also blocked by BTP2 with an IC50 of <0.3 μm. Importantly, direct activation of TRPC3 channels by diacylglycerol was also blocked by BTP2 (IC50 ∼ 0.3 μm). BTP2 still blocked TRPC3 in medium with N-methyl-d-glucamine-chloride replacing Na+, indicating BTP2 did not block divalent cation entry by depolarization induced by activating monovalent cation entry channels. Whereas whole-cell carbachol-induced TRPC3 current was blocked by 3 μm BTP2, single TRPC3 channel recordings revealed persistent short openings suggesting BTP2 reduces the open probability of the channel rather than its pore properties. TRPC5 channels transiently expressed in HEK293 cells were blocked by BTP2 in the same range as TRPC3. However, function of the highly Ca2+-selective TRPV6 channel, with many channel properties akin to SOCs, was entirely unaffected by BTP2. The results indicate a strong functional link between the operation of expressed TRPC channels and endogenous SOC activity. Cytosolic Ca2+ signals control a wide array of cellular functions ranging from short-term responses such as contraction and secretion to longer-term regulation of cell growth and proliferation (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals generated in response to receptors are complex, involving two closely coupled components: rapid, transient release of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SOC, store-operated channel; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; PLC, phospholipase C; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; OAG, oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; BCR, B cell receptor; fura-2/AM, fura-2 acetoxymethylester; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; BTP2 (4-methy-4′-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carboxanilide); CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SOC, store-operated channel; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; PLC, phospholipase C; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; OAG, oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; BCR, B cell receptor; fura-2/AM, fura-2 acetoxymethylester; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; BTP2 (4-methy-4′-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carboxanilide); CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current. followed by slowly developing extracellular Ca2+ entry (1Berridge M.J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Receptors coupled to activation of either PLC-β or PLC-γ generate the two messengers, InsP3 and DAG. InsP3 diffuses rapidly within the cytosol to interact with InsP3 receptors in the ER that serve as Ca2+ channels to release luminal stored Ca2+ and generate the initial Ca2+ signal phase (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). The resulting depletion of Ca2+ stored within the ER lumen serves as the primary trigger for a message that is returned to the plasma membrane resulting in the activation of store-operated channels (SOCs) that mediate capacitative Ca2+ entry (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 3Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The activation of SOCs is relatively slow (10–100 s), and the Ca2+ entry phase of Ca2+ signals serves to mediate longer-term cytosolic Ca2+ elevations and provides a means to replenish intracellular stores (3Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In certain cell types, including hematopoietic cells, SOCs carry a highly Ca2+-selective, non-voltage-dependent, inwardly rectifying current termed the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current, or ICRAC (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The mechanism of coupling of depleted ER Ca2+ stores to activate Ca2+ entry through SOCs remains a crucial but unresolved question. The TRP superfamily of cation channels includes a remarkable spectrum of channels mediating a variety of sensory and receptor-induced signals (5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 6Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). Within this superfamily, members of the TRPC and TRPV channel families have in several cases been shown to mediate Ca2+ entry with coupling properties and/or conductance properties very similar to SOCs (4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). TRPC channels are ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells and are the products of seven genes coding for cation channels activated primarily in response to PLC-coupled receptors (4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

Evidence indicates that many TRPC family members can function as store-operated channels (3Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J.

However, there is also evidence that TRPC channels can function independently of stores (3Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat.

Members of the closely related subgroup of TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 channels (TRPC3/6/7) can each be activated by DAG (4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6915-6922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting DAG is the PLC-derived product mediating their physiological activation. In contrast, the TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 subgroup of channels (TRPC1/4/5), although dependent on receptor-induced PLC activation exactly as TRPC3/6/7 channels, are completely unresponsive to DAG (16Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 18Venkatachalam K. Zheng F. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29031-29040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, how receptor activation of TRPC1/4/5 channels occurs remains a mystery. Members of the TRPV channel family also have properties that have made them attractive SOC candidates. The TRPV6 channel (similar to TRPV5) has channel properties with very high Ca2+ selectivity that suggest a close similarity to the store-operated CRAC channel (19Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Indeed, expressed TRPV6 channels have been observed to be activated in response to store depletion (19Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 20Schindl R. Kahr H. Graz I. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26950-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although other studies suggest otherwise (21Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, despite considerable study, the role of TRP channels in mediating Ca2+ entry in response to Ca2+ store depletion and receptor activation remains uncertain and controversial. Moreover, the coupling process by which emptied ER stores communicate to activate plasma membrane Ca2+ entry channels is unknown. A significant factor contributing to the paucity of information on the nature of store-operated Ca2+ entry has been a lack of channel modifiers to probe the function and coupling mechanisms for these channels. Recently, a report from Ishikawa et al. (22Ishikawa J. Ohga K. Yoshino T. Takezawa R. Ichikawa A. Kubota H. Yamada T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4441-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) identified a 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole derivative (4-methy-4′-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carboxanilide), YM-58483, as a potent inhibitor of store-operated Ca2+ entry in T-lymphocytes. This same compound (now named BTP2) was also shown by Zitt et al. (23Zitt C. Strauss B. Schwarz E.C. Spaeth N. Rast G. Hatzelmann A. Hoth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12427-12437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) to block the highly Ca2+-selective CRAC channel in T-lymphocytes that mediates store-dependent Ca2+ entry in these cells. At the same time, BTP2 appeared selective because it did not affect Ca2+ handling by mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum or other channel activities such as K+ channels or voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (22Ishikawa J. Ohga K. Yoshino T. Takezawa R. Ichikawa A. Kubota H. Yamada T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4441-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Zitt C. Strauss B. Schwarz E.C. Spaeth N. Rast G. Hatzelmann A. Hoth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12427-12437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The highly Ca2+-selective store-operated CRAC channel has been characterized in some detail; however, its operation appears restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is clear that virtually all cell types exhibit store-operated Ca2+ entry (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Hence it was important to assess the actions of BTP2 on Ca2+ entry in cells other than lymphocytes and gauge any relationship between the properties of the narrowly defined CRAC channel and the more broadly operating SOC activity. Moreover, we sought to use BTP2 as a means to determine the relationship between SOC-mediated Ca2+ entry and that mediated by a number of specific TRP channel proteins that have been strongly implicated as SOC candidates. Our studies focused on the TRPC3, TRPC5, and TRPV6 channel proteins. The TRPC3 channel is representative of the closely similar TRPC3/6/7 subgroup, observed to be activated in response to PLC-coupled receptors, diacylglycerol, and store depletion (4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

The TRPC5 channel, a member of the TRPC1/4/5 subgroup, is responsive to both PLC-coupled receptors and is also implicated in mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry (4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The TRPV6 channel is highly Ca2+-selective, closely resembling the pore properties of the CRAC channel and likely other SOCs (4Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

All measurements shown are averages of multiple single cell Ca2+ traces, and the results are representative of a minimum of three, and in most cases a larger number of, independent experiments. In all experiments utilizing BTP2, whenever BTP was included in a preincubation, the same concentration of BTP2 was also included throughout the imaging period. Electrophysiological Channel Measurements—For patch clamp experiments, T3–65 and C-1 cells grown on glass coverslips were transferred to the recording chamber and kept in a standard external solution (145 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 10 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4; free Ca 2+ was adjusted to 6 μm using WEBMAX software). Patch clamp experiments were conducted in the tight seal whole-cell and cell-attached configuration. High resolution current recordings were acquired with a computer-based patch clamp amplifier system (EPC-10; HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes had resistances between 2 and 4 mΩ after filling with the standard pipette solution (145 mm Cs-glutamate, 8 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 0.3 mm GTP, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH to pH 7.2). Free Mg 2+ was adjusted to 1 mm and free Ca 2+ adjusted to 100 nm with MgCl2 and CaCl2 using WEBMAX software. Immediately after establishment of the whole-cell configuration, voltage ramps of 50-ms duration spanning the voltage range of –100 to +100mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of 10 mV between external and internal solutions. Currents were filtered at 2.3 kHz and sampled at 20-μs intervals. Capacitive currents and series resistance were determined and corrected using the automatic capacitance compensation of the EPC-10. For analysis, four ramps were averaged after current inactivation and used for leak subtraction. The low resolution temporal development of inward currents was leak-corrected with an individual ramp current record after current inactivation by measuring the current amplitude at –80 mV. CCh was added to the standard external solution as indicated.

The molecular identification and functional coupling of store-operated channels has been a long-term goal for many laboratories. The mediation of entry of Ca2+ and other cations through SOCs occurs in most cells; thus, elucidation of their identity and function has broad significance (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Anti-MRGBP, anti-TIP49a, anti-TIP49b, anti-YL1, anti-TRCp120, and anti-BAF53a rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.). Anti-p400 antibodies were from Abcam, Inc. Tissue Culture—cDNAs encoding N-terminally FLAG-tagged human MRGBP, YL1, and ZnF/HIT1 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and stably transfected into HeLa S3 cells. Parental and stably transformed HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. For large scale cultures, HeLa cells were grown in spinner culture in Joklik medium with 5% calf serum. N-terminally FLAG-tagged human H2AZ was subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT and introduced into 293/FRT cells using the Invitrogen Flp-in System. Parental and stably transformed 293/FRT cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were adjusted to 0.3 m KCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Ti-45 rotor. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose beads in a ratio of 100 μl of packed beads/6 ml of nuclear extract and gently rocked for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with an ∼50-fold excess of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.25 m KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% (v/v) glycerol and then eluted with 100 μl of the same buffer containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide.

Following centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 rpm in a Ti-45 rotor, the resulting supernatant, which contained ∼200 mg of protein, was applied at 2 packed column volumes/h to a phosphocellulose column (∼10 mg of protein/ml packed column bed volume) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed at the same flow rate with Buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl, and proteins that flowed through the column at 0.1 m KCl were collected. Bound proteins were eluted stepwise at the same flow rate with Buffer A containing 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m KCl. One-fifth column volume fractions were collected, and protein-containing fractions from each salt step were pooled. TSK DEAE 5-PW HPLC of the Phosphocellulose 0.1 m KCl Fraction— The phosphocellulose 0.1 m KCl, flow-through fraction (∼25 mg of protein) was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Using a Beckman System Gold HPLC, the resulting supernatant was applied at 1 ml/min to a TSK DEAE 5-PW HPLC column (7.5 × 75 mm, Toso-Haas) pre-equilibrated in Buffer B (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.05 m KCl. The column was washed at the same flow rate with Buffer B containing 0.05 m KCl and then eluted at 1 ml/min with a 30-ml linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.6 m KCl in Buffer B. 1.0-ml fractions were collected. HAT Assays—Histone acetyltransferase assays were performed essentially as described (15.Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Methods. 2004; 15: 315-321Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.5 μCi of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (3.4 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 3 μg of long oligonucleosomes prepared as described (16.Owen-Hughes T.

Biol. 1999; 119: 319-331PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-FLAG-agarose eluates prepared from either FLAG-MRGBP or FLAG-YL1 expressing HeLa cells were incubated at 30 °C. After 30 min, aliquots of reaction mixtures were subjected to 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29:1 acrylamide:bis). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie R-250 Blue staining, and radioactively labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography using EN3HANCE (NEN Research Products). Mass Spectrometry—Identification of proteins was accomplished using a modification of the multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) procedure described by Washburn et al. (17.Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were resuspended in 30 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m Urea. Proteins were reduced with 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Roche Applied Science), alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma), and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) for at least 6 h at 37 °C. Proteins were then diluted 4-fold in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and digested overnight at 37 °C with modified trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 2mm CaCl2. Peptide mixtures were pressure-loaded onto a three-phase microcapillary column (18.McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Miyamoto D.T. Mitchison T.J. Yates J.R. Int. J. Mass.

This three-phase column was then installed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump. Overflow tubing was used to decrease the flow rate from 0.1 ml/min to ∼200–300 nl/min. Fully automated six-step chromatography runs were carried out. Three different elution buffers were used: Buffer A, Buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), and Buffer C (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). In such sequences of chromatographic events, peptides are sequentially eluted from the SCX resin to the reverse phase resin by increasing salt steps (increase in Buffer C concentration), followed by organic gradients (increase in Buffer B concentration). The last chromatography step consists in a high salt wash with 100% Buffer C followed by the acetonitrile gradient. The application of a 2.5-kV distal voltage electrosprayed the eluting peptides directly into a Deca-XP ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan). Full mass spectrometry spectra were recorded on the peptides over a 400–1,600 m/z range, followed by three tandem mass spectrometry events sequentially generated in a data-dependent manner on the first, second, and third most intense ions selected from the full mass spectrometry spectrum (at 35% collision energy). Mass spectrometer scan functions and HPLC solvent gradients were controlled by the Xcalibur data system (ThermoFinnigan). The software algorithm 2–3 (19.Sadygov R.G. Eng J. Durr E. Saraf A.

SEQUEST (20.Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass.

The validity of peptide/spectrum matches was assessed using the SE-QUEST-defined parameters, cross-correlation score, and normalized difference in cross-correlation scores. Spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a normalized difference in cross-correlation scores of at least 0.08 and minimum cross-correlation score of 1.8 for +1, 2.5 for +2, and 3.5 for +3 spectra. In addition, the peptides had to be at least seven amino acids long. DTASelect (21.Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) was used to select and sort peptide/spectrum matches passing this criteria set. Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST (21.Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar).

Our characterization of the human TRRAP/TIP60 complex led to the identification of the TRCp120, DMAP1, MRG15, MRGX, and MRGBP proteins as new subunits of the complex. In addition, analysis of proteins present in our most highly purified preparations of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex by mass spectrometry identified the YL1 protein as a potential subunit of the complex. The YL1 gene was originally isolated by positional cloning as a gene capable of suppressing the anchorage-independent growth of Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed NIH3T3 cells (6.Horikawa I. Tanaka H.

Notably, the Swc2/Vps72 protein was recently identified as a subunit of the S. cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex, which catalyzes ATP-dependent incorporation of histone variant Htz1 (H2AZ) into nucleosomes (11.Kobor M.S.

To begin to investigate the possibility that the YL1 protein is a bona fide subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex, we generated a HeLa cell line stably expressing YL1 with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag and purified YL1 and its associated proteins by anti-FLAG-agarose affinity chromatography. We then compared the nucleosomal HAT activity of anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-YL1 to that of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex, which had been purified by anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells stably expressing the TRRAP/TIP60 subunit MRGBP with an N-terminal FLAG tag (3.Cai Y. Jin J. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42733-42736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from both FLAG-MRGBP- and FLAG-YL1-expressing HeLa cells possessed HAT activity that specifically acetylated nucleosomal histones H2A and H4, consistent with the possibility that, like MRGBP, YL1 is a subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. Also consistent with this possibility, analysis of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed that anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-YL1 expressing HeLa cells appeared to include a set of proteins similar to those found in preparations of MRGBP-associated proteins; however, some differences in the protein compositions of the two preparations were apparent (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Most notably, complexes purified through FLAG-YL1 contained substantially smaller amounts of three polypeptides of ∼28–38 kDa, corresponding to MRGBP, MRGX, and MRG15, consistent with our observation that these proteins are found both as components of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex and as free heterodimers consisting of MRGBP and MRGX or MRGBP and MRG15, respectively (3.Cai Y. Jin J. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42733-42736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, complexes purified through FLAG-YL1 contained a reduced level of a doublet of ∼120–150 kDa, corresponding to TRCp120 (3.Cai Y. Jin J. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J.

Finally, YL1 also appeared to associate with a number of unique polypeptides. To compare in more detail the polypeptide compositions of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex purified through FLAG-MRGBP and anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-YL1-expressing cells, we took advantage of MudPIT (17.Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar, 23.Wolters D. Washburn M.P. Yates J.R. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). MudPIT is a sensitive method for detecting proteins present in complex mixtures. In MudPIT, a mixture of proteins is first digested into peptides, which are then separated by two-dimensional cation exchange and reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by in-line tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis by MudPIT of proteins present in TRRAP/TIP60 complexes purified by anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography from FLAG-MRGBP-expressing HeLa cells identified the YL1 protein (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table I), as well as all of the previously described subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex (3.Cai Y. Jin J. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42733-42736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4.Doyon Y.

The presence of the YL1 protein in TRRAP/TIP60 complexes purified from FLAG-MRGBP-expressing HeLa cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Importantly, an analysis of proteins present in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-YL1-expressing HeLa cells by MudPIT (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table I) and by Western blotting (Fig. 3) identified as YL1-associated proteins all known subunits of the mammalian TRRAP/TIP60 complex. Together with the results of the HAT assays of Fig. 1A, these results argue that the YL1 protein is a bona fide subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex.Fig. 3Identification of proteins associated with FLAG-MRGBP, FLAG-YL1, FLAG-ZnF/HIT1, and FLAG-H2AZ by Western blotting. Anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography of nuclear extracts from FLAG-MRGBP-, FLAG-YL1-, FLAG-ZnF/HIT1-, and FLAG-H2AZ-expressing cells was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of anti-FLAG-agarose eluates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 4–20% gradient gels, and proteins were identified by Western blotting with antibodies that recognize the proteins indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) YL1 Is also Associated with an SRCAP-containing Complex That Resembles the S. cerevisiae SWR1 Chromatin-remodeling Complex—As expected from the results of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 1B, MudPIT analysis of anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-YL1-expressing HeLa cells identified several proteins not found in the TRRAP/TIP60 complex, raising the possibility that the YL1 protein is present in cells not only as a subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex but also as a component of one or more additional species. Among the additional proteins associated with YL1 were the SNF2-related helicase SRCAP, the actin-related protein ARP6, and a previously uncharacterized protein encoded by an open reading frame described in the NCBI protein data base as ZnF/HIT1 (accession number NP_006340). SRCAP is a member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of ATPases. SRCAP was originally identified by its ability to interact with residues 227–460 of the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase CBP in a yeast two-hybrid screen (8.Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparampil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16370-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SRCAP was found to function as a coactivator for nuclear receptors and to synergize with CBP in this process (9.Monroy M.A. Ruhl D.D. Xu X. Granner D.K. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40721-40726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10.Monroy M.A. Schott N.M. Cox L. Chen J.D. Ruh M. Chrivia J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SRCAP shares significant sequence similarity with the p400 helicase subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex (E-value e–122). As noted by Kobor et al. (11.Kobor M.S. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Meneghini M.D. Gin J.W. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Madhani H.D. Rine J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E131Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), SRCAP and p400 are most closely related to the SNF2-related Swr1 helicase subunit of the S. cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. The SWR1 complex includes potential orthologs of a subset of TRRAP/TIP60 subunits including DMAP1, TIP49a, TIP49b, BAF53a, and GAS41. In addition, the SWR1 complex includes the Swr1 helicase, the potential YL1 ortholog Swc2/Vps72, Arp6, and Swc6/Vps71, which in its C-terminal zinc finger/HIT domain shares a significant sequence similarity with the C terminus of the YL1-associated ZnF/HIT1 protein (E-value 3e–05). Taken together, these findings suggested that the YL1 protein might be a shared subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex and a distinct, SRCAP-containing complex that resembles the S. cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex. To investigate this possibility, we first attempted to fractionate nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-YL1 to resolve the TRRAP/TIP60 complex from other potential YL1-containing species that might be present in these extracts. Nuclear extracts from FLAG-YL1-expressing HeLa cells were applied to a phosphocellulose column at 0.1 m KCl and eluted stepwise with 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m KCl. As shown in Fig. 4A, FLAG-YL1 was detected by Western blotting in the 0.1 m KCl flow-through fraction from phosphocellulose, as well as in fractions that eluted with 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m KCl. In contrast, the TIP60 HAT subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex was detected by Western blotting only in the 0.3 m KCl phosphocellulose fraction. To identify YL1-associated proteins in the phosphocellulose fractions, each fraction was subjected to anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography, and anti-FLAG-agarose eluates were analyzed by MudPIT. In anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from the phosphocellulose 0.3 m KCl fraction, we detected peptides from the same set of proteins found in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from unfractionated nuclear extracts of FLAG-YL1-expressing cells. In contrast, we detected peptides from only a subset of these proteins in anti-FLAG eluates from each of the other fractions, consistent with the possibility that YL1 is a component of multiple species. YL1-associated proteins in the phosphocellulose 0.1 m KCl flow-through fraction included SRCAP, ARP6, DMAP1, Tip49a and b, BAF53a, and GAS41; however, in this fraction we detected only three spectra corresponding to peptides from the p400 subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex and no spectra corresponding to peptides from the TRRAP, TRCp120, EPC and EPC-like, TIP60, ING3, MRG15, MRGX, MRGBP, and FLJ11730/Eaf6 subunits of the complex. The results suggested that the YL1 protein is present in this fraction in a species that is distinct from TRRAP/TIP60 complex and that resembles the recently identified S. cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. To explore this possibility further, the phosphocellulose flow-through fraction was subjected to consecutive TSK DEAE 5-PW HPLC and anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography. Notably, YL1 eluted from the TSK DEAE 5-PW column in a single, discrete peak centered around fraction 8 (Fig. 4B), which was then subjected to anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography. MudPIT analysis of proteins present in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates prepared from fraction 8 identified the SRCAP, YL1, DMAP1, BAF53a, ARP6, TIP49a, TIP49b, GAS41, and ZnFHIT1 proteins (Fig. 4C, column 5 and supplemental Table II), arguing that the YL1 protein is a component not only of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex but also of a multiprotein complex containing the SRCAP protein. The ZnF/HIT1 Protein Is Associated with the SRCAP Complex—Because of its similarity to the Swc6/Vps71 subunit of the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex, we sought to determine whether the ZnF/HIT1 protein is a bona fide subunit of the SRCAP complex. To accomplish this, we generated a HeLa cell line stably expressing the ZnF/HIT1 protein with an N-terminal FLAG tag. Nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-ZnF/HIT1 were subjected to anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography. As shown in the silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 1B (lanes 2–4), anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-ZnF/HIT1-expressing HeLa cells appeared to include a subset of proteins found in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-MRGBP- and FLAG-YL1-expressing cells. An analysis of proteins present in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-ZnF/HIT1-expressing HeLa cells by MudPIT (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table I) and by Western blotting (Fig. 3) identified, in addition to the ZnF/HIT1 protein, the SRCAP, DMAP1, BAF53a, ARP6, TIP49a, TIP49b, GAS41, and YL1 proteins, arguing that ZnF/HIT1 is a subunit of the SRCAP complex. In addition, we note that no unique subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex were detected by MudPIT in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-ZnF/HIT1-expressing HeLa cells, providing further support for the idea that the YL1 protein is present in cell lysates in multiple, chromatographically distinct species, the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex and an SRCAP-containing complex resembling the S. cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. The SRCAP Complex Binds Tightly and Specifically to the Histone H2A Variant H2AZ—As discussed above, our findings argue that human YL1 protein is a subunit of at least two multiprotein complexes, the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex and an SRCAP-containing complex similar in subunit composition to the S. cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. In yeast, the SWR1 complex is capable of binding tightly and specifically to the histone H2A variant Htz1 and of catalyzing its incorporation into nucleosomes. As summarized in Fig. 2, substantial spectra corresponding to peptides derived from H2AZ (or H2A.F/Z), the mammalian ortholog of yeast Htz1, were detected by MudPIT in fractions containing the SRCAP complex. In contrast, no spectra corresponding to peptides derived from H2AZ were detected in fractions lacking the SRCAP complex, such as those fractions purified from FLAG-MRGBP-expressing HeLa cells. These observations suggest that, like the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex, the human SRCAP complex might bind H2AZ. To address this possibility, we generated a human 293 cell line stably expressing human histone variant H2AZ with an N-terminal FLAG tag, and we purified H2AZ-associated proteins by anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography. As shown in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 1B (lanes 4 and 5), anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-H2AZ-expressing 293 cells appeared to include a set of proteins similar to those found in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates containing the SRCAP complex from FLAG-ZnF/HIT1-expressing cells. An analysis of proteins present in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-H2AZ-expressing 293 cells by MudPIT (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table I) and by Western blotting (Fig. 3) identified, the SRCAP, DMAP1, BAF53a, ARP6, TIP49a, TIP49b, GAS41, ZnF/HIT1, and YL1 proteins, arguing that the SRCAP complex binds stably to histone variant H2AZ. In addition, we note that no unique subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex were detected by MudPIT in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-H2AZ-expressing 293 cells. Thus, like the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex, the SRCAP complex appears to bind specifically to histone variant H2AZ. Summary and Perspective—In summary, in this report we present biochemical evidence that the YL1 protein is a subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. In addition, we present evidence that the YL1 protein is also present in cells as a subunit of the previously uncharacterized mammalian SRCAP complex, which bears a striking similarity to the recently described S. cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex and is composed of the SNF2-related SRCAP helicase, ARP6, ZnF/HIT1, and a subset of proteins including YL1, DMAP1, TIP49a, TIP49b, BAF53a, and GAS41, which are also subunits of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. Our results are consistent with the findings of Doyon et al. (4.Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Cote J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), who recently reported that DMAP1 is present in cells as a subunit in one or more additional species that are distinct from the TRRAP/TIP60 complex and include SRCAP and YL1. Finally, we note that, although the mammalian SRCAP complex has a subunit composition quite similar to that of the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex and can bind histone variant H2AZ, we have not yet succeeded in assaying SRCAP complex-dependent incorporation of H2AZ into nucleosomes, in either the presence or absence of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex. Although we observe that crude HeLa cell nuclear extracts catalyze robust incorporation of H2AZ into nucleosomal arrays in vitro (data not shown), we have thus far failed to observe our preparations of the purified SRCAP complex catalyze incorporation of H2AZ into nucleosomes in similar assays. Thus, it is possible that, unlike the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex, the SRCAP complex is not responsible for H2AZ exchange in mammalian cells or, as seems more likely, that the SRCAP complex participates in H2AZ exchange in mammalian cells but requires assistance from additional, as yet unidentified, factors present in crude nuclear extracts.

These proteins have two putative deaminase domains, and it is unclear whether one or both catalyze deamination, unlike their homologs, AID and APOBEC1, which are well characterized single domain deaminases. Here, we show that only the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain of APOBEC3F and -3G governs retroviral hypermutation. A chimeric protein with the N-terminal cytosine deaminase domain from APOBEC3G and the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain from APOBEC3F elicited a dinucleotide hypermutation preference nearly indistinguishable from that of APOBEC3F. This 5′-TC→TT mutational specificity was confirmed in a heterologous Escherichia coli-based mutation assay, in which the 5′-CC→CT dinucleotide hypermutation preference of APOBEC3G also mapped to the C-terminal deaminase domain. An N-terminal APOBEC3G deletion mutant displayed a preference indistinguishable from that of the full-length protein, and replacing the C-terminal deaminase domain of APOBEC3F with AID resulted in an AID-like mutational signature. Together, these data indicate that only the C-terminal domain of APOBEC3F and -3G dictates the retroviral minus strand 5′-TC and 5′-CC dinucleotide hypermutation preferences, respectively, leaving the N-terminal domain to perform other aspects of retroviral restriction.

Despite similar mechanisms of action and high levels of amino acid identity, APOBEC3F and -3G elicit distinct minus strand mutational preferences, 5′-TC and -CC, respectively (5′-GA and -GG on the viral genomic strand). Clear examples of both types of hypermutation occur in patient-derived HIV-1 DNA sequences indicating that these proteins are at least some of the time able to escape Vif-mediated degradation in vivo (4Liddament M.T.

Human APOBEC protein family members have either one or two cytosine/cytidine deaminase domains, each defined by a conserved HXE-X23–28-CPX2–4C motif (8Harris R.S. Liddament M.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 24Conticello S.G. Thomas C.J. Petersen-Mahrt S. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Biol.

Based on the three-dimensional structures of bacterial and yeast cytidine deaminases, the histidine and the cysteine residues are proposed to coordinate a zinc ion, whereas the glutamate promotes the creation of a hydroxide ion critical for deamination. The apoB mRNA editing protein APOBEC1 and the antibody gene deaminase AID are examples of single domain cytosine deaminases, and their activity is abolished by the mutation of the conserved deaminase domain residues (8Harris R.S. Liddament M.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 26Wedekind J.E. Dance G.S. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C.

Sci. 2003; 28: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, APOBEC3F and -3G have two deaminase domains, both of which appear to be essential for retroviral restriction (1Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 3Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44412-44416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it is not presently clear whether one or both of these domains participates directly in the deamination reaction itself. Here, we took advantage of the distinct dinucleotide hypermutation preferences of APOBEC3F and -3G (5′-TC and -CC, respectively) to show that this preference and the associated cytosine deaminase activity track exclusively with the C-terminal deaminase domain. The N-terminal deaminase domain was not required for C→U conversion, and it is likely important for other aspects of this innate retroviral restriction mechanism. Plasmid Constructions—Escherichia coli expression plasmids were derived from pTrc99A (AP BioSciences). The APOBEC3G expression construct was made by amplification of the human APOBEC3G cDNA from pRH204 (30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 431 and 365 (5′-NNG AGC TCA GGT ACC ACC ATG AAG CCT CAC TTC AGA AAC-3′ and 5′-NNN NGT CGA CCC CAT CCT TCA GTT TTC CTG-3′) and digestion of the PCR product with KpnI and SalI followed by ligation into pTrc99A. The human APOBEC3F expression plasmid was described previously (4Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and this insert was flanked by identical restriction sites. The A3F+G and A3G+F chimeras were constructed by restricting the aforementioned plasmids with BsrG1, which cuts each APOBEC cDNA internally (Fig. 1A), and with either KpnI or SalI. Ligation of these plasmid backbones with the corresponding inserts produced A3F(1–162)+A3G(168–384) and A3G(1–167)+A3F(163–373), respectively. The A3F+AID expression plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification of the N-terminal region of APOBEC3F using oligonucleotides 431 and 459 (5′-G TAA AGA AAC TTC CTC CGG TTC ATT GCC TCC ATC GGG-3′) and PCR amplification of AID using oligonucleotides 369 and 245 (5′-NN NNC CAT GGA CAG CCT CTT GAT GAA-3′ and 5′-NNG GAT CCT GCA GTC AAA GTC CCA AAG TAC GAA ATG-3′), gel purification of the resulting products, followed by a second PCR amplification primed by complementary sequences within each product, and finally a third PCR amplification of the full-length chimeric cDNA using the 5′-APOBEC3F oligonucleotide 431 and the 3′-AID oligonucleotide 245. This product was digested with KpnI and BamHI and ligated into pTrc99A. Eukaryotic expression plasmids were derived from pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) by inserting KpnI and SalI-flanked APOBEC cDNAs from the E. coli expression plasmids. Qiagen DNA purification kits were used for small (mini)- and large (maxi)-scale plasmid purifications. Single Cycle Infectivity Assays—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts), penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). HIV-GFP (also called CS-CG (31Miyoshi H. Blomer U. Takahashi M. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8150-8157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was produced by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences)-mediated transfection of 50–70% confluent 293T cells with a plasmid mixture containing 0.22 μg of CS-CG, 0.14 μg of pRK5/Pack1(Gag-Pol), 0.07 μg of pRK5/Rev, 0.07 μg of pMDG (VSV-G Env), and 0.5 μg of an APOBEC expression or empty vector control plasmid as described previously (4Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). After an incubation period of 48 h, virus-containing supernatants were clarified by low speed centrifugation, filtered (0.45 μm), and quantified using a reverse transcriptase activitybased enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cavidi Tech). Reverse transcriptase-normalized supernatants were applied to fresh 293T cells, and infection was allowed to proceed for 96 h. Infectivity (GFP fluorescence) was then measured by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). For experiments requiring the recovery of retroviral DNA for hypermutation analyses, the viral supernatants were treated with 50 units/ml DNase (Sigma) prior to 293T cell infection. Retroviral DNA Sequence Analyses—Genomic DNA was prepared from infected 293T cells using the DNeasy procedure (Qiagen) and incubated with DpnI to remove any non-reverse-transcribed CS-CG plasmid DNA. GPF was amplified using high fidelity PCR reagents (MJ Research) and CS-CG-specific primers 439 and 440 (5′-CG TGT ACG GTG GGA GGT CTA-3′ and 5′-TT GGT AGC TGC TGT GTT GCT-3′). PCR products were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) as described previously (4Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and sequenched using universal primers (University of Minnesota Advanced Genetic Analysis Center). Sequence analyses were done using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corp.). Virion Incorporation Assays—Viruses present in cell supernatants were harvested by filtration (0.45 μm), normalized for reverse transcriptase activity as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cavidi Tech), and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (Beckman SW 41 rotor, 25,000 rpm, 2 h). Pellets were dissolved in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. APOBEC3G was detected with a rabbit anti-APOBEC3G, C terminus-specific antibody (32Newman E.N.C. Holmes R.K. Craig H.M. Klein K.C. Lingappa J.R. Malim M.H. Sheehy A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 166-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) from J. Lingappa (University of Washington). p24Gag was detected using a monoclonal antibody present in 183-H12-5C hybridoma serum. This hybridoma, originally from Drs. B. Chesebro and H. Chen, was obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (catalog no. 3537). E. coli Mutation Assays—Uracil DNA glycosylase-deficient E. coli strain BW310 was transformed with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible APOBEC expression constructs (above) or pTrc99A. Individual colonies were picked and grown to saturation in a rich medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Appropriate dilutions were plated onto a rich medium containing 100 μg/ml rifampicin or ampicillin to select Rif R colonies or measure cell viability, respectively, after an overnight incubation. Mutation frequencies were reported as the number of Rif R colonies per 107 viable cells. rpoB sequences were obtained by colony PCR (oligonucleotides 441 and 442, 5′-TTG GCG AAA TGG CGG AAA ACC-3′ and 5′-C ACC GAC GGA TAC CAC CTG CTG-3′), Exo-SAP (USB) treatment of the PCR product, and direct DNA sequencing (30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). To address whether the conserved N-terminal, C-terminal, or both cytosine deaminase domains of APOBEC3F and -3G are responsible for the observed retroviral dinucleotide hypermutation preferences, chimeric proteins were constructed by recombining the cDNA sequences at a common BsrG1 restriction site (Fig. 1A). The resulting protein fusion junction occurs within a conserved amino acid motif (FVYS), which is predicted to lie in a region linking the two deaminase domains (25Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric proteins were designated A3F+G and A3G+F. Should the strong dinucleotide preference of APOBEC3F or -3G be attributable to a single cytosine deaminase domain, then the dinucleotide preference would be expected to track with that domain in the corresponding chimera. In comparison with HIV-GFP viruses produced in the presence of a control plasmid, retroviruses produced in the presence of APOBEC3F, -3G, or -3G+F expression constructs showed much lower levels of infectivity (Fig. 1B). In agreement with our previous studies (4Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), APOBEC3F was less inhibitory than APOBEC3G, causing a 40- versus 200-fold decrease in infectivity, respectively. The A3G+F chimera decreased retroviral infectivity nearly 10-fold. This effect was smaller than that attributable to equivalent amounts of APOBEC3F or -3G, but this slight decline in chimera efficacy is perhaps not surprising given that these proteins are at least several million years diverged (chimpanzees also express both APOBEC3F and -3G (8Harris R.S. Liddament M.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 24Conticello S.G. Thomas C.J. Petersen-Mahrt S. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 33Zhang J. Webb D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Sawyer S.L. Emerman M. Malik H.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E275Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar)). In contrast to the A3G+F chimera, expression of the reciprocal A3F+G hybrid protein failed to diminish the infectivity of HIV-GFP (Fig. 1B). To address whether this was due to an expression and/or incorporation deficiency, we examined the protein composition of viral particles produced in the presence of A3F+G, APOBEC3G, or a control vector after purification through a 20% sucrose cushion by ultra-centrifugation. Immunoblots of virion-associated proteins using a polyclonal antibody specific to the C terminus of APOBEC3G (32Newman E.N.C. Holmes R.K. Craig H.M. Klein K.C. Lingappa J.R. Malim M.H. Sheehy A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 166-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) showed that the A3F+G chimeric protein was encapsidated nearly as well as APOBEC3G (Fig. 1C). Levels of p24Gag were similar in all virion preparations. Thus, the apparent lack of chimera antiretroviral activity was not attributable to an expression or incorporation deficiency. The intrinsic deamination capacity of this chimeric protein will be addressed below. The functional A3G+F chimera provided a molecular probe with which we could begin to delineate the deaminase domain(s) responsible for the distinct dinucleotide hypermutation preference of APOBEC3F and -3G. DNA was purified from 293T target cells infected with HIV-GFP viruses produced in the presence of APOBEC3F, -3G, -3G+F, or an empty control vector. Virus-specific GFP DNA sequences were amplified by high fidelity PCR, cloned, and sequenced. Like retroviruses exposed to APOBEC3F and -3G, those produced in the presence of the A3G+F chimera showed high levels of G→A hypermutation (Fig. 1D). As expected, the hypermutation frequencies correlated strongly with the observed infectivity declines, with APOBEC3G, -3F, and 3G+F triggering, respectively, 208, 82, and 56 G→A transition mutations per 10 kbp of viral DNA sequenced. The contribution from reverse transcription and PCR error was negligible inasmuch as only one base substitution (G474→A) was observed in more than 10 kbp of viral DNA sequences recovered in parallel from the control infections. The mutated positions attributable to the A3G+F chimera were nearly identical to those of APOBEC3F (Fig. 1D). Prominent examples include G339, G363, G378, G474, G477, G492, and G642 at which over a quarter of the A3G+F and APOBECF hypermutations mapped. Overall, the genomic strand 5′-GA dinucleotide was preferred ∼60% of the time by both A3G+F and APOBEC3F. In contrast, APOBEC3G displayed a strong preference for 5′-GG and rarely triggered mutations at 5′-GA, as observed previously (1Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 2Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Neuberger M.S. Malim M.H.

Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These data are most consistent with the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain of APOBEC3F (and by deduction APOBEC3G) being responsible for the retroviral dinucleotide hypermutation preferences observed. To support these data, the mutational capacities and preferences of the chimeric A3F+G and A3G+F proteins were evaluated in an E. coli-based rifampicin-resistance (Rif R) mutation assay (4Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol.

Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This heterologous system provides a sensitive means to monitor the intrinsic DNA cytosine deaminase activity of the APOBEC proteins without possible complicating effects of other human and viral components. Bacteria expressing APOBEC3F and -3G were shown previously to display elevated Rif R mutation frequencies attributable to deamination within 5′-TC and -CC dinucleotide sequences (5′-GA and -GG on the complementary DNA strand), respectively (4Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Similar effects were observed here with APOBEC3F and -3G expression triggering 3.4- and 7.1-fold increases in the median mutation frequency (Fig. 2A). To our surprise, not only did expression of the A3G+F chimera cause a 3.5-fold increase in the median frequency of RifR, but expression of the corresponding A3F+G chimera triggered an even larger 4.6-fold increase. This stimulation suggested that the latter chimera was indeed capable of DNA cytosine deamination, further permitting a two-way evaluation of the intrinsic mutational preferences of these hybrid proteins. A limited number of C/G→T/A base substitutions within a 0.2-kbp interval of the E. coli RNA polymerase B (rpoB) gene confer Rif R. Mutable cytosines can be found on either DNA stand and within all possible dinucleotide contexts. Independent RifR mutants were therefore purified and subjected to PCR and DNA sequencing to determine the base changes responsible for the drug-resistant phenotype. The main rpoB hotspots preferred by the A3G+F chimera were nearly identical to those preferred by APOBEC3F (C1721 > C1535 > G1546) and were occurring at levels above those found in the control vector containing cells (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1). These sites harbored the majority of all Rif R mutations attributable to these proteins, and for APOBEC3F these data agreed with those from our previous studies (4Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Such a correlation was even more profound for the A3F+G chimera that, like APOBEC3G (30Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), almost exclusively preferred the last cytosine of a 5′-CCCC run (C1691, Fig. 2B). This indicated that the A3F+G chimera was fully capable of DNA cytosine deamination. Together with the fact that the A3F+G chimera also incorporated into retroviral particles (Fig. 1C), these data suggested that a novel step between incorporation and cytosine deamination was disrupted, an intriguing possibility that we have begun to pursue. Moreover, these data strengthened the conclusion that the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain alone dictates (and presumably also catalyzes) the dinucleotide hypermutation preferences of both APOBEC3F and -3G. However, it was still formally possible that the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain of APOBEC3F and -3G somehow guides the N-terminal cytosine deaminase domain to the specific DNA target (i.e. selects the appropriate dinucleotide for deamination by the N-terminal deaminase domain). We therefore employed two approaches to address this possibility and distinguish it from the more likely aforementioned alternative. First, we examined the mutational capacity and specificity of an APOBEC3G mutant lacking most of its N-terminal deaminase domain (A3GΔN(1–67)). This deletion removed the catalytic HXE motif of the N-terminal domain. E. coli expressing this mutant showed levels and distributions of Rif R mutations indistinguishable from those attributable to expression of the full-length protein (predominantly C/G→T/A transitions at C1691; data not shown). This result demonstrated that the N-terminal deaminase domain is not required for catalysis. It is notable that a similar APOBEC3G N-terminal deletion mutant fails to restrict retroviral infectivity (37Li J. Potash M.J. Volsky D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 560-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Second, if the C-terminal deaminase domain alone catalyzes the lesions that result in hypermutations, then the replacement of this domain with that of another bona fide DNA cytosine deaminase should yield a chimera with the dinucleotide specificity of the latter protein. We chose to replace the C-terminal domain of APOBEC3F with AID, a single domain APOBEC protein family member that uses cytosine deamination to trigger antibody gene diversification events in vertebrates (27Honjo T. Muramatsu M. Fagarasan S. Immunity. 2004; 20: 659-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Neuberger M.S. Harris R.S. Di Noia J. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Bacterial expression of the resulting A3F+AID chimera caused a modest 2–3-fold increase in the frequency of Rif R mutants (Fig. 3B). However, an examination of the mutated rpoB genes revealed a striking change in the distribution of the mutations that confer Rif R (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 1). The A3F+AID chimera produced an AID-like mutational specificity (36Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), with the majority of the C/G→T/A transition mutations occurring predominantly at two positions within rpoB, G1586 > C1576. These preferences hardly overlap with those of APOBEC3F or its derivatives (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the mutational specificity of the C-terminal deaminase domain of APOBEC3F can be transformed completely by replacing it with the single domain deaminase AID. The mutation specificities of APOBEC family member chimeras and deletion mutants demonstrate that the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain of APOBEC3F and -3G is exclusively responsible for the retroviral dinucleotide hypermutation preference and for catalysis. Respectively, these proteins prefer to deaminate cytosines within 5′-TC and 5′-CC on the retroviral cDNA strand, alterations that manifest as genomic strand 5′-GA→AA and 5′-GG→AG hypermutations. Such biases are readily visible in model systems and in patient-derived HIV-1 sequences. The delineation of the active cytosine deaminase domain is an important step toward fully understanding the molecular details of this mechanism of retroviral restriction. Previous APOBEC3G site-directed mutation experiments showed that both the N- and the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domains are required for inhibiting the infectivity of HIV-based retroviruses (1Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G. Friedli M. Perrin L. Trono D. Nature. 2003; 424: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 3Zhang H. Yang B. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang C. Arunachalam S.C. Gao L. Nature. 2003; 424: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). These studies used APOBEC3G variants with mutations in the conserved cytosine deaminase domain cysteine and glutamate residues thought to be crucial for zinc-binding and catalysis, respectively. Both studies reported that mutations in either deaminase domain rendered APOBEC3G unable to restrict infection, and it was therefore not possible to define the source of the deaminase activity causing retroviral hypermutation or whether other mechanistic steps were disrupted. In contrast, a third study indicated that the N-terminal glutamate was dispensable, whereas the C-terminal glutamate of APOBEC3G was essential for restricting HIV-1 infection (29Shindo K. Takaori-Kondo A. Kobayashi M. Abudu A. Fukunaga K. Uchiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44412-44416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although this initially appears consistent with our data, both mutants still showed moderate levels of G→A mutation suggesting that either domain can mediate catalysis (29Shindo K. Takaori-Kondo A. Kobayashi M. Abudu A. Fukunaga K. Uchiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44412-44416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This apparent conundrum may be attributable to reverse transcriptase error and/or to the APOBEC3G mutants retaining a low level of deaminase activity. Here, functional APOBEC chimeras and deletion mutants were used to unambiguously show that, for both APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G, the C-terminal cytosine deaminase domain alone governs the catalytic activity and the retroviral hypermutation specificity. The N-terminal deaminase domain is also important for retroviral restriction, but it is likely required for mechanistic steps preceding deamination (e.g. virion incorporation (17Cen S. Guo F. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Deflassieux J. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33177-33184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)). It is probable that during the evolution of this unique innate antiretroviral immune response, two single domain deaminases recombined to yield a dual domain deaminase with a target tropism and mutator activity that eventually were governed by the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively.

Consequently, dominant-negative RhoA and RhoB mutants blocked TGF-β1-induced actin reorganization. Because Rho GTPases are known to regulate the activity of LIM-kinases (LIMK), we found that TGF-β1 induced LIMK2 phosphorylation with similar kinetics to Rho activation. Cofilin and LIMK2 co-precipitated and cofilin became phosphorylated in response to TGF-β1, whereas RNA interference against LIMK2 blocked formation of new stress fibers by TGF-β1. Because the kinase ROCK1 links Rho GTPases to LIMK2, we found that inhibiting ROCK1 activity blocked completely TGF-β1-induced LIMK2/cofilin phosphorylation and downstream stress fiber formation. We then tested whether the canonical TGF-β receptor/Smad pathway mediates regulation of the above effectors and actin reorganization. Adenoviruses expressing constitutively activated TGF-β type I receptor led to robust actin reorganization and Rho activation, whereas the constitutively activated TGF-β type I receptor with mutated Smad docking sites (L45 loop) did not affect either actin organization or Rho activity. In line with this, ectopic expression of the inhibitory Smad7 inhibited TGF-β1-induced Rho activation and cytoskeletal reorganization. Our data define a novel pathway emanating from the TGF-β type I receptor and leading to regulation of actin assembly, via the kinase LIMK2.

Regulation of actin reorganization and contractility allows cells to control their shape, movement, division and secretion, vital processes known to be coordinated by the action of several signal transduction pathways (1Carpenter C.L. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 28: N94-N99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is one of the earliest cellular responses to many extracellular signals. Moreover, modulation of the sensitive and dynamic equilibrium of monomeric globular to filamentous actin has been known to occur during cell transformation (2Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 3Stournaras C. Stiakaki E. Koukouritaki S.B. Theodoropoulos P.A. Kalmanti M. Fostinis Y. Gravanis A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Among the signaling effectors that regulate such processes of actin reorganization, the best understood are small GTPases of the Rho family (4Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Much is currently known about the signaling cascades that link the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors to Rho GTPases and downstream modulation of the actin cytoskeleton (5Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Classically, plasma membrane receptors activate specific guanine exchange factors often via phosphorylation, which leads to subsequent loading of Rho GTPases with GTP (6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Active Rho GTPases continue signal transmission toward Rho coiled-coiled kinase 1 (ROCK1) 1The abbreviations used are: ROCK1, Rho coiled-coiled kinase; ALK, activin receptor-like kinase; caALK-5, constitutively active ALK-5; caALK-5mL45, caALK-5 with inactivating mutations at the L45 loop; F-, filamentous actin; G-, globular actin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LIMK, LIM-kinase; RBD, Rho-binding domain; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; TβRI and TβRII, TGF-β receptor type I and II; siRNA, small interference RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. and/or p21-activated kinase 1 (7Amano M.

LIMK1 and LIMK2 are closely related proteins composed of two N-terminal LIM domains and a C-terminal kinase domain. The LIM domains are protein-binding motifs frequently found in cytosolic proteins that interact with the actin cytoskeleton (14Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Eventually, LIMK1 and LIMK2 phosphorylate actin-depolymerizing proteins such as cofilin and actin-depolymerizing factor, which are inactivated and thus permit actin polymerization to occur (9Amano T. Tanabe K. Eto T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates cell growth and differentiation (17Roberts A.B. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1998; 24: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β induces motility of various cell types, is involved in wound healing processes, and influences epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, events critical for normal embryogenesis but also for tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis (18Dumont N. Arteaga C.L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 531-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Grünert S. Jechlinger M. Beug H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, TGF-β modulates cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton in a variety of cell types (21Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 22Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.-H. Aspenström P. Mol. Biol.

Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β offers a good system to address the mechanistic interrelationships between regulatory pathways of malignant cell proliferation, motility, and the actin cytoskeleton. The basic TGF-β signaling apparatus consists of a plasma membrane complex of type I (TβRI, also known as activin receptor-like kinase 5, ALK-5) and type II (TβRII) receptors and downstream Smad signaling effectors (25Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-activated TβRI phosphorylates and activates the Smad family members Smad2 and Smad3, termed R-Smads. Then R-Smads oligomerize with the unique co-Smad, Smad4, and rapidly translocate to the nucleus where they regulate expression of target genes (25Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar, 26Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway is negatively regulated by multiple signaling inputs. The best understood is a feedback loop that involves Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, which blocks R-Smad phosphorylation by TβRI and directs lysosomal degradation of the receptor thus, ensuring a shut off of the pathway (26Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Despite the current understanding of the Smad pathway, the mechanisms by which TGF-β signals modulate cell shape and the actin cytoskeleton are not yet fully characterized. Furthermore, conflicting reports exist that suggest either that the Smad pathway is critical for such responses (24Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Itoh S. Thorikay M. Kowanetz M. Moustakas A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3193-3206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or that non-Smad signaling effectors such as Rho GTPases, phospholipid 3′-kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase play more important roles in this response (21Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 22Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.-H.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Another interesting twist to the regulation of actin dynamics by TGF-β is the cell-type specificity one observes. Although all previous reports have focused on epithelial cells of either mammary or prostate origin, no evidence yet exists on the signaling pathways that mediate TGF-β effects on actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts. We have previously shown that TGF-β1 suppresses the transformed phenotype and regulates actin reorganization in oncogenic fibroblasts NIH3T3/ras (23Moustakas A. Stournaras C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work we addressed the signaling pathway downstream of TGF-β1 in fibroblasts and identified a novel cascade of effectors that mediate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by this growth factor. Rho GTPases, ROCK1, LIMK2, and cofilin are critical components of the newly identified pathway. Cell Culture, Adenoviruses, Ligands, siRNAs, and Plasmids—Mouse Swiss3T3fibroblasts and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.

Immunofluorescence Analysis and Confocal Microscopy—For immunofluorescence or direct fluorescence of the actin cytoskeleton, cell monolayers were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with TGF-β1; alternatively, cells were first infected with adenoviruses, then starved for 24 h and finally treated with TGF-β1 as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Cells were prepared as previously described (23Moustakas A. Stournaras C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kurisaki K. Kurisaki A. Valcourt U. Terentiev A.A.

Images were acquired with the camera's QED Imaging Inc. software and, using the Adobe Photoshop software, image memory content was reduced and brightness-contrast was adjusted. Confocal microscopy was performed with a confocal laser-scanning module (Leica Lasertechnik), and images were analyzed with the instrument's software. Determination of GTP-loaded Rho Levels—Expression and purification of GST-RBD was performed as described before (38Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For affinity precipitation with GST-RBD, cell monolayers were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with TGF-β1 as indicated in the corresponding legends. Alternatively, cells were transiently infected with LacZ or Smad7 or caALK-5 or caALK-5mL45 adenoviruses 16 h prior to serum starvation and stimulation with TGF-β1. The cells were then washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, supplemented with protease inhibitors). Cleared cell lysates were incubated with 30 μg of GST-RBD attached to glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. GTP-bound Rho was detected by immunoblotting using the appropriate antibody. Protein band intensity was quantified using PC-based image analysis (Image Analysis Inc.).

Cleared lysates were pre-adsorbed to G-protein-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged, and the supernatants (equal amounts of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the rabbit anti-LIMK2 or the rat anti-LIMK1 antibody described above and protein G-Agarose beads. Immunoprecipitated LIMK2 or LIMK1 beads were washed three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2,10mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of the kinase buffer containing 15 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were resolved by 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose, and 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. TGF-β1 Induces Rapid Reorganization of the Actin Cytoskeleton in Swiss3T3 and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—The effect of TGF-β1 on the actin cytoskeleton of Swiss3T3 fibroblasts was analyzed by direct fluorescence microscopy using rhodamine-phalloidin, and cell morphology was monitored by light microscopy. Control cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 15 min up to maximum 24 h (Fig. 1). Starved cells exhibited typical morphology, and their actin cytoskeleton was restricted to cortical actin while the main cell body became devoid of stress fibers. Treatment with TGF-β1 resulted in cell flattening and scattering, which was supported by changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Newly formed stress fibers were prominent in the treated cells, and their abundance and length clearly increased with prolonged TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 1). The actin reorganization was evident as early as 15 min post-TGF-β1 treatment and persisted as long as 24 h, at which point the cell shape change became even more dramatic and cells appeared elongated or spindle shaped with a parallel arrangement of actin bundles. To extend these observations to a different mouse fibroblast model, we repeated the same experiment in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts and essentially observed the same phenotypic response of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 1). The only reproducible difference observed was that the embryonic fibroblasts exhibited a stronger response than the Swiss3T3 cells at the very early (15 min) time point. We also confirmed the microscopic results with biochemical measurements of the intracellular G- and F-actin pools using the DNase I inhibition assay (42Koukouritaki S.B. Theodoropoulos P.A.

Comparison of control Swiss3T3 cells serum-starved for 24 h, with cells treated with TGF-β1 for various time points revealed a clear, reproducible, and gradual decrease in the G/Total actin ratio up to 1.47-fold, corresponding to a clear shift of the dynamic equilibrium toward polymerized actin. 2L. Vardouli, unpublished data. Thus, mouse fibroblasts from different origins respond to TGF-β1 by rearranging their actin cytoskeleton. Both RhoA and RhoB Are Activated by TGF-β1 in Swiss3T3 Fibroblasts—Accumulating evidence places the Rho family of small GTPases playing prominent roles in regulating actin reorganization through various effectors (4Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Because RhoA and RhoB are well characterized Rho GTPases that trigger the formation of stress fibers, we studied whether these proteins can be activated by TGF-β1 in Swiss3T3 cells. For this purpose, we performed affinity precipitation assays using the rhotekin Rho-binding domain fused to GST (GST-RBD) (38Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a 24-h serum deprivation, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for different time points and GST-RBD was used to isolate GTP-loaded RhoA and RhoB from cell lysates. Both proteins were monitored by immunoblotting with anti-RhoA- and anti-RhoB-specific antibodies, and densitometric quantification of the protein band intensities are presented in Fig. 2 after normalization relative to the total RhoA or RhoB content of non-adsorbed cell lysates. In the three independent repeats of this experiment, it became evident that both RhoA and RhoB are activated by TGF-β1 in Swiss3T3 fibroblasts. The data in Fig. 2 (A and C) show representative results from a single experiment for RhoA and RhoB activation, respectively, whereas Fig. 2 (B and D) shows the statistically treated mean values of the corresponding three independent experiments. The amount of GTP-bound RhoA and RhoB increased 5 min after TGF-β1 stimulation, reached maximal level, and decreased to baseline after 3 h (Fig. 2). RhoB, in contrast to RhoA, exhibited a small relative decrease of the GTP-bound levels at 15 and 30 min post-stimulation, a reproducible fact of unknown physiological significance (Fig. 2, C and D). Despite the fact that both activated Rho members were measured using the same RBD-based assay, the data in Fig. 2 present the kinetics of activation of the two endogenous small GTPases, because the antibodies used for detection were highly specific toward each protein, even under conditions of transient overexpression (Fig. 2E). Thus, TGF-β1 can elicit robust and rapid activation of Rho GTPases in Swiss3T3 fibroblasts, which coincides with the onset of actin stress fiber formation in these cells (Fig. 1). RhoA and RhoB Activation Is Necessary for TGF-β1-induced Actin Reorganization in Swiss3T3 Fibroblasts—Having established the activation of RhoA and RhoB by TGF-β1 we investigated the involvement of these small GTPases in the TGF-β1-induced actin reorganization in Swiss3T3 fibroblasts. For this purpose we transiently overexpressed dominant-negative mutants of RhoA or RhoB (36Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2030464812,"Smad proteins are critical intracellular mediators of the transforming growth factor-β, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), and activin signaling. Upon ligand binding, the receptor-associated R-Smads are phosphorylated by the active type I receptor serine/threonine kinases. The phosphorylated R-Smads then form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, translocate into the nucleus, and interact with various transcription factors to regulate the expression of downstream genes. Interaction of Smad proteins with cellular partners in the cytoplasm and nucleus is a critical mechanism by which the activities and expression of the Smad proteins are modulated. Here we report a novel step of regulation of the R-Smad function at the inner nuclear membrane through a physical interaction between the integral inner nuclear membrane protein MAN1 and R-Smads. MAN1, through the RNA recognition motif, associates with R-Smads but not Smad4 at the inner nuclear membrane in a ligand-independent manner. Overexpression of MAN1 results in inhibition of R-Smad phosphorylation, heterodimerization with Smad4 and nuclear translocation, and repression of transcriptional activation of the TGFβ, BMP2, and activin-responsive promoters. This repression of TGFβ, BMP2, and activin signaling is dependent on the MAN1-Smad interaction because a point mutation that disrupts this interaction abolishes the transcriptional repression by MAN1. Thus, MAN1 represents a new class of R-Smad regulators and defines a previously unrecognized regulatory step at the nuclear periphery.

The signals initiated by these cytokines are transduced by their receptors and the downstream Smad proteins (1Shi Y. Massague J.

Upon ligand binding, activin or TGFβ receptor serine/threonine kinase phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor kinase, which then phosphorylates the downstream Smad proteins. The Smad proteins are critical mediators of TGFβ superfamily signaling. Upon phosphorylation by the activated type I receptor kinases, the receptor-associated R-Smads (Smad2 and Smad3 for TGFβ and activin; Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 for BMPs) oligomerize with the common mediator Smad4, translocate into the nucleus where they interact with various transcription factors, bind to DNA, and regulate transcription of downstream genes.The expression and activity of the Smad proteins can be modulated by interaction with various cellular proteins at the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm and nucleus (2Derynck R.

Other post-translational modifications of the Smad proteins such as acetylation or sumoylation have also been demonstrated to occur through direct interactions with acetyltransferases or ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases for sumoylation and can affect their signaling activity (2Derynck R.

Upon receptor activation, activated Smad proteins can also be degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitination-dependent manner through direct association with the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (2Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4199) Google Scholar, 25Izzi L. Attisano L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, identification and characterization of the Smad-interacting molecules hold the key to understanding how the Smad pathway is regulated and how it functions.In this paper we report the identification and characterization of the interaction between an integral inner nuclear membrane protein, MAN1, and the R-Smads. MAN1 was originally identified as an antigen recognized by a self-antibody present in the serum of a patient with collagenosis (36Paulin-Levasseur M. Blake D.L. Julien M. Rouleau L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cloning of MAN1 shows that it is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane with 910 amino acid residues. MAN1 contains an LEM (LAP2, Emerin, and MAN1) domain at the N terminus that is present in several proteins, including LAP2 and emerin, two inner nuclear membrane proteins (37Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and is speculated to mediate protein-protein interactions with the components of the nuclear lamina and chromatin (38Liu J. Lee K.K. Segura-Totten M. Neufeld E. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4598-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis further indicates that MAN1 contains two putative transmembrane domains that may span the inner nuclear membrane twice, resulting in a protein with N- and C-terminal nucleoplasmic domains. The N-terminal nucleoplasmic domain and the first transmembrane domain of MAN1 have been shown to be necessary for the inner nuclear envelope localization of MAN1 (39Wu W. Lin F. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MAN1 contains one RNA recognition motif (RRM) in the C-terminal domain. The function of this RRM is unclear.The function and regulation of MAN1 have not been defined. In Caenorhabditis elegans, Ce-MAN1 interacts with lamin and BAF and may play a role in maintaining nuclear integrity during mitosis and cytokinesis as well as promoting nuclear re-assembly (38Liu J. Lee K.K. Segura-Totten M. Neufeld E. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4598-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 40Lee K.K. Gruenbaum Y. Spann P. Liu J. Wilson K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in Xenopus embryos, MAN1 induces the formation of a secondary neural axis, suggesting that it may antagonize BMP signaling (41Osada S. Ohmori S.Y. Taira M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1783-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Indeed, Xenopus MAN1 was found to interact with Smad1 (41Osada S. Ohmori S.Y. Taira M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1783-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that MAN1 interacts with all R-Smad proteins in mammalian cells and represses TGFβ, activin, and BMP signaling. This interaction reveals a previous unrecognized step in the regulation of Smad activity at the inner nuclear membrane.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, Antisera, and Constructs—The human hepatoma Hep3B cell line was maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. C2C12 cell were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FBS. Antisera against HA and FLAG peptides were purchased from Sigma. An anti-MAN1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a MAN1 N-terminal fragment (residues 1–329). Antibodies for phospho-Smads 1–3 were generous gifts from Dr. Aristidis Moustakas. Antisera against Smad3 (FL-425 and I-20), Smad1 (T-20 and H-465), and Smad4 (B-8) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. MAN1 mutants, constitutively active receptors, and Smad mutants were generated by PCR. An oligonucleotide pair encoding an siRNA specific for human MAN1 (5′-gatccccTGAGTCTAGAGTTCGCACGttcaagagaCGTGCGAACTCTAGACTCAtttttggaaa-3′) was cloned into the pSUPER vector (Oligoengine) and used to reduce endogenous MAN1 expression. Stable Hep3B cell lines expressing the siRNA for MAN1 were generated by co-transfection of Hep3B cells with the pSUPER vector encoding the siRNA duplex together with a vector expressing the puromycin resistance gene. Transfected cells were selected in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS containing 2 μg/ml puromycin.Transfection and Luciferase Assay—293T and Hep3B cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. C2C12 cells were trypsinized and transiently transfected in suspension using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) (42Escobedo J. Koh T.J. BioTechniques. 2003; 35 (940): 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the luciferase assay, a total of 2.5 μg of DNA was transfected into the Hep3B cells. For the TGFβ response, 0.5 μg of p3TP-lux or pLUC800 was co-transfected with or without FLAG-MAN1. For the BMP response, 0.75 μg of 15XGCCG-lux was co-transfected with 0.25 μg of Smad1, 0.25 μg of Smad4, and 0.5 μg of constitutively active Alk3 (Alk3*) in the presence or absence of FLAG-MAN1. For the activin response, 0.75 μg of 3ARE-lux was co-transfected with 0.01 μg of Fast1, 0.25 μg of Smad2, and 0.25 μg of Smad4. Luciferase activity was measured 16 h after stimulation with 50 pm of TGFβ1 or 48 h after the initial transfection.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—FLAG- and/or HA-tagged Smads and MAN1 were isolated from transfected 293T by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and/or anti-HA beads, followed by elution with the FLAG and HA peptide, and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (17Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Endogenous Smads were isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-Smad3 antibody (FL-425) and anti-Smad1 antibody (H-465).Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down—Recombinant fragments of MAN1 were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins. Recombinant Smad2 and Smad2C (residues 264–467) were similarly purified as GST fusion proteins followed by thrombin cleavage. For binding assays, 1.5 μg of GST-MAN1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with 2 μg of purified recombinant Smad proteins for 1 h at 4 °C (14He J. Tegen S.B. Krawitz A.R. Martin G.S. Luo K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30540-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the MAN1-bound Smads were eluted by glutathione and detected by immunoblotting with anti-Smad2 (S-20).Immunofluorescence—C2C12 and Hep3B were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Nuclei were detected by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Cells were visualized by a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. For detergent extraction of the soluble proteins, C2C12 were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 s just before fixation.Northern Blotting—Hep3B cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then stimulated with 200 pm TGFβ1 for the indicated period. Total RNA was prepared from these cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 15–20 μg RNA was resolved on a 1% formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and analyzed by Northern blotting.Growth Inhibition Assay—5 × 104 Hep3B cells were incubated with various concentrations of TGFβ1 for 4 days. Cell growth was determined by cell counting and compared with that in the absence of TGFβ1 (100%).Pulse-Chase Assay—Transfected 293T cells growing in 6-well plates were washed with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking Met and Cys, pulsed with 0.4 mCi/ml 35S-express (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min, and chased for different periods of time as described previously (14He J. Tegen S.B. Krawitz A.R. Martin G.S. Luo K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30540-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of MAN1 as an R-Smad Partner—To identify Smad3-associated cellular proteins, FLAG-tagged Smad3 was introduced stably into the TGFβ-responsive Hep3B and RIE-1 cells. Cellular proteins bound to Smad3 were purified by affinity purification with anti-FLAG-agarose and eluted and analyzed by silver staining (Fig. 1A). Among the proteins that co-precipitated specifically with Smad3, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa was detected in both Hep3B/Smad3 (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and RIE-1/Smad3 cells (data not shown) but not in untransfected or vector control cells (lane 1). By both peptide sequencing and mass spectrophotometry, the protein was identified as MAN1, an 110-kDa integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane (37Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MAN1 interacts with other Smad proteins, HA-MAN1 was co-transfected into the 293T cells together with FLAG-tagged Smad1–5. HA-MAN1 associated with the Smad proteins was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG followed by Western blotting with anti-HA. MAN1 was found to interact with all R-Smads tested, Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5, but not with the Co-Smad Smad4 (Fig. 1B). The interaction is predominantly mediated by the C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 699–910) of MAN1 and the MH2 domains of the R-Smads (Fig. 1, B and C). A weak interaction between the N-terminal fragment of GST-MAN1-N (residues 1–329) and Smads was detected (Fig. 1C), suggesting a possible second lower affinity binding site, at least in vitro. Because of a lower expression of FLAG-Smad2C in this experiment (middle panel, Fig. 1B), the interaction between MAN1 and Smad2C appeared to be weak. However, upon expression and purification from E. coli, recombinant Smad2C associated with MAN1 as efficiently as full-length Smad2 (Fig. 1C), confirming that the interaction is mediated by the MH2 domain of Smad2. In addition, recombinant Smad2 and MAN1 fragments purified from E. coli readily bound to each other in vitro (Fig. 1C), indicating that the interaction is direct.To investigate how the MAN1-R-Smad interaction is regulated by activation of TGFβ, activin, or BMP signaling, a constitutively active type I receptor for TGFβ (Alk5*, T204DAlk5), activin (Alk4*, T206DAlk4), or BMP (Alk3*, Q233DAlk3) was co-transfected with HA-MAN1 and various FLAG-Smad proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, activation of TGFβ, activin, or BMP signaling had no effect on the MAN1-Smad interaction. In addition, both phosphorylated (in the presence of receptor) and unphosphorylated Smad proteins associated with MAN1 (Fig. 1F), indicating that MAN1 does not distinguish between the active and inactive forms of Smad proteins under this overexpression condition. Consistent with this, Smad3 mutants that either lack the C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites (3S-3A) or simulate phosphorylation (3S-3D) bound to MAN1 to a similar extent as WT Smad3 (Fig. 1E).To investigate whether endogenous MAN1 and the R-Smads also interact and whether this interaction is subjected to regulation by the TGFβ family of growth factors, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal part of MAN1 (residues 1–329 or GST-MAN1-N). In several human cell lines, this antibody, but not a pre-immune serum, specifically recognizes a 110-kDa protein that can be competed away effectively with GST-MAN1-N (data not shown). To examine the interaction of endogenous MAN1 and Smad proteins, the BMP2- and TGFβ-responsive C2C12 cells were stimulated with BMP2 or TGFβ1 for 1 h. MAN1 that associated with Smad1 or Smad3 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad1 or anti-Smad3 and detected by Western blotting with anti-MAN1. As shown in Fig. 1F, endogenous MAN1 bound to both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Smad1 and Smad2/Smad3. Most interestingly, the MAN1-Smad1 or MAN1-Smad2/3 interaction was not affected by BMP2 or TGFβ1. Taken together, our results suggest that MAN1 interacts with the R-Smads proteins, and this interaction is independent of TGFβ, activin, or BMP stimulation.MAN1 and Smad3 Interact at the Inner Nuclear Membrane—Because MAN1 is an inner nuclear membrane protein, but the R-Smads are usually cytoplasmic and translocate into the nucleus upon activation, we next examined the intracellular location where the MAN1-R-Smad interaction occurs by indirect immunofluorescence in C2C12 cells. As reported before, endogenous MAN1 is an integral inner nuclear membrane protein and displayed a ring-like localization around the nucleus as visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2, A and B). Whereas Smad1 (Fig. 2A) and Smad3 (Fig. 2B) are predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm in the absence of BMP2 or TGFβ1, respectively, a ring-like perinuclear staining is present. This nuclear membrane staining is more apparent when the cells were extracted briefly with Triton X-100 to get rid of soluble proteins (Fig. 2, A and B, 3rd row of each panel), suggesting that a small population of the R-Smads may associate with the nuclear membrane. Most importantly, this R-Smad staining co-localized with MAN1 staining.Fig. 2MAN1 and R-Smads co-localize at the inner nuclear membrane. The BMP2- or TGFβ1-responsive C2C12 cells were stimulated with or without BMP2 (A) or TGFβ1 (B) for 1 h as indicated. Localization of endogenous MAN1 and Smad1 or Smad3 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence staining using polyclonal antisera specific for these proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain for DNA was used to indicate the position of nuclei. Bottom two rows of each section showed staining of these proteins after the cells were extracted for 30 s with 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to fixation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Upon TGFβ1 or BMP2 stimulation, the R-Smads readily translocate into the nucleus (Fig. 2, A and B). Most interestingly, there is still a detergent non-extractable fraction of the R-Smads that is localized at the nuclear membrane and co-localized with MAN1 (bottom rows, Fig. 2, A and B). The interaction between MAN1 and this insoluble population of R-Smads appeared to be independent of stimulation by TGFβ1 or BMP2. This is consistent with our results from the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data indicate that MAN1 interacts with a detergent non-extractable fraction of the R-Smads at the inner nuclear membrane in a ligand-independent manner.MAN1 Interacts with the Smad Proteins through the RRM Domain—To determine the amino acid residues in MAN1 that are required for binding to the Smads, GST fusion proteins of MAN1 containing either the N-terminal 329 amino acid residues (MAN1-N), the middle region with two putative transmembrane domains (MAN1-L, residues 297–698), or the C-terminal fragment (MAN1-C, residues 699–910) were generated and purified. When incubated with purified recombinant Smad2 or Smad2C, the C-terminal MAN1 fragment showed a strong binding for Smad2 and Smad2C (Fig. 1C), indicating that the major Smad-binding site resides in the C-terminal region of MAN1. Most interestingly, this region contains an RRM motif found in several RNA-binding proteins including a cellular co-factor for the HIV Tat protein, TAT-SF1 (43Zhou Q. Sharp P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). RRM is an evolutionarily conserved domain that mediates RNA-protein or protein-protein interactions. Structural analysis of a putative RRM reveals that most RRMs contain two highly conserved octamers, RNP-2 and RNP-1, that form two β-sheets and are required for the interaction of an RRM with RNA or protein partners (44Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The conserved Tyr and Val residues in RNP-2 or Leu and Ile residues in the RNP-1 are critical for maintaining their structural integrity. To investigate whether the RNPs in MAN1 are required for binding to the Smad proteins and, if so, which of the RNPs is critical, point mutations altering the Tyr and Val in the RNP-2 to Asp (YV-DD mutant) or Leu-Ile in the RNP-1 to Glu and Asp (LI-ED mutant) were introduced into MAN1. A deletion mutant of MAN1-(1–759) lacking the RRM and the subsequent C-terminal residues was also generated and tested. In the co-immunoprecipitation assay, although WT MAN1 bound to Smad1 readily, all three mutants failed to do so (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the RRM domain is required for the interaction of MAN1 with the R-Smads.Fig. 3MAN1 interacts with the Smad proteins through the RRM domain.A, upper panel, domain structure of WT and mutant MAN1. The positions of the LEM domain, two putative transmembrane domains (TM), and the RRM domain with two RNPs are indicated. Lower panel, co-immunoprecipitation assays. FLAG-tagged WT and mutant MAN1 were co-transfected in 293T cells together with HA-tagged Smad1 and isolated by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-HA to detect MAN1-bound Smad1 (top) or with anti-FLAG for MAN1 (middle). IB, immunoblot. Cell lysates were blotted directly with anti-HA for expression of the HA-Smad1 (bottom). B, the MAN1-R-Smad interaction does not require an RNA intermediate. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from 293T cells co-transfected with FLAG-Smad1 and HA-MAN1 were treated with or without RNase A and subjected to Western blotting with anti-HA to detect Smad1-bound MAN1 or with anti-FLAG for Smad1 expression. As a positive control, interaction of stably expressed FLAG-HEXIM1 with the endogenous cyclin T1 in the absence or presence of RNase A was analyzed in parallel (right panel). The HEXIM1-bound cyclinT1 was visualized by Western blotting of the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-cyclinT1. Cell lysates were blotted with anti-cyclinT1 antibody as a control"
https://openalex.org/W2074529937,"In response to hyperthermia, heat shock transcription factor (HSF) activates transcription of a set of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs). The promoter regions of HSP genes contain the HSF binding sequence called the heat shock element (HSE), which consists of contiguous inverted repeats of the sequence 5′-nGAAn-3′ (where n is any nucleotide). We have constructed an hsf1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed genome-wide changes in heat shock response in the mutant cells. The results have revealed that Hsf1 is necessary for heat-induced transcription of not only HSP but also genes encoding proteins involved in diverse cellular processes such as protein degradation, detoxification, energy generation, carbohydrate metabolism, and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Approximately half of the Hsf1-regulated genes lacked the typical HSE in their promoter regions. Instead, several of these genes have a novel Hsf1 binding sequence that contains three direct repeats of nTTCn (or nGAAn) interrupted by 5 bp. The number and spacing of the repeating units are critical determinants for heat-induced transcription as well as for recognition by Hsf1. In the yeast genome, the presence of the sequence is enriched in Hsf1-regulated genes, suggesting that it is generally used as an HSE in the Hsf1 regulon.

All organisms respond to elevated temperatures by changing transcription programs and expressing a set of proteins called heat shock proteins (HSPs), 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock factor; HSE, heat shock element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; ORF, open reading frame; YPD, rich glucose medium; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock factor; HSE, heat shock element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; ORF, open reading frame; YPD, rich glucose medium; WT, wild type. many of which are chaperones involved in protein folding, trafficking, maturation, and degradation (1Feder M.E. Hofmann G.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, heat shock transcription factor (HSF) activates transcription of HSP genes under a variety of chemical and physical stresses as well as heat shock. The target genes of HSF contain a cis-acting sequence designated the heat shock element (HSE). The HSF-HSE interaction is conserved from yeasts to humans (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The HSF proteins have common structural motifs, including a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hydrophobic repeat region essential for formation of a three-stranded coiled-coil, and a C-terminal transactivation domain (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). For binding to the HSE, HSF forms a homotrimer through the coiled-coil domains and the DBD recognizes the sequence 5′-nGAAn-3′. The HSE is composed of at least three contiguous inverted repeats of the nGAAn unit (perfect type, nTTCnnGAAnnTTCn) (5Xiao H. Lis J.T. Science. 1988; 239: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 6Amin J. Ananthan J. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3761-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 7Perisic O.

Cell. 1991; 64: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A variation of the HSE, two consecutive nGAAn units followed by another unit after a gap of 5 bp (gap type, nTTCnnGAAn(5 bp)nGAAn), is tolerated by HSFs (9Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10Santoro N. Johansson N. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6340-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The mammalian HSF isoforms, HSF1 and HSF2, which may respond to distinct stresses and regulate different target genes, exhibit differences in their abilities to bind to variations in the HSE (11Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7592-7603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ahn S.-G. Liu P.C. Klyachko K. Morimoto R.I. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2134-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, the divergence of HSE architecture is believed to provide gene-specific responses to stress.The baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has one HSF encoded by the HSF1 locus (13Wiederrecht G. Seto D. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 54: 841-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 14Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Yeast Hsf1 is indispensable for viability because it binds constitutively to the HSE and maintains basal levels of transcription of genes even at normal growth temperatures (15Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Nature. 1987; 329: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1989; 9: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Heat shock leads to cooperative interactions of Hsf1 with the HSE and to acquisition of higher level transcriptional activity of Hsf1 (19Erkine A.M. Magrogan S.F. Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1627-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Hahn J.-S. Hu Z. Thiele D.J. Iyer V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Various regulatory domains have been identified in Hsf1, including the DBD, coiled-coil trimerization domain, and an N-terminal (AR1/NTA/AAD) and a C-terminal (AR2/CTA/CAD) activation domain (13Wiederrecht G. Seto D. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 54: 841-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Sorger P.K. Nelson H.C.M.

Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsf1 contains yeast-specific domains termed CE2 and CTM; the former negatively regulates the activator function and the latter alleviates the CE2 repression function in response to heat shock (24Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CTM is necessary for heat-induced hyperphosphorylation of Hsf1 and for activation of genes containing the gap-type HSE but not the perfect-type HSE (25Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The AR2, but not the AR1, activation domain is responsible for transcription through the gaptype HSE (9Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10Santoro N. Johansson N. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6340-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CTM-CE2 interaction regulates phosphorylation, which in turn activates the AR2 function of Hsf1 bound to the gap-type HSE.Hsf1 is thought to activate transcription of HSP genes in response to heat shock, but its involvement in regulation of other heat-inducible genes has not been investigated. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation together with a DNA microarray analysis, Hahn et al. (20Hahn J.-S. Hu Z. Thiele D.J. Iyer V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5249-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) have recently shown that putative Hsf1 targets represent nearly 3% (165 genes) of the genome. It is not known, however, whether Hsf1 directly regulates transcription of all these genes in response to heat shock. To gain further insight into the Hsf1 regulon of yeast, we have constructed a new hsf1 mutant that fails to mediate heat-induced transcription of various known target genes. We have used this mutant to perform a genome-wide survey to identify genes whose expression is dependent on normal Hsf1 function. We found that some of the Hsf1-regulated genes contain a novel type of HSE. These results provide important information for understanding the transcriptional network regulated by HSF upon various chemical and physiological stresses as well as heat shock.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Media—Strains were derived from HS126 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 hsf1::HIS3 YCp-URA3-HSF1) or HS134 (HS126 containing SSA4-lacZ reporter gene in the chromosomal leu2 locus) (25Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Strain HS164 was an msn2::LEU2 msn4::ADE2 derivative of HS126. Strain HS170T was a derivative of HS126 containing pK157 (YCp-TRP1-HSF1) instead of YCp-URA3-HSF1. The nTTCn repeat sequence of the FSH1 promoter was changed to the “m1” and “m2” sequences (see Fig. 4A) in the chromosome of HS170T to create HS218 and HS219, respectively. Rich glucose medium (YPD), enriched synthetic glucose medium, and 5-fluoroortic acid-containing medium were prepared as described previously (24Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Sakurai H. Hashikawa N. Imazu H. Fukasawa T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Isolation of Temperature-sensitive hsf1 Mutations—Plasmid pK157 was a TRP1-marked plasmid bearing the wild type HSF1 gene from -729 to +2882 relative to the translation initiation site (24Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To construct a gene library containing mutations in the coding sequence of the Hsf1 N-terminal region, a segment from -729 to +1545 of HSF1 was amplified by PCR under error-prone conditions (25Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mutagenized fragments were digested with BamHI (at +195) and NheI (at +1444) and cloned into BamHI-NheI-digested pK157. The mutant library was used to transform strain HS134 to tryptophan prototrophy. Transformants were replica plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing medium to shuffle out the resident URA3-marked plasmid bearing the wild type HSF1. The plates were incubated at 38 °C to identify plasmids bearing mutant hsf1 genes that confer temperature-sensitive growth. Plasmids recovered from the cells were sequenced. One of these, designated pAY9, contained a substitution of phenylalanine to serine at the 256 position in HSF1 (YCp-TRP1-hsf1-F256S).Plasmids—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the megaprimer PCR method (27Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: e78Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A substitution of valine to alanine at the 203 position (V203A) was introduced into HSF1 (pK157) and hsf1-F256S (pAY9) to create pAY15 and pAY18, respectively. Similarly, plasmids pAY19 and pAY22 contained an R206S substitution in HSF1 and hsf1-F256S, respectively. These plasmids were transformed into HS134, and transformants were streaked on a 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plate to isolate cells expressing mutant Hsf1 proteins.The FSH1-lacZ reporter gene was constructed as follows. The 5′-region of FSH1 from -350 to +45, in which the SalI and BamHI sites were created at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was amplified by PCR from yeast chromosomal DNA. The SalI-BamHI-digested fragment was substituted for the CYC1 promoter region of the CYC1-lacZ reporter (pLG670Z; YEp-URA3-CYC1-lacZ) (28Sakurai H. Hiraoka Y. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8382-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced by the megaprimer PCR method. To construct SSC1/CYC1-lacZ reporters, an oligonucleotide of the TTC repeating sequence of SSC1 (from -285 to -256) or its derivatives was inserted into the XhoI site lying upstream of the CYC1 promoter of pLG670Z.RNA Analysis—Cells were grown in YPD medium at 28 °C to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm, and then the temperature was shifted to 39 °C. Total RNA was prepared from the cells and analyzed by reverse transcription-coupled PCR as described previously (25Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The amounts of PCR products, which represent relative amounts of mRNA, were compared after normalizing RNA samples with the levels of control ACT1 mRNA (encoding actin). The nucleotide sequences of gene-specific primers are available upon request.GeneFilter Hybridization and Data Analysis—Mini-array filter hybridization analysis was carried out as described previously (29Fukasawa T. Fukuma M. Yano K. Sakurai H. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, HSF1 and hsf1-R206S/F256S cells grown in YPD medium at 28 °C were incubated at 39 °C for 15 min. Total RNA was prepared, 10 μg was mixed with 1 μg of oligo(dT), and cDNA was synthesized by Superscript II (Invitrogen) in the presence of [α-33P]dCTP. The mini-array genomic filters (GeneFilters®; Invitrogen) were hybridized with the labeled cDNA in a MicroHyb hybridization solution (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 16 h. The filters were washed, exposed to an imaging plate, and scanned at a resolution of 25 microns on a BAS5000 image analyzer (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of signals was quantified by ArrayGauge, an image analyzing application (FujiFilm).The hybridization of each sample was performed in duplicate. To facilitate comparisons, the raw hybridization intensity of each open reading frame (ORF) on a single array was normalized as follows. First, the local background intensity was subtracted from each ORF, and then each ORF value was normalized to equalize the total intensity of all ORFs on each array. The normalized intensities from duplicate experiments were averaged, and the average -fold changes were calculated.

Open table in a new tab DNase I Footprint Analysis—The N-terminal Hsf1 polypeptide (amino acids 1-583 (N583/WT)) was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (25Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The polypeptide was incubated with 5′-end-labeled DNA in 8 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm potassium acetate, 0.025% Nonidet-P40, 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol. After incubating on ice for 15 min, 2 μl of DNase I solution (0.1-0.2 units of DNase I in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, plus 10 mm CaCl2) was added and incubated for an additional 2 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 22 mm Tris borate, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol) followed by boiling for 3 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel and subjected to phosphorimaging with a Typhoon9200 image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). The probe DNAs were the FSH1 fragment from -350 to +45, the SSC1 fragment from -454 to -79, and the CTH1 fragment from -463 to -52.Gel Retardation Analysis—The reaction mixture, which was the same as above except containing 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were electrophoresed on an agarose gel in 45 mm Tris borate plus 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C and subjected to phosphorimaging. The probe DNA fragments were SSC1wt (see Fig. 4C), 3P (5′-TCGACTTCTAGAAGCTTCCACTAATTAGTGCTACTCGA-3′), and 6P oligonucleotides (5′-TCGACTTCTAGAAGCTTCCAGAAATTTCTGGAACTCGA-3′).Assay of β-Galactosidase Activity—The reporter genes FSH1-lacZ, SSC1/CYC1-lacZ, and their derivatives were introduced into strain HS170T. Transformants were grown in enriched synthetic glucose medium lacking uracil and tryptophan at 28 or at 39 °C for 90 min. The β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (28Sakurai H. Hiraoka Y. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8382-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of Temperature-sensitive hsf1 Mutants—From an hsf1 library, we isolated temperature-sensitive mutants that failed to grow at 38 °C (Fig. 1A). One of these mutant strains contained an amino acid alteration of phenylalanine to serine at the 256 position (F256S) in HSF1. The Phe-256 residue is located in the fourth β-strand of the DBD and is conserved among HSFs from various organisms (30Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C.M.

Biol. 1994; 1: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In cells expressing the Hsf1-F256S protein, accumulation of transcripts from SSA1 and SSA4 (encoding Hsp70) was observed after the temperature upshift, but the kinetics were slightly delayed in comparison with the HSF1 control (Fig. 1B). The mRNA levels of HSP82 increased moderately, and CUP1 (encoding copper metallothionein) mRNA decreased rather than increased after heat shock. Thus, the F256S mutation clearly altered the heat shock response of a subset of genes.Fig. 1Characterization of hsf1 mutant cells. A, cells expressing wild type HSF1 (WT), hsf1-F256S (F256S), hsf1-R206S (R206S), or hsf1-R206S/F256S (R206S/F256S) were streaked on a YPD medium plate and incubated at 28, 33, or 38 °C for 3 days. B, cells were grown in YPD medium at 28 °C, and then the temperature was shifted to 39 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots of cells were removed and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA prepared from each sample was subjected to reverse transcription-coupled-PCR analysis with sets of primers for the heat-inducible genes (SSA1, SSA4, HSP82, and CUP1) and control ACT1 gene (encoding actin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The SSA1 and SSA4 genes contain the perfect-type HSE, whereas HSP82 and CUP1 are the gap-type HSE (10Santoro N. Johansson N. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6340-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Hsf1 containing a substitution of valine to alanine at amino acid 203 (V203A) in the DBD elevates transcription of CUP1 at both normal and higher temperatures (32Silar P. Butler G. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Yang W.M. Gahl W. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3676-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A substitution of arginine to serine at 206 (R206S) causes constitutive activation of both CUP1 and a reporter gene containing the perfect-type HSE (34Sewell A.K. Yokoya F. Yu W. Miyagawa T. Murayama T. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins bind to the CUP1 HSE with higher efficiency than the wild type protein (32Silar P. Butler G. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Yang W.M. Gahl W. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3676-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Sewell A.K.

Although we did not know why the F256S mutation led to the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, we reasoned that it might be possible to restore transcriptional activation by counterbalancing the F256S mutation with the V203A or R206S substitution. We combined F256S with the V203A or R206S substitution, but, unexpectedly, the combinations exacerbated, rather than rescued, the growth defect of hsf1-F256S cells.The HSF1 gene containing both V203A and F256S led to growth failure of yeast at any temperature (data not shown). The cells expressing the Hsf1-R206S/F256S protein were able to grow slowly at 28 °C, but not at 33 °C, a temperature at which hsf1-F256S cells were able to grow (Fig. 1A). Heat-induced accumulation of various mRNAs in hsf1-R206S/F256S cells is shown in Fig. 1B. In agreement with the previous report (34Sewell A.K. Yokoya F. Yu W. Miyagawa T. Murayama T. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the mRNA levels of CUP1 were higher in hsf1-R206S cells than in the HSF1 control. Remarkably, combination of R206S with the F256S mutation abrogated the CUP1 activation. Furthermore, heat shock response of SSA1, SSA4, and HSP82, which was slightly up-regulated in hsf1-R206S cells, was almost completely inhibited in hsf1-R206S/F256S cells. It should be noted that R206S was originally identified as one of two mutations in hsf1-301 cells; the other is a substitution of Phe-256 to tyrosine (F256Y) (34Sewell A.K. Yokoya F. Yu W. Miyagawa T. Murayama T. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to the F256S isolated in this work, the substitution to tyrosine exhibited no significant transcriptional effects. The F256Y mutant attenuated the stimulatory effects of R206S on a reporter gene containing the perfect-type HSE but had no effect on R206S up-regulation of CUP1 expression (34Sewell A.K. Yokoya F. Yu W. Miyagawa T. Murayama T. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The residue Phe-256 anchors the fourth β-strand to the hydrophobic core in the DBD (31Vuister G.W. Kim S.-J. Orosz A. Marquardt J. Wu C. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the substitution to serine, a small hydrophilic residue, may destabilize formation of the fourth β-strand more than the substitution to tyrosine does.Genome-wide Transcriptional Changes in Cells Bearing the hsf1-R206S/F256S Mutation—Various temperature-sensitive hsf1 mutations have been isolated and characterized.

Both transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), the most potent fibrogenic cytokine for HSCs, which classically activates Smad signaling, and p38 MAPK signaling have been shown to influence collagen gene expression; however, the relative contribution and mechanisms that these two signaling pathways have in regulating collagen gene expression have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative roles and mechanisms of both Smad and p38 MAPK signaling in α1(I) collagen gene expression in HSCs. Inhibiting either p38 MAPK or Smad signaling reduced α1(I) collagen mRNA expression in untreated or TGF-β-treated HSCs, and when both signaling pathways were simultaneously inhibited, α1(I) collagen gene expression was essentially blocked. Both signaling pathways were found to independently and additively increase α1(I) collagen gene expression by transcriptional mechanisms. TGF-β treatment increased α1(I) collagen mRNA half-life, mediated by increased stability of α1(I) collagen mRNA through p38 MAPK signaling but not through Smad signaling.

Liver fibrosis represents a wound-healing process in response to a variety of chronic stimuli. Fibrosis is characterized by an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, of which type I collagen predominates. The activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) 1The abbreviations used are: HSC, hepatic stellate cell; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FBS, fetal bovine serum; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; SMA, smooth muscle α-actin; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase. is the predominant cell type in the liver responsible for the increased synthesis and deposition of type I collagen during liver fibrosis. The HSCs normally reside in the liver in a quiescent state; however, following a fibrogenic stimulus, HSCs undergo a complex activation process in which the cell changes from a quiescent vitamin A-storing cell to an activated myofibroblast-like cell, which proliferates and becomes fibrogenic (1Friedman S.L.

An increase in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation occurs with HSC activation. Altered collagen synthesis, at both mRNA and protein levels, is observed with a dramatic increase in type I collagen along with smaller but significant increases in type III collagen (3Maher J.J.

Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). TGF-β binds to the constitutively active type II receptor, which then recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor. Smad2 and Smad3 are recruited to the activated type I receptor where Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated (8Piek E. Westermark U. Kastemar M. Heldin C.H. van Zoelen E.J. Nister M. ten Dijke P. Int. J.

These then form a heterooligomeric complex with Smad4, and the complex translocates into the nucleus and regulates transcription of target genes. Smad7, an inhibitor of Smad signaling, associates with the activated type I receptor and interferes with Smad2 and Smad3 interaction with the receptor effectively inhibiting Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation and subsequent downstream signaling events (10Nakao A.

In addition, gene transfer of Smad7 into unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced renal fibrosis in rats significantly prevented the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (14Terada Y.

Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-1, and p38 MAPK represent central kinases that typically transduce signals generated by growth factors and stress (16Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). TGF-β also can induce the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway mediated by the upstream TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family (17Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K.

MKK3 and MKK6, known as the MAPK kinases, are thought to be activators of p38 MAPK, but the expression and the roles of MKK3 and MKK6 differ in cell types. For example, MKK3 is required for p38 MAPK activation in murine embryonic fibroblasts (19Wysk M. Yang D.D. Lu H.T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3763-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas MKK6 is an important activator of p38 MAPK in cells exposed to osmotic stress (20Moriguchi T. Toyoshima T. Gotoh Y.

In HSCs isolated from Smad3 knock-out mice α1(I) collagen, mRNA levels were reduced ∼30% than in HSCs from wild-type mice (23Schnabl B. Kweon Y.O. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). HSCs transduced with Ad5Smad7 also showed reduced α1(I) collagen mRNA expression in activated, TGF-β-untreated, HSCs (15Dooley S. Hamzavi J. Breitkopf K. Wiercinska E. Said H.M.

Therefore, although both Smad and p38 MAPK signaling pathways have been shown to influence collagen gene expression, the relative contribution and mechanisms these two signaling pathways have in regulating collagen gene expression are unknown. Furthermore, the role of both MKK3 and MKK6 in the HSC remain to be elucidated. We undertook the present study to assess the role of Smad and p38 MAPK signaling on α1(I) collagen gene expression in primary rat HSCs. We found that inhibition of either p38 MAPK or Smad signaling pathways decreased culture-induced and TGF-β-stimulated expression of the α1(I) collagen mRNA steady state levels to similar degrees. However, when both signaling pathways were inhibited, α1(I) collagen expression was essentially blocked. In addition, both MKK3 and MKK6 were shown to activate p38 MAPK, which is coupled with enhanced collagen gene expression in HSCs. By using HSCs isolated from transgenic pCol9GFP-HS4,5 mice blocking either p38 MAPK or Smad, signaling pathways inhibited GFP expression to similar degrees, indicating that both p38 MAPK and Smad signaling increased transcriptional activity of the α1(I) collagen gene. Post-transcriptional regulation was found to be mediated by p38 MAPK signaling, but not Smad signaling, where p38 MAPK signaling increased the stability of α1(I) collagen mRNA in untreated activated HSCs. Moreover, TGF-β treatment increased α1(I) collagen mRNA stabilization that was mediated by p38 MAPK signaling and not by Smad signaling. Together, our results show that expression of the α1(I) collagen gene in HSCs is independently and positively regulated by both p38 MAPK and Smad signaling in both untreated and TGF-β-treated HSCs by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.

Hepatology. 2003; 37: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). HSC purity, assessed by the autofluorescence of the cells by ultraviolet-excited fluorescence microscopy, was typically between 90 and 95%. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mml-glutamine and cultured in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Growth medium was changed every other day. HSCs were treated with 5 ng/ml recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 1–10 μm SB203580, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (Calbiochem), 1–10 μm PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MEK (Calbiochem), 1–10 μm SB431542, a potent inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor (Tocris, Ellisville, MO), or 5 ng/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) following a 24-h serum-free period. All animal procedures were performed under the guidelines set by the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are in accordance with those set by the National Institutes of Health. Adenovirus Transduction of HSCs—Ad5LacZ, which contains the β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used as a control virus throughout this study. The Ad5Smad7 virus expresses a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human Smad7 protein. The human Smad7 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Wrana (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) and cloned into the pGI-AdCMV5 transfer vector (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). FLAG-tagged adenovirus dominant negative form of MKK3 (Ad5dnMKK3) and MKK6 (Ad5dnMKK6) were obtained from Dr. Brydon Bennett (Celgene, San Diego, CA). Viral amplification was performed in 293 cells and cesium chloride purified by standard methodology. Viral titer estimates were performed by optical density measurements. For single adenovirus transductions, HSCs were transduced with Ad5Smad7, Ad5dnMKK3, Ad5dnMKK6, or Ad5LacZ at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 250 2 days after isolation (day 2) for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% FBS. When transducing cells with both Ad5dnMKK3 and Ad5dnMKK6, the cells were simultaneously treated using an m.o.i. of 150 for each adenovirus. After 16 h, the transduction medium was changed to fresh growth medium containing 10% FBS. Western Blot Analysis—Cultured HSCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed with protein sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were stained with 0.5% Ponceau S to ensure equal protein loading and transfer. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% milk in TBS-T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 144 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Afterward, membranes were incubated with the following antibodies, each diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk in TBS-T: primary anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-phospho-JNK, or anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) incubated for 16 h at 4 °C followed by the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), incubated for 1 h at room temperature; primary anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-JNK1 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubated for 1 h at room temperature; primary anti-actin antibody (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubated for 1 h at room temperature; primary anti-human smooth muscle actin antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) incubated for 1 h at room temperature; primary anti-α-tubulin antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA), incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed four times with TBS-T at room temperature for 15 min each time after incubation with the primary and secondary antibody, respectively. Immunodetected proteins were visualized using ECL assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA was isolated from rat HSCs cultured for 3 and 10 days, and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (24Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were prepared for rat α1(I) collagen (26Rivera C.A. Bradford B.U. Hunt K.J. Adachi Y. Schrum L.W. Koop D.R. Burchardt E.R. Rippe R.A. Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G200-G207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pTRI-GAPDH-Rat, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and mixed with 5 μg of total HSC RNA. Protected fragments were analyzed on standard 6% sequencing gels. Following electrophoresis, bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). GFP Expression—To analyze GFP transgene expression in HSCs, HSCs were isolated from GFP transgenic mice and cultured. GFP fluorescence was assessed and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences) daily. Statistical Analysis—The results were analyzed for statistical significance according to the Student's t test. Statistical values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Data are presented as means ± S.D. TGF-β Treatment Leads to Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK but Not JNK—To evaluate the effect of TGF-β on activating MAPK signaling, HSCs, cultured for 2 days, were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h. Cell lysates were examined by Western blot analysis for p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK activation status using phospho-specific antibodies. Following TGF-β treatment, activation of both ERK and p38 MAPK was observed 60 and 120 min, respectively, following TGF-β treatment in 3-day cultured HSCs (Fig. 1). On the other hand, JNK activation was not observed following treatment of the cells with TGF-β. Inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK Activities Prevents TGF-β-induced Kinase Activation—To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK activity, on TGF-β-induced p38 MAPK activation, HSCs were cultured for 3 days and then incubated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of SB203580 and subsequently stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 2 h. Activation of p38 MAPK was assessed by Western blot analysis using a phospho-specific antibody recognizing activated phospho-p38. Blocking p38 MAPK activity with SB203580 inhibited TGF-β-induced p38 phosphorylation at concentrations of 3 and 10 μm but not at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 2A). To assess the effect of inhibiting MEK activity, an upstream kinase that activates ERK with PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, on TGF-β-induced ERK activity, 3-day cultured HSCs were pretreated with increasing concentrations of PD98059 for 1 h and subsequently stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 1 h. Inhibiting ERK activity with 10 μm PD98059 completely blocked TGF-β-induced ERK activation; treatment with 3 μm PD98059 only partially inhibited ERK activity, and incubation with 1 μm did not inhibit ERK activity (Fig. 2B). TGF-β Independently Activates Smad and p38 MAPK Signaling in HSCs—Because both Smad and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are activated following TGF-β treatment, we wanted to determine whether TGF-β induces the activation of these signaling pathways independently of each other or if they are activated by a common mechanism. Because Smad proteins act as mediators for TGF-β signaling, the effect of inhibiting Smad signaling using Ad5Smad7 on basal Smad activity and Smad activity in response to TGF-β stimulation in HSCs was investigated. To inhibit TGF-β-mediated cell signaling, HSCs were transduced with Ad5Smad7 (m.o.i. of 250). HSCs, 2 days in culture, were transduced with Ad5Smad7 and on the following day cells were harvested. Transduction of HSCs with Ad5Smad7 showed high levels of Smad7 protein expression as assessed by Western blot analysis using the HA tag (Fig. 3A). Treatment of day 3 cultured HSCs with 5 ng/ml TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation within 15 min was maximal 30 min after treatment and persisted for at least 120 min (Fig. 3B). To assess the effect of inhibiting Smad signaling followed by TGF-β treatment, HSCs, cultured for 2 days, were transduced with Ad5Smad7, and the following day Smad2 phosphorylation was assessed after stimulation with TGF-β for 30 min. TGF-β stimulation increased Smad2 phosphorylation 3.5-fold compared with both untransduced and Ad5LacZ control virus-transduced HSCs (Fig. 3C). Transduction with Ad5Smad7 significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation compared with Ad5LacZ-transduced HSCs. To investigate the effect of blocking Smad signaling on the activation of p38 MAPK, HSCs were transduced with Ad5Smad7 and treated with TGF-β for 2 h, and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was assessed by Western blot analysis using a phospho-p38-specific antibody. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was found to be increased 7.5-fold following TGF-β treatment, compared with both untransduced and Ad5LacZ-transduced control HSCs (Fig. 3D). Blocking Smad signaling with Ad5Smad7 did not affect basal or TGF-β-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, indicating that these two signaling pathways are independent from each other (Fig. 3D). Similarly, HSCs, cultured for 3 days, were preincubated with 10 μm SB203580 for 1 h and then stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 2 h. TGF-β-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was completely inhibited by SB203580 (Fig. 3F). On the other hand, blocking p38 MAPK activity did not inhibit TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 3E). Together these results show that these two TGF-β-induced signaling pathways are independent from each other. Blocking Either p38 MAPK or Smad Signaling Inhibits TGF-β-induced α1(I) Collagen mRNA Expression—To assess the role of p38 MAPK and ERK activities on TGF-β-induced α1(I) collagen mRNA steady state expression, HSCs were cultured for 3 days and then pretreated for 1 h with 10 μm SB203580 or 10 μm PD98059, respectively. Afterward, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h, and total RNA was isolated, and then α1(I) collagen mRNA steady state expression was assessed. TGF-β increased α1(I) collagen mRNA steady state levels 2.1-fold in quiescent HSCs (3-day cultures; Fig. 4, A and B); however, TGF-β-induced α1(I) collagen mRNA expression was not observed in HSCs cultured for 10 days (Fig. 4, C and D). Inhibiting p38 MAPK activity with 10 μm SB203580 blocked total α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by 38%, whereas inhibiting ERK activity with 10 μm PD98059 had no effect on α1(I) collagen mRNA expression (Fig. 4, A and B). Inhibiting Smad signaling with Ad5Smad7 reduced total α1(I) collagen mRNA expression 59% compare with HSCs treated with TGF-β alone (Fig. 5A, B). Inhibition of both p38 MAPK and Smad signaling reduced total expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA by 84% to that of TGF-β-treated cells.Fig. 5Inhibition of Smad signaling with Ad5Smad7 inhibits TGF-β-induced α1(I) collagen mRNA in HSCs. HSCs, cultured for 2 days, were transduced with Ad5Smad7 (m.o.i. of 250) to inhibit Smad signaling. On the following day (day 3), the cells were treated for 24 h with 5 ng/ml TGF-β alone or in combination with 10 μm SB203580 added 1 h prior to the addition of 5 ng/ml TGF-β. Total RNA was isolated and used (5 μg) to measure α1(I) collagen mRNA expression, normalized to that of GAPDH. A representative RNase protection assay is shown. tRNA was used as a negative control RNA sample (A). Graphical analysis from three individual RNase protection assays is shown (B). Error bars represent S.D. *, p < 0.05; a, versus control; b, versus TGF-β treated HSC; c, versus SB203580 (SB)-treated HSC; d, versus Ad5Smad7-transduced HSC.

To keep a continuous inhibition of kinase activity, the culture medium containing SB203580 was replaced daily until the cells were harvested. Expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA, which was up-regulated in culture-induced activated HSCs (5 days in culture), remained unchanged after Ad5LacZ transduction (Fig. 6). Inhibiting Smad signaling with Ad5Smad7 reduced steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA by 84%, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK activity inhibited α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by 80%. When both signaling pathways were simultaneously inhibited, α1(I) collagen mRNA expression was reduced 96% compared with control cells, indicating that these two signaling pathways are primarily responsible for α1(I) collagen expression in the HSC. Both MKK3 and MKK6 Locate Upstream of p38 MAPK and Regulate Collagen Gene Expression through p38 MAPK in HSCs—Although MKK3 and MKK6 are generally considered to be upstream kinases and activators of p38 MAPK, their role in HSCs has not been investigated previously. To determine their roles in TGF-β/p38 MAPK signaling, HSCs were transduced with Ad5dnMKK3 and/or Ad5dnMKK6 on day 2, and subsequently treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 2 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and activation of p38 MAPK was assessed by Western blot analysis using a phospho-specific p38 MAPK antibody. Viral transduction was confirmed by Western blot analysis for expression of the FLAG tag present on the dnMKK3 and MKK6 proteins (data not shown). Blocking either MKK3 or MKK6 activity partially inhibited TGF-β-induced p38 phosphorylation, whereas transduction with both Ad5dnMKK3 and Ad5dnMKK6 completely blocked p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). These data show that both MKK3 and MKK6 are positioned upstream of p38 MAPK and positively transmit TGF-β/p38 MAPK signaling. To confirm the role of Smad signaling in HSCs, SB431542, a potent and selective inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor kinase, was used to block TGF-β/Smad signaling (30Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C. Martin W. Fornwald J. Lehr R. Harling J. Gaster L. Callahan J.F. Olson B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To show the inhibitory effect of SB431542 on TGF-β-induced Smad2 activation, HSCs were cultured for 3 days, then incubated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of SB431542, and subsequently stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 30 min. Activation of Smad2 was assessed by Western blot analysis using a phospho-specific antibody recognizing activated phospho-Smad2. Blocking TGF-β type I receptor activity with SB431542 completely abolished TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation at concentration of 10 μm without affecting phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 7, B and C). To examine the role of MKK3/6 on TGF-β-induced α1(I) collagen mRNA expression, HSCs, day 2 in culture, were transduced with Ad5dnMKK3 and/or Ad5dnMKK6 and treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h. RNA was harvested, and RNase protection assays were performed. Blocking MKK3 reduced steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA by 46% (Fig. 7, D and E). Most interestingly, inhibiting MKK6 alone decreased α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by 62% which was nearly at the same level as when both MKK3 and MKK6 activities were blocked (64%). Therefore, both MKK3 and MKK6 play important roles in regulating α1(I) collagen gene expression through p38 MAPK; however, MKK6 signaling appears to have a stronger effect than MKK3 activity. Blocking Smad signaling with SB431542 reduced α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by 63%, and inhibiting both Smad and MKK3/6 (as a result of blocking both Smad and p38 MAPK) decreased α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by 88% (Fig. 7, D and E). Furthermore, transduction of HSCs with Ad5dnMKK3 reduced culture-induced steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA by 48%, and inhibiting MKK6 alone with Ad5dnMKK6 decreased α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by 75%, nearly the same level as blocking both MKK3 and MKK6 by 73% (Fig. 7, F and G). Blocking Smad signaling with SB431542 reduced culture-induced α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by 81%, and inhibiting both Smad and MKKs decreased by 97% (Fig. 7, F and G). Both"

Therefore, modulators of iNOS expression and activity, both endogenous and exogenous, are important in determining the magnitude and time course of this condition. We have shown previously that NO from the constitutive endothelial NOS (eNOS) is necessary to obtain maximal iNOS expression and activity following exposure of murine macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Thus, eNOS represents an important regulator of iNOS expression in vitro. Herein, we validate this hypothesis in vivo using a murine model of sepsis. A temporal reduction in iNOS expression and activity was observed in LPS-treated eNOS knock-out (KO) mice as compared with wild-type animals; this was reflected in a more stable hemodynamic profile in eNOS KO mice during endotoxaemia. Furthermore, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, LPS leads to the activation of eNOS through phosphoinositide 3-kinase- and Akt/protein kinase B-dependent enzyme phosphorylation. These data indicate that the pathogenesis of sepsis is characterized by an initial eNOS activation, with the resultant NO acting as a co-stimulus for the expression of iNOS, and therefore highlight a novel pro-inflammatory role for eNOS.

Inducible NOS is effectively absent under physiological conditions but is expressed in many cell types in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides (LPS); in accord, induction of this NOS isoform is necessary for “high output” NO production and cytostatic and cytotoxic effects that facilitate host defense (11MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3458) Google Scholar). While iNOS expression is essential to combat bacterial infection, the sustained overproduction of NO is deleterious to the host, as exemplified by the cardiovascular dysfunction during sepsis. Since iNOS is regulated primarily at a transcriptional level (12Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Xie Q. Nathan C.

In contrast to iNOS, a potential role for endothelial NOS (eNOS) in the pathogenesis of sepsis is unsubstantiated. Initial studies suggested that eNOS knock-out (KO) animals respond to endotoxin in an identical manner to wild-type (WT) littermates (15Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), and more recently, mice overexpressing eNOS were shown to express equivalent levels of iNOS mRNA and generate similar levels of plasma NO–2 and NO–3 (an index of iNOS activity) to control animals (16Julou-Schaeffer G. Gray G.A. Fleming I. Schott C. Parratt J.R. Stoclet J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar) in response to LPS. However, we have recently demonstrated that eNOS acts in a pro-inflammatory manner in immune cells by facilitating iNOS expression in response to endotoxin, such that in bone marrow-derived macrophages from eNOS KO mice, iNOS expression and activity are less than 50% of WT controls (17Connelly L. Jacobs A.T. Palacios-Callender M. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26480-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This pro-inflammatory effect of eNOS-derived NO occurs, at least in part, via a modulation of the activity of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (18Connelly L. Palacios-Callender M. Ameixa C. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Further studies give support to a potential pro-inflammatory role for eNOS. For instance, a reduction in both basal and LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production occurs in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes from eNOS KO mice (19Peng T. Lu X. Lei M. Feng Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8099-8105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and in HeLa and microvascular endothelial cells, TNF-α has been shown to activate eNOS (20Barsacchi R. Perrotta C. Bulotta S. Moncada S. Borgese N. Clementi E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 886-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Kawanaka H. Jones M.K. Szabo I.L. Baatar D. Pai R. Tsugawa K. Sugimachi K. Sarfeh I.J. Tarnawski A.S. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies not only demonstrate the importance of eNOS for the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory protein expression but also illustrate the auto-regulation of NOS expression by NO, since iNOS-derived NO is known to feedback and inhibit the expression and activity of eNOS (22Chauhan S.D. Seggara G. Vo P.A. MacAllister R.J. Hobbs A.J. Ahluwalia A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 773-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Buga G.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In combination, these data give rise to the hypothesis that eNOS plays a key role in the expression of iNOS and the pathogenesis of sepsis. In accord, in the present study we have employed eNOS KO mice to examine the role of this NOS isoform in an in vivo conscious animal model of sepsis (10Rees D.D. Monkhouse J.E. Cambridge D. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMØs) (from WT and eNOS KO mice) to dissect the mechanisms underlying LPS-stimulated eNOS activity. Herein, we demonstrate that eNOS plays an important role in facilitating iNOS expression in vivo during endotoxaemia with a marked reduction in iNOS protein observed in the liver, lung, heart, and aorta of eNOS KO mice as compared with WT, in addition to an accompanying reduction in plasma levels of NO–2 and NO–3. The impaired iNOS expression and activity are accompanied by a more stable hemodynamic profile and reduced mortality in response to LPS. We also show that in HUVECs and BMDMØs, LPS activates eNOS via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- and Akt/protein kinase B-dependent mechanism. Reagents—Deguelin was purchased from Alexis (Nottingham, UK). 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). All drugs were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) such that the final concentration of Me2SO in culture did not exceed 0.001%. Salmonella typhosa LPS was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. LPS Treatment and Tissue Homogenization—S. typhosa LPS (12.5 mg/kg, intravenously) was administered to 6–8-week-old male WT (C57/BL6; 15–25 g) and eNOS KO mice via the tail vein. After the appropriate time interval the animals were euthanized and tissues and/or blood collected. Tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C before transfer into whole-cell homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 8 mm EGTA, and 1 μg/ml benzamidine, leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin). Tissues were homogenized, centrifuged (13,793 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), and the supernatants retained for subsequent analysis. Blood samples were centrifuged (13,397 × g, room temperature, 5 min) and plasma retained. Plasma samples were then spun for a further 30 min through Microcon centrifugal filter devices (YM3, 3000-Da cutoff; Millipore, Watford, UK) before assaying. Measurement of Mean Arterial Blood Pressure—Mice (WT and eNOS KO; male; 15–25 g) were anesthetized briefly with isolflurane (2%). A cannula (internal diameter: 0.28 mm, outer diameter: 0.61 mm) was implanted in the carotid artery and jugular vein and tunnelled subcutaneously to emerge at the nape of the neck. The cannulae were connected to a swivel/tether system secured to the mouse using four silk sutures. This enabled the mouse, on recovery, to have unimpeded movement around the cage with free access to food and water. Both lines were flushed continuously with 0.1 ml/h heparinized-saline (1:1,000). Following recovery from surgery, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was measured (P23 XL transducer, Viggo-Spectramed, Oxnard, CA) and recorded onto a precalibrated PowerLab system (ADInstuments, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia), as described previously (10Rees D.D. Monkhouse J.E. Cambridge D. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, LPS (12.5 mg/kg) was administered via the jugular vein, and the MABP was monitored over an 18-h period. HUVEC Culture—HUVECs (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 0.4% endothelial cell growth supplement/heparin, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast factor, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (all from Promocell). Cells were passaged by trypsinization with cells of passage 5 and below used for experimentation. For phosphorylation experiments, cells were seeded in 10 cm culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air until ∼90% confluent. At 4 h before stimulation (to minimize basal Akt and eNOS phosphorylation), medium was removed and replaced with endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (all from Promocell). After activation with LPS (1 μg/ml) for appropriate times, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS before addition of phospho-homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaPPi, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 μg/ml benzamidine, leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin). Homogenates were scraped into 1.5-ml tubes and then centrifuged (13,793 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and supernatants retained for subsequent analysis. Bone Marrow-derived Macrophage Culture—BMDMØs were extracted and cultured as described previously (17Connelly L. Jacobs A.T. Palacios-Callender M. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26480-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For Akt phosphorylation experiments, cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates (4 × 106 cells/well) in 2 ml of medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 25 mm HEPES supplemented with 10% New Zealand fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin; all from Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air. After activation with LPS (100 ng/ml) for appropriate times, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS before addition of phospho-homogenization buffer (as described above). For experiments to study the effect of deguelin or LY294002 on Akt phosphorylation, cells were preincubated with deguelin (1 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), or Me2SO (control) for 30 min before addition of LPS (100 ng/ml). Homogenates were scraped into 1.5-ml tubes and then centrifuged (13,793 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and the supernatants retained for subsequent analysis. For experiments to study the effect of deguelin or LY294002 on iNOS expression, cells were seeded into 12-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) in 1 ml of medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air. Cells were preincubated with deguelin (1 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), or Me2SO (control) for 30 min before addition of LPS (100 ng/ml). After 9 h medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS before addition of whole-cell homogenization buffer (as above). Homogenates were scraped into 1.5-ml tubes and then centrifuged (13,793 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and the supernatants retained for subsequent analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Equal volumes of protein were subjected to 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a semidry blotter (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 60 min. The membranes were then incubated with shaking in 5% milk in wash buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C, with gentle shaking with primary antibody (αiNOS, BD Biosciences, αAkt, αphospho-Akt (Ser473), αeNOS, αphospho-eNOS (Ser1177), all from Cell Signaling) diluted 1:2,000 (iNOS) or 1:500 (all other antibodies) in 1% milk in wash buffer. The membrane was washed six times (5 min/wash) and then incubated, with gentle shaking for 1 h at room temperature, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated αrabbit IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:1,000 (tissue and HUVEC) or 1:2,000 (BMDMØs) in 1% milk in wash buffer. The membrane was washed as described before, and proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified by densitometry (NIH image). Cyclic GMP Assay—BMDMØs were seeded into 6-well culture plates (4 × 106 cells/well) in 2 ml of medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air. Medium was aspirated and replaced with medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and cells preincubated with deguelin (1 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), or Me2SO (control) for 30 min. Cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 30 min at which point the medium was aspirated and intracellular cGMP concentrations measured using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nitrite and Nitrate Measurement—Plasma samples were analyzed for NO2− and NO3− using chemiluminescence as described previously (24Ignarro L.J. Fukuto J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Byrns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples and standards containing NO2− and NO3− were first reduced to NO, which was then quantified after reaction with ozone using a nitric oxide analyzer (NOA 280, Sievers). To determine total NO2− and NO3− concentrations, collectively termed “NOx,” samples were added to 0.1 m vanadium (III) chloride in 1 m hydrochloric acid refluxing at 90 °C under nitrogen. Data Analysis—All statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Densitometric analyses were performed using NIH Image. All data are plotted graphically as mean values with vertical bars representing standard error of the mean (S.E.). A Student's t test was used to assess differences between individual experimental conditions. Analysis of variance was used to compare temporal changes in MABP in WT and eNOS KO animals. A probability (p) value of <0.05 was taken as an appropriate level of significance. Hemodynamic Profile in WT and eNOS KO Mice in Response to LPS—The administration of LPS (12.5 mg/kg) led to a biphasic effect on the MABP of WT mice (n = 6). There was an immediate but transient drop in MABP following administration of LPS (∼10 mm Hg) that recovered to basal levels after 4–5 h. At this time point, the MABP fell again and continued to decline for the duration of the experiment (18 h) or until the animal died (two out of six; Fig. 1). In contrast, in eNOS KO mice the blood pressure remained stable immediately after injection of LPS, and while at 6 h the MABP began to fall slightly, this only deviated from basal levels by <20% (Fig. 1). Plasma NOx Accumulation in Response to LPS—Resting plasma [NOx] were higher in WT compared with eNOS KO animals, as would be expected in animals lacking eNOS-derived NO. Administration of LPS (12.5 mg/kg) resulted in an increase in plasma [NOx] in both WT and eNOS KO mice (Fig. 2). The increases in plasma [NOx] closely mirrored the sustained fall in MABP observed in WT animals. However, the plasma NOx levels in eNOS KOs were significantly reduced in comparison with WT animals, such that at 12 h there was an approximate 50% reduction in plasma [NOx] in eNOS KO animals (Fig. 2). Effect of eNOS Deletion on iNOS Expression in Response to LPS—There was no detectable iNOS expression in tissues from control mice either WT or eNOS KO (saline-treated). Administration of LPS (12.5 mg/kg) led to a time-dependent increase in the expression of iNOS protein in the liver, lung, heart, and aorta of WT and eNOS KO mice (Fig. 3). However, in tissues from eNOS KO mice there was a significantly lower level of iNOS protein expression after treatment with LPS, with the maximum differential effect observed between 9 and 12 h (Fig. 3). The peak iNOS protein levels were 69.1 ± 10.5% in the liver, 51.3 ± 22.9% in the lung, 52.6 ± 30.0% in the heart, and 58.1 ± 1.8% in the aorta of those observed in WT animals (p < 0.05 for each). Akt and eNOS Phosphorylation in Response to LPS in HUVECs—Since our in vivo investigations had revealed a key role for eNOS in facilitating iNOS expression, we investigated whether the PI3K/Akt pathway was responsible for activation of eNOS in response to LPS in HUVECs. HUVECs were incubated in basal medium without growth factors for 4 h (to minimize basal Akt and eNOS phosphorylation) followed by stimulation with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 60 min and Akt phosphorylation assessed by Western blot. LPS caused a transient Akt phosphorylation that peaked at ∼15 min and returned to basal levels within 60 min (Fig. 4). Since Akt was phosphorylated in response to LPS stimulation, the downstream phosphorylation of eNOS was also studied under the same conditions. After 4-h incubation in basal medium, cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 60 min and eNOS phosphorylation assessed by Western blot. In a pattern that mirrored Akt activation, eNOS was transiently phosphorylated after LPS treatment with peak levels of phosphorylation occurring between 15 and 30 min after activation (Fig. 5). Akt and eNOS Phosphorylation in Response to LPS in Murine BMDMØs—Since HUVECs do not express iNOS in response to inflammatory stimuli in vitro, and so that it was possible to exploit KO technology, we used BMDMØs to demonstrate a link between LPS-induced PI3K/Akt and eNOS phosphorylation with iNOS expression. Cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and phosphorylation of Akt monitored over 60 min by Western blot. A transient increase in phosphorylated Akt was observed in response to LPS treatment, with a peak effect observed between 15 and 30 min (Fig. 6). Since BMDMØs express very low levels of eNOS (some 100-fold less than endothelial cells (17Connelly L. Jacobs A.T. Palacios-Callender M. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26480-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)), it was not possible to determine whether eNOS phosphorylation occurred as a result of LPS-stimulated Akt activation in these cells. However, a similar pattern of Akt phosphorylation was observed in eNOS KO cells in response to LPS (data not shown) confirming that the activation of Akt occurs upstream of eNOS. To investigate whether the phosphorylation and activation of Akt was linked with eNOS activation and the expression of iNOS, WT and eNOS KO BMDMØs were activated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 9 h in the presence and absence of the PI3K/Akt inhibitors deguelin (1 μm) (25Chun K.H. Kosmeder J.W. Sun S. Pezzuto J.M. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Lee H.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) or LY294002 (10 μm) and iNOS expression determined (NOx accumulation in the culture medium was below detection limits of the chemiluminescence system at this time point; data not shown). In the presence of deguelin or LY294002, iNOS expression in WT cells was 32.4 ± 8.2% (Fig. 7) and 64.9 ± 5.4% (Fig. 7) of the expression levels observed with LPS only (control). However, in eNOS KO cells, both deguelin and LY294002 failed to cause a significant reduction in LPS-stimulated iNOS expression (Fig. 7). Indeed, in the presence of deguelin and LY294002, iNOS expression in response to LPS was essentially identical in cells from WT and eNOS KO mice (Fig. 7), confirming the importance of eNOS-derived NO to iNOS expression. Effect of Deguelin and LY294002 on Akt Phosphorylation in Response to LPS in WT and eNOS KO BMDMØs—To confirm that the effects of deguelin and LY294002 on iNOS expression were due specifically to inhibition of Akt activity, BMDMØs were activated with LPS (100 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of deguelin (1 μm) or LY294002 (10 μm) and Akt phosphorylation determined by Western blot after 15 min. In the presence of deguelin, Akt phosphorylation was reduced to 60.5 ± 10.9% of the level observed with LPS only (control) in WT cells and 35.9 ± 11.3% of control levels in eNOS KO cells (Fig. 8). Accordingly, in the presence of LY294002, Akt phosphorylation was reduced to 49.0 ± 10.3% of the level observed with LPS only (control) in WT cells and 32.3 ± 6.5% of control levels in eNOS KO cells (Fig. 8). Thus, while both deguelin and LY294002 have an inhibitory effect on Akt phosphorylation in both WT and eNOS KO, this was only manifested as an inhibition of iNOS activity in cells from WT animals. Effect of Deguelin and LY294002 on cGMP Accumulation in Response to LPS in WT and eNOS KO BMDMØs—Since the concentrations of NO–2 and NO–3 generated by BMDMØ eNOS are too low to be detected by chemiluminescence analysis, we measured cGMP accumulation as an index of eNOS activity to further demonstrate that stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway underlies eNOS activation by LPS. We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of BMDMØs with LPS (100 ng/ml) leads to an accumulation of intracellular cGMP in WT but not eNOS KO cells (17Connelly L. Jacobs A.T. Palacios-Callender M. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26480-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this case, cGMP accumulation in response to LPS stimulation was measured in the presence or absence of the PI3K/Akt inhibitors deguelin (1 μm) and LY294002 (10 μm). The stimulation of cells with LPS led to an ∼40% increase in intracellular cGMP concentration as compared with background (Fig. 9); this increase was reversed in the presence of deguelin (1 μm) or LY294002 (10 μm; Fig. 9). This study demonstrates that eNOS-derived NO plays a key role in facilitating iNOS expression in LPS-induced endotoxaemia in mice in vivo. In eNOS KO animals, the systemic hypotension and mortality associated with sepsis were markedly reduced, and this was mirrored by a reduction in iNOS expression in the heart, lung, liver, and aorta and a significantly smaller production of NO (as assessed by NOx accumulation). Furthermore, the activation of eNOS by LPS to enable maximal iNOS expression is triggered by the PI3K/Akt pathway, as has been identified previously to couple shear stress to NO production by the endothelium (26Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar, 27Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). These observations extend our previous finding that eNOS-derived NO is necessary to achieve peak iNOS expression in LPS-treated murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (17Connelly L. Jacobs A.T. Palacios-Callender M. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26480-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and suggest that this constitutive NOS isoform plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Moreover, the findings assign a potential pro-inflammatory role to eNOS, an enzyme that has been classically considered to act in an anti-inflammatory manner via NO-mediated inhibition of smooth muscle proliferation, leukocyte recruitment, and platelet aggregation (28Moncada S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To determine whether eNOS is important for the hemodynamic changes (and consequent aberrations in tissue perfusion) observed during septic shock, conscious WT and eNOS KO animals were exposed to LPS for 18 h. During this time, WT animals displayed a rapid, transient reduction in systemic blood pressure (within 1 h) that recovered almost entirely by 5 h and then dropped steadily throughout the remainder of the investigation. In marked contrast, the eNOS KO animals did not show an initial hypotensive response to LPS administration, and while systemic blood pressure in these animals waned over the length of the experiment, this was considerably more stable than that observed in WT animals and did not deviate by more than ∼20% from baseline values. These data establish two important principles with respect to eNOS activity in response to LPS. First, endotoxin causes an immediate up-regulation of eNOS activity, which is manifested as a hypotensive effect that is both rapid in onset and short-lived; such a hypotensive effect of LPS has been demonstrated previously in WT animals (10Rees"

First, we elucidated the essential role of IL-13 in the induction of the eotaxins by comparing IL-13 gene-targeted mice with wild type control mice by using an ovalbumin-induced model of allergic airway inflammation. Notably, ovalbumin-induced expressions of eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2 mRNA in the lungs were almost completely dependent upon IL-13. Second, in order to address the specific role of eotaxin-2 in IL-13-induced pulmonary eosinophilia, we generated eotaxin-2 gene-deficient mice by homologous recombination. Notably, in contrast to observations made in eotaxin-1-deficient mice, eotaxin-2-deficient mice had normal base-line eosinophil levels in the hematopoietic tissues and gastrointestinal tract. However, following intratracheal IL-13 administration, eotaxin-2-deficient mice showed a profound reduction in airway eosinophilia compared with wild type mice. Most interestingly, the level of peribronchial lung tissue eosinophils in IL-13-treated eotaxin-2-deficient mice was indistinguishable from wild type mice. Furthermore, IL-13 lung transgenic mice genetically engineered to be deficient in eotaxin-2 had a marked reduction of luminal eosinophils. Mechanistic analysis identified IL13-induced eotaxin-2 expression by macrophages in a distinct lung compartment (luminal inflammatory cells) compared with eotaxin-1, which was expressed solely in the tissue. Taken together, these results demonstrate a cooperative mechanism between IL-13 and eotaxin-2. In particular, IL-13 mediates allergen-induced eotaxin-2 expression, and eotaxin-2 mediates IL-13-induced airway eosinophilia.

There is currently an epidemic of allergic diseases in the western world (1.International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Steering CommitteeLancet. 1998; 351: 1225-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Experimentation in the asthma field has largely focused on analysis of the cellular and molecular events induced by allergen exposure in sensitized animals (primarily mice) and humans. These studies have identified elevated production of IgE, airway obstruction, eosinophilic inflammation, enhanced bronchial reactivity to spasmogens, epithelial metaplasia (including goblet cell formation), and epithelial injury in the asthmatic response (2.Broide D. Sriramarao P. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Clinical and experimental investigations have demonstrated a strong correlation between the presence of CD4+ T helper 2 lymphocytes (Th2 cells), lung eosinophilia, and disease severity, suggesting an integral role for these cells in the pathophysiology of asthma (3.Robinson D.S.

Th2 cells are thought to induce asthma through the secretion of an array of cytokines (IL 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; AHR, airway hyper-responsiveness; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; EtBr, ethidium bromide; KO, knockout; MBP, major basic protein; OVA, ovalbumin; Sal, saline; TK, thymidine kinase. -4, -5, -9, and -13) that activate inflammatory and residential effector pathways both directly and indirectly (5.Ray A. Cohn L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Eosinophils are thought to contribute to allergic airway inflammation by release of their pro-inflammatory cytotoxic granule proteins, generation of lipid mediators such as the cysteinyl-leukotrienes, and their release of mediators that can induce lung remodeling (e.g. transforming growth factors) (6.Gleich G.J.

Center D.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1996; 22: S109-S115Google Scholar). Accordingly, elucidating the mechanism of Th2 cell and eosinophil recruitment and the cooperative role of these cells in the induction of allergic airway inflammation is an active area of research investigation and therapeutic intervention (8.Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 9.Onuffer J.J. Horuk R. Trends Pharmacol.

The importance of elucidating the molecular mechanisms that govern eosinophil trafficking to the lung has been recently reinforced by the dramatic protection from experimental asthma seen in two different eosinophil-deficient mouse lines (11.Humbles A.A. Lloyd C.M. McMillan S.J. Friend D.S. Xanthou G. McKenna E.E. Ghiran S. Gerard N.P. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Gerard C. Science. 2004; 305: 1776-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 12.Lee J.J.

Science. 2004; 305: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Eosinophil recruitment into inflammatory sites is a complex process regulated by a number of cytokines, including IL-3, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, chemokines (e.g. regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted and the eotaxins), and Th2 cell products (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13) (13.Rothenberg M.E.

IL-13 is particularly important because it is produced in high quantities by Th2-cells and regulates multiple features of asthma (IgE production, mucus overproduction, eosinophil recruitment and survival, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), and the expression of CD23, adhesion molecules, and chemokines (e.g. eotaxin)) (16.Wills-Karp M.

Overexpression of IL-13, by pharmacological administration or transgenic approaches, induces multiple features of asthma, including eosinophilia, mucus overproduction, and AHR, that appear to be mediated, at least in part, by chemokine induction (26.Zhu Z.

Mosmann T.R. Lo D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2477-2487PubMed Google Scholar). During induction of IL-13-induced eosinophil-associated allergic airway inflammation, it has been proposed that the effect of IL-13 may be chemokine-dependent, as demonstrated by reduced lung inflammation in IL-13 lung transgenic mice engineered to be deficient in the chemokine receptor CCR2 (28.Zhu Z.

In addition to inducing CCR2 ligands, focusing on eosinophils, a paradigm has emerged implicating IL-4 and IL-13 in the induction of eosinophil active chemokines (29.Zimmermann N. Hershey G.K. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111 (243): 227-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In particular, IL-4 and IL-13 signaling involves utilization of the IL-4 receptor α-chain (30.Lai S.Y. Molden J. Liu K.D. Puck J.M.

However, the relative role of IL-4, IL-13, and other allergen-induced cytokines that have been shown to induce chemokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α) in the induction of the eotaxins has not been established. In addition, recent attention has been drawn to acidic mammalian chitinase in the regulation of eosinophilia and eotaxin induction (36.Zhu Z. Zheng T. Homer R.J. Kim Y.K. Chen N.Y. Cohn L. Hamid Q. Elias J.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). By using experimental models of antigen-induced airway inflammation, eotaxin-1 has been demonstrated to partially regulate eosinophil recruitment during the late phase response following repetitive mucosal antigen challenges (37.Rothenberg M.E. MacLean J.A. Pearlman E. Luster A.D. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 38.Campbell E.M. Kunkel S.L. Strieter R.M. Lukacs N.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 7047-7053PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient in both eotaxin-1 and IL-5 have a synergistic deficiency of lung eosinophils compared with mice deficient in either cytokine alone (39.Pope S.M. Brandt E.B. Mishra A. Hogan S.P. Zimmermann N. Matthaei K.I. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 108: 594-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Also, eotaxin-1/IL-5 double-deficient mice have an intrinsic deficiency in IL-13 production by antigen-specific CD4+ cells, demonstrating that eosinophils, eotaxin-1, and IL-13 cooperate in allergic airway inflammation (40.Mattes J. Foster P.S. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2003; 2: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additionally, intratracheal delivery of eotaxin-2 to IL-5 transgenic mice induces enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia and AHR compared with delivery to wild type mice (41.Yang M. Hogan S.P. Mahalingam S. Pope S.M. Zimmermann N. Fulkerson P. Dent L.A. Young I.G. Matthaei K.I. Rothenberg M.E. Foster P.S. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 112: 935-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made in understanding the specific contribution of eotaxin-1 in allergic airway inflammation, the role of eotaxin-2 has been less extensively studied. Notably, eotaxin-1 was originally identified based on its functional effect as a selective chemoattractant of eosinophils to the lung in a model of experimental asthma (42.Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D. Walsh D.T. Moqbel R. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Williams T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). However, both mouse and human eotaxin-2 were discovered by genomic approaches (43.Patel V.P. Kreider B.L. Li Y. Li H. Leung K. Salcedo T. Nardelli B. Pippalla V. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Parmelee D.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5839-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there is less certainty concerning the role of eotaxin-2 in asthmatic responses. In this work we aimed to further characterize the interaction of IL-13 and eotaxin-2 in the induction of lung eosinophilia. First, we were interested in defining the role of IL-13 in allergen-induced expression of the eotaxins. Second, we were interested in testing the role of eotaxin-2 in the recruitment of eosinophils into the lung in response to IL-13. Our results establish a critical role for IL-13 in allergen-induced expression of the eotaxins. Additionally, we generated eotaxin-2 gene-targeted mice and used them to demonstrate an essential role for eotaxin-2 in mediating IL-13-induced airway eosinophilia. Furthermore, mechanistic analysis identified IL-13-induced eotaxin-2 expression in a distinct cellular compartment (airway lumen) compared with eotaxin-1, which was solely expressed by cells found in the lung tissue. Taken together, these results identify a linear relationship in which allergen induces IL-13, which in turn is required for eotaxin-2 induction, which in turn regulates airway eosinophilia in a manner distinct from eotaxin-1. Mice—Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and examined at 6–8 weeks of age. IL-13-deficient mice and matched control mice with a BALB/c background (F6) were kindly provided by Dr. Andrew McKenzie (46.McKenzie G.J. Fallon P.G. Emson C.L. Grencis R.K. McKenzie A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the tetracycline-inducible IL-13 transgene under the regulation of the Clara cell 10 (CC10) lung promoter have been described previously (47.Wan H. Kaestner K.H. Ang S.L. Ikegami M. Finkelman F.D. Stahlman M.T. Fulkerson P.C. Rothenberg M.E. Whitsett J.A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In brief, a two-transgenic system was used to target the expression of IL-13 to the lung in an externally regulated fashion. The activator mice, containing the CC10-rtTA-hGH transgene, were kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center) (48.Tichelaar J.W. Lu W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the TetO-CMVp-IL-13-bGH transgene were bred with activator mice, and the resulting bitransgenic mice (CC10-rtTA-IL-13) at 4 weeks of age were fed doxycycline-impregnated food for 1–30 days. Generation of Eotaxin-2-deficient Mice—An eotaxin-2-targeting construct (Fig. 1A) was constructed by cloning a 5′ genomic fragment containing a 4.0-kb-long PCR product (5′-ACTCGAGTGTGGTGTAGCGTTTCACAC and 3′-ACTCGAGAGGCACAGCTCAGAGTTCAAAAC) by utilizing Expand™ Long Template PCR system (Invitrogen) and a 3′ genomic fragment containing a 3.9-kb SmaI-EcoRI fragment into a pGKneo plasmid vector (Boehringer Mishina GmbH, Houston, TX), which was modified to have a herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene inserted 3′ of the neomycin resistance gene. The genomic arms were derived from two λ phage DNA clones derived from 129 SvEv mice (Fig. 1A). The vector was linearized and electroporated into KG-1 embryonic stem cells of the 129 SvEv strain, and 288 neomycin-resistant clones were screened by Southern blot analysis by using a 622-bp PCR-generated probe (5′-AGACTTGAGGGTTTACAAAGTTTAG and 3′-TACCATGGATACCCTTCTAAAATTC) hybridized to EcoRV-digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1B), thereby yielding both a 28.3- and an 8.6-kb eotaxin-2-deficient band in correctly targeted clones (Fig. 1C). Three positive clones were detected. Two targeted clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts by standard methods. Both clones produced high degree chimeras, which transmitted the disrupted eotaxin-2 allele to offspring at roughly 50% frequency. High degree chimeric mice were then bred with C57BL/6J mice. Offspring with agouti coat color were genotyped, and mice heterozygote for the eotaxin-2 deletion were bred. Mice homozygous for the eotaxin-2 deletion were compared with wild type littermate controls. To produce eotaxin-2-deficient mice in the pure 129 SvEv background, the high degree chimeric mice were bred to 129 SvEv mice; heterozygote offspring for the eotaxin-2-deficient alleles were mated to produce homozygous eotaxin-2-deficient mice on a pure 129 SvEv background. A PCR strategy (5′-GGAAGTCCGTGGGGGAGAG and 3′-CTAAACCTCGGTGCTATTGC primers) was employed to genotype mice; PCR of wild type and eotaxin-2-deficient DNA yielded products of 2338 and ∼2150 bp, respectively (Fig. 1D). To produce inducible IL-13 lung transgenic mice deficient in eotaxin-2, bitransgenic mice (CC10-rtTA-IL-13) on an FVBN background were bred with eotaxin-2-deficient mice on a 129 SvEv background. F2 mice were genotyped for the eotaxin-2 deletion as well as the CC10 and IL-13 transgenes. Mice that were homozygous null for eotaxin-2 were compared with littermate control mice that were wild type for eotaxin-2. OVA-induced Model of Allergic Lung Inflammation—An allergic lung disease mouse model was established by sensitizing mice with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 μg of OVA and 1.0 mg of alum in 200 μl of sterile physiologic saline on two occasions separated by 2 weeks. Two weeks after the last sensitization, two intranasal doses of 50 μg of OVA 3 days apart were administered. Briefly, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation and held in a supine position, and 50 μl of normal saline containing 50 μg of OVA was applied to the nares using a micropipette. After the liquid was aspirated into the lung, the mice were held upright until alert. Mice were sacrificed between 18 and 20 h after the second intranasal challenge. IL-13-induced Airway Responses—An allergic lung inflammation mouse model was established by modifying protocols described previously (49.Huang W.W. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Sauty A. Oettgen H.C. Rothenberg M.E. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 50.Mishra A. Hogan S.P. Lee J.J. Foster P.S. Rothenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Mice received three 10-μg doses of IL-13 by intratracheal administration every other day. Mice were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of ketamine and held in an upright position, and 20 μl of physiologic saline containing 10 μg of recombinant murine IL-13 (a generous gift of Dr. Debra Donaldson, Wyeth Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) was applied directly into the lungs using a micropipette with a gel-loading tip. After instillation, mice were held upright for 20–30 s. Mice were sacrificed between 18 and 20 h after the last challenge. BALF Analysis—Immediately after being euthanized by CO2 inhalation, a midline neck incision was made, and the trachea was cannulated. The lungs were lavaged two times with 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. For cellular analysis, the recovered BALF was centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mm EDTA. Lysis of red blood cells was carried out utilizing RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total cell numbers were counted with a hemocytometer. Cytocentrifuge preparations (5 × 104 cells) were stained with Giemsa-Diff-Quick (Dade Diagnostics of Puerto Rico, Inc., Aguada, Puerto Rico), and differential cell counts were determined. For RNA analysis, the lungs were lavaged once with 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The recovered BALF was immediately centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cells were resuspended in Trizol™. RNA was then prepared per the manufacturer's specifications. Peripheral Blood Eosinophil Analysis—The mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Immediately thereafter, a midline neck incision was used to sever the jugular vein. Peripheral blood was immediately collected with a pipette, and 5 μl was added directly to 45 μl of Discombe's solution, as reported previously (51.Discombe G. Lancet. 1946; 1: 195Abstract PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Quantification of Tissue Eosinophil Levels—After lavage, the left lobe of the lung was removed and fixed with Accustain® neutral buffered 10% formalin (Sigma), embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm sections, and fixed to positive charge slides. Eosinophils in the tissue were differentially stained using an antiserum against murine major basic protein (anti-MBP) as described earlier (52.Matthews A.N. Friend D.S. Zimmermann N. Sarafi M.N. Luster A.D. Pearlman E. Wert S.E. Rothenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In brief, tissue endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol followed by nonspecific protein blocking with normal goat serum. Tissue sections were then treated with pepsin (DIGEST-ALL™ 3, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 4 min at room temperature, incubated with rabbit anti-murine MBP antibody (1:6000, a kind gift from J. Lee, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ) for 1 h at room temperature, and followed by 1:500 dilution of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and avidin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min each. These slides were further treated with nickel diaminobenzidine-cobalt chloride solution to form a black precipitate and were counter-stained with nuclear fast red solution. Quantification of immunoreactive cells was performed by computer-aided image analysis using Image Pro Plus imaging software system (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). At least four selections per mouse lung section were analyzed. Using digital image capture, the subepithelial peribronchial tissue regions associated with medium sized bronchioles were quantified for the total MBP+ cell numbers relative to the total tissue area. Calculated eosinophil levels are expressed as cells/mm2. Bone Marrow Eosinophil Colony-forming Unit Analysis—Naive wild type and eotaxin-2-deficient mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and bone marrow cells were obtained from the femur and centrifuged and resuspended in complete culture RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 m HEPES (Invitrogen). Low density mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation over LymphPrep (Accurate Chemicals) for 25 min at 1500 × g at room temperature, and subsequently incubated in plastic flasks for 2 h at 37 °C and with 5% CO2 to remove adherent cells. Nonadherent mononuclear cells (1 × 105) were cultured at 37 °C and with 5% CO2 in 35 × 10-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon Plastics and Discovery Labware) in 1 ml of methylcellulose culture medium ((Methocult™ M3234, Stem Cell Technologies), 20% fetal calf serum and 5 ng/ml of recombinant mouse IL-5 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)). Eosinophil colonies were evaluated after 10 days as described previously (53.Saito H. Matsumoto K. Denburg A.E. Crawford L. Ellis R. Inman M.D. Sehmi R. Takatsu K. Matthaei K.I. Denburg J.A. J.

In brief, murine eotaxin-1 cDNA in pBS-KS+/- plasmid was linearized by restriction enzyme digest with XhoI or EcoRI sense and antisense probes were generated by T7 and T3 RNA polymerase, respectively (Riboprobe Gemini Core System II transcription kit, Promega, Madison, WI). Murine eotaxin-2 cDNA in pBS-KS+/- plasmid was linearized by restriction enzyme digest with XhoI or EcoRI antisense and sense probes were generated by T7 and T3 RNA polymerase, respectively (Riboprobe Gemini Core System II transcription kit; Promega, Madison, WI). The radiolabeled α-35S-UTP probes were hybridized and washed under high stringency conditions. AHR Measurements—AHR was measured using whole body plethysmography, as reported previously (41.Yang M. Hogan S.P. Mahalingam S. Pope S.M. Zimmermann N. Fulkerson P. Dent L.A. Young I.G. Matthaei K.I. Rothenberg M.E. Foster P.S. J. Allergy Clin.

Increases in airway resistance to aerosolized methacholine (3.125 to 50 mg/ml) were determined as Penh, a dimensionless value, after 5 min of aerosol exposure. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance comparing different sets of mice was determined by Wilcoxon rank sum of the median test. IL-13 Is Required for Eotaxin-1 and Eotaxin-2 Induction—We were first interested in determining the specific molecules associated with allergen-induced Th2 responses that were responsible for mediating induction of the eotaxins. Whereas IL-13 overexpression has been shown to be sufficient for expression of the eotaxins (27.Li L. Xia Y. Nguyen A. Lai Y.H. Feng L. Mosmann T.R. Lo D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2477-2487PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Zhu Z. Ma B. Zheng T. Homer R.J. Lee C.G. Charo I.F. Noble P. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2953-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the requirement of IL-13 for the expression of the eotaxins during the development of allergen-induced lung inflammation has not been addressed. In order to examine this, we subjected IL-13-deficient and matched control mice to OVA-induced experimental asthma"
https://openalex.org/W1972943445,"Evidence suggests that protein kinase C (PKC) and intracellular calcium are important for amphetamine-stimulated outward transport of dopamine in rat striatum. In this study, we examined the effect of select PKC isoforms on amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux, focusing on Ca2+-dependent forms of PKC. Efflux of endogenous dopamine was measured in superfused rat striatal slices; dopamine was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The non-selective classical PKC inhibitor Gö6976 inhibited amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux, whereas rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKCδ, had no effect. A highly specific PKCβ inhibitor, LY379196, blocked dopamine efflux that was stimulated by either amphetamine or the PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. None of the PKC inhibitors significantly altered [3H]dopamine uptake. PKCβI and PKCβII, but not PKCα or PKCγ, were co-immunoprecipitated from rat striatal membranes with the dopamine transporter (DAT). Conversely, antisera to PKCβI and PKCβII but not PKCα or PKCγ were able to co-immunoprecipitate DAT. Amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux was significantly enhanced in hDAT-HEK 293 cells transfected with PKCβII as compared with hDAT-HEK 293 cells alone, or hDAT-HEK 293 cells transfected with PKCα or PKCβI. These results suggest that classical PKCβII is physically associated with DAT and is important in maintaining the amphetamine-stimulated outward transport of dopamine in rat striatum.

The plasmalemmal dopamine transporter (DAT) 1The abbreviations used are: DAT, dopamine transporter; PKC, protein kinase C; hDAT, human DAT; hDAT-HEK-293, human DAT-transfected human embryonic kidney cells; KRB, Kreb's-Ringer buffer; KRH, Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. is a pre-synaptic protein that belongs to the SLC6 family of Na+/Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters. It is the primary regulator of the duration and strength of the dopamine signal in the synapse (1Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). DAT binds extracellular dopamine, Na+, and Cl– and transports them intracellularly, clearing dopamine from the synaptic cleft. The transporter is also the site of action of psychostimulant drugs such as amphetamine, which is a DAT substrate. Following its transport into the synaptic terminal, amphetamine stimulates a reversal of the transporter eliciting dopamine efflux. DAT is characterized as having 12 transmembrane segments and a large second extracellular loop with the N- and C-terminals located intracellularly. There are also putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A, and Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase II (2Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). PKC has been implicated in various aspects of DAT function and regulation, such as trafficking (3Melikian H.E.

General PKC inhibitors blocked dopamine efflux induced by amphetamine in rat striatal slices (9Kantor L. Gnegy M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 594-598Google Scholar). Accordingly, a PKC inhibitor blocked amphetamine-mediated locomotor behavior when injected directly into rat nucleus accumbens (10Browman K.E. Kantor L. Richardson S. Badiani A. Robinson T.E. Gnegy M.E. Brain Res. 1998; 814: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The phorbol ester PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), mimicked the effect of amphetamine on the reverse transport by eliciting an efflux of dopamine that was cocaine-sensitive and independent of extracellular Ca2+ (11Cowell R.M. Kantor L. Hewlett G.H. Frey K.A. Gnegy M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 389: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Finally, a deletion of the N-terminal 22 amino acids of DAT, containing the distal N-terminal serines that are strongly considered to be substrate sites of PKC (6Foster J.D. Pananusorn B. Vaughan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25178-25186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), abrogated amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux from hDAT-HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) without altering inward transport (12Khoshbouei H. Sen N. Guptaroy B. Johnson L. Lund D. Gnegy M.E. Galli A. Javitch J.A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E78Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mutation of the distal N-terminal serines of DAT to alanines similarly abolished amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux, whereas mutation of the N-terminal serines to aspartates restored sensitivity of the reverse transport to amphetamine. The PKC isoform altering DAT-mediated dopamine efflux is not known, but it could be a Ca2+-sensitive isoform. Although amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux does not require extracellular Ca2+, it does require intracellular Ca2+ (13Kantor L. Hewlett G.H. Park Y.H. Richardson-Burns S.M. Mellon M.J. Gnegy M.E.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, amphetamine, acting at DAT, increases intracellular Ca2+ from thapsigargin-sensitive stores (14Gnegy M.E.

The classical PKC isoforms (α, β1, β2, γ) are Ca2+- and diacylglycerol-dependent. The non-classical PKC isoforms (δ, ϵ, η, θ) are Ca2+-independent but diacylglycerol-dependent. The atypical PKC isoforms (ζ and ι/λ) are insensitive to Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. There is a limited number of inhibitors that can distinguish among the different isoforms. Gö6976 is a potent inhibitor of the classical PKC isoforms (16Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LY379196, structurally similar to LY333531, is a highly selective inhibitor of the PKCβ isoform (17Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Gonzalez C.M. Heath W.F. McDonald III, J.H. Neel D.A. Rito C.J. Singh U. Stramm L.E. Melikian-Badalian A. Baevsky M. Ballas L.M. Hall S.E. Winneroski L.L. Faul M.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and rottlerin is a selective inhibitor of the PKCδ isoform (18Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Using these selective inhibitors in combination with co-immunoprecipitation studies and the transfection of PKC isozymes into hDAT human embryonic kidney 293 (hDAT-HEK 293) cells, we investigated the role of two classical PKC isozymes in regulating outward transport of dopamine by amphetamine and their association with DAT. Materials—Gö6976 and rottlerin were purchased from Calbiochem. d-Amphetamine, dopamine, and TPA were purchased from Sigma. LY379196 was a generous gift from Lilly. hDAT cDNA was a gift from Dr. Z. B. Pristupa, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Canada; cDNAs for PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII were generous gifts from Dr. Stephen Ferguson, John P. Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada. Amphetamine- or TPA-mediated Dopamine Efflux—Rat striata from female Sprague-Dawley rats (175–200 g) were sliced, weighed, and placed in chambers of a Brandel perfusion apparatus (Brandel SF-12, Gaithersburg, MD) onto Whatman GF/B filter disks. The chambers were perfused at 37 °C with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB, 145 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.255 mm ascorbic acid, 24.9 mm NaHCO3, 50 μm pargyline, and 1 mm tropolone) for 40 min at a rate of 100 μl/min. The slices were then perfused in the presence or absence of the drugs (130 nm Gö6976, 10 μm rottlerin, or 100 nm LY379196) for 40 min prior to the addition of a 2.5-min bolus of 3 μm amphetamine or 300 nm TPA. Eluates (500 μl, 5-min fractions) were collected into vials containing 25 μl of internal standard solution (0.05 m HClO4, 4.55 mm dihydroxybenzylamine (internal standard), 1 m metabisulfate and 0.1 m EDTA). Dopamine was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. To measure dopamine efflux from hDAT-HEK 293 cells, cells cultured in 100-mm plates were incubated with 15 μm unlabeled dopamine for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation, cells were washed two times with a Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.6 mm glucose, and 1 mm tropolone) and resuspended in 300 μl of KRH. The cells (200 μl) were placed in the Brandel superperfusion apparatus and washed for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of 3 μm amphetamine for 2.5 min. Dopamine was measured in the eluates as described above. Synaptosome Preparation—Rat striata were homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science), pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and centrifuged again. The combined supernatant fractions were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet (P2) was resuspended in KRB for [3H]dopamine uptake assay. [3H]Dopamine Uptake—Synaptosomes were resuspended in 1.2 ml of KRB and incubated in the presence or absence of drugs (130 nm Gö6976, 10 μm rottlerin, or 100 nm LY379196) for 40 min at 37 °C. [3H]Dopamine (330 nm, 24.4 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added for 3 min. [3H]Dopamine uptake was stopped with 5 ml of cold KRB; samples were filtered on GF/C filters and washed twice with 5 ml of cold KRB. Filters were dried and then counted in a Beckman LS 5801 liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific uptake was determined using 10 μm of the DAT uptake inhibitor GBR12935. Uptake of 25 nm [3H]dopamine was measured similarly in hDAT-HEK 293 cells, which were resuspended in KRB after being triturated from the plates. Co-immunoprecipitation—Rat striatal synaptosomes were lysed in RIPAE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Na deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) by rotating for 1 h at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Lysates (50 μg) were incubated with either anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβII (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PKCβI (Sigma), anti-PKCγ (BD Biosciences), or anti-DAT antibody (University of Michigan antibody core). In some experiments, anti-DAT was preincubated with 40 μg of the immunizing peptide (see “Preparation of Purified Anti-DAT”) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 30 min and pelleted at 1000 × g. After washing twice with RIPAE buffer and twice with Tris-buffered saline (Tris 10 mm, pH 7.4, and NaCl, 150 mm), proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose with Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Generation and Maintenance of Stable Cell Lines—HEK 293 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For stable transfection, the cells were plated at 80% confluence on 6-well culture plates and were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.4 μg of hDAT cDNA in a pIREShyg 2 vector (Clontech) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) reduced serum medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. 12 h after transfection, the solution was removed, and fresh medium was added. Cells were grown for 7–8 h, and 250 μg/ml hygromycin was added to select for a stably transfected pool of cells. Stable cell lines expressing PKC isoforms (PKCβI, PKCβII, or PKCα) were made by transfection of 15 μg of individual cDNAs for PKCα, PKCβI, or PKCβII (PKCα in pEGFP-C3 vector, Clontech; PKCβI in pEGFP-C1 vector, Clontech; GFP-PKCβII fusion protein (19Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

The double transfectants were selected by growing in the presence of hygromycin and neomycin for PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII. Expression of hDAT and PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris/glycine gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% casein and incubated for 1 h in TBST containing anti-rat DAT monoclonal antibody at 1:1000 dilution (mab16, generously donated by Dr. Roxanne Vaughan, University of North Dakota), anti-PKCα antibody at 1:1000, PKCβI or PKCβII at 1:2000 dilution in TBST. Membranes were given four 10-min washes with TBST and incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution. Membranes were again washed with TBST and developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Purified Anti-DAT—A peptide corresponding to residues 42–59 of rat DAT (LTNSTLINPPQTPVEAQE) was synthesized at the Protein Structure Core, University of Michigan. Anti-peptide antibody was produced in rabbit at the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, University of Michigan, following the strategy of Freed et al. (20Freed C. Revay R. Vaughan R.A. Kriek E. Grant S. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The peptide-specific antibody was purified using the Amino Link Plus immobilization kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Surface expression of hDAT-HEK 293 cells and cells stably expressing hDAT + PKCα, hDAT + PKCβI, and hDAT + PKCβII was determined by reacting the surface proteins with sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1, 3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) using the method described by Granas et al. (21Granas C. Ferrer J.V. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4990-5000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with the following slight variations. Cells were grown to confluence on 100-mm plates, washed, removed from the plates by trituration, and resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline/Ca-Mg buffer, pH 7.3, before treating with sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1, 3-dithiopropionate (2.0 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 60 min in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca-Mg. The biotinylation reaction was stopped, and the samples were prepared as described by Granas et al. (21Granas C. Ferrer J.V. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4990-5000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) except that only 750 μg of samples were incubated with monomeric avidin beads. The eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris/glycine) and immunoblotted using a 1:1000 dilution of MAB369, anti-DAT (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Bands were visualized using goat anti-rat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:10,000 followed by ECL detection. Quantification of the bands was performed by the Scion Image software. Statistics—Statistical significance was calculated using Graph Pad 3. Statistical significance among three or more groups was determined using one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison analysis. Two-group comparisons, such as those comparing the effect of a drug on amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux, were made using a two-tail Student's t test. Effect of PKC Inhibitors on Amphetamine-stimulated Dopamine Efflux—The effect of the selective PKC inhibitors Gö6976, LY379196, and rottlerin on amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux from rat striatal slices was investigated. The classical PKC inhibitor Gö6976 at 130 nm (IC50 of 2.3–7.9 nm) (16Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduced the amount of dopamine efflux in response to amphetamine from 0.39 ± 0.05 pmol/mg of protein in the absence of the drug to 0.13 ± 0.05 pmol/mg of protein in the presence of the drug (p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux was also found using 13 nm Gö6976, a concentration closer to the IC50. PKC LY379196 is a highly selective inhibitor of PKCβ (IC50 of 30 nm) (17Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Gonzalez C.M. Heath W.F. McDonald III, J.H. Neel D.A. Rito C.J. Singh U. Stramm L.E. Melikian-Badalian A. Baevsky M. Ballas L.M. Hall S.E. Winneroski L.L. Faul M.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar); we used this compound to examine the role of a single classical PKC isozyme, PKCβ. LY379196 demonstrates a 10-fold selectivity over other classical PKCs and 10–100-fold selectivity over non-classical PKCs. In the presence of 100 nm LY379196, amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux was reduced from 0.28 ± 0.08 pmol/mg of protein in the absence of drug to 0.06 ± 0.03 pmol/mg of protein (p < 0.03, n = 8) (Fig. 1B). The value for dopamine efflux in the presence of LY379196 was not different from base line (0.10 ± 0.02, n = 8). To test the activity of a novel PKC, we used rottlerin, a selective PKCδ inhibitor (IC50 of 2–6 μm) (18Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Rottlerin, at 10 μm, did not decrease amphetamine-mediated dopamine efflux in rat striatal slices (Fig. 1C). Rottlerin exhibited a slight but non-significant stimulatory effect on efflux. Effect of the PKC Inhibitors on [3H]Dopamine Uptake—To determine whether the PKC inhibitors prevented inward transport of substrate, [3H]dopamine uptake was assessed. Striatal synaptosomes were incubated with Gö6976, LY379196, and rottlerin at 37 °C for 40 min prior to the addition of [3H]dopamine to mimic the conditions in the efflux assay. Preincubation of the synaptosomes with 130 nm Gö6976, 100 nm LY379196, or 10 μm rottlerin had no effect on [3H]dopamine uptake as compared with vehicle controls (Fig. 2). Effect of LY379196 on TPA-mediated Dopamine Efflux—We have shown previously that activation of PKC with TPA mimicked the ability of amphetamine to induce dopamine efflux from rat striatal slices (9Kantor L. Gnegy M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 594-598Google Scholar, 11Cowell R.M. Kantor L. Hewlett G.H. Frey K.A. Gnegy M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 389: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). If TPA and amphetamine are using the same signaling pathway, TPA-mediated dopamine efflux should be inhibited by the selective PKCβ inhibitor, LY379196, in rat striatal slices. As shown in Fig. 3, LY379196 reduced TPA-mediated dopamine efflux from 3.3 ± 0.83-fold of base-line dopamine values to 1.3 ± 0.43-fold base-line dopamine values (p < 0.05, n = 4). PKCβI and PKCβII Are Associated with DAT in Rat Striatal Synaptosomes—We utilized the technique of co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether PKCβ was bound to DAT. DAT was immunoprecipitated using a peptide affinity-purified polyclonal antibody developed in our laboratory. The DAT immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ. To ensure that the co-immunoprecipitation was specific for DAT, we preincubated the antibody with the DAT N-terminal antigen. The data in Fig. 4 demonstrate that both PKCβI and PKCβII co-immunoprecipitated with DAT in the absence but not the presence of the peptide antigen. On the contrary, neither PKCα nor PKCγ co-immunoprecipitated with DAT. As shown in Fig. 4, all four forms of PKC were present in the lysate. To further test the apparent association, immunoprecipitation was conducted using antisera to the PKC isoforms, and the presence of DAT in the immunoprecipitates was tested with immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, DAT co-immunoprecipitated with PKCβI and PKCβII but not with PKCα or PKCγ. We have validated these results with two different PKCβII antibodies. We also detected co-immunoprecipitation of hDAT and PKCβII in hDAT-PC12 cells following immunoprecipitation with either anti-DAT or anti-PKCβII (data not shown). However, we would use caution in interpreting the relative amounts of PKCβ isozymes that immunoprecipitated with DAT. We performed all experiments with two to three different antibodies to PKCβI and PKCβII, and although the results were qualitatively similar, we found that the relative amounts of the detected isozyme could vary depending on the efficacy of the antibody for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting.Fig. 5Immunoprecipitation of striatal synaptosomes with either anti-PKCβI or anti-PKCβII but not anti-PKCγ or anti-PKCα co-immunoprecipitates DAT. Rat striatal synaptosomes were lysed in RIPAE buffer and precleared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 50 μg of protein were incubated with either anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβI, anti-PKCβII immunoprecipitates or anti-PKCγ antibody. The protein from the (IP) was eluted in sample buffer. Eluted proteins and original lysates (Ly) (20 μg of protein for lysate in left panel and 12.5 μg of protein in lysate in right panel) were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) for DAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PKCβII Potentiates Amphetamine-stimulated Dopamine Efflux—Because both PKCβI and PKCβII co-immunoprecipitated with DAT, one or both of the isozymes could be responsible for enhancing amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux. LY379196 does not discriminate between PKCβI and PKCβII. To distinguish between the two PKCβ isozymes we created stable hDAT-HEK 293 cell lines overexpressing PKCα, PKCβI, or PKCβII. As shown in Fig. 6A, hDAT-HEK 293 cells endogenously contain PKCα and PKCβI but have very little PKCβII. However, the stable cell lines contained high concentrations of their respective PKC isozymes. The cells were loaded with 15 μm dopamine for 30 min to measure dopamine efflux by superperfusion. The dopamine efflux in response to 3 μm amphetamine was similar in the hDAT-HEK 293 cells, the PKCα-hDAT-HEK 293 cells, and the PKCβI-hDAT-HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6B). However, the dopamine efflux in response to amphetamine was much greater in the PKCβII-hDAT-HEK 293 cells than in the other cell lines. The average -fold base line of amphetamine response in the PKCβII-hDAT-HEK 293 cells was 2.8 ± 0.5 (n = 7), whereas that in the other lines was maximal at 1.57 ± 0.3 (for hDAT-HEK 293 cells, n = 6), 1.47 ± 0.3 (PKCα-hDAT-HEK 293 cells, n = 7), and 1.3 ± 0.2 (for PKCβI-hDAT-HEK 293 cells, n = 7). Base-line values (in pmol of dopamine/5 min/mg of protein) in the untransfected hDAT-HEK 293 cells and the stable HEK 293 lines containing PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII were 9.4 ± 1.6, 12.8 ± 1.5, 9.4 ± 1.2, and 10.0 ± 1.3, respectively. The average concentration of dopamine present in the cells at the start of the perfusion was, in nmol/mg of protein: 1.6 ± 0.5 in hDAT-HEK 293 cells; 1.2 ± 0.3 in PKCα-hDAT-HEK 293 cells; 1.5 ± 0.3 in PKCβI-hDAT-HEK 293 cells; and 1.9 ± 0.6 in PKCβII-hDAT-HEK 293 cells (n = 6, p = 0.76, one-way analysis of variance). Similar numbers of cells were used in all assays. Therefore the increase in amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux in the PKCβII-hDAT-HEK 293 cells was not due to a significantly greater initial concentration of dopamine in the cells. To ensure that transport of amphetamine into the different cell lines was not altered by the transfection of the PKC isoforms, we measured uptake of [3H]dopamine in the four cell lines. Uptake of 25 nm [3H]dopamine was, in pmol/3 min/mg of protein: 0.16 ± 0.02 in hDAT-HEK 293 cells; 0.22 ± 0.09 in PKCα-hDAT-HEK 293 cells; 0.19 ± 0.07 in PKCβI-hDAT-HEK 293 cells; and 0.23 ± 0.1 in PKCβII-hDAT-HEK 293 cells (n = 5, p = 0.7, one-way analysis of variance). To determine whether the amount of hDAT on the surface of the four cell lines was altered by transfection of the PKC isoforms, surface biotinylation of DAT was measured. As shown in Fig. 6C, the enhancement in amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux in PKCβII-hDAT-HEK 293 cells is also not due to the presence of significantly greater levels of surface hDAT as compared with the other cell types. We report that classical PKC isozymes regulate the mechanism of action of amphetamine in eliciting outward transport of dopamine. We made the original observations that PKCβ and, more specifically, PKCβII, promotes amphetamine-induced outward transport through the dopamine transporter and that PKCβ isoforms are selectively associated with DAT. The regulation of DAT by PKC is obviously complex. We have demonstrated that brief (<3 min) incubations with TPA elicit efflux of dopamine that is blocked by cocaine but independent of extracellular Ca2+ (11Cowell R.M. Kantor L. Hewlett G.H. Frey K.A. Gnegy M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 389: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the contrary, longer incubations with TPA (>5 min) increase inward trafficking of DAT (8Zahniser N.R. Doolen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The TPA-induced internalization of DAT also involves classical PKCs; Gö6976 attenuated TPA-induced reduction of DAT-associated transport currents (4Doolen S. Zahniser N.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), an effect attributed to the enhanced endocytosis of DAT. Because TPA can activate many PKC isozymes, and there are four isotypes of classical PKC isozymes (PKCα, βI, βII, and γ), different classical PKC isozymes could be mediating these two effects. Opposing regulation of cell surface transporters by different patterns of PKC activation and different PKC isozymes has been reported. Brief activation with TPA increases activity of the Na+/HCO–3 transporter in proximal convoluted tubules, whereas longer incubations decreases inward transport (22Wang T. Chan Y.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 117: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II elicits biphasic effects on bicarbonate transport in the proximal tubule, and both effects appear to be mediated by PKC (22Wang T. Chan Y.L. J. Membr.

Na+,K+-ATPase is another transporter that is regulated biphasically by PKC. A PKCβ-dependent phosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α subunit recruits the transporter to the cell surface, whereas a PKCζ-dependent phosphorylation of the same subunit induces endocytosis of the transporter (25Budu C.E.

Inhibition of TPA-mediated dopamine efflux by the highly specific PKCβ inhibitor LY379196 strongly suggests that PKCβ is the specific isoform that is responsible for DAT-mediated efflux of dopamine. The effects of PKCα and PKCγ on amphetamine-mediated dopamine efflux were not investigated because of the lack of selective inhibitors for these isoforms. However, the co-immunoprecipitation studies and the studies with overexpression of PKCα strongly suggest that these isozymes neither bind to DAT nor affect DAT-mediated dopamine efflux. All four classical PKC isoforms are reported to exist in the dopamine cell body areas of Sprague-Dawley rats, the strain used in these studies (28Steketee J.D. Rowe L.A. Chandler L.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although the predominant form was PKCβI. This study demonstrated that both the PKCβI and PKCβII isozymes readily co-immunoprecipitated with DAT suggesting that they associate in the terminal. We do not know whether they bind directly to DAT or whether there is an intermediary protein. The receptor for activated C kinases (RACK1) has recently been demonstrated to bind to the N terminus of DAT (29Lee K.H. Kim M.Y. Kim D.H. Lee Y.S. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 1405-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PKCβII interacts specifically with RACK1, which consequently determines the localization and functional activity of PKCβII (30Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PKCα-binding protein, PICK 1 (31Staudinger J. Zhou J.M. Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to form a stable complex with the PDZ domain in the C terminus of DAT (32Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It is unclear at this time whether PKCα plays any role in the ability of PICK 1 to increase the number of plasma membrane DATs (32Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). If so, a complex of PKCα, PICK 1, and DAT may not have been retained through our immunoprecipitation protocol, or PKCα may only bind when DAT is activated. PKCα complexes with the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 upon PKC activation in C6 glioma cells and rat brain synaptosomes, and this binding correlates with the PKC-dependent redistribution of EAAC1 (33Gonzalez M.I. Bannerman P.G. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5589-5593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study suggests that PKCβ is associated with DAT even under “resting” conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed complexes between protein phosphatase 2Ac and DAT as well as the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters under basal conditions (34Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it appears that DAT and other transporters can exist in complexes in the membrane that include scaffolding and signal transduction molecules. Our experiments using hDAT-HEK 293 cells transfected with PKC isozymes suggest that the PKCβII isozyme is important for amphetamine-stimulated efflux of dopamine through DAT. Overexpression of hDAT-HEK 293 cells (PKCα or PKCβI) did not significantly alter the amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux from that of untransfected HEK 293 cells. Although one could argue that overexpression of PKCα may not have a sufficient effect because the HEK 293 cells already contained some level of PKCα, that argument would not be true for PKCβI. The HEK 293 cells had low levels of PKCβI and almost no PKCβII. Only co-transfection with PKCβII significantly increased the dopamine efflux in response to amphetamine. The mechanism by which PKCβ alters amphetamine-stimulated dopamine efflux is currently under investigation. PKCβ could be directly phosphorylating DAT and altering efflux. A PKC-dependent phosphorylation of DAT has been demonstrated at sites that appear to be the most distal N-terminal serines (6Foster J.D. Pananusorn B. Vaughan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25178-25186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that phosphorylation of the N-terminal serines in DAT is required for maximal amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux (12Khoshbouei H. Sen N. Guptaroy B. Johnson L. Lund D. Gnegy M.E. Galli A. Javitch J.A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E78Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but [3H]dopamine uptake is not affected. An alternative explanation is that PKCβ could participate in the transporter vesicle recycling or maintenance of surface expression of DAT. PKCβ increases the surface expression of both glucose transporter 1 and rodent proximal tubule Na+,K+-ATPase (25Budu C.E. Efendiev R. Cinelli A.M. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PKCβII, as opposed to PKCβI, has been demonstrated to associate with the actin cytoskeleton (35Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and therefore could be involved in DAT trafficking. We are presently examining this possibility. We and others have reported that amphetamine can activate PKC in rat striatum (36Iwata S. Hewlett G.H. Gnegy M.E. Synapse. 1997; 26: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Gnegy M.E.

Neuropharmacology. 1992; 31: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and that Ca2+ seems to be involved in this activation. The amphetamine-induced activation of PKC involves activation of phospholipase C and Na+/Ca2+ exchange (38Giambalvo C.T. Synapse. 2004; 51: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further, amphetamine can increase intracellular Ca2+ (14Gnegy M.E. Khoshbouei H. Berg K.A. Javitch J.A. Clarke W.P. Zhang M. Galli A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Kantor L. Zhang M. Guptaroy B. Park Y.H. Gnegy M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence that indicates which isoforms of PKC are activated. We demonstrated that amphetamine increases PKC activity and stimulates in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation of GAP-43 on serine-41, which is the PKC substrate site (36Iwata S. Hewlett G.H. Gnegy M.E. Synapse. 1997; 26: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Iwata S. Hewlett G.H. Ferrell S.T. Czernik A.J. Meiri K.F. Gnegy M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 1428-1434PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that GAP-43 is phosphorylated more actively by PKCβ, especially PKCβII, as compared with PKCα or PKCγ (41Sheu F.-S. Marais R.M. Parker P.J. Bazan N.G. Routtenberg A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1236-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amphetamine-stimulated increase in GAP-43 phosphorylation could be mediated by activation of PKCβII. By elucidating which PKC isoforms are involved in regulating amphetamine-mediated dopamine efflux we can better understand the mechanism by which amphetamine acts to reverse the transport of dopamine. These studies have demonstrated that PKCβII is complexed with DAT and is important in the reverse transport of dopamine through DAT.

Nitric oxide and S-nitrosothiols can be metabolized by bacteria, but only a few enzymes have been shown to be important in responses to such stresses. Glycerol-limited chemostat cultures in defined medium of Escherichia coli MG1655 were used to provide bacteria in defined physiological states before applying nitrosative stress by addition of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Exposure to 200 μm GSNO for 5 min was sufficient to elicit an adaptive response as judged by the development of NO-insensitive respiration. Transcriptome profiling experiments were used to investigate the transcriptional basis of the observed adaptation to the presence of GSNO. In aerobic cultures, only 17 genes were significantly up-regulated, including genes known to be involved in NO tolerance, particularly hmp (encoding the NO-consuming flavohemoglobin Hmp) and norV (encoding flavorubredoxin). Significantly, none of the up-regulated genes were members of the Fur regulon. Six genes involved in methionine biosynthesis or regulation were significantly up-regulated; metN, metI, and metR were shown to be important for GSNO tolerance, because mutants in these genes exhibited GSNO growth sensitivity. Furthermore, exogenous methionine abrogated the toxicity of GSNO supporting the hypothesis that GSNO nitrosates homocysteine, thereby withdrawing this intermediate from the methionine biosynthetic pathway. Anaerobically, 10 genes showed significant up-regulation, of which norV, hcp, metR, and metB were also up-regulated aerobically. The data presented here reveal new genes important for nitrosative stress tolerance and demonstrate that methionine biosynthesis is a casualty of nitrosative stress.

It is a lipophilic radical that has the ability to diffuse across biological membranes and through the cytoplasm. At high concentrations NO is viewed as a toxic molecule, capable of reacting with all major classes of biomolecules. Of particular interest is its ability to react with thiols and transition metal centers, often altering the functions of the proteins that contain such groups, including terminal oxidases and other heme proteins that bind dioxygen (1Fillebeen C. Pantopoulos K. Redox Rep. 2002; 7: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Drapier J.-C. Methods. 1997; 11: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Hidalgo E. Ding H. Demple B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide is also inhibitory to iron-sulfur centers in dehydratases such as aconitase (4Castro L.A. Robalinho R.L. Cayota A. Meneghini R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These reactions with biomolecules underpin the use of NO as a powerful weapon in the armory of mammalian cells to combat bacterial infection. Because NO is an extremely reactive molecule, it leads to the production of other reactive nitrogen species in biological systems (reviewed in Ref. 5Patel R.P. McAndrew J. Sellak H. White C.R. Jo H. Freeman B.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite, formed during the oxidative burst of macrophages by the reaction of NO with superoxide is the most highly reactive and potentially cytotoxic of all the reactive nitrogen species (6Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Nitrosation is the transfer of an NO+ group to a nucleophilic center, usually to a sulfur or nitrogen lone pair of electrons (7Hughes M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Nitrosated compounds such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which is an excellent nitrosating agent, are extremely useful laboratory tools for the study of nitrosative stress. Unsurprisingly, due to the cytotoxic effects of NO and its derivatives, bacterial cells have developed mechanisms for NO detoxification. Escherichia coli possesses two prominent NO-detoxifying activities, a nitric-oxide reductase (NorVW) and the flavohemoglobin Hmp. Transcription of the norVW-encoded flavorubredoxin and flavorubredoxin reductase that convert NO to nitrous oxide is activated by NorR, an NO-responsive regulator (8Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 9Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A second detoxification mechanism is mediated by the flavohemoglobin Hmp acting as a nitric-oxide dioxygenase or denitrosylase converting NO to the relatively innocuous nitrate ion (NO–3) (10Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14100-14105Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The flavohemoglobins, exemplified by the E. coli Hmp, have been extensively examined and reviewed (13Wu G. Wainwright L.M. Poole R.K. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2003; 47: 255-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We have elucidated a mechanism for hmp gene regulation (15Membrillo-Hernández J. Coopamah M.D. Channa A. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that involves the interaction of S-nitrosothiols with homocysteine (Hcy), a cofactor for the regulator of the methionine biosynthetic pathway, MetR. It was proposed that Hcy nitrosation leads to depletion of Hcy and enhanced MetR-mediated transcription of hmp. Other systems for detoxification of NO, or related agents of nitrosative stress, include the periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase, encoded by nrfA, which catalyzes the respiratory reduction of nitrite and nitric oxide (16Poock S.R. Leach E.R. Moir J.W.B. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23664-23669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, encoded by adhC, which metabolizes GSNO (17Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The importance of reducing oxidized methionine residues by the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, MsrA, has also been demonstrated in the defense of E. coli to peroxynitrite-mediated damage (18John G.S. Brot N. Ruan J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Weissbach H. Nathan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9901-9906Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to specific NO defense mechanisms, there are two known regulons in E. coli that are thought to respond primarily to redox stresses but which can also be activated by NO and reactive nitrogen species. These are the SoxRS and OxyR regulons, both of which mediate the expression of a number of genes involved in oxidative and nitrosative stress responses. Activation of SoxR by NO occurs through the nitrosylation of the Fe-S centers, forming mixed dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol complexes (19Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The OxyR regulon is thought to respond most strongly to the presence of hydrogen peroxide (20Demple B. Halbrook J. Nature. 1983; 304: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) as well as superoxide-generating agents and nitrosothiols (21Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although the genes regulated by SoxRS and OxyR have been postulated to play a role in NO detoxification, to date there is no evidence demonstrating their specific importance. Recently, the genome-wide response of E. coli to GSNO and acidified sodium nitrite in aerobic batch cultures has been reported (22Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRoassa R.L. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This revealed that NorR and Fur are major regulators of the nitrosative defense system under the conditions tested. In the present report, we describe a different approach, namely the use of a chemically defined medium in continuous culture to profile, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the genome-wide transcriptional responses to GSNO of E. coli. The use of chemostat cultures for microarray studies has recently been reported for the analysis of the response to changes in growth-limiting nutrients in E. coli (23Hua Q. Yang C. Oshima T. Mori H. Shimizu K. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24Boer V.M. de Winde J.H. Pronk J.T. Piper M.D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3265-3274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, microorganisms are grown under defined and controlled conditions allowing changes in gene expression to be attributed solely to the specified environmental changes and not, for example, to accompanying changes in growth rate. Here transcriptional profiling of chemostat cultures exposed to GSNO confirms the role of genes previously known to be involved in the nitrosative stress response, but also reveals genes required for methionine biosynthesis to be critical for GSNO tolerance under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Under our conditions, in a medium with adequate supplies of chelated metal ions, Fur is not involved in responses to nitrosative stress. Bacterial Strains and Growth—E. coli strain MG1655 was grown in a New Brunswick Scientific Bioflow III fermenter under continuous culture (chemostat) conditions. Cells were grown in defined media containing 54 mm glycerol as the sole and limiting source of energy and carbon (25Poole R.K. Haddock B.A. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The medium also contained 23 mm K2HPO4, 7.3 mm KH2PO4, 18.7 mm NH4Cl, 69 μm CaCl2, 15 mm K2SO4, 1 mm MgCl2 and the following trace elements in 134 μm EDTA: 31 μm FeCl3·6H2O, 6.15 μm ZnO, 570 nm CuCl2·2H2O, 340 nm CoNO3·6H2O, 1.6 μm H3BO3 (all final concentrations) in distilled water. The pH of the medium was maintained automatically at 7.0 by the addition of sterile 1 m NaOH or HCl and monitored using a Broadley James Fermprobe (F-635-B200-DH). To test for glycerol limitation, culture supernatant was subjected to an enzymatic assay as described by Garland and Randle (26Garland P.B. Randle P.J. Nature. 1962; 196: 987-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The working volume was 1 liter. The maximum specific growth rate aerobically (determined in batch cultures) in this defined medium was 0.6 h–1, whereas anaerobically it was about 0.3 h–1. Despite these inevitable differences, we elected to maintain a constant dilution rate, D, of 0.2 h–1 for both aerobic and anaerobic conditions to eliminate any growth rate-dependent changes in gene expression. For aerobic growth, the air-flow rate was 1 liter min–1, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained at 40% air saturation by measuring oxygen dissolved in the culture using a Broadley James D140 OxyProbe® electrode and automated adjustment of stirring rate. To establish anaerobic growth, nitrogen was sparged through the chemostat medium prior to inoculation and throughout the course of the experiment at a rate of 0.2 liter min–1. No dissolved oxygen was detectable using the OxyProbe. Sodium fumarate was added to anaerobic medium at a final concentration of 50 mm to act as a terminal electron acceptor (27Haddock B.A. Downie J.A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Small anaerobic cultures were grown in glass universal bottles filled to the brim and closed with metal screw caps with rubber liners. Where indicated, chloramphenicol was added before harvest to a final concentration of 200 μg ml–1 and GSNO to a final concentration of 200 μm. GSNO Chemostat Experiments and RNA Isolation—Cells were grown as above to steady state, defined as constant optical density (A600), after ∼5 culture volumes had passed through the vessel. At steady state, GSNO (synthesized according to the method of Hart (28Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar)) was added to the chemostat culture and simultaneously to the nutrient feed at a final concentration of 200 μm unless otherwise stated. Samples were taken immediately prior to the addition of GSNO and after a period of 5-min exposure to GSNO for subsequent analysis using microarrays. Cells were harvested directly into RNA Protect (Qiagen) to stabilize RNA, and total RNA was purified using Qiagen's RNeasy Mini kit as recommended by the suppliers. The integrity of the RNA was determined by electrophoresis on a 1.25% agarose gel run in 1 × MOPS, and the concentration and purity of the nucleic acid were measured at 260 and 280 nm on a Beckman DU® 650 spectrophotometer (29Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Preparation of Labeled cDNA and Hybridization—Equal quantities of RNA from control and GSNO-supplemented cultures were labeled using nucleotide analogues of dCTP containing either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes. For each microarray slide, one sample was labeled with Cy3-dCTP while the other incorporated Cy5-dCTP. Dye-swap experiments were performed for each pair to compensate for different efficiencies of incorporation of the labeled nucleotides. The slides used were E. coli K12 PAN arrays purchased from MWG Biotech. These slides contain 4,288 gene-specific oligonucleotide probes representing the complete E. coli (K12) genome. cDNA synthesis was carried out using 12 μg of RNA, primed with 9 μg of pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences). Reaction mixes (20 μl) containing 0.5 mm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, 0.2 mm dCTP, and 0.11 mm Cy3/Cy5-dCTP were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 200 units of Superscript II RNase-H Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Following synthesis, cDNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) to remove unincorporated dNTPs, fluorescent dyes, and primers. Equal volumes of cDNA were combined and evaporated for ∼45 min in a Thermo Savant SPD121P Speed Vac®. For hybridization to the microarray slides, cDNA was resuspended in an appropriate volume of salt-based hybridization buffer (provided by MWG). Prior to addition to the slides, cDNA samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Slides were placed in MWG hybridization chambers and incubated for 16–24 h in a shaking water bath at 42 °C. Washing and Scanning of Slides—Following incubation, the slides were washed in decreasing salt concentrations, as recommended by MWG Biotech, ranging from 2 × SSC, including 1% SDS, to 0.5 × SSC at 37 °C, with gentle agitation. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min and subsequently scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner. Data Analysis—The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from BioDiscovery, Inc. (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5). The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalized using the LOWESS method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values. The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence ratios were calculated from the normalized values. Biological experiments, i.e. chemostat growths, were carried out twice, and dye-swap analysis was performed on each experiment providing four technical repeats, two from each biological experiment. Data from the independent experiments were combined. Genes differentially regulated ≥2-fold and displaying a p value of ≤0.05 (using t test) were defined as being statistically, differentially transcribed. The GEO accession numbers are GSE2095 (aerobic data) and GSE2129 (anaerobic data) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/. Real Time-PCR—RNA was extracted as described above. cDNA synthesis was carried out using 4 μg of starting material, primed with 9 μg of pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences). Reaction mixes (20 μl) containing 0.5 mm dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP were incubated for 2 h at 42 °C with 200 units of Superscript II RNase-H Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Following synthesis, cDNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) to remove unincorporated dNTPs and primers. Gene-specific primers were designed to amplify 50–150 nucleotide fragments of target genes using PRIMER3 software (30Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Krawetz S. Misener S. Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 365-386Google Scholar). Each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl on a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). Each well contained 50% SYBR® green PCR Mastermix (AB Applied Biosystems), 12.5 pmol of each of the two primers, and 5 μl of cDNA sample. PCR amplification was carried out in an ABI 7700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystems) with the following thermal cycling conditions: 50 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 1 min. The data were analyzed using the Sequence Detector System software (PE Applied Biosystems). A standard curve was established using genomic DNA for each gene studied to confirm that the primers amplified at the same rate and to validate the experiment. The relative levels of expression of genes of interest, compared with untreated controls, were calculated following the protocol for the Standard Curve Method in the User Bulletin #2 (ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, Subject: Relative Quantification of Gene Expression) supplied by Applied Biosystems. No-template reactions were included as negative controls. Disc Diffusion Assays—E. coli strain MG1655, and isogenic mutant cultures, were grown to stationary phase in LB medium. Cells (∼106) were spread onto a nutrient agar plate, and a 6-mm filter disc, saturated with 100 mm GSNO, was placed onto the agar. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C prior to zones of inhibition being measured. Viability Studies—Overnight cultures of E. coli MG1655 cells were inoculated at 1% into defined medium and grown to a culture A600 of 0.3. The culture was split and exposed to separate concentrations of methionine (0, 3, and 10 mm) for 15 min. These cultures were then subsequently exposed to GSNO at 0.3, 1, or 3 mm (final concentrations) for 45 min. Cultures were serially diluted, and a portion (10 μl) of each dilution was spotted onto nutrient agar plates and incubated overnight. The resulting colonies were counted to calculate culture viability. Measurements of Aerobic Respiration and Anoxic Fumarate Reductase Activity—Respiration rates of washed cell suspensions were determined using a Clarke-type O2 electrode as described before (12Mills C.E. Sedellnikova S. Søballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fumarate reductase activity was measured essentially as described in a previous study (31Cecchini G. Ackrell B. Deshler J. Gunsalus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which fumarate-dependent oxidation of dithionite-reduced benzyl viologen was measured at 550 nm. Fumarate reductase assays were conducted on cell-free extracts prepared by ultrasonic disintegration (2 × 30 s, 15-μm amplitude) of anaerobically grown cells, followed by centrifugation (10 min, 13,000 rpm in a Sigma 1–13 microcentrifuge) to remove unbroken cells. In fumarate reductase assays where the effects of added NO were investigated, the reaction was initiated by adding fumarate. Rapid Adaptation of E. coli in Response to GSNO—In a chemostat, all culture conditions are controlled and measured. Critically, growth rate is controlled by dilution rate (here 0.2 h–1), so that transient changes in metabolism induced by a stressing reagent are not reflected in growth rate, which is itself an important determinant of gene expression. In the present aerobic experiments, pH was maintained at 7.0, oxygen tension at 40% of air saturation, and glycerol was the sole growth-limiting nutrient. Lower glycerol concentrations in the medium feed gave proportionately lower yields, and all glycerol was consumed (results not shown). Control of these parameters eliminates possible changes in metal ion, especially iron, solubility, and other variables that might arise as a function of increasing population density, nutrient deprivation, and changing oxygen tension as batch cultures grow. To ensure a step-change in GSNO concentration at a desired time, and to maintain GSNO concentrations at this level throughout the experiment, the nitrosating agent was added not only to the growth vessel but also simultaneously to the reservoir of growth medium. A concentration of 200 μm was chosen from previous studies, which determined the maximal expression of hmp in response to varying concentrations of GSNO. 2M. Coopamah and R. K. Poole, unpublished data. To assess the impact of nitrosative stress on respiratory metabolism of chemostat-grown E. coli cells and, in particular, to determine whether short (5 min) exposure to GSNO was sufficient to elicit an adaptive response, O2 uptake rates of cells harvested from the chemostat were measured (Table I). Expressed with respect to total cell protein, respiration rates were diminished in GSNO-treated cultures. With endogenous respirable substrates (i.e. measured in washed cell suspensions from glycerol-limited chemostats, not further supplemented with an energy source), respiration rates in GSNO-treated cells were about one-half of control values. Addition of glucose (final concentration, 100 μm) to the polarographic chamber markedly stimulated respiration rates for the treated and untreated cultures (Table I). However, although glycerol-supported respiration was increased for GSNO-treated bacteria, it did not reach the levels achieved with the untreated samples (Table I).Table IOxygen consumption rates of cells from control and GSNO-treated chemostat cells and resistance to NOSubstrate respiredControl chemostat cellsGSNO-treated cellsRespiration rateInhibition of respiration by NORespiration rateInhibition of respiration by NO45 μm NO90 μm NO45 μm NO90 μm NOnmol O2/min/mgminnmol O2/min/mgminEndogenous33.6 (± 11)NDaND, not determined.ND15.9 (± 4.1)NDNDGlucose82.3 (± 12)0.67 (± 0.06)5.0 (± 0.9)76.7 (± 9.5)0 (± 0)2.1 (± 1)Glycerol87.6 (± 25)1.1 (± 0.3)6.4 (± 0.5)32.5 (± 4.1)0 (± 0)0.13 (± 0.2)a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab When NO solutions were added to respiring bacterial suspensions, a transient inhibition of O2 uptake was observed. The period of cessation of O2 uptake was dependent on both the NO concentration and the prevailing O2 tension in the chamber, as described before (32Stevanin T.M. Ionnidis N. Mills C.E. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35868-35875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), with inhibition increasing at lower O2 tensions (results not shown). The respiratory response of chemostat grown E. coli MG1655 to NO was investigated by adding NO, to a final concentration of 45 μm, when the oxygen tension had reached 90 μm, and then making a second addition of NO, to a final concentration of 90 μm, when the O2 tension reached 30 μm (Table I). Bacteria from control chemostats exhibited a NO dose-dependent inhibition with either respirable substrate (glucose or glycerol), increasing to 5- to 6-min duration at 90 μm NO. In contrast, cells from GSNO-treated chemostats were completely insensitive to 45 μm NO and exhibited only brief periods of inhibition when exposed to 90 μm NO. This indicates that exposure to GSNO for 5 min is sufficient to elicit an adaptive response. Similar experiments were attempted to demonstrate the sensitivity to nitrosative stress of fumarate reductase, which will be the predominant terminal reductase (27Haddock B.A. Downie J.A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) under these anoxic growth conditions. However, the standard assay employing fumarate-dependent benzyl viologen oxidation was unsuitable, because addition of solutions of NO gas to the reaction resulted in immediate, fumarate-independent viologen oxidation. This may result from rapid metabolism of the added NO accompanied by enzymic consumption (by flavorubredoxin or flavohemoglobin) of reductant in the extract. We demonstrated, however, the inactivation of fumarate reductase by GSNO. Fumarate reductase activity decreased from control values (mean of two determinations, 15 μmol min–1 (mg protein)–1) by 37 and 57% after 5 and 30 min, respectively, exposure to 200 μm GSNO. However, when chloramphenicol was added immediately prior to GSNO, the inactivation of fumarate reductase was much greater, namely 66 and 79% after 5 and 30 min, respectively, exposure to 200 μm GSNO. These data suggest that exposure to GSNO for 5 min is also sufficient to elicit an adaptive response and partial reductase protection under anoxic conditions. Global Transcriptional Responses to GSNO in an Aerobic Chemostat Culture—The data described above suggested that E. coli is able to mount an adaptive response within 5 min of being exposed to 200 μm GSNO. To determine how the transcriptome changes to mediate this rapid adaptation, total RNA was isolated from aerobic chemostat cultures before the addition of GSNO and 5 min after addition of the stress reagent. The corresponding fluorescently labeled cDNAs were synthesized and were used to probe arrays. The entire chemostat run was replicated and, in each case, two arrays were prepared in which the sample-dye pairings were reversed. Under these conditions, a surprisingly small set of genes exhibited increased transcript levels within 5 min of GSNO treatment. It should be noted that the high cell densities achieved when growth is limited only by 54 mm glycerol (A600 3.8) may mitigate against more dramatic transcriptional changes, but 200 μm GSNO was sufficient to induce an adaptive respiratory response (see above) and increasing the GSNO concentration to 1 mm elicited a response similar to that observed with 200 μm GSNO (data not shown). 17 genes (0.5% of the total) were significantly up-regulated (p value of < 0.05) in response to GSNO, whereas four genes (p value of <0.05) were down-regulated (Table II). The 17 genes whose transcripts showed >2-fold accumulation at a p value of <0.05 are listed in Table III. As expected from previous studies, both norV and hmp transcription were up-regulated in response to GSNO (9Hutching"
https://openalex.org/W2127344145,"Transforming growth factor β type II receptor (TβRII) is a tumor suppressor gene that can be transcriptionally silenced by histone deacetylases (HDACs) in cancer cells. In this report, we demonstrated the mechanism by which trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC, induces the expression of TβRII in human pancreatic cancer cell lines by modulating the transcriptional components that bind a specific DNA region of the TβRII promoter. This region of the TβRII promoter possesses Sp1 and NF-Y binding sites in close proximity (located at –102 and –83, respectively). Treatment of cells with TSA activates the TβRII promoter in a time-dependent manner through the recruitment of p300 and PCAF into a Sp1·NF-Y·HDAC complex that binds this DNA element. The recruitment of p300 and PCAF into the complex is associated with a concomitant acetylation of Sp1 and an overall decrease in the amount of HDAC associated with the complex. Transient overexpression of p300 or PCAF potentiated TSA-induced TβRII promoter activity. The effect of PCAF was dependent on its histone acetyltransferase activity, whereas that of p300 was independent. Stable transfection of PCAF caused an increase in TβRII mRNA expression, the association of PCAF with TβRII promoter, and the acetylation of Sp1. Taken together, these results showed that TSA treatment of pancreatic cancer cells leads to transcriptional activation of the TβRII promoter through modulation of the components of a Sp1·NF-Y·p300·PCAF·HDAC-1 multiprotein complex.

Wrana J.L. Lopez-Casillas F. Massague J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). TGF-β mediates its biological effects through cell surface receptors known as TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). Its intracellular signaling is initiated upon the selective binding of the active cytokine to the TβRII homodimer. TβRII is a ubiquitously expressed and constitutively active serine/threonine kinase. Ligand binding to TβRII induces the assembly of a heterotetrameric complex consisting of TβRI and TβRII. Once the receptor complex is formed, TβRII phosphorylates and thereby activates the TβRI serine/threonine kinase. Activation of TβRI propagates downstream signaling via Smad family proteins. TβRI directly interacts with and phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3. These Smads bind Smad4 and then result in the translocation of this complex to the nucleus and modulate TGF-β-responsive gene expression (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar, 3Shi Y. Massague J.

Loss of negative growth regulation by TGF-β affords cells a selective growth advantage associated with decreased dependence of exogenous growth factor and increased tumorigenicity. Frequently, inhibition of TGF-β signaling occurs by either abolition of the function of a common mediator, Smad4, or interference with TβRII function (5Goggins M. Shekher M. Turnacioglu K. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5329-5332PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kern S.E. Med. Clin. N. Am. 2000; 84 (xi): 691-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Smad4 and TβRII are tumor suppressor genes (5Goggins M. Shekher M. Turnacioglu K. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5329-5332PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kern S.E. Med. Clin. N.

It was reported that about 50% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas express a low or undetectable level of TβRII, although they have a normal TβRII gene and downstream signaling intermediates (7Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Mohiuddin M. Swiderski C. Lee E. Gower Jr., W.R. Salhab K.F. McGrath P. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that the down-regulation of TβRII in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was most often caused by transcriptional repression but not by a mutation of the TβRII gene (8Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Swiderski C. Harp C. Lee E.Y. McGrath P. Mohiuddin M. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 22: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The decrease of expression of TβRII in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells due to transcriptional repression contributes to a loss in growth control (9Freeman J.W. DeArmond D. Lake M. Huang W. Venkatasubbarao K. Zhao S. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and resistance to apoptosis (10Ahmed M.M. Alcock R.A. Chendil D. Dey S. Das A.

Restoration of expression of TβRII in MIA PaCa-2 cells results in increased sensitivity to irradiation-induced apoptosis (10Ahmed M.M. Alcock R.A. Chendil D. Dey S. Das A. Venkatasubbarao K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2234-2246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), consistent with TβRII being a tumor suppressor in these cells. The TβRII promoter has been partially characterized. It lacks a distinct TATA box near the transcription initiation site. There are four major regulatory elements in TβRII promoter: two positive regulatory elements (PRE-1 and PRE-2; located at –219 to –172 and +1 to +50), a negative regulatory element (NRE2; located at –100 to –67), and a core promoter (–47 to –1) (11Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, TβRII promoter contains many transcription factor binding sites, such as those of Sp1, NF-Y, AP1, CREB, and ERT (12Chang J. Lee C. Hahm K.B. Yi Y. Choi S.G. Kim S.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Li C. Zhu N.L. Tan R.C. Ballard P.L. Derynck R. Minoo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38399-38408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). There are two consensus Sp1 binding sites, one in the core promoter (located at –25), and the other upstream of the NRE2 (located at –147). Recently, two novel regulatory sites at position –102 and –59 have been identified that bind the Sp family of proteins (14Jennings R. Alsarraj M. Wright K.L. Munoz-Antonia T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6899-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The NF-Y transcription factor binds to an inverted CCAAT box in NRE2 of TβRII promoter at position –83, which is in close proximity to the novel Sp1 site at position –102 (15Kelly D. Kim S.J. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21115-21124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Regulation of specific gene expression is achieved largely by controlling production of transcription factors responsible for the expression of target genes, alteration of the activity of transcription factor through post-translational modification, and localized remodeling of chromatin structures. Recently, histone acetylation and deacetylation have attracted tremendous attention. Acetylation of histone proteins, particularly H3 and H4, is thought to lead to relaxed chromatin structure and, therefore, to an enhanced rate of transcription. There are two classes of enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferase (HATs), involved in the regulation of the acetylation state of histones (16de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar). Several transcriptional co-activators with intrinsic acetyl-transferase activity have been identified, including PCAF, p300/CREB-binding protein, GCN5, TAFII250, ACTR, and SRC-1. Among them, p300/CREB-binding protein and PCAF/GCN5 are the best-studied co-activators (17Marmorstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that these activators are brought to target gene promoters through interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, where they may function 1) as a bridge to connect sequence-specific transcription factors to the transcription apparatus, 2) as a protein scaffold for the assembly of multicomponent complexes that confer transcriptional activation, and 3) as an acetylase targeting chromatin and/or as transcription factors to facilitate a transcriptional response (18Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work, we showed that treatment of MIA PaCa-2 cells with a HDAC inhibitor, TSA, strongly induces TβRII expression. A specific Sp1 site (Sp1C, located at –102 bp relative to transcription start site) and an adjacent NF-Y site (–83 bp) are required for TSA-mediated activation of the TβRII gene (20Zhao S. Venkatasubbarao K. Li S. Freeman J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar, 21Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.B. Sausville E.A. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Lee B.I. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5168-5174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the mechanisms by which an HDAC inhibitor causes activation of the TβRII promoter through modulation of components that bind to the Sp1C/NF-Y sites. In this study, we demonstrate that TSA treatment activates the TβRII promoter and leads to the acetylation of Sp1 protein in a time-dependent manner. Overexpression of p300 or PCAF potentiates TSA-induced TβRII promoter activity. The effect of PCAF is dependent on its HAT activity, whereas that of p300 is independent. Moreover, PCAF can acetylate Sp1 in vivo. Taken together, these results show that the modulation of the Sp1·NF-Y·p300·PCAF·HDAC-1 multiprotein complex plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional activation of the TβRII promoter through the Sp1C site by TSA. Cells and Reagents—Human pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3, PANC-1, CFPAC-1, and MIA PaCa-2 were procured from American Type Culture Collection. The cell line UK Pan-1 was established previously in our laboratory (22Fralix K.D. Ahmed M.M. Mattingly C. Swiderski C. McGrath P.C. Venkatasubbarao K. Kamada N. Mohiuddin M. Strodel W.E. Freeman J.W. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2010-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The immortalized pancreatic epithelial cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Michel Ouellett (University of Nebraska). All the cell lines were cultured in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. TSA (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Plasmids and Antibodies—The p300 cDNA-expressing construct (p300-WT) and its acetylase-defective mutant (p300 ΔHAT) were described previously (23Ammanamanchi S. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32620-32625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PCAF cDNA-expressing vector (PCAF-WT) and its acetylase-defective mutant (PCAF ΔHAT) were kindly provided by Chao-Zhong Song (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The antibodies against Sp1, p300, NF-Y, and pan-acetyl were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibodies against PCAF and HDAC-1 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). HDAC Activity Assay—The HDAC enzymatic activity was determined using a histone deacetylase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with [3H]acetyl histone H4 peptide in the HDAC assay buffer for 24 h. The released [3H]acetate was extracted with 600 μl of ethyl acetate and separated by centrifugation, and then 200-μl aliquots of the ethyl acetate phase were measured in duplicates for radioactivity by a scintillation counter. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Pancreatic cancer cell lines were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well the day before transfection. Transfection was performed by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The DNA mixture containing 0.5 μg of RII promoter-luciferase construct; 0.5 μg of p300-WT, p300 ΔHAT, PCAF-WT, or PCAF ΔHAT; 100 ng of Sp1 cDNA; and the relative empty vector were adjusted to 1.1 μg of DNA per well. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TSA or vehicle alone at the indicated time points. The TβRII promoter activities were assayed by luminometer and dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized against the protein concentration or cytomegalovirus-Renilla luciferase activity. All experiments were performed at least three times. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 100 μg of nuclear extract from MIA PaCa-2 cells with 0.5 μg of appropriate immunoprecipitation antibody in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Protein A-agarose beads (25 μl) were used to precipitate the associated protein. Samples were then separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blotting using indicated antibodies. DNA Affinity Purification Assays (DAPAs)—DAPA was carried out as described by Walker et al. (24Walker G.E. Wilson E.M. Powell D. Oh Y. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3817-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of biotin-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was incubated with 100 μg of nuclear extracts from untreated or TSA-treated cells at the indicated time points in DAPA buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25% Triton X-100).

Cells (2 × 107) were treated with or without 100 ng/ml TSA for 24 h. Formaldehyde was added to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 1%, and after incubation at room temperature for 15 min, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 10 min. Lysates were sonicated on ice to break the chromatin DNA to an average length of about 500–600 bp and pre-cleaned with protein A-agarose. The chromatin·protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-PCAF, -p300, and -Sp1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Cross-linking of protein·DNA complexes was reversed at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA was extracted three times with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and subjected to PCR amplification using specific TβRII promoter primers: forward primer, 5′-GTAAATACTTGGAGCGGGAAC-3′ (–182/–161); and reverse primer, 5′-ACTCACTCAACTTCAACTCAGA-3′ (+54/+33). Stable Transfection—MIA PaCa-2 cells were transfected with a vector that expresses PCAF cDNA or PCAF ΔHAT or with an empty vector without the PCAF insert by using commercially available FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were cultured further and selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. Individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated by ring cloning after drug selection, established as individual clones, and used for additional analysis. mRNA Expression of TβRII—RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA as described previously. PCR was performed using the following specific RII primers: forward primer, 5′-CAGAAATCCTGCATGAGCAA-3′ (+212/+231); and reverse primer, 5′-GCTGATGCCTGTCACTTGAA-3′ (+516/+535). Expression levels of β-actin were used as an internal loading control. The PCR products were run in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. In Vivo Sodium [3H]Acetate Labeling and Immunoprecipitation Experiments—[3H]Acetate labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Hung et al. (26Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. MIA PaCa-2 cells stably transfected with expression vector for PCAF-WT, PCAF ΔHAT defective mutant, or empty vector were plated on 10-cm plates. At 70% confluence, 1 mCi/ml sodium [3H]acetate (4.1 Ci/mmol; ICN) and 100 ng/ml TSA were added to the medium and incubated for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with Sp1 antibodies. The immunoprecipitated samples were captured with 30 μl of 50% slurry of protein A-agarose and washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The beads were resuspended in scintillation fluid and counted for radioactivity. Expression and Activity of HDAC in Pancreatic Epithelial Cells and Pancreatic Cancer Cell Lines—HDACs are known to contribute to transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes and are reported to be overexpressed in cancer cells including pancreatic cancer (27Blasco F. Penuelas S. Cascallo M. Hernandez J.L. Alemany C. Masa M. Calbo J. Soler M. Nicolas M. Perez-Torras S. Gomez A. Tarrason G. Noe V. Mazo A. Ciudad C.J. Piulats J. Oncology (Basel). 2004; 67: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we showed that an immortalized pancreatic epithelial cell line expressed lower levels of HDAC 1 protein compared with five pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). Expression levels of a second protein, c-Jun/AP1, were shown to indicate that pancreatic cancer cells do not show a global increase of expression of nuclear proteins when compared with normal pancreatic epithelial cells (Fig. 1A). As expected, the greater levels of HDAC expression were also related to an overall increase in the level of HDAC activity (Fig. 1B). We reported previously that the TβRII gene is transcriptionally silenced in MIA PaCa-2 cells, at least in part, by a mechanism involving HDAC (20Zhao S. Venkatasubbarao K. Li S. Freeman J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar). We further found that treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines with the HDAC inhibitor TSA leads to a transcriptional activation of the TβRII promoter and an increased expression of the TβRII receptor (20Zhao S. Venkatasubbarao K. Li S. Freeman J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the pancreatic cancer cell lines with TSA caused an increase in TβRII promoter activity of all five pancreatic cancer cell lines, indicating that the increase in promoter activity by TSA was not restricted to a single pancreatic cancer cell line (Fig. 2).Fig. 2TSA activates TβRII promoter activity in pancreatic cancer cells. Cells were transiently transfected with TβRII promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and treated with 100 ng/ml TSA or vehicle control for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured at 48 h after transfection and normalized by cytomegalovirus-Renilla luciferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results support our previous finding that HDACs can regulate the expression of the TβRII gene (20Zhao S. Venkatasubbarao K. Li S. Freeman J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar). In that report, we showed that a specific Sp1 site located at –102 is required for TSA responsiveness. Moreover, we (20Zhao S. Venkatasubbarao K. Li S. Freeman J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar) and others (21Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.B.

In this study, we evaluated the mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors modulated the components of the transcriptional complex that binds to this region of the TβRII promoter. MIA PaCa-2 cells were primarily used as a model to examine this mechanism because they appear to show severe repression of TβRII gene expression. TSA Alters the Sp1·NF-Y Multiprotein Complexes—The Sp1 and NF-Y binding sites within the NRE2 region are reported to play key roles in the TSA activation of TβRII promoter (20Zhao S. Venkatasubbarao K. Li S. Freeman J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2624-2630PubMed Google Scholar, 21Park S.H. Lee S.R. Kim B.C. Cho E.A. Patel S.P. Kang H.B. Sausville E.A. Nakanishi O. Trepel J.B. Lee B.I. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5168-5174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We surmised that treatment with TSA would cause changes within the transcriptional complexes that bind to this region. Therefore, we determined whether the amount of Sp1, NF-Y, and other potential transcriptional regulators was changed in MIA PaCa-2 cells after TSA treatment. The expression levels of PCAF and p300, which have intrinsic HAT activity, and HDAC-1 were determined because these factors may be involved in the effect of increasing TβRII promoter activity by TSA. Immunoblotting experiments with nuclear extracts from MIA PaCa-2 cells showed that the relative amounts of Sp1, NF-Y, p300, PCAF, and HDAC-1 were unchanged after TSA treatment (Fig. 3A, N/E). However, it is possible that TSA might induce posttranslational modifications or increase the recruitment of transcriptional components to the specific site, making the transcriptional complex more efficient in its transcriptional activation. Therefore, we next investigated whether the TSA-induced TβRII promoter activity is dependent on the modulation of multiprotein complexes. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to confirm the association of proteins that might likely form complexes with Sp1 and NF-Y. Nuclear extracts isolated from MIA PaCa-2 cells with or without TSA treatment were immunoprecipitated with Sp1 and NF-Y antibodies, respectively. The results show that Sp1 and NF-Y were present in the same complex (Fig. 3A). We also determined whether HDAC or PCAF and p300, two known cofactors with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, formed complexes with Sp1 and NF-Y. These studies demonstrate that both Sp1 and NF-Y were able to associate with p300, PCAF, and HDAC-1 (Fig. 3A). After treatment of cells with TSA, the association of PCAF with either Sp1 or NF-Y complex was increased. p300 was only faintly detected by these immunoprecipitation assays but also appeared to show some increase in association with Sp1 and NF-Y (Fig. 3A). In contrast to PCAF and p300, HDAC-1 appeared to show a slight decrease in association with Sp1 or NF-Y after TSA treatment (Fig. 3A). Thus, our results suggested that changes in the composition of multiprotein complexes occurred during the TSA-induced TβRII promoter activation. The immunoprecipitation analysis reflects only changes in association of these various transcriptional components within the total pool of nuclear proteins. Therefore, we next sought to determine whether the transcriptional components that bind to the Sp1C/NF-Y site of the TβRII promoter were also changed after treatment with TSA. To assess this possibility, DAPAs were performed with biotin-end-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences from –112 to –66 of the TβRII promoter (containing the Sp1C site and the adjacent CCAAT box to which NF-Y binds). The results showed that recruitment of p300 and PCAF to the transcription complex was increased after treatment with TSA and reached a peak after 12 h of treatment (Fig. 3B). Conversely, TSA treatment of cells caused a decrease of HDAC-1 binding, which was apparent at 12 h and decreased further at 24 h (Fig. 3B). Therefore, p300 and PCAF were recruited to the TβRII promoter in response to treatment with TSA in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the level of HDAC associated with the complex decreased in concordance with the increase in promoter activity. Next we determined whether the recruitment of PCAF and p300 could also explain the increase in TβRII promoter activity induced by TSA in other pancreatic cell lines. We examined two additional cell lines, UK Pan-1 and BxPC3, by DAPA analysis and found results similar to those seen for MIA PaCa-2. We show a representative result for DAPA analysis of UK Pan-1 in Fig. 3C. Thus, TSA induced similar changes in the transcriptional complex that activates TβRII promoter in different pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we performed a ChIP assay to examine whether TSA, under in vivo binding conditions, modulated the complex formation of p300, PCAF, and Sp1 to the TβRII promoter. In agreement with the results of DAPA and co-immunoprecipitation, p300 and PCAF binding to the TβRII promoter was greatly enhanced by TSA, whereas, Sp1 binding was not changed (Fig. 3D). Role of the Sp1C Site and NF-Y Site in TSA-induced Activation of the TβRII Promoter—The role of the Sp1C and NF-Y sites required for TSA-mediated activation of the TβRII promoter in multiprotein complex formation was next investigated by DAPA. These assays used biotin-end-labeled wild-type oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences from –112 to –65 of the TβRII promoter containing the Sp1C and NF-Y binding sites (Sp1C/NF-Y) with the Sp1C site mutated (Sp1C mut/NF-Y) or with the NF-Y binding site mutated (Sp1C/NF-Ymut). The results showed that when the Sp1C site was mutated, the binding of p300, PCAF, or HDAC was greatly diminished compared with that with wild-type oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). This result suggested that the Sp1C site is required for the formation of Sp1·HDAC-1·p300·PCAF multiprotein complex. Surprisingly, the binding of Sp1 to the Sp1C mut/NF-Y was not decreased but increased (Fig. 4A). To elucidate the influence of Sp1"

The functions of PGE2 in the target cells are mediated by four different G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (23Narumiya S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin.

The signal of EP1 increases intracellular Ca2+ and activates protein kinase C. EP2 and EP4 activate Gs, which stimulates cAMP generation, followed by the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), in the target cells. Conversely, EP3 acts via Gi to inhibit cAMP generation. Among these PGE2 receptor subtypes, EP4 mainly mediates PGE2-induced RANKL expression in osteoblasts (21Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M.

In addition, PGE2 synergistically stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow macrophages into osteoclasts induced by RANKL and M-CSF (26Tintut Y. Parhami F. Tsingotjidou A. Tetradis S. Territo M.

Thus, PGE2 stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption through the following two different pathways: the induction of RANKL expression in osteoblasts, and the direct enhancement of RANKL-induced differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells into osteoclasts.

The ligand-dependent interaction of TRAFs with RANK induces activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (30Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4727) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB and MAPKs in osteoclast precursors is believed to be involved in osteoclast differentiation. Recent studies (31Kobayashi N. Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) have revealed that TRAF6-mediated signals are particularly important for RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and function. TRAF6 knock-out mice exhibit severe osteopetrosis with defects in bone resorption due to the impaired osteoclast differentiation and function (32Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.-C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S.

Inoue J. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In contrast to RANK, TNF receptors interact with TRAF2 but not with TRAF6 in their signaling pathway (34Dempsey P.W. Doyle S.E. He J.Q. Cheng G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) was first identified as a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP-KKK) activated by TGF-β family ligands (35Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 27: 2008-2011Crossref Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Recent studies (36Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z.

Biol. 2002; 22: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) have shown that TAK1, which forms a complex with the TAK1-binding protein 1 and 2 (TAB1/2), functions as an adaptor molecule in the interaction between TRAF6 and downstream molecules such as NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK in signaling cascades induced by IL-1, LPS, and RANKL. Endogenous TAK1 is activated in response to RANKL stimulation, and a dominant-negative form of TAK1 inhibits the RANK-induced activation of NF-κB in RAW264.7 cells (38Mizukami J. Takaesu G. Akatsuka H. Sakurai H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Sakurai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TAK1 is also involved in TRAF2-mediated signaling (39Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These results suggest that TAK1 is involved in the RANK- and TNF receptor-induced signaling pathways and may regulate the MAPK and NF-κB pathways activated by the interaction of RANKL-RANK or TNFα-TNF receptors. In the present study, we explored the mechanism of PGE2 action on the osteoclastic differentiation of precursor cells. The stimulatory effect of PGE2 on the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of the precursor cells was mediated through EP2 and EP4. TAK1 acted as an adaptor molecule linking PKA-induced signals, and RANKL and TNFα induced such signals in osteoclast precursors. Furthermore, TAK1 is involved in the synergistic effect of cAMP/PKA signals on TNF receptor- and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced signaling pathways. The cAMP/PKA signal may enhance bone resorption induced by RANKL and TNFα through TAK1 in osteoclast precursors. Antibodies and Chemicals—Human recombinant RANKL was purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, UK), and mouse TNFα was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human M-CSF (Leukoprol) was obtained from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). PGE2 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Purified LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) was from Sigma. Elcatonin, a synthetic analogue of eel calcitonin (CT), was kindly provided by Asahi Kasei (Tokyo, Japan). Forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Polyclonal antibodies against p38 MAPK, phosphorylated p38 MAPK, ERK, phosphorylated ERK, JNK, phosphorylated JNK, phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrates, and IκBα were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against TAK1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluo-4 AM, Fura Red AM, and Pluronic F127 were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene OR). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Plasmids and cDNA Cloning—Mouse TAK1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number D76446) was amplified by RT-PCR from cDNA of RAW264.7 cells using high fidelity Taq polymerase (Pyrobest, Takara Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and TAK1-specific primers (forward primer 5′-gATATCCTGTCGACAGCCTCCGC and reverse primer 5′-AACGTAACGGGCCCAGAGAA). The PCR product was verified to be TAK1 cDNA by DNA sequencing. The TAK1 cDNA fragment was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pc DNA3.1/His, a mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The mutant TAK1, Ser412 → Ala TAK1, was generated by PCR-directed site-specific mutagenesis. Coding regions of all plasmids were sequenced in both directions prior to the transfection. Cell Culture and Transfection—RAW264.7 cells were obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) (RCB0535). RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) in 100-mm dishes. The RAW264.7 cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids (10 μg) by TransFast transfection reagents (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of cultivation, 1 mg/ml of G418 was added to the medium, and the medium was replaced 2–3 times during a 2-week period. Clonal lines were prepared from the drug-resistant cultures. To evaluate clones expressing the TAK1 transgenes, Western blotting was performed on several cell lines. We obtained three different lines in each transfectant. Cultures of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages and RAW264.7 Cells—Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMφ) were prepared as osteoclast precursors from 5- to 8-week-old male ddY mice (Shizuoka Laboratories Animal Center, Shizuoka, Japan). All procedures for animal care were approved by the Animal Management Committee of Matsumoto Dental University. Bone marrow cells obtained from mouse tibia were suspended in α-MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS in 60-mm diameter dishes for 16 h in the presence of M-CSF (50 ng/ml). Then nonadherent cells were harvested and further cultured for 2 days with M-CSF (50 ng/ml). The adherent cells, most of which expressed macrophage-specific antigens such as Mac-1, Moma-2, and F4/80, were used as BMMφ. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in α-MEM in the presence of RANKL (50 ng/ml) to induce their differentiation into osteoclasts. After the cells were cultured for 5 days, they were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP, a marker enzyme of osteoclasts). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing more than three nuclei were observed under a microscope and counted as osteoclasts. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate cultures. All experiments were performed at least three times, and similar results were obtained. Statistical analysis of the results was performed by Student's t test. RT-PCR for PGE2 Receptor mRNAs—Total RNA was extracted from cultured mouse bone marrow macrophages and RAW264.7 cells using the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method. cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of the total RNA by using reverse transcriptase (Revatra Ace, Toyobo Co. Ltd., Tokyo) and amplified using PCR. Sequences of primers used in RT-PCR for EP subtypes, CT receptor, and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were described in previous reports (21Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Suda T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 40Itoh K. Udagawa N. Katagiri T. Iemura S. Ueno N.

The PCR conditions for EP subtypes were as follows: denaturation 94 °C, 30 s, annealing 65 °C, 30 s, and primer extension 75 °C, 60 s. The conditions for the CT receptor and G3PDH were as follows: denaturation 94 °C, 30 s, annealing 60 °C, 30 s, and primer extension 72 °C, 60 s. Preliminary experiments were performed to ensure that the number of PCR cycles was within the exponential phase of the amplification curve. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1× protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma)). After removal of the cellular debris, the lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 1 μg of various antibodies and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The Sepharose beads were suspended in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 2 min. The cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Clear blot P membrane, Atto Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was blotted with antibodies to specific proteins and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Assay of cAMP Production and IL-6—To measure the amount of cAMP produced, cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in α-MEM containing 1 mm IBMX, and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with CT (Elcatonin, 10-9m) or PGE2 (10-6m). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm IBMX and then were dissolved. The amounts of intracellular cAMP were determined using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the effect of forskolin on LPS-induced IL-6 production, RAW264.7 cells transfected with mock, wild-type TAK1, or Ser412 → Ala TAK1 (0.8 × 105 cells/well, 48-well plate) were cultured with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of forskolin (100 μm) for 24 h. The culture medium was collected, and the concentration of IL-6 in the culture medium was measured by ELISA (R & D Systems). Measurements of Intracellular Ca2+—The effects of PGE2 and CT on intracellular Ca2+ in RAW264.7 cells was measured using a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) according to the methods described previously (41Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells were incubated in glass-bottom dishes (Asahi Techno Glass Corp., Tokyo) for 6 h. Cells were then incubated with 5 μm fluo-4 AM, 5 μm Fura Red AM, and 0.05% Pluronic F127 for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells loaded with these dyes were washed twice with α-MEM and post-incubated in α-MEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were further washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then excited at 488 nm. Emission at 505–530 nm for fluo-4 and at 600–680 nm for Fura Red was acquired simultaneously at 2-s intervals. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity of fluo-4 to Fura Red was calculated to estimate intracellular Ca2+ influx in single cells. Expression of PGE2 Receptors in Osteoclast Precursors—We first analyzed the expression of PGE2 receptors in bone marrow macrophages and RAW264.7 cells using RT-PCR. Bone marrow macrophages expressed EP1, EP2, EP3β, and EP4 mRNAs, whereas RAW264.7 cells expressed EP1, EP2, and EP4 mRNAs (Fig. 1A). Bone marrow macrophages differentiated into TRAP-positive osteoclasts in response to RANKL together with M-CSF (Fig. 1B, upper panel). PGE2 (10-6m) alone did not induce osteoclast formation in cultures of bone marrow macrophages but did enhance the osteoclast formation induced by RANKL plus M-CSF (Fig. 1B, upper panel). RAW264.7 cells differentiated into osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL (Fig. 1B, lower panel). PGE2 similarly enhanced the osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL in cultures of RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1B, lower panel). EP1 activates Ca2+ signals, whereas EP2 and EP4 couple to Gs protein, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. We then examined calcium signaling in RAW264.7 cells treated with PGE2 and eel CT (Fig. 1C). An increase in intracellular calcium was induced by PGE2 (10-5m) but not CT (10-9m) in RAW264.7 cells. We next examined the effects of PGE2 and CT on cAMP production in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1D). PGE2 (10-6m) but not CT (10-9m) stimulated cAMP production in RAW264.7 cells. We also analyzed the expression of EPs in osteoclasts purified from co-cultures of mouse calvarial osteoblasts and bone marrow cells treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Osteoclasts expressed only EP1 mRNA but not EP2, EP3, or EP4 mRNA (data not shown). These results indicate that expression of EP2 and EP4 mRNAs in osteoclast precursors was down-regulated during their differentiation into osteoclasts. CT (10-9m) enhanced intracellular calcium concentrations and cAMP production in osteoclasts formed from RAW264.7 cells treated with RANKL (data not shown). These results suggest that functional EP1, EP2, and EP4 are expressed in RAW264.7 cells. Enhancement of RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation by EP2/EP4-mediated Signals—PGE2 has been shown to enhance synergistically RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from the precursors (26Tintut Y. Parhami F. Tsingotjidou A. Tetradis S. Territo M. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14221-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Wani M.R. Fuller K. Kim N.S. Choi Y. Chambers T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells expressed functional EP1, EP2, and EP4 receptors (Fig. 1). We then examined which type of PGE2 receptors is involved in the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2). RANKL-induced osteoclast formation was enhanced by PGE2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The synergistic effect of PGE2 on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation was dose-dependently inhibited by H-89, a specific inhibitor of PKA (Fig. 2, B and C). Dibutyryl cAMP (100 μm), a cell-permeable analogue of cAMP, enhanced the osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL (Fig. 2B). PGE2 and dibutyryl cAMP also enhanced osteoclastic differentiation of bone marrow macrophages treated with M-CSF and RANKL (data not shown). These results suggest that PGE2 enhances RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation through the signals mediated by EP2 and EP4 in the precursor cells. Enhancement of RANK-induced Signals by EP2/EP4-mediated Signals—Binding of RANKL to RANK activates various signaling pathways, including those involving NF-κB, p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK, in the target cells.

https://openalex.org/W2060347174,"We investigated whether substrate availability influences the type of energy metabolism in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei. We show that absence of glycolytic substrates (glucose and glycerol) does not induce a shift from a fermentative metabolism to complete oxidation of substrates. We also show that glucose (and even glycolysis) is not essential for normal functioning and proliferation of pleomorphic procyclic T. brucei cells. Furthermore, absence of glucose did not result in increased degradation of amino acids. Variations in availability of glucose and glycerol did result, however, in adaptations in metabolism in such a way that the glycosome was always in redox balance. We argue that it is likely that, in procyclic cells, phosphoglycerate kinase is located not only in the cytosol, but also inside glycosomes, as otherwise an ATP deficit would occur in this organelle. We demonstrate that procyclic T. brucei uses parts of the Krebs cycle for purposes other than complete degradation of mitochondrial substrates. We suggest that citrate synthase plus pyruvate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase are used to transport acetyl-CoA units from the mitochondrion to the cytosol for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, a process we show to occur in proliferating procyclic cells. The part of the Krebs cycle consisting of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase was used for the degradation of proline and glutamate to succinate. We also demonstrate that the subsequent enzymes of the Krebs cycle, succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase, are most likely used for conversion of succinate into malate, which can then be used in gluconeogenesis.

Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular eukaryote that causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock. African trypanosomes undergo a complex life cycle through the blood-stream of their mammalian host and the blood-feeding insect vector, the tsetse fly (Glossina spp.) (1.Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). During their life cycle, trypanosomes encounter many different environments and respond to these by dramatic morphological and metabolic changes, including adaptation of their glucose metabolism. The long slender bloodstream form has the simplest pathway for the degradation of glucose, viz. glycolysis, and excretes pyruvate as the sole end product (2.Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4.Clayton C.E. Michels P.A. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the glycosomal and mitochondrial metabolism of T. brucei changes significantly upon transformation from the long slender bloodstream form to the procyclic form. In procyclic forms, the end product of glycolysis (pyruvate) is not excreted, but is further degraded inside the mitochondrion. In addition to carbohydrates, procyclic T. brucei forms are also able to use amino acids such as proline and threonine for energy generation (5.Evans D.E. Brown R.C. J. Protozool. 1972; 19: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6.Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In our previous investigation, we studied the contribution of the Krebs cycle to the energy metabolism of wild-type and aconitase knockout procyclic cells by metabolic incubations using labeled glucose and proline (7.van Weelden S.W.H. Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We showed that, under standard in vitro culture conditions, proline and glucose are not degraded via the Krebs cycle to CO2. Instead, proline is mainly degraded to succinate, and glucose is degraded to acetate, succinate, and alanine. It has been shown that succinate production from glucose occurs predominantly inside the glycosome (8.Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no difference in excreted end products was detected between wild-type and aconitase knockout procyclic cells, demonstrating that complete Krebs cycle activity is not involved in energy generation in procyclic T. brucei under the conditions studied (7.van Weelden S.W.H. Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Many microorganisms are able to adapt their metabolism for optimal utilization of the carbon sources available in the environment. One of the major mechanisms by which cells adapt is by regulation of gene expression. Analysis of genomic expression has revealed that, in many organisms, multiple genes are differentially transcribed in response to varying glucose levels, a process called glucose repression (9.Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose repression affects the enzymes required for the metabolism of the sugars sucrose, maltose, and galactose and non-fermentable carbon sources such as ethanol and acetate, as well as the enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation (10.Trumbly R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). When carbohydrates are abundantly available, S. cerevisiae exhibits a fermentative metabolism, even under aerobic culture conditions. Under glucose-limited conditions, however, chemostat cultivation of S. cerevisiae induces activation of the Krebs cycle (11.Gombert A.K. Moreira dos Santos M. Christensen B. Nielsen J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The question now arises whether also in procyclic T. brucei the (near) absence of carbohydrates leads to activation of the Krebs cycle for the complete oxidation of substrates. To investigate whether the availability of substrates for glycolysis influences the type of energy metabolism in procyclic T. brucei cells, we performed radioactive incubations with cells cultured in the absence and presence of glucose and/or glycerol. Our investigations showed that the absence of carbohydrates did not induce a shift from a fermentative metabolism to the use of the Krebs cycle for complete oxidation of substrates. We therefore investigated whether the Krebs cycle enzymes, which have been shown to be present in procyclic T. brucei (12.Durieux P.O. Schütz P. Brun R. Köhler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), might be involved in processes other than the degradation of acetyl-CoA. Our data led to the proposal that the Krebs cycle does indeed not function as a cycle in procyclic T. brucei, but that parts of the Krebs cycle machinery are used in other processes such as partial degradation of amino acids, but also for biosynthetic purposes such as fatty acid biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis. Trypanosome Culture Conditions—The pleomorphic procyclic T. brucei brucei TREU 927 strain (a gift from Jeremy Mottram, Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom) was grown at 27 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in SDM-79 medium with different glucose and/or glycerol concentrations. SDM-79 medium without glucose was prepared with glucose-free Medium 199 and minimum Eagle's medium, and no additional glucose was added. This medium was supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), resulting in a final glucose concentration of ∼0.02 mm. The three other culture media that we investigated were obtained by addition of glucose (10 mm final concentration) and/or glycerol (13 mm final concentration) to the above-described medium without glucose. Standard culturing was carried out in SDM-79 medium containing 10 mm glucose, and changes to other media were performed by dilution (1:5) in the new medium for at least 5 consecutive days before the metabolic studies were performed. This procedure allows possible adaptations to take place. Metabolic Incubations—Incubations were performed using procyclic cells cultured in SDM-79 medium containing glucose and glycerol or procyclic cells that were adapted for 5 days to SDM-79 medium without glucose and/or glycerol. Metabolic experiments were started with 5 × 106 cells/ml, and incubations were carried out for 17–24 h at 27 °C in sealed Erlenmeyer flasks containing 5 ml of incubation medium. Before sealing, the flasks were flushed for 1 min with a gas phase of 95% air and 5% CO2. Incubations were started after addition of 5 μCi of d-[6-14C]glucose (2.07 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 5 μCi of l-[U-14C]proline (9.47 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 5 μCi of [U-14C]glycerol (5.07 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), or 5 μCi of l-[U-14C]threonine (6.48 GBq/mmol; ICN Biomedicals). Incubations were terminated by addition of 40 μl of 6 m HCl to lower the pH to 3.5. Analysis of the end products was performed as described (13.Tielens A.G.M. Horemans A.M.C. Dunnewijk R. van der Meer P. Van den Bergh S.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Glucose concentrations were determined enzymatically using hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and by measuring the NADPH formed. Protein was determined by the Lowry method using defatted and dialyzed bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) as the standard. Fatty Acid Analysis—Procyclic T. brucei cells were incubated for 17 h in the presence of [6-14C]glucose, [U-14C]proline, or [U-14C]threonine as described above under “Metabolic Incubations.” Afterward, the trypanosomes (∼5 × 107 cells) were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and washed with ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 140 mm NaCl. Lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (14.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Organic extracts were dried under nitrogen, and lipids were subsequently hydrolyzed in 2.5 ml of 0.3 m NaOH in methanol for 1 h at 75 °C. Non-saponified material was extracted three times with 1 volume of petroleum ether. After acidification of the methanolic phase with 150 μlof6 m HCl, the fatty acids were extracted three times with 1 volume of petroleum ether (15.Brouwers J.F. Smeenk I.M. Van Golde L.M.G. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88 (M. G.): 175-185LCrossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The isolated fatty acids were dried under nitrogen, converted into their phenylacyl derivatives, dried under nitrogen, and redissolved in acetonitrile (16.Wood R. Lee T. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 254: 237-246Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The obtained fatty acid phenylacyl esters were loaded onto a 250 × 4-mm LiChrospher 100 RP-18e column (5 μm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and eluted isocratically with acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Detection of the fatty acids was performed at 242 nm using PerkinElmer Life Sciences analytical software for data analysis. Fractions were collected every 30 s in scintillation vials, evaporated to dryness, and counted for radioactivity after addition of tritosol scintillation fluid (15.Brouwers J.F. Smeenk I.M. Van Golde L.M.G. Tielens A.G.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88 (M. G.): 175-185LCrossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate whether radioactive carbons were incorporated into saturated or unsaturated acyl chains, fatty acids obtained after petroleum ether extraction were either analyzed directly or first dissolved in methanol and hydrogenated by hydrogen gas in the presence of platinum(IV) oxide for 2 h before conversion into phenylacyl derivatives. Metabolic Incubations—To investigate whether the availability of substrates for glycolysis influences the type of energy metabolism in procyclic T. brucei, we performed radioactive incubations using four distinct labeled substrates. We used two substrates for glycolysis, [6-14C]glucose and [U-14C]glycerol, and two substrates for mitochondrial metabolism, [U-14C]proline and [U-14C]threonine. Glucose, proline, and threonine are considered to be main carbon sources for energy generation in procyclic T. brucei (5.Evans D.E. Brown R.C. J. Protozool. 1972; 19: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6.Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When present, glycerol was also a main carbon source for procyclic T. brucei, as was shown previously for cultured Trypanosoma rhodesiense cells (17.Riley J.F. Biochem. J. 1962; 85: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The catabolism of each of these four substrates was investigated separately under standard culture conditions in the presence of SDM-79 medium alone, with glycerol, without glucose, or without glucose but with glycerol (see Fig. 1 for an outline of all the radioactive incubations performed. Metabolic Pathways in the Presence of Glucose (10 mm), Glycerol (13 mm), Proline (5 mm), and Threonine (3 mm)—The incubations performed with [6-14C]glucose demonstrated that acetate and succinate were the main excreted end products of glucose metabolism (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with previous reports (7.van Weelden S.W.H. Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8.Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol.

Only a very limited amount of glucose (∼1%) was broken down to labeled CO2. Because significant production of labeled CO2 from [6-14C]glucose can occur only when pyruvate is degraded by the Krebs cycle, this result confirms that the activity of a complete Krebs cycle is negligible in procyclic cells (7.van Weelden S.W.H. Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The incubations performed with [U-14C]glycerol showed that, in the presence of both substrates, next to glucose, a considerable amount of glycerol was consumed, which was mainly metabolized into succinate (Fig. 1B). A minor part of the consumed glycerol was degraded to acetate, with the concomitant release of an equimolar amount of labeled CO2, which is produced during the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Analysis of the radioactive end products from [U-14C]proline revealed that the major end product was succinate, with the concomitant release of an equimolar amount of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1C), as was shown previously (7.van Weelden S.W.H. Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Minor amounts of labeled acetate were detected upon [U-14C]proline degradation. The incubations performed with [U-14C]threonine demonstrated that considerable amounts of l-threonine were metabolized to acetate (Fig. 1D), which is in agreement with previous studies (6.Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, at the same time, an equimolar amount of glycine has been reported to be produced (19.Linstead D.J. Klein R.A. Cross G.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 101: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but this end product cannot be detected by the method we used because threonine (the labeled substrate) elutes close to glycine. Calculations of the amounts of various substrates consumed in the presence of all four substrates showed that the consumption ratio of the substrates was ∼5: 13:1:4 for glucose, glycerol, proline, and threonine, respectively (Fig. 1). However, it should be realized that, during glycolysis, degradation of one molecule of glucose results in the formation of two molecules of triose phosphate and therefore results in twice the amount of end products compared with glycerol, proline, and threonine. Metabolic Pathways in the Near Absence of Glucose (0.02 mm; with Glycerol, Proline, and Threonine Present at the Original Concentrations Indicated Above)—Procyclic cells grown in the presence of only a tracer amount of labeled glucose had a 50% increased doubling time (calculated from days 5 to 10) compared with procyclic cells grown in SDM-79 medium with both glucose and glycerol (Fig. 2). No change in the excreted end product pattern of proline, glycerol, and glucose metabolism was detected (Fig. 1, A–C). Also, no increase in glycerol or proline consumption was measured when the glucose consumption was negligible in the medium without glucose. Apparently, there is no change in the use of catabolic pathways and no up-regulation of the degradation of other substrates when glucose is absent. Glucose Metabolism in the Absence of Glycerol (with Glucose, Proline, and Threonine Present at the Original Concentrations Indicated Above)—A small negative growth effect (25%) was detected in procyclic cells cultured in the absence of glycerol (Fig. 2). Metabolic incubations using labeled glucose showed that acetate and succinate were still the main end products of glucose catabolism, but the ratio in which these products were excreted changed significantly (Fig. 1A). Acetate production was increased from an average of 30 ± 8% to an average of 55 ± 1%, whereas succinate production dropped from 70 ± 8to45 ± 1%. In addition, glucose degradation was halved in the absence of glycerol. Amino Acid Metabolism in the Absence of Glucose and Glycerol—Although both substrates for glycolysis were absent, proliferation continued, albeit at a slower rate (35% decrease compared with procyclic cells grown in the presence of SDM-79 medium with both glucose and glycerol) (Fig. 2). The absence of glucose and glycerol induced a 2-fold increase in proline degradation (Fig. 1C), but no increase was detected in threonine degradation (Fig. 1D), and also no difference was seen in the end product pattern produced from threonine breakdown. Because labeled threonine is broken down to labeled acetate via labeled acetyl-CoA, an active Krebs cycle would result in significant excretion of labeled CO2. Therefore, the absence of significant labeled CO2 production upon threonine degradation showed that, even in the near absence of glycolytic substrates, the Krebs cycle was not induced, although the proliferating cells had 5 days to adapt their metabolism to the medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). The end product pattern produced from [U-14C]proline showed a dramatic increase in CO2 production compared with the incubations containing carbohydrates (Fig. 1C), whereas excretion of succinate was not increased. This high production of labeled CO2 has to imply that also more labeled succinate was produced. Apparently, this labeled succinate was not secreted, but was instead used for biosynthetic purposes such as the gluconeogenic pathway to produce carbohydrates (see “Discussion”). Incorporation of Radioactive Carbons into Fatty Acyl Chains— Comparison of the isolated fatty acids present in the serum added to SDM-79 medium (Fig. 3A) with the fatty acids isolated from procyclic T. brucei cells (Fig. 3B) showed that the fatty acid composition in procyclic T. brucei cells differed from that in the medium. Therefore, procyclic cells either took up fatty acids selectively or synthesized fatty acids de novo or performed both activities. Fig. 3B demonstrates that fatty acids were synthesized de novo by procyclic cells, as fatty acid peaks marked with asterisks showed significant incorporation of labeled carbons derived from [6-14C]glucose or [U-14C]threonine (dpm up to 100 times the background levels). The only way to incorporate 14C from these substrates into fatty acids involves a mitochondrial acetyl-CoA intermediate. No difference in fatty acid profile was observed in procyclic cells cultured in the presence or absence of glucose and glycerol (data not shown). All these experiments show that part of the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA pool is used for fatty acid biosynthesis in proliferating procyclic T. brucei cells. As could be expected from the observed low absolute flux of proline degradation in combination with the relative small amount of acetate that was produced from this substrate (Fig. 1), no significant radioactive carbon incorporation from [U-14C]proline into fatty acids could be detected. In contrast to the bloodstream form fatty-acid synthase system, which is specialized for myristate synthesis, procyclic forms synthesized mainly 16- or 18-carbon fatty acids, which is in agreement with previous studies in cell-free systems (20.Morita Y.S. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Science. 2000; 288: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Procyclic forms also synthesized myristate, which can be concluded from the detection of radioactive label in the C14:0 species after hydrogenation (Fig. 3C), but the incorporated amount of label was <10% of that present in 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids. No radioactive carbons could be detected in the C22:5 and C22:6 species; and therefore, the abundance of these fatty acids in procyclic cells compared with their presence in the medium can be explained only by selective uptake or modification of specific fatty acids from the medium. Influences of Substrate Availability—The absence of glucose and/or glycerol in SDM-79 medium did result in decreased growth, but did not result in halted proliferation or cell death of procyclic cells of this pleomorphic T. brucei strain. This observation confirms previous studies on monomorphic strains (21.Furaya T. Kessler P. Jardim A. Schnaufer A. Crudder C. Parsons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14177-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22.Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be concluded that glucose and glycerol (and hence glycolysis) are not essential for normal functioning and proliferation of this pleomorphic strain because procyclic T. brucei cells can adapt their metabolism accordingly. However, some morphological changes were observed upon changing substrate levels. Omission of glucose from the medium (with glycerol still present) resulted in an extension of the total length (body + flagellum) of the procyclic cells (from 44 ± 5 to 63 ± 8 μm). Elongation of the flagellum in response to glucose limitation has been described previously in T. cruzi (23.Tyler K.M. Engman D.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our various incubations also resulted in changes in the procyclin coat of the parasites, but these changes were not studied extensively. This aspect has been described in detail previously, and it is known that glucose and glycerol availability influences the expression of procyclins present on the surface coat of procyclic trypanosomes (22.Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24.Vassella E. Van Den Abbeele J. Butikofer P. Renggli C.K. Furger A. Brun R. Roditi I.

Cell. 2004; 15: 3986-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Redox and ATP Balance in Glycosomes of Procyclic T. brucei—Glucose metabolism in the absence of glycerol (with glucose, proline, and threonine present) resulted in an altered acetate/succinate ratio (1:1) compared with the acetate/succinate ratio (1:3) in incubations performed in the presence of glycerol (Fig. 1). Apparently, glucose metabolism was affected by the presence of glycerol in the medium, and the question is why? The pathways of glycerol and glucose degradation via glycolysis overlap, starting at the formation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol 3-phosphate. However, in the formation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate, glycerol catabolism consumes one molecule of ATP/triose phosphate and produces one molecule of NADH/triose phosphate, whereas glucose catabolism also consumes one molecule of ATP/triose phosphate, but produces no NADH. Could this difference in NADH production possibly explain the altered acetate/succinate ratio? It should be realized that, in procyclic T. brucei, glucose and glycerol catabolism and amino acid degradation result in a significant net production of NADH. This substantial amount of NADH is reoxidized by the respiratory chain because procyclic cells are known to consume significant amounts of oxygen by alternative oxidase and cytochrome c oxidase activities. Furthermore, this observed net NADH production is in agreement with the essential function of the respiratory chain in procyclic T. brucei cells, which are rapidly killed when both branches of their respiratory chain are inhibited simultaneously (7.van Weelden S.W.H. Fast B. Vogt A. van der Meer P. Saas J. van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G.M. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Based on the current carbohydrate metabolism models of procyclic T. brucei, the net production or consumption of cofactors in the various organelles can be calculated for the degradation of each carbohydrate substrate into the specific end products acetate and succinate. Using the current models that consider a cytosolic location for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), 1The abbreviation used is: PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase. glucose degradation to acetate results (per molecule of acetate produced) in the formation of two molecules of NADH (one produced inside the glycosome) and in the net formation of two molecules of ATP (but in this process, one molecule of ATP is consumed inside the glycosome) (Table I). Glucose degradation to succinate in the glycosome results in the consumption of one molecule of NADH (inside the glycosome) and yields one molecule of ATP (no ATP formed inside the glycosome). Glycerol degradation to acetate yields three molecules of NADH (two inside the glycosome) and two molecules of ATP (one consumed inside the glycosome). Glycerol degradation to succinate is redox neutral (also in the glycosome) and yields no ATP inside the glycosome. In the case of a putative glycosomal localization of PGK, one extra molecule of ATP is produced inside the glycosome during the degradation of both glucose and glycerol to acetate and succinate at the expense of one molecule of ATP in the cytosol (Table I).Table INADH and ATP balances of glucose and glycerol metabolism in procyclic T. bruceiSubstrateEnd productaAll of the succinate referred to is glycosomal, whereas acetate is produced inside the mitochondrion.NADH/mol productbIn the production of acetate and succinate from glucose and glycerol, NADH is produced in the reactions catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, whereas NADH is oxidized in the reactions catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fumarate reductase (see Fig. 4).ATP yield/mol productcIn the production of acetate and succinate from glucose and glycerol, ATP is consumed in the reactions catalyzed by hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, whereas ATP synthesis by substrate level phosphorylation occurs in the reactions catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, and phosphoenolpyruvate"

Mucus clearance is regulated, in part, by activation of apical membrane receptors coupled to intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) mobilization. We have shown that Ca2+i signals resulting from apical purinoceptor (P2Y2-R) activation are increased in CF compared with normal human airway epithelia. The present study addressed the mechanism for the larger apical P2Y2-R-dependent Ca2+i signals in CF human airway epithelia. We show that the increased Ca2+i mobilization in CF was not specific to P2Y2-Rs because it was mimicked by apical bradykinin receptor activation, and it did not result from a greater number of P2Y2-R or a more efficient coupling between P2Y2-Rs and phospholipase C-generated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Rather, the larger apical P2Y2-R activation-promoted Ca2+i signals in CF epithelia resulted from an increased density and Ca2+ storage capacity of apically confined endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. To address whether the ER up-regulation resulted from ER retention of misfolded ΔF508 CFTR or was an acquired response to chronic luminal airway infection/inflammation, three approaches were used. First, ER density was studied in normal and CF sweat duct human epithelia expressing high levels of ΔF508 CFTR, and it was found to be the same in normal and CF epithelia. Second, apical ER density was morphometrically analyzed in airway epithelia from normal subjects, ΔF508 homozygous CF patients, and a disease control, primary ciliary dyskinesia; it was found to be greater in both CF and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Third, apical ER density and P2Y2-R activation-mobilized Ca2+i, which were investigated in airway epithelia in a long term culture in the absence of luminal infection, were similar in normal and CF epithelia. To directly test whether luminal infection/inflammation triggers an up-regulation of the apically confined ER Ca2+ stores, normal airway epithelia were chronically exposed to supernatant from mucopurulent material from CF airways. Supernatant treatment expanded the apically confined ER, resulting in larger apical P2Y2-R activation-dependent Ca2+i responses, which reproduced the increased Ca2+i signals observed in CF epithelia. In conclusion, the mechanism for the larger Ca2+i signals elicited by apical P2Y2-R activation in CF airway epithelia is an expansion of the apical ER Ca2+ stores triggered by chronic luminal airway infection/inflammation.

Airway epithelia constitute the major interface between inspired air and the airway wall. These epithelia are highly polarized and exhibit a series of integrated functions that provide mechanical cleansing, i.e. mucus clearance, as a primary mode of lung defense. The individual airway epithelial functional components that mediate mucus clearance, including ion transport, mucin secretion, and ciliary beat frequency (1Wanner A. Salathe M. O'Riordan T.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 1868-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), are regulated in part by intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) (2Knowles M.R. Noone P.G. Bennett W.D. Boucher R.C.

Boucher R.C. Salathe M. Cilia, Mucus and Mucociliary Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 303-314Google Scholar).In airway epithelia of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the functional absence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) results in a diminished periciliary liquid layer depth (6Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) and a reduction in mucus clearance. Likewise, abnormal mucus clearance is found in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a syndrome that results from defective airway epithelial ciliary proteins linked to a decreased ciliary activity (7Eliasson R. Mossberg B. Camner P. Afzelius B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In both diseases, persistent airways infection and inflammation are the predominant clinical phenotypic characteristics consequent to the impairment of mucus clearance (8Leigh M.W. Disorders of the Respiratory Tract of Children. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998Google Scholar).There are clues that airway epithelia may regulate the Ca2+i signaling pathway in response to airways disease. For example, in vivo studies established that the nasal transepithelial electrical potential difference responses to agents that activate P2Y2-Rs and promote Ca2+i mobilization (e.g. ATP/UTP) are greater in CF patients than in normal subjects (9Knowles M.R. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 10Knowles M.R. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Chest. 1992; 101: 60S-63SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In vitro studies also detected a larger apical Ca2+i-dependent Cl– conductance in CF airway epithelia (9Knowles M.R. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J.

Physiol. 1994; 266: C1478-C1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we recently reported that apical P2Y2-R activation promotes greater Ca2+i mobilization in CF compared with normal human nasal epithelia (4Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for the regulation of the increased Ca2+i responsiveness of CF airway epithelia and its functional consequences are unknown.Therefore, in the present study we investigated the mechanism for the augmented apical GPCR-derived Ca2+i signals in CF airway epithelia by probing the P2Y2-R/Ca2+ signaling system in functional, biochemical, and cell biological studies in normal and CF human airway epithelia. Further, we investigated whether the raised Ca2+i signals in CF are a manifestation of the molecular pathogenesis of mutant CFTR (ΔF508 CFTR) or are an acquired host response to chronic infection/inflammation in vivo. We compared ER density in non-infected human sweat duct epithelia from normal and ΔF508 CF individuals and in human airway epithelia from normal, ΔF508 CF, and PCD patients with chronic airway infection and inflammation. In addition, ER density and apical P2Y2-R activation-induced Ca2+i mobilization were studied in short term and long term cultures of normal and CF bronchial epithelia. Finally, to directly address whether chronic airway infection/inflammation, independently of defective CFTR, up-regulated apically confined ER Ca2+ stores, ER density and UTP-mobilized ER Ca2+ were investigated in normal airway epithelia chronically exposed to supernatant from CF airways mucopurulent material (SMM).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Freshly Excised Tissue—Tissues and cells were obtained under the auspices of protocols approved by the Institutional Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. Excess tissues from human donor lungs and excised recipient lungs were obtained at the time of lung transplantation from main stem or lobar bronchi. Tissues were either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin or used for cell isolation. Bronchial epithelial cells were provided by the University of North Carolina CF Center Tissue Core. Normal and CF (ΔF508 homozygous) cells were harvested and cultured as described previously (4Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at an air-liquid surface interface, and polarized primary cultures were studied at 6–11 days (short term monolayers) or 30–40 days later (long term well differentiated). Normal and CF cultures were apically washed with sterile PBS, and the serosal media were replenished every 2–4 days.Nasal scrapes obtained from normal (n = 4, ages 33–35), ΔF508 homozygous CF (n = 4, ages 25–46), or PCD (n = 3, ages 34–57) individuals and skin biopsies from normal (n = 4, ages 28–47) and ΔF508 homozygous CF (n = 5, ages 31–47) individuals were used for ER density studies.Ca2+iStudies—6–11- or 30–40-day-old cultures were loaded with fura-2/AM, and Ca2+i was measured under bilateral perfusion as reported previously (4Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ca2+i signals were calibrated as described previously (14Paradiso A.M. Cheng E.H. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L63-L69PubMed Google Scholar). There were no systematic differences between CF and normal epithelia as a result of differential fura-2 behavior, including dye loading. Baseline Ca2+i levels were the same in CF and normal epithelia, as reported previously (4Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and no consistent differences were observed between CF and normal epithelia in the sustained phase of Ca2+i mobilization following activation of P2Y2-Rs.Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)—A 398-base pair human P2Y2-R fragment was prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human airway RNA and ligated into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). P2Y2-R primer sequences were as follows: 253F, 5′AGACCTGGGCCCCTGGAATGACACCATC3′; and 651R, 5′AGACGCCCAGACACCGGTGCACGCTGATG3′.Individual clones were verified by automatic sequencing. Templates for RPAs were prepared by PCR from the P2Y2-R plasmid with the following primers for the PCRII vector: PCRII SP6, 5′ATGATTACGCCAAGCTATTTAGGTGACACT3′ and PCRII T7, 5′GACGGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACT3′.50 ng of purified PCR fragment was transcribed, incorporating the [32P]UTP label with the Maxiscript kit (Ambion), and RPA was performed with the RPA III kit (Ambion). Protected fragments were quantified by phosphorimaging with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).Phospholipase C Activity—After 4 days in culture, monolayers of normal and CF bronchial epithelia were radiolabeled with [3H]inositol for 4–5 days (15Shears S.B. Shears S.B. Signalling by Inositides: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). For 20 min prior to study, cultures were placed in serum-free media containing 10 mm lithium and [3H]inositol followed by 5 min 100 μm mucosal UTP-induced PLC activity measured as reported previously (15Shears S.B. Shears S.B. Signalling by Inositides: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). The levels of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates were normalized to [3H]IP6 levels because IP6 levels are not affected by agonist stimulation (16Yang X. Rudolf M. Carew M.A. Yoshida M. Nerreter V. Riley A.M. Chung S.K. Bruzik K.S. Potter B.V. Schultz C. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18973-18980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in duplicate.Immunostaining of Calreticulin and IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) and DIOC6(3) Staining—The immunostaining of calreticulin and IP3Rs in cultures and deparaffinized native bronchial epithelial or skin biopsy sections was performed according to a modification of our previous method (17Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For calreticulin and IP3Rs staining, samples were incubated with a rabbit anti-calreticulin antibody (1:100 dilution, Affinity Bioreagents) and a mouse anti-IP3R antibody that recognizes all IP3R isoforms (1:100 dilution, Calbiochem) for 60 min at 37 °C. This incubation was followed by three PBS washes and a 30-min incubation at 25 °C with a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:20 dilution for calreticulin, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and with a Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:200 dilution for IP3Rs, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). As controls, the primary antibodies were omitted or substituted with rabbit and mouse γ-globulins (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). For antibody-independent ER staining, sections of native bronchial epithelia were labeled with the fluorescent dihexaoxacarbocyanine dye DIOC6(3) by incubation with 250 ng/ml DIOC6(3) for 1 min at room temperature in PBS followed by three washes with PBS as we have reported previously (17Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ store markers and the DIOC6(3) signals were studied by laser confocal microscopy (Leica, model TCS 4D, PL APO 63x/1.20 mm water lens) in the XZ or XY scanning mode.To quantify the fluorescence intensity of labeled calreticulin and IP3Rs and DIOC6(3), multiple scans were obtained from each sample, and regions of interest were designated in the apical domains with the MetaMorph software. The same acquisition parameters (e.g. laser power, contrast, brightness, and pinhole value) were employed for each channel to acquire the images from normal and CF cultures or native tissue in experiments performed on the same day. The fluorescence intensity values from the regions of interest were averaged from paired normal and CF cultures, native bronchial epithelia, skin biopsies, or normal cultures treated with PBS or supernatant from CF airways mucopurulent material (SMM, see “Studies with Infectious/Inflammatory Material from CF Airways”).Calreticulin Western Blot Analysis—Monolayers of normal and CF bronchial epithelia were lysed and blotted as reported previously (18Sarkadi B. Bauzon D. Huckle W.R. Earp H.S. Berry A. Suchindran H. Price E.M. Olsen J.C. Boucher R.C. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2087-2095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calreticulin antibody was a rabbit polyclonal (1:5000 dilution, Affinity Bioreagents), and the secondary antibody was an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence.Electron Microscopy—Nasal scrapes from normal, ΔF508 homozygous CF, and PCD individuals were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde plus 0.25% tannic acid, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, and processed for electron microscopy (19Robinson G. Gray T. Bancroft J.D. Stevens A. Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques. Churchill Livingstone, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Apical ER morphometric scoring was performed double blind. Only ciliated cells were analyzed, and repairing cells with migrating basal bodies (procentrioles) and micrographs with tangential cuts were excluded. The apical domain was defined as the region 1–3.4 μm (to exclude basal bodies) from the apical plasma membrane. The criteria for identifying ER were: parallel membranes in elongated or oval strands, containing an amorphous center without cristae (to exclude mitochondria), or electron-dense particles (to exclude rough ER, because it is increased in repairing cells), and not stacked (to exclude Golgi). Data are expressed as number of ER strands/μm2.Studies with Infectious/Inflammatory Material from CF Airways— Mucopurulent material was harvested from the airway lumens of excised human CF lungs infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus at the time of transplant and provided by the University of North Carolina CF Center Tissue Core. This material was centrifuged at 100,000 rpm (60 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and frozen at –80 °C. Preliminary studies revealed that treatment of airway epithelia with SMM from individual CF lungs infected with P. aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus induced epithelial hyperinflammation. Because of the small volume of SMM/patient, SMMs from nine CF lungs (five males and four females, age 17–48 years, four ΔF508 homozygous and five unknown genotypes) were pooled to assure homogeneous stimulus throughout experiments.To address the effect of SMM on ER size and Ca2+ storage, PBS or SMM (40 μl) was applied to the mucosal surfaces of well differentiated cultures of normal bronchial epithelia for 48 h, and then either ER volume was studied by calreticulin immunostaining as described above or peak Ca2+i responses to 100 μm mucosal UTP were measured, respectively.Statistics—Data represent the mean ± S.E. from at least three experiments from three individual donors and were analyzed by unpaired t test or two-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined with p < 0.05.RESULTSLarger Apical GPCR-modulated Ca2+iResponses Are a Generalized Feature of CF Airway Epithelia—We have shown previously that CF human nasal epithelia exhibit larger rises in Ca2+i in response to apical P2Y2-R activation than normal nasal epithelia (4Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this difference was generalized to lower airways, we studied the effect of a maximal dose (100 μm) UTP applied to the apical surface of 6–11-day-old monolayers of normal and CF human bronchial epithelial cultures on Ca2+i mobilization (4Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). UTP addition to normal bronchial epithelium induced an initial Ca2+i peak, resulting from IP3-dependent ER Ca2+ store release, and a sustained rise in Ca2+i, resulting from activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (3Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E. Boucher R.C. Salathe M. Cilia, Mucus and Mucociliary Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 303-314Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). P2Y2-R activation in CF epithelium (Fig. 1B) resulted in a markedly higher Ca2+i mobilization peak than in normal epithelium, in agreement with our findings in nasal epithelia (4Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C illustrates the summary ΔCa2+i data (peak-baseline Ca2+i values) from these studies.We next addressed whether the larger Ca2+i mobilization in CF was a specific property of P2Y2-R activation or was generalized to other GPCRs linked to PLC at the apical membrane. Fig. 1, D and E, shows representative Ca2+i tracings from 6–11-day-old monolayers of normal and CF bronchial epithelial cultures, respectively, following apical addition of a maximal dose (5 μm) of bradykinin. Fig. 1F depicts the summary ΔCa2+i data from these experiments, illustrating that apical bradykinin receptor activation in CF also resulted in an increased ΔCa2+i mobilization. Because the greater bradykinin-induced Ca2+i signal in CF mimicked that elicited by P2Y2-R activation, the larger ΔCa2+i signal in CF does not depend on a specific class of GPCRs.P2Y2-R Number and P2Y2-R-dependent PLC Activation Are the Same in Normal and CF Airway Epithelia—We tested whether P2Y2-R expression was increased in CF. Because no antibodies or radioligands were available for P2Y2-R quantification, we used an RPA to assess P2Y2-R steady-state mRNA levels in 6–11-day-old primary culture monolayers of normal and CF bronchial airway epithelia. No difference was found in P2Y2-R mRNA levels from normal compared with CF human airway epithelia (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2P2Y2-R expression and P2Y2-R-PLC coupling efficiency are similar in normal and CF bronchial epithelial cultures.A, P2Y2-R steady-state mRNA levels from three different samples from short term primary culture monolayers of normal and CF human bronchial epithelia. B, P2Y2-R mRNA expression levels (corrected for actin mRNA levels) from the data shown in A (n = 3 for both groups). C, UTP-dependent PLC activity (the sum of IP3 metabolites (Ins-1-P, Ins-2-P, Ins(1,3,4)P3, Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4) in short term culture monolayers of normal and CF human primary bronchial epithelia. Inositol phosphate levels were normalized to IP6 and expressed as -fold increase over the inositol phosphate values in the absence of UTP. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 3 for both groups). CF and normal airway epithelial cells also showed similar levels of IP3, as well as Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, an inhibitor of Ca2+-activated Cl– channels (20Carew M.A. Yang X. Schultz C. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26906-66913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next investigated whether the larger Ca2+i mobilization in CF was driven by an enhanced PLC response to P2Y2-R activation. P2Y2-R-regulated PLC activity was assayed by measuring IP3 and the accumulation of its downstream metabolites in the presence of lithium to prevent recycling of inositol phosphates back to inositol (20Carew M.A. Yang X. Schultz C. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26906-66913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that PLC activation in response to a 5-min treatment with 100 μm apical UTP was not elevated in 6–11-day-old primary culture monolayers of CF (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that the larger ΔCa2+i in CF does not reflect increased P2Y2-R number or increased efficiency of P2Y2-R coupling to PLC.Apical ER Ca2+ Stores Are Functionally Increased in CF Airway Epithelia—We next addressed whether 6–11-day old monolayers of CF cultures exhibited an increased quantity of ER Ca2+ that could be mobilized in response to IP3 generation resulting from GPCR activation. To measure the Ca2+ storage capacity of the apical ER, a protocol was developed based on findings that ER Ca2+ stores are functionally confined to the plasma membrane domain ipsilateral to P2Y2-R activation (21Paradiso A.M. Mason S.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 6–11-Day-old normal and CF monolayers, bathed in bilateral nominally Ca2+-free buffer, were exposed to 100 μm basolateral UTP to deplete P2Y2-R-sensitive basolateral Ca2+ stores. Basolateral UTP increased Ca2+i to the same extent in both cultures (Fig. 3A), suggesting that basolateral ER Ca2+ store capacity was the same in normal and CF epithelia. Apical ER Ca2+ store capacity was then measured with perfusion with 0.6 mm bilateral La3+ to block plasma membrane Ca2+-AT-Pases and Ca2+ influx channels (22Paradiso A.M. Brown H.A. Ye H. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Exp. Lung Res. 1999; 25: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) followed by 1 μm apical thapsigargin (an ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor) to release Ca2+ from apical ER stores (23Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ca2+i rose and was sustained because of inhibition of the plasma membrane and ER Ca2+-ATPases by La3+ and thapsigargin, respectively (Fig. 3A). The greater rise in Ca2+i in CF (Fig. 3A) indicated that the quantity of Ca2+ sequestered in the apical ER was functionally greater in CF compared with normal bronchial epithelial cultures. Fig. 3B illustrates the summary ΔCa2+i data from these experiments. These results led us to speculate that the density of apical ER Ca2+ stores is increased in short term 6–11-day-old cultures of CF airway epithelia.Fig. 3The increased Ca2+i mobilization triggered by apical purinergic receptor activation in CF airway epithelia reflects larger apically confined functional ER Ca2+ stores.A, representative Ca2+i tracings depicting the Ca2+i responses to sequential exposure of basolateral UTP (to assess the capacity of UTP-releasable basolateral ER Ca2+ stores), bilateral (BL) La3+, and apical thapsigargin (TG) (to assess the capacity of apically confined ER Ca2+ stores) in short term primary culture monolayers of normal and CF human bronchial epithelia. Cultures were bilaterally perfused with a nominally Ca2+-free buffer throughout the entire experiment. B, compiled ΔCa2+i values (steady state-baseline Ca2+i) from the experiments shown in A (n = 4). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05, CF versus normal cultures.View Large Image"

Here, we test the hypothesis that Scl variant might interact with mammalian collagen-binding integrins. We show that the recombinant Scl protein p176 promotes adhesion and spreading of human lung fibroblast cells through an α2β1 integrin-mediated interaction as shown in cell adhesion inhibition assays using anti-α2β1 and anti-β1 integrins monoclonal antibodies. Accordingly, C2C12 cells stably expressing α2β1 integrin as the only collagen-binding integrin show productive cell adhesion activities on p176 that can be blocked by an anti-α2β1 integrin antibody. In addition, p176 promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK of C2C12 cells expressing α2β1 integrin, whereas parental cells do not. Furthermore, C2C12 adhesion of human lung fibroblast cells to p176 induces phosphorylation of p125FAK, p130CAS, and p68Paxillin proteins. In a domain swapping experiment, we show that integrin binds to the collagenous domain of the Scl protein. Moreover, the recombinant inserted domain of the α2 integrin interacts with p176 with a relatively high affinity (KD = 17 nm). Attempts to identify the integrin sites in p176 suggest that more than one site may be involved.

The collagens also contain C- and N-terminal noncollagenous domains, which often are proteolyzed during secretion from the cells (7.Pihlajaniemi T. Myllyla R. Alitalo K. Vaheri A. Kivirikko K.I.

The N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal cell wall associated regions are conserved between Scl1 and Scl2, whereas the variable (V) and the collagen-like (CL) regions differ significantly in length and primary sequence. In addition, Scl1, but not Scl2, contains a linker region between the CL and the cell wall regions, which is composed of highly conserved tandem repeats. It was previously shown that at least some Scl variants can form collagen-like triple helices, despite the lack of hydroxyprolines (21.Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Höök M. Lukomski S. J. Biol.

There are 18 distinct α subunits and 8 β subunits in mammals that combine to form 24 known heterodimers. Recent studies demonstrated that the so called inserted (I) domains of the α subunits of α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1 integrins mediate the interactions of these ECM receptors with collagens (29.Liddington R.

A general mechanism for integrin signaling has been established; for example, integrin ligation induces phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal and signaling molecules including FAK, PYK2, p72SYK, ILK-1, CAS, paxillin, SRC/FYN, and Shc (37.Yamada K.M.

Importantly, this interaction promotes cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, much like eukaryotic collagens. These studies, for the first time, show that collagen-like structure is functionally conserved in evolutionary distant organisms such as bacteria and humans.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Proteins—Recombinant proteins were subjected to the Strep-tag II expression and purification system (IBA-GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). The Scl2.28-based pSL163 construct encoding p163 polypeptide has been reported previously (21.Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Höök M. Lukomski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To prepare scl1.41-based pSL176 construct encoding recombinant p176 polypeptide, the DNA fragment of the scl1.41 allele (accession number AY452037) was amplified and cloned into an Escherichia coli vector pASK-IBA2 (42.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The pSL180 construct encodes p180 polypeptide, containing a glutamate to alanine (E → A) substitution within the GLPGER motif of p176 protein. Single-stranded DNA template of pSL176 harbored in E. coli CJ236 was prepared employing ori f1 present in the expression vector pASK-IBA2 as described. Oligonucleotide containing new ApaLI restriction site (5′-CCTTTAGGTCCTCTAGGTCCTCGTGCACCAGG-3′) was phosphorylated, annealed, and extended in vitro using T7 DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To identify mutants, the PCR products amplified directly from the E. coli colonies were digested by ApaLI restriction enzyme.For domain swapping, plasmid pSL163 was used as a core sequence. To prepare pSL181 construct encoding p181 polypeptide, DNA fragment encoding the V region of p176 was PCR-amplified and replaced into the corresponding V region of pSL163. Next, the DNA sequence of the CL region in pSL181 was replaced with a CL region sequence of pSL176. The resulting pSL182 construct contains the V and CL sequence of pSL176 but lacks its linker region. The constructs were subjected to DNA sequencing for correctness. Recombinant proteins were purified by Strep-Tactin-Sepharose affinity column, and their identity was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing.Rotary Shadowing and Electron Microscopy—The structural organization of the recombinant proteins was viewed by electron microscopy of the rotary-shadowed rScls, as previously described. Protein samples (100 μg/ml) were dialyzed against 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate and then mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 70% (v/v). The samples were atomized onto freshly cleaved mica sheets using an air brush and rotary-shadowed with platinum at an angle of 6 degrees. The replicas were backed with carbon at 90 degrees in a Balzers BAE250 vacuum evaporator. The replicas were floated from the mica in distilled water and placed on copper grids. Photomicrographs were taken with a Philips 410 Transmission electron microscope operated at 80 KV. α2-I domain binding to p176 was performed as described earlier. Shortly, recombinant proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1 m (NH4)2CO3, 1 mm MgCl2 and mixed at the α2-I:p176 (trimer) molar ratio of 4:1 in the same buffer. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 4 h. After that, the sample was mixed with glycerol and rotary-shadowed as described above.Circular dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—The triple helical conformation of recombinant rScls was analyzed by CD, as described previously (44.Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Höök A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The spectra were recorded on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a variable temperature unit. The samples were dissolved in 0.001× PBS, pH 7.4. The Measurements were taken with a 0.5-cm path length, and the data were integrated for 1 s at 0.2-nm intervals with a bandwidth of 1 nm. A wavelength scan was performed for each protein before unfolding (4 and 25 °C) and after unfolding (50 °C) or after subsequent refolding (4 °C, renatured).Reagents and Antibodies—Human fibronectin, type I and type IV collagen, control IgG, anti-α1 (TS2/7), anti-α2 (P1E6), anti-α3 (P1B5), anti-α5 (P1D6) integrin antibodies, and cell culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-FAK (2A7), anti-p130CAS, anti-paxillin, and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antiphospho-JNK and anti-phospho-FAK (Y397) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-αvβ3 (LM609) was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-β1 (4B4) integrin monoclonal antibody was procured from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).Cells and Cell Culture—Human lung fibroblast cell lines (MRC-5 and WI-38) were obtained from ATCC (CCL-171; CCL-75) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.4 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Parental mouse myoblast C2C12 (control cells) and C2C12 cells stably transfected with the human α2 integrin subunit (C2C12-α2+) were kindly provided by Dr. Donald Gullberg (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) and maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml puromycin, respectively. Methods for cell culture have been previously described (45.Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 46.Humtsoe J.O. Feng S. Thakker G.D. Yang J. Hong J. Wary K.K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1539-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting—The cells were washed in PBS, pH 7.4, and then dissociated with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, and washed twice in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. The cells were passed through a cell strainer and enumerated. The cells (2 × 106) were then incubated with saturating amounts of control mouse IgG or anti-human integrin adhesion-blocking monoclonal antibodies: anti-α1 (TS2/7), anti-α2 (P1E6), anti-α3 (P1B5), anti-αvβ3 (LM609), anti-α5 (P1D6), and anti-β1 (4B4) for 30 min at 4 °C. In all cases, secondary labeling was performed for 1 h at 4°C with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Molecular Probes). The cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 0.5% p-formaldehyde, and analyzed with the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).Cell Adhesion and Spreading Assays—Most cell adhesion assays were carried out in a 24-well tissue culture dish coated with specified substrates as has been described previously (46.Humtsoe J.O. Feng S. Thakker G.D. Yang J. Hong J. Wary K.K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1539-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the test substrates (Scl recombinant proteins) were prepared at a concentration of 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nm in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH.7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide) and coated onto sterile microplates overnight at 4 °C. Human fibronectin, type IV collagen, type I collagen, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μg/ml) were included as controls. BSA was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and heat-inactivated prior to use. After washing with PBS, the plates were saturated with 0.5% BSA for 60 min in a 37 °C CO2 incubator. Human lung fibroblast MRC-5 and WI-38 or C2C12 cells starved overnight in serum-free medium were detached in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.0025% trypsin. The cells were collected and resuspended in M199-defined medium containing appropriate antibiotics, 0.2% BSA, and 1× insulin/transferrin/selenium-A supplemented with 2 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm each of Ca2+/Mn2+. Saturated plates were washed, and 100 μl of cell suspension (0.15 × 106 cells/ml) was added and allowed to adhere. After 45 or 90 min, the unattached cells were gently removed and washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ before fixing in 3% p-formaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were then washed with cold 1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, refixed in 20% methanol for 10 min, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 5 min. The plates were gently washed with running distilled water and air-dried. The dye was then eluted in 100 μlof100 mm sodium citrate and absorbance was measured at 590 nm. To visualize cell spreading, p-formaldehyde-fixed cells were stained with eosin and hematoxylin solution. The images were captured in an inverted light microscope under 20× magnification. Alternatively, cells grown on coverslips under similar conditions were stained with FITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) to identify actin-stress fibers. A Zeiss Axiovert-125 fluoroscope was used for this purpose.Cell Adhesion Blocking Assay—For blocking assay, antibodies were dialyzed overnight in sterile 1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, at 4 °C to remove any traces of sodium azide and minor impurities. The integrity and concentration of antibodies were determined by 10% SDS-PAGE prior to experiment. The cell adhesion blocking assay has been previously described (46.Humtsoe J.O. Feng S. Thakker G.D. Yang J. Hong J. Wary K.K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1539-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, 70% confluent human lung fibroblast (MRC-5), parental C2C12, and C2C12-α2+ cells were washed in PBS, detached with in 2 mm EDTA, and washed. The cells were passed through a cell strainer and enumerated. Approximately 0.1 × 106 cells were incubated with 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml of anti-α1, anti-α2, anti-α3, anti-α5, anti-αvβ3, and anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibodies on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed and resuspended in defined medium. The dishes were precoated with 100 nm (considered optimal concentration; no further increase in cell adhesion was observed beyond 100 nm of p176 in prior experiments) p176 and subjected to cell adhesion assays at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The use of single dose (10 μg/ml) of anti-integrin monoclonal antibody for C2C12-α2+ cell adhesion blocking assay was considered optimal. Cold (4 °C) PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was used for washing cells. Statistical analyses were performed as previously described (46.Humtsoe J.O. Feng S. Thakker G.D. Yang J. Hong J. Wary K.K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1539-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Recombinant I Domain of α2 Integrin Subunit—Cloning, expression, and purification of the I domain of α2 integrin have been previously described (47.Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A. Moore D. Symerski J. Yang V.W.-C. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24906-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA fragment encoding the I domain of α2 integrin subunit was amplified by PCR from a human hepatoma cDNA library and subcloned into the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). The accuracy of the DNA sequence was verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing (Lonestar Laboratory, Houston, TX). Large scale expression and purification of the recombinant α2-I were carried out using Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography as previously described (44.Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—Measurements were performed at room temperature in a BIACORE 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (47.Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A. Moore D. Symerski J. Yang V.W.-C. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. J. Biol.

Briefly, p176Scl (990 response units) and p181Scl (717 response units) proteins were immobilized onto the flow cells on a CM5 chip. Different concentrations of α2-I proteins in 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% octyl-d-glucopyranoside were passed over these surfaces at 20 μl/min for 6 min. Regeneration of the Scl protein surface was achieved by running 10 μl of a solution of 0.01% SDS. Binding of α2-I to a reference flow cell, which had been activated and deactivated without the coupling of proteins, was also measured and subtracted from the binding to Scl protein-coated chips. SPR sensorgrams from different injections were overlaid using the BIAevaluation software (BIAcore AB). Data from the equilibrium portion of these sensorgrams were used for Scatchard analysis. Based on the correlation between the SPR response and change in soluble I domain protein binding to the immobilized Scl proteins, values for the binding ratio, νbound, and the concentration of free protein, [P]free, were calculated using the equations described previously (47.Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A. Moore D. Symerski J. Yang V.W.-C. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24906-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis was performed by plotting νbound/[P]free against νbound, in which the negative reciprocal of the slope is the dissociation constant, KD.Biochemical Methods—The cells were serum-starved overnight, detached, and maintained in suspension for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then replated onto dishes coated with indicated substrates at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After 30 or 60 min the cells were washed with cold PBS, pH 7.4, and solubilized in cell extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, with various protease inhibitors freshly added) for 30 min on ice. Extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations of the resulting lysates were determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. For immunoprecipitation analyses, the cell lysates were preadsorbed with mouse IgG-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and detection protocols were performed as described previously (45.Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 46.Humtsoe J.O. Feng S. Thakker G.D. Yang J. Hong J. Wary K.K.

For immunoprecipitation, 2–3 μg of antibodies were used for each sample. For immunoblotting analyses, the antibodies were prepared at a concentration of 0.5–2 μg/ml in 1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 3% BSA.RESULTSCharacterization of Recombinant Scl (rScl) Proteins—We recently demonstrated that two different rScl proteins, p144 derived from the Scl1.1 variant produced by the M1-type group A Streptococcus and p163 (Scl2.28) derived from the Scl2 variant of the M28-type group A Streptococcus, contain domains that form collagen-like triple helices, despite the lack of hydroxyproline commonly found in mammalian collagens and a significan"
https://openalex.org/W2054517572,"The CCAAT box is a prototypical promoter element, almost invariably found between –60 and –100 upstream of the major transcription start site. It is bound and activated by the histone fold trimer NF-Y. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on chip experiments on two different CpG islands arrays using chromatin from hepatic HepG2 and pre-B cell leukemia NALM-6 cell lines, with different protocols of probe preparation and labeling. We analyzed and classified 239 known or predicted targets; we validated several by conventional ChIPs with anti-YB and anti-YC antibodies, in vitro EMSAs, and ChIP scanning. The importance of NF-Y binding for gene expression was verified by the use of a dominant negative NF-YA mutant. All but four genes are new NF-Y targets, falling into different functional categories. This analysis reinforces the notion that NF-Y is an important regulator of cell growth, and novel unexpected findings emerged from this unbiased approach. (i) A remarkable proportion of NF-Y targets, 40%, are complex transcriptional units composed of divergent, convergent, and tandem promoters. (ii) 40–50% of NF-Y sites are not in core promoters but are in introns or at distant 3′ or 5′ locations. The abundance of “unorthodox” CCAAT positions highlights an unexpected complexity of the NF-Y-mediated transcriptional network.

The abundance of “unorthodox” CCAAT positions highlights an unexpected complexity of the NF-Y-mediated transcriptional network. The CCAAT box is a DNA element that controls transcriptional initiation in eukaryotic promoters; recent bioinformatic studies unambiguously identify it as one of the most widespread. The analysis on 1031 human promoters isolated through unbiased determination of mRNA start sites suggested that the CCAAT box or its reverse ATTGG is present in as many as 67% of promoters (1.Suzuki Y. Tsunoda T. Sese J. Taira H. Mizushima-Sugano J. Hata H. Ota T. Isogai T. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Suyama A. Sakaki Y. Morishita S. Okubo K. Sugano S. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A statistical, unbiased analysis of random octanucleotides on a large 13,000-promoter data set confirmed that the CCAAT is second only to the Sp1-binding GC box in terms of abundance, despite the fact that the percentage of CCAAT promoters was inferior, 7.5% (2.FitzGerald P.C. Shlyakhtenko A. Mir A.A. Vinson C. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1562-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of cell cycle-regulated genes identified the CCAAT box as specifically present in promoters of G2/M genes (3.Elkon R. Linhart C. Sharan R. Shamir R. Shiloh Y. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Most importantly, specific flanking nucleotides emerging from these studies matched specifically the consensus of the NF-Y transcription factor. A combination of EMSAs and transfections with highly diagnostic dominant negative vectors implicated NF-Y as the CCAAT activator (4.Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). It is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, all necessary for sequence-specific binding to a G/A, G/A, C, C, A, A, T, C/G, A/G, G/C consensus. NF-YB and NF-YC contain evolutionarily conserved histone fold motifs common to all core histones, mediating dimerization, a feature strictly required for NF-YA association and sequence-specific DNA binding (5.Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B.

NF-Y is considered as a general promoter organizer: thanks to its histone-like nature, it presets chromatin structure locally (8.Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), interfacing well with nucleosomes (9.Coustry F. Hu Q. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol.

The location of the CCAAT box is far from random, being positioned between –60 and –100 in the vast majority of the promoters analyzed. In general, our knowledge of the anatomy of NF-Y-binding sites in terms of flanking sequences, position with respect to transcriptional start sites, and promoter context (6.Romier C. Cocchiarella F.

Dey A. Sacchi A. Ozato K. Piaggio G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, binding to cell cycle-regulated promoters is not constitutive but is time-regulated, being found before activation and displaced when promoters are repressed (10.Caretti G. Salsi V. Vecchi C. Imbriano C. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30435-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conditional knock-out experiments of CBF-B (NF-YA) unambiguously determined that the protein is required for cell proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblasts and mouse development (15.Bhattacharya A. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8167-8172PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of 130 mammalian CCAAT-containing promoters suggests a prevalence in genes that are active in a tissue- or development-specific way and in inducible genes, either by external stimuli or during the cell cycle (7.Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Whereas this is certainly informative, very little information exists as to the binding to other regions. Finding all genes targeted by a particular transcription factor is crucial to reconstruct its transcriptional network. To expand our knowledge of NF-Y binding in vivo, a valuable approach is to use DNA derived from ChIPs to probe microarrays. DNA arrays have been developed in which clones derived from a CpG island library have been spotted (16.Cross S.H. Charlton J.A. Nan X. Bird A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); CpG islands have long been known to be associated to regulatory elements in promoters (17.Ioshikhes I.P. Zhang M.Q. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and also elsewhere in the genome. They are believed to be mainly associated to “housekeeping” genes (i.e. genes active in all cells), albeit at different levels (reviewed in Ref. 18.Antequera F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To gain a wider understanding of the NF-Y transcriptional circuitry, we took a high throughput genomic approach by screening with anti-YB chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA two CpG island arrays. The procedure for ChIP was essentially as described previously (10.Caretti G. Salsi V. Vecchi C. Imbriano C. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30435-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Rabbit polyclonal anti-YB and anti-YC antibodies were derived by purification of the corresponding sera on affinity columns containing purified recombinant NF-YB or NF-YC linked to CnBr-Sepharose (Sigma). Nalm-6 and HepG2 cells, grown in RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, were treated by adding formaldehyde directly to tissue culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were used for each immunoprecipitation. Cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of phosphate-buffered saline-glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min. Cells were then resuspended in cell lysis buffer (5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (100 ng/ml aprotinin and 100 ng/ml leupeptin) and 0.5 mm PMSF and kept on ice for 15 min. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (B pestel) several times, and the resultant homogenates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the nuclei. The pellets were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid) containing protease inhibitors and PMSF and kept on ice for 20 min. The nuclear lysates were sonicated on ice to an average chromatin length of 2–2.5 kb and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 500 mm LiCl) containing protease inhibitors and PMSF, with Protein G-agarose (KPL) for 2 h at 4 °C in rotation. After removal of Protein G-agarose, the precleared lysates were used as soluble chromatin for ChIP. Chromatin was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 4 μg of anti-NF-YB or anti-NF-YC antibodies. No antibody and anti-FLAG (Sigma) control samples were included. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with Protein G-agarose previously precleared in IP buffer (1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/μl salmon testis DNA, protease inhibitors, and PMSF). To perform a second immunoprecipitation, 30 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) were added, and the recovered material was diluted with 270 μl of IP buffer. 2 μgof the second antibody were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The recovery proceeded as in the first IP reaction. Reversal of formaldehyde cross-linking, RNase A, and Proteinase K treatments were performed as previously described (19.Caretti G. Cocchiarella F. Sidoli C. Villard J. Peretti M. Reith W. Mantovani R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Data validation was performed with conventional ChIPs (10.Caretti G. Salsi V. Vecchi C. Imbriano C. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30435-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), with chromatin of 0.8 kb and with anti-YB as well as anti-YC purified polyclonal antibodies. The sequence of PCR primers used to analyze the genes reported in Fig. 2 are shown in Supplemental Table I. DNAs from 20–30 individual ChIPs were used to generate a probe for array screening. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was used as template for random priming reactions in the presence of 10 mm amino allyl-UTP (Sigma catalog no. A-0410) using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). The DNAs were desalted and concentrated with a Microcon YM30 filter column (Millipore Corp.) and then lyophilized. After resuspension in water, amino allyl-dUTP-labeled chromatin was coupled with Cy5 dye (Amersham Biosciences) solubilized in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, for 1 h in the dark. After the addition of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, DNAs were purified with QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and lyophilized. The generation of amplicons from individual ChIPs was performed following the protocols of LM-PCR described in Refs. 20.Oberley M.J. Inman D.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42466-42476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 21.Oberley M.J. Tsao J. Yau P. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 315-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. Briefly, two unidirectional linkers (oligonucleotide JW102, 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′; oligonucleotide JW103, 5′-GAATTCAGATC-3′) were annealed and ligated to the chromatin IPs, previously blunted by T4 DNA polymerase. The first amplicons were generated by PCR (one cycle at 55 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 15 cycles at 95 °C for 30 min, 55 °C for min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension of 4 min at 72 °C). The reaction was purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) or the GFX PCR purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of these initial reactions were used to generate more amplicons, using the same PCR program for a subsequent 30 cycles. After purification of these last rounds of amplification, the DNA was quantified and examined by gene-specific PCR to ensure that the initial enrichment was maintained. 5 μg of amplicons for α-NF-YB, α-FLAG, and input DNA (subjected to the same number of PCR manipulations as the IPs) were labeled using the LabelIT Cy5/Cy3 nucleic acid labeling kit (Mirus), following the manufacturer's instructions, with a reagent/DNA ratio of 2.5 for Cy5 (IPs) and 1.5 for Cy3 (input). 7776 CpG Array—The development of the 7776 CpG island array was described previously (21.Oberley M.J. Tsao J. Yau P. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 315-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22.Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Prior to hybridization, spotted CpG island slides were incubated with a solution of 3× SSC, 0.25% SDS, and 1.5 μg/μl salmon testis DNA under a glass coverslip at 37 °C for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. Slides were washed twice with water and dried for 5 min at 600 rpm in a centrifuge. Labeled DNAs were added to hybridization buffer (0.25 m NaPO4, 4.5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× SSC), denatured at 95 °C for 2 min, cooled to 60 °C, and dropped onto slides placed in prewarmed hybridization chambers. Incubation was performed at 60 °C overnight. After hybridization, the slides were washed successively at 50 °C with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature with 1× SSC (0.1%) and at room temperature with 0.2 SSC for 5 min each and then dried. Hybridized slides were scanned with the GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon), and the acquired images were analyzed with the software GenePix Pro, Version 3.0. A global normalization factor was determined for each replica, evaluating the anti-NF-YB ChIP Cy5/control ChIP Cy5 ratio relative to control repetitive elements. Data were normalized prior to comparison. After normalization, positive loci were defined by hybridization intensities at least 2 times greater than that of control. 12K Array—The Cy5- and Cy3-labeled DNA were each resuspended in 10 μl of 1 μg/μl Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and mixed together in order to have the same amount of input Cy3-labeled DNA for each IP Cy5-labeled DNA. The hybridization solution was then added to a final composition of 43% formamide, 4.3× SSPE, 0.42% SDS, 42 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 0.2 μg of tRNA, heated for 2 min at 95 °C and cooled down to 37 °C over 30 min. 95 μl of each mixture solution was applied to two human CpG 12K slides (University Health Network, The Microarray Center, Toronto, Canada) and hybridized at 37 °C for >18 h. The slides were prehybridized for 1 h at42 °C with 25% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 10 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. The slides were washed at room temperature for 5 min twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; once in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS; and one final time in 0.1× SSC; dried; and immediately scanned using a ScanArray 4000 scanner (Packard). The hybridized microarrays were analyzed using the Quantarray microarray analysis software (Packard). Features of poor intensity (<500) and those that did not meet the quality control criteria (visual inspection, spot circularity, spot uniformity, and background uniformity for both channels) were discarded. After the background subtraction for each spot, the data were normalized to median (i.e. the ratio of the median value of all spots in the Cy5 channel (IP DNA) was normalized to the ratio of the median value of the control channel (Cy3 = input)). From a direct comparison of the arrays hybridized with the DNA of the α-NF-YB IP and the α-FLAG IP, only the spots that showed an enrichment >2-fold in the YB samples were further analyzed. Two independent experiments were performed, each consisting of one α-NF-YB IP and one control α-FLAG IP slide, normalized to the same input DNA, and the commonly enriched spots were considered. Positive clones were sequenced and mapped with BLAT. The presence of CCAAT sequences were searched for 2 kb on the flanking of the 7776 CpG island array and 500 bp on the 12K array, annotated in individual files corresponding to the genomic loci identified. The criteria for classifications are described below. Mouse orthologs were retrieved using BLAT. The annotated genes were classified according to functional categories, and the classification was compared with those performed on the MYC and E2F4 targets. HepG2 cells were infected with control green fluorescent protein, wild type NF-YA, or dominant negative YAm29 adenovirus. 2Imbriano, C., Gurtner, A., Cocchiarella, F., Di Agostino, S., Basile, V., Gostissa, M., Dobbelstein, M., Del Sal, G., Piaggio G., and Mantovani, R. (2005) Mol Cell Biol., in press Adenovirus vectors to express NF-YA or the YAm29 dominant negative mutant were generated using AdEasy, using HindIII and XbaI from the corresponding pcDNA3-based vectors, and introduced into the same sites of the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. This plasmid was recombined with the vector pAdEasy1, followed by treatment with PacI and transfection into an E1-complementing cell line. We infected exponentially growing cells for 7 h in the absence of serum. Fetal calf serum was then added, and cells were incubated for 48 h. RNA was extracted using an RNA-Easy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For cDNA synthesis, 4 μg of RNA were used with the M-MLV-RT kit (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR analysis was performed with oligonucleotides detailed in Supplemental Table II. EMSA analyses of Fig. 3 were performed under standard NF-Y conditions (6.Romier C. Cocchiarella F.

The samples were loaded on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel, run for 2 h, dried, and exposed. To produce recombinant NF-Y, Escherichia coli BL21 DE3LysS was induced at an A600 value of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 3 h. Bacterial pellets were resuspended and sonicated in sonication buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF (Sigma), and protein inhibitors) and centrifuged at 23,000 × g in a Beckman SW 27Ti rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The inclusion bodies pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged again. Inclusion bodies were finally resuspended in 6 m guanidium chloride, 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF. The three subunits were mixed to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and dialyzed against a 100-fold excess of BC300 (300 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF); glycerol concentration was adjusted to 20%, and proteins were loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, washed with BC300, and eluted with 0.25 m imidazole. The proteins were finally dialyzed against BC100, the purity being routinely >80%. Our goal was to identify novel targets of NF-Y in an unbiased way. The combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray analysis was performed in yeast (24.Ren B. Robert F. Wyrick J.J. Aparicio O. Jennings E.G. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Schreiber J.

In particular, DNA microarrays containing genomic fragments with CpG islands, often corresponding to regulatory regions, were probed with DNA recovered from chromatin immunoprecipitated using MYC, E2F4/6, and methyl CpG binding domain protein antibodies. We decided to take the same route and used two different reagents: a 7776 array and a 12K array from UHN (Toronto, Canada). We also tested two different ways of preparing probes for hybridization. For the 7776 array, we prepared several sequential ChIPs with chromatin from the liver HepG2 cell line, with a highly specific anti-NF-YB antibody, and, in parallel, control ChIPs with a commercially available anti-FLAG control. The chromatin used in this procedure was larger (∼2–2.5 kb) than the one used in conventional ChIPs (0.5–1 kb). Because of the modifications of our routine ChIPs with extended chromatin, we first verified whether immunoprecipitated DNAs were indeed enriched in NF-Y-targeted fragments. We used oligonucleotides amplifying several CCAAT-containing promoters in semiquantitative PCRs. Fig. 1A shows that essentially all of the promoters tested were clearly positive in the anti-YB ChIP, compared with the FLAG and no antibody controls: the liver-specific genes αGA, MVK, OAT, and mATP synthase and the ubiquitous HnRNPA1, NP95, PPP1R7, HMGB2, ABL, CDC25A, β-actin, and OGG1. Note that only the last two genes were previously known to be regulated by NF-Y (31.Danilition S.L. Frederickson R.M. Taylor C.Y. Miyamoto N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32.Gowri P.M. Yu J.H. Shaufl A. Sperling M.A. Menon R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas all of the others were derived from a CCAAT-containing promoter data set. 3A. Testa and R. Mantovani, manuscript in preparation. In parallel ChIP analysis, CCAAT-less promoters, p107, α-tubulin, RPS19, and YBL1, were negative (Fig. 1A, lower panel). For the 12K hybridization, we took a different approach, by PCR-amplifying chromatin from Nalm-6 cells after ligation of linker DNA. The advantage is that a very limited amount of ChIP material is required to yield enough DNA for hybridization. We also checked that the successive rounds of PCR amplifications would not decrease the enrichment of bona fide NF-Y targets in the amplicons. Indeed, Fig. 1B shows that the NF-YA promoter amplicon is no less, and in fact probably more, enriched in the final LM-PCR chromatin compared with the initial starting material. Therefore, we conclude that both of these procedures yield sufficiently enriched DNA for further genomic analysis. Results of the 7776 Array—We used DNAs from 20–30 individual ChIPs to generate probes for the 7776 array screening. We identified at least 230 spots, in which the corrected signal obtained with the NF-YB chromatin was at least 2-fold higher than the anti-FLAG signal. We sequenced all positive clones and derived their chromosomal localizations. A positive clone will indicate that a bound NF-Y site lies somewhere within 2.5 kb of the CpG island. The genomic sequences surrounding the CpG island were therefore scrutinized for the presence of CCAAT sequences for a length of 2 kb on either sides. Table I shows a list of the positive clones. Several criteria helped us to classify them as follows.Table IClassification of NF-Y-targeted genes Open table in a new tab Flanking sequences are essential for high affinity NF-Y binding both at the 5′ and 3′ of the pentanucleotide, with a variation of 2 logs in Kd in vitro, between high and low affinity sites (for details, see Refs. 6.Romier C.

https://openalex.org/W2065446100,"Mutations in the autoimmune regulator protein AIRE1 cause a monogenic autosomal recessively inherited disease: autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). AIRE1 is a multidomain protein that harbors two plant homeodomain (PHD)-type zinc fingers. The first PHD finger of AIRE1 is a mutational hot spot, to which several pathological point mutations have been mapped. Using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, we determined the solution structure of the first PHD finger of AIRE1 (AIRE1-PHD1), and characterized the peptide backbone mobility of the domain. We performed a conformational analysis of pathological AIRE1-PHD1 mutants that allowed us to rationalize the structural impact of APECED-causing mutations and to identify an interaction site with putative protein ligands of the AIRE1-PHD1 domain. The structure unequivocally exhibits the canonical PHD finger fold, with a highly conserved tryptophan buried inside the structure. The PHD finger is stabilized by two zinc ions coordinated in an interleaved (cross-brace) scheme. This zinc coordination resembles RING finger domains, which can function as E3 ligases in the ubiquitination pathway. Based on this fold similarity, it has been suggested that PHD fingers might also function as E3 ligases, although this hypothesis is controversial. At variance to a previous report, we could not find any evidence that AIRE1-PHD1 has an intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, nor detect any direct interaction between AIRE1-PHD1 and its putative cognate E2. Consistently, we show that the AIRE1-PHD1 structure is clearly distinct from the RING finger fold. Our results point to a function of the AIRE1-PHD1 domain in protein-protein interactions, which is impaired in some APECED mutations."

In addition to their ability to improve glucose homeostasis, TZDs also exert anti-proliferative effects by a mechanism that is unclear. Our laboratory has shown that two TZDs, ciglitazone and troglitazone, rapidly induce calcium-dependent p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in liver epithelial cells. Here, we further characterize the mechanism responsible for p38 MAPK activation by PPARγ ligands and correlate this with the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Specifically, we show that TZDs rapidly activate the ER stress-responsive pancreatic eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinase or PKR (double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase/pancreatic eIF2α kinase, and that activation of these kinases is correlated with subsequent eIF2α phosphorylation. Interestingly, PPARγ ligands not only activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) 2-fold over control, but the selective CaMKII inhibitor, KN-93, attenuated MKK3/6 and p38 as well as PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation. Although CaMKII was not affected by inhibition of PKR with 2-aminopurine, phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 as well as eIF2α were significantly reduced. Collectively, these data provide evidence that CaMKII is a regulator of PKR-dependent p38 and eIF2α phosphorylation in response to ER calcium depletion by TZDs. Furthermore, using structural derivatives of TZDs that lack PPARγ ligand-binding activity as well as a PPARγ antagonist, we show that activation of these kinase signaling pathways is PPARγ-independent.

Mizuno K. Imamiya E. Sugiyama Y. Fujita T. Kawamatsu Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1982; 30: 3580-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The TZDs have since grown to include three other members, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, which function to improve metabolic control in patients with type II diabetes by increasing insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver (2Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Following their discovery, it was learned that TZDs are ligands for the gamma isoform of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) (3Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A.

From this, it was understood that these agents exert their insulin-sensitizing effects primarily through PPARγ-dependent transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and energy balance. In addition to their ability to promote effective glycemic control, TZDs have also been shown to exert growth inhibitory effects in multiple cell and animal models (4Kubota T. Koshizuka K.

This is consistent with the observation that PPARγ is both necessary and sufficient to promote adipocyte differentiation (8Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). However, the sensitivity of various cell lines to TZD-induced growth inhibition does not correlate with levels of PPARγ expression (9Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Martin K.J. Zhang M. Fletcher C. Singer S. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 465-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). This suggests that TZDs have distinct PPARγ-independent effects that are important for these additional, unanticipated mechanisms of action. In support of this hypothesis, troglitazone was shown to equally inhibit proliferation of both PPARγ–/– and PPARγ+/+ mouse embryonic stem cells (10Palakurthi S.S. Aktas H. Grubissich L.M. Mortensen R.M. Halperin J.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6213-6218PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, structural derivatives of ciglitazone and troglitazone that lack PPARγ ligand-binding activity were demonstrated to prevent growth of prostate cancer cells. 2C.-W. Shiau, C.-C. Yang, S. K. Kulp, K.-F. Chen, C.-S. Chen, J.-W. Huang, and C.-S. Chen. (2005) Cancer Res.4, in press. Interestingly, these derivatives exhibited more potent growth inhibitory effects than their parent analogs. Collectively, these data support the growing list of evidence that TZDs have potentially important PPARγ-independent or “non-genomic” effects. Both our laboratory and others have shown that TZDs influence mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity (11Gardner O.S. Dewar B.J. Earp H.S. Samet J.M. Graves L.M. J. Biol.

The three best characterized mammalian MAPKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), are known to play important roles in coordinating a variety of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and, in some cases, apoptosis (15Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3509) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated via a three-tiered, phospho-relay mechanism whereby a MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK or MEKK) phosphorylates an MAPK kinase (MKK or MEK), which subsequently phosphorylates a MAPK. For example, p38 is selectively phosphorylated by MKK3 and MKK6 (16Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 17Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar); on the other hand, multiple MEKKs are known to converge on a particular MKK (18Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). This increases the complexity and selectivity of these signaling pathways such that distinct MAPK cascades can be activated both independently and simultaneously in a stimulus-specific manner. In general, the Erk pathway is activated primarily by mitogens, whereas JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. Activation of MAPKs results in phosphorylation of transcription factors that increase the expression of target genes. Thus, in addition to their PPARγ ligand-binding activity, the ability of TZDs to induce MAPK phosphorylation may represent an additional pathway by which these agents affect cell growth and differentiation. It is therefore important to understand how these agents induce MAPK signaling as well as to determine the role of PPARγ in this process. We previously characterized the mechanism by which ciglitazone and troglitazone acutely activate members of the MAPK family in GN4 rat liver epithelial cells (11Gardner O.S. Dewar B.J. Earp H.S. Samet J.M. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46261-46269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data suggest that PPARγ is not required for TZD-induced MAPK phosphorylation. In the current study, we have utilized the aforementioned structural derivatives of ciglitazone and troglitazone that are devoid of PPARγ ligand-binding activity in addition to a PPARγ antagonist to provide definitive evidence that MAPK activation by TZDs in GN4 cells is indeed PPARγ-independent. Additionally, we have further characterized the mechanism responsible for p38 activation by TZDs and provide evidence suggesting a link between p38 activation and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Materials—The thiazolidinediones ciglitazone and troglitazone, PP2, PP3, and KN-93 were purchased from Biomol. Δ2-Ciglitazone and Δ2-troglitazone, TZD derivatives with attenuated PPARγ ligand-binding activity, were synthesized as described. 2C.-W. Shiau, C.-C. Yang, S. K. Kulp, K.-F. Chen, C.-S. Chen, J.-W.

Anti-Pyk2 monoclonal antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-EGFR C-terminal polyclonal antibody (#22) and anti-Pyk2 C-terminal polyclonal antibody (#72) were generated as previously described (19Li X.L. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S.

Cell Culture—GN4 rat liver epithelial cells were grown in Richter's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin as detailed earlier (23Earp H.S.

A549 human lung carcinoma cells were purchased from ATCC and similarly propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient mixture F-12 (1/1) supplemented with serum and antibiotics as above as well as 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate and 2 mm l-glutamine. Prior to experiments, cells at 70–80% confluency were serum-starved overnight in the appropriate medium containing 0.1% FBS. Cell Lysate Preparation—Following stimulation for the times indicated, media was aspirated and the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then scraped into ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 9.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) with freshly added 200 μm Na3VO4, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 nm microcystin. To analyze changes in PERK, PKR, and eIF2α phosphorylation, cells were lysed in ice-cold HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Immunoblotting—In a typical experiment, 10 μg of cell lysate was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min to denature proteins. Lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE on Novex pre-cast 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Immunoblots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed 3× with TBST, and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were then developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by autoradiography (X-Omat Blue film, Eastman Kodak). In certain instances, membranes were stripped in buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 55 °C for 30 min and reprobed with another antibody. Immunoprecipitation—Following stimulation, cells were rinsed as described above and scraped into ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer without SDS. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation. 300 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated by incubation with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C under slight agitation. Fifteen microliters of Protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to each sample, which were then incubated an additional hour at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by brief centrifugation and washed four times in ice-cold lysis buffer. Remaining wash buffer was carefully removed with a Hamilton syringe. Immune complexes were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. In Vitro CaMKII Kinase Assay—CaMKII kinase activity in stimulated GN4 cells was measured using a commercial CaMKII assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modification. Briefly, CaMKII was immunoprecipitated from 400 μg of cell lysate in HEPES binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) by overnight incubation with an anti-CaMKII antibody (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CaMKII activity present in immune complexes was assessed by measuring the transfer of the γ-phosphate of [γ-32P]ATP to a specific CaMKII substrate peptide for 10 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated substrate was then separated from residual [γ-32P]ATP using P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) and quantified with a scintillation counter. Src-dependent Activation of EGFR and Erk by Ciglitazone Does Not Require PPARγ—Previously, we have shown that ciglitazone-induced Erk phosphorylation in rat liver epithelial (GN4) cells required Src-dependent EGFR transactivation (11Gardner O.S. Dewar B.J. Earp H.S. Samet J.M. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46261-46269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Src kinase activity was unaffected by a PPARγ antagonist suggesting that ciglitazone activates this signaling pathway via a non-genomic mechanism. We recently obtained derivatives of two thiazolidinediones, Δ2-ciglitazone and Δ2-troglitazone (Fig. 1), which completely lack PPARγ ligand-binding activity. 2C.-W. Shiau, C.-C. Yang, S. K. Kulp, K.-F. Chen, C.-S. Chen, J.-W. Huang, and C.-S. Chen. (2005) Cancer Res.4, in press. Because pharmacological inhibitors often have nonspecific effects, we tested whether Δ2-ciglitazone retained the ability to activate EGFR and Erk in GN4 cells. Similar to ciglitazone, treatment of GN4 cells with Δ2-ciglitazone induced rapid, robust EGFR phosphorylation that correlated with Erk activation (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, Δ2-troglitazone failed to significantly activate EGFR and Erk, consistent with our previous finding that troglitazone was a much weaker Erk activator than ciglitazone in GN4 cells (11Gardner O.S. Dewar B.J. Earp H.S. Samet J.M. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46261-46269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the Δ2-derivatives act similarly to their parent compounds with respect to EGFR and Erk phosphorylation.Fig. 2Δ2-Ciglitazone potently activates the EGFR and Erk, whereas Δ2-troglitazone does not. Rat liver epithelial cells (GN4) were grown to near confluency and starved overnight in media containing 0.1% FBS. Cells were stimulated with ciglitazone, Δ2-ciglitazone, troglitazone, Δ2-troglitazone (50 μm), or Me2SO (DMSO, 0.1%) for 10 min. A, EGFR was immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysates, and samples from immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The immunoblots (IB) were probed with a pan anti-phosphotyrosine anti-body, PY99, or an anti-EGFR antibody. Blots were developed with ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by autoradiography. B, changes in Erk phosphorylation were assessed by immunoblot following resolution of cell lysates by SDS-PAGE using an anti-phospho Erk (p-Erk) antibody. The blots were stripped and reprobed using antibodies directed against total Erk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Src is required for EGFR transactivation and down-stream Erk phosphorylation by ciglitazone (11Gardner O.S. Dewar B.J. Earp H.S. Samet J.M. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46261-46269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we tested whether this kinase played a similar, necessary role in signaling events following exposure to Δ2-ciglitazone. Using an anti-body that recognizes the EGFR when phosphorylated at Tyr845, a putative Src-specific phosphorylation site (24Biscardi J.S. Maa M.-C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.-H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), we observed that Δ2-ciglitazone, like ciglitazone, induced Tyr845 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Pretreatment of cells with PP2, a selective Src kinase inhibitor, completely blocked Δ2-ciglitazone-induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr845 as well as downstream Erk activation. In contrast, pretreatment of cells with PP3, a pharmacologically inactive analog of PP2, did not affect the ability of Δ2-ciglitazone to induce either EGFR or Erk phosphorylation. Thus, these data show that EGFR transactivation as well as Erk phosphorylation by Δ2-ciglitazone requires Src. Collectively, these findings corroborate our earlier studies using a PPARγ antagonist and, importantly, provide additional evidence that TZDs activate PPARγ-independent kinase signaling pathways in GN4 cells. Δ2-Thiazolidinediones Are Less Effective Activators of the p38 MAPK Pathway—In addition to their effects on the EGFR and Erk, we previously showed that both ciglitazone and troglitazone rapidly activate p38 in GN4 cells (11Gardner O.S. Dewar B.J. Earp H.S. Samet J.M. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46261-46269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PPARγ ligand-induced p38 phosphorylation occurred in an EGFR-independent manner and was instead correlated with increases in intracellular calcium and activation of the calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2. Here, we tested whether Δ2-ciglitazone and Δ2-troglitazone retained the ability to similarly activate Pyk2 and p38. Interestingly, both of the Δ2-derivatives showed significantly reduced efficacy in activating p38 when compared with the parent compounds (Fig. 4A). Examination of MKK3/6, the MAP kinase kinase immediately upstream of p38, and Pyk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) revealed similar findings; Δ2-ciglitazone and Δ2-troglitazone failed to activate these kinases as strongly as ciglitazone and troglitazone, respectively. To further evaluate the role of PPARγ in TZD-dependent p38 activation, we pretreated GN4 cells with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 prior to stimulation with ciglitazone, troglitazone, or their respective Δ2-derivatives. GW9662 failed to inhibit the ability of ciglitazone or troglitazone to activate MKK3/6 and p38 (Fig. 4C). Importantly, co-treatment of GN4 cells with GW9662 and either of the Δ2-TZDs did not potentiate the lack of effect on MKK3/6 and p38 phosphorylation in response to these derivatives alone. Together, these findings suggest that TZD-induced p38 phosphorylation, like Erk activation, is also PPARγ-independent. In support of this hypothesis, structurally related TZDs and more potent PPARγ agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, were unable to activate p38 MAPK in GN4 cells (data not shown). Role of Pyk2 as an Upstream Activator of p38—Because our previous studies suggested a link between Pyk2 and p38 MAPK, we further examined if activation of Pyk2 was necessary for the effects of PPARγ ligands on p38 phosphorylation. Specifically, GN4 cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding either bacterial β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) or a C-terminal inhibitory form of Pyk2 (Ad.CRNK) prior to stimulation with PPARγ ligands. CRNK represents an alternative potential splice variant of Pyk2 (21Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which functions to negatively regulate endogenous Pyk2 autophosphorylation (25Li X. Dy R. Cance W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II-dependent Pyk2 phosphorylation in GN4 cells was reduced to near basal levels following infection with increasing amounts of Ad.CRNK with maximal inhibition observed using 4 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml, a titer that also produced significant CRNK expression (data not shown). Therefore, this dose was used in subsequent studies. Although Ad.lacZ had no affect on PPARγ ligand-dependent Pyk2 phosphorylation, overexpression of CRNK significantly blunted Pyk2 activation by both ciglitazone and troglitazone (Fig. 5A). Immunoblots from the same lysates revealed that, in contrast to Pyk2, CRNK failed to prevent activation of either MKK3/6 or p38 MAPK (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that independent but parallel, calcium-regulated signaling pathways activate Pyk2 and p38 in this cell type. CaMKII but Not PKC Is Required for MKK3/6 and p38 Activation by PPARγ Ligands—Our earlier work with BAPTA-AM showed that intracellular calcium was required for both Pyk2 and p38 activation in response to PPARγ ligands (11Gardner O.S. Dewar B.J. Earp H.S. Samet J.M. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46261-46269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Yet, PPARγ agonist-induced MKK3/6 and p38 phosphorylations are unaffected by adenoviral-mediated overexpression of a Pyk2 dominant negative, conditions that prevented Pyk2 activation in response to these drugs. Together, these findings suggest that an additional calcium-activated kinase is induced by PPARγ ligands, ultimately leading to p38 phosphorylation. Similar to Pyk2, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and the classic protein kinase Cs (PKCα, -β, and -γ) represent other calcium-regulated kinases that could be activated by PPARγ ligands. To test the involvement of PKC in p38 activation by PPARγ agonists, classic PKCs were depleted by chronic exposure of GN4 cells to TPA. Although PKC depletion completely prevented transient, TPA-dependent Erk activation (data not shown), ciglitazone and troglitazone-induced p38 phosphorylation was not affected (Fig. 6A). This result suggests that classic PKCs are not involved in PPARγ ligand-dependent p38 activation. To determine whether CaMKII is necessary for p38 phosphorylation in response to PPARγ agonists, the ability of ciglitazone and troglitazone to activate p38 in the presence of the selective CaMKII inhibitor, KN-93 (26Sumi K. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), was evaluated. Interestingly, pretreatment of GN4 cells with KN-93 blocked both MKK3/6 as well as p38 activation by PPARγ ligands (Fig. 6B). These effects were specific for KN-93, because KN-92, a pharmacologically inactive analog of KN-93, did not prevent activation of these kinases. Further, the ability of ciglitazone and troglitazone to directly stimulate CaMKII activity was examined. CaMKII was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and in vitro kinase assays were performed using a specific substrate peptide. Ciglitazone and troglitazone significantly increased CaMKII activity 2-fold over vehicle control within 10 min, a time that coincides with maximal p38 phosphorylation (Table I). Consistent with its documented ability to directly inhibit CaMKII (26Sumi K. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), KN-93 significantly blunted PPARγ ligand-induced CaMKII activation. In contrast to its effects on CaMKII, MKK3/6, and p38, KN-93 failed to prevent TZD-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these findings support our hypothesis that CaMKII, and not Pyk2, acts upstream of MKK3/6 and p38 in this signaling pathway.Table IActivation of CaMKII by PPARγ ligands and their Δ2-derivativesCaMKII activityTreatment-Fold × Me2SOpCig 1.5′1.09 ± 0.22aDenotes statistical significant differences from ciglitazone or troglitazone (10-min treatments) as appropriate (p < 0.01; one-way ANOVA).0.002Cig 5′1.40 ± 0.050.06Cig 10′1.97 ± 0.44Cig + KN-931.38 ± 0.22bDenotes stat"
https://openalex.org/W2073931970,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that regulates tissue-specific gene expression in the kidney and other epithelial organs. Mutations of HNF-1β produce congenital cystic abnormalities of the kidney, and previous studies showed that HNF-1β regulates the expression of the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) gene, Pkhd1. Here we show that the C-terminal region of HNF-1β contains an activation domain that is functional when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. An HNF-1β deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal domain interacts with wild-type HNF-1β, binds DNA, and functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of a chromosomally integrated Pkhd1 promoter. The activation of the Pkhd1 promoter by wild-type HNF-1β is stimulated by sodium butyrate or coactivators CREB (cAMP-response element)-binding protein (CBP) and P/CAF. The interaction with CBP and P/CAF requires the C-terminal domain. Expression of an HNF-1β C-terminal deletion mutant in transgenic mice produces renal cysts, increased cell proliferation, and dilatation of the ureter similar to mice with kidney-specific inactivation of HNF-1β. Pkhd1 expression is inhibited in cystic collecting ducts but not in non-cystic proximal tubules, despite transgene expression in this nephron segment. We conclude that the C-terminal domain of HNF-1β is required for the activation of the Pkhd1 promoter. Deletion mutants lacking the C-terminal domain function as dominant-negative mutants, possibly by preventing the recruitment of histone acetylases to the promoter. Cyst formation correlates with inhibition of Pkhd1 expression, which argues that mutations of HNF-1β produce kidney cysts by down-regulating the ARPKD gene, Pkhd1.

HNF-1α and HNF-1β have a similar overall structure consisting of an N-terminal dimerization domain, a POU (Pit-1, Oct-1/2, Unc-86)-specific domain and a POU-homeodomain that mediate sequence-specific DNA binding, and a C-terminal domain. The sequences of the dimerization domains and DNA-binding domains are highly similar, but the C-terminal domains are divergent (5Bach I. Mattei M.G. Cereghini S. Yaniv M.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). HNF-1α and HNF-1β bind to DNA as obligatory homodimers or heterodimers and recognize an identical DNA sequence (3Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M.

They were first discovered in hepatocytes because of their roles in liver-specific expression of genes such as albumin and transthyretin, but they also regulate gene expression in epithelia of the pancreas, lung, intestine, and kidney. In general, HNF-1α and HNF-1β function as transcriptional activators, but transcriptional repression has also been observed depending on the promoter, cell type, and alternative splicing (7Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Ringeisen F. Rey-Campos J. Yaniv M. J. Biol.

The C-terminal domain of HNF-1α contains two discrete activation domains, ADI and ADII (11Nicosia A. Monaci P. Tomei L. De Francesco R. Nuzzo M. Stunnenberg H. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1225-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of HNF-1β also has transcriptional activity but has not been characterized in detail (10Bach I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4229-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HNF-1α and HNF-1β are both highly expressed in the kidney, but their patterns of expression are distinct. HNF-1α is restricted to the proximal tubules, whereas HNF-1β is expressed in all segments of the nephron and in renal collecting ducts (12Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 13Ott M.O. Rey-Campos J. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Mech.

Neither protein is expressed in glomeruli. In the embryonic kidney, HNF-1β is expressed in the ureteric bud that will give rise to the renal collecting system and ureter as well as comma- and S-shaped bodies that will form the nephron proper. HNF-1α appears later and only in developing proximal tubules (12Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 13Ott M.O. Rey-Campos J. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Mech.

Despite their prominent expression, the functions of HNF-1α and HNF-1β in the kidney are incompletely understood, and relatively few downstream target genes have been identified in this organ. Mutations of the human HNF-1α gene (TCF1) produce the autosomal dominant disorder maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 3 (MODY3) (15Yamagata K. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Furuta H. Vaxillaire M. Southam L. Cox R.D. Lathrop G.M. Boriraj V.V. Chen X. Cox N.J. Oda Y. Yano H. Le Beau M.M. Yamada S. Nishigori H. Takeda J. Fajans S.S. Hattersley A.T. Iwasaki N. Hansen T. Pedersen O. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). MODY3 is associated with renal glycosuria in the absence of hyperglycemia (16Pontoglio M. Prie D. Cheret C. Doyen A. Leroy C. Froguel P. Velho G. Yaniv M. Friedlander G. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). HNF-1α knock-out mice exhibit glycosuria, amino aciduria, and phosphaturia and show decreased expression of genes encoding glucose and phosphate transporters in the proximal tubule (12Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 17Cheret C. Doyen A. Yaniv M.

These findings suggest that HNF-1α may be involved in the regulation of proximal tubule-specific gene expression. Mutations of HNF-1β (TCF2) produce maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 5 (MODY5) and are invariably associated with congenital abnormalities of the kidney and/or genitourinary tract (19Horikawa Y. Iwasaki N. Hara M. Furuta H. Hinokio Y. Cockburn B.N. Lindner T. Yamagata K. Ogata M. Tomonaga O. Kuroki H. Kasahara T. Iwamoto Y. Bell G.I. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 384-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The most common kidney abnormality is the formation of cysts in the renal tubules, and the acronym RCAD (renal cysts and diabetes) has been used to describe this syndrome (20Bingham C. Ellard S. Allen L. Bulman M. Shepherd M. Frayling T. Berry P.J. Clark P.M. Lindner T. Bell G.I. Ryffel G.U. Nicholls A.J. Hattersley A.T. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The spectrum of renal cystic abnormalities includes simple cysts, multicystic renal dysplasia, and hypoplastic glomerulocystic kidney disease. Renal involvement is often severe and can produce kidney failure. In addition to renal cysts, other kidney abnormalities caused by mutations of HNF-1β include oligomeganephronia, familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, and renal agenesis or hypoplasia (21Bingham C. Ellard S. van't Hoff W.G. Simmonds H.A. Marinaki A.M. Badman M.K. Winocour P.H. Stride A. Lockwood C.R. Nicholls A.J. Owen K.R. Spyer G. Pearson E.R. Hattersley A.T. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1645-1651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism by which mutations of HNF-1β produce renal cystic disease, we have previously generated transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of mouse HNF-1β that corresponds to a naturally occurring human mutation (A263fsinsGG) (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The A263fsinsGG mutation prevents DNA binding and produces a dominant-negative mutant. Transgenic mice expressing mutant HNF-1β develop kidney cysts that are similar to those found in humans with MODY5. The kidney cysts show decreased expression of Pkhd1, the gene that is mutated in humans with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) (23Onuchic L.F. Furu L. Nagasawa Y. Hou X. Eggermann T. Ren Z. Bergmann C. Senderek J. Esquivel E. Zeltner R. Rudnik-Schoneborn S. Mrug M. Sweeney W. Avner E.D. Zerres K. Guay-Woodford L.M. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Am. J. Hum.

Ishibashi M. Milliner D.S. Torres V.E. Harris P.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Similarly, tissue-specific inactivation of HNF-1β in the kidney using Cre/loxP recombination results in the formation of kidney cysts and down-regulation of Pkhd1 expression (25Gresh L. Fischer E. Reimann A. Tanguy M. Garbay S. Shao X. Hiesberger T. Fiette L. Igarashi P. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Pkhd1 promoter contains an evolutionarily conserved binding site for HNF-1β that is located 49 bp upstream to the transcription start site within a region of cell-specific chromatin remodeling (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutations of the HNF-1β binding site inhibit promoter activity in renal epithelial cells. Expression of wild-type HNF-1β transactivates the Pkhd1 promoter, whereas expression of a dominant-negative HNF-1β mutant inhibits promoter activity. Taken together, these studies suggest that two renal cystic diseases, MODY5 and ARPKD, are linked in a common transcriptional pathway and that the mechanism of cyst formation in humans with mutations of HNF-1β involves down-regulation of PKHD1 (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Gresh L. Fischer E. Reimann A. Tanguy M. Garbay S. Shao X. Hiesberger T. Fiette L. Igarashi P. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). HNF-1β directly regulates the transcription of Pkhd1, but the mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of the Pkhd1 promoter by HNF-1β, focusing on the role of the C-terminal domain. Additionally, we studied the consequences of expression of an HNF-1β mutant lacking the C-terminal domain on mammalian kidney development as a model for naturally occurring human mutations affecting this region. Plasmids—Expression plasmids encoding wild-type mouse HNF-1β (pHNF1β) and HNF-1β containing C-terminal V5 and FLAG epitope tags (pHNF1β-V5 and pHNF1β-FLAG) were described previously (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing 444 bp of the Pkhd1 promoter linked to a Photinus luciferase reporter gene (pPkhd1-luc) was described previously (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHNF1βΔC-V5 encoding an HNF-1β mutant lacking 236 amino acids at the C terminus was produced by PCR amplification and cloning into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The V5-epitope tag was replaced with a FLAG epitope tag to generate pHNF1βΔC-FLAG. The plasmid pGal4 (originally named pM1) encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) under the control of the SV40 promoter was a gift from Ivan Sadowski (University of British Columbia). Plasmids encoding fusion proteins containing the Gal4 DBD and C-terminal fragments of HNF-1β were generated by inserting appropriate PCR fragments in-frame into pGal4. The plasmid pcDNA-Pod1-FLAG was generated by inserting a PCR product encoding mouse Pod1 (26Quaggin S.E. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Igarashi P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag into pcDNA3.1. The plasmid pPkhd1-Gal4-VP16 was generated by replacing the luciferase coding region of pPkhd1-luc with DNA encoding a Gal4-VP16 fusion protein. In addition, a neomycin resistance cassette was inserted into this plasmid. The pG5-luc reporter plasmid containing 5 repeats of the Gal4 binding site and a TATA box upstream of the Photinus luciferase gene was a generous gift from Richard Baer (Columbia University) (27Yu X.

The plasmids pCX-FLAG-P/CAF, pFLAG-Scr1α, and pFLAG-Rac3 were generous gifts from Iannis Talianidis (Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Herakleion, Crete, Greece) (28Soutoglou E. Viollet B. Vaxillaire M. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRc/Rsv-mCBP-HA was a gift from Roland Kwok (University of Michigan) (29Shao X. Johnson J.E. Richardson J.A. Hiesberger T. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1824-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The plasmids pcDNA-FLAG-P/CAF and pcDNA-mCBP-HA were obtained by subcloning the corresponding coding sequences into pcDNA3.1-V5/His. Immunoprecipitation—In vitro translated proteins were generated using TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation kits (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's directions. 1 μg of plasmid and 40 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate were used in each reaction. Reaction products were diluted with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After addition of 25 μl of FLAG-agarose or HA-agarose (Sigma), samples were rotated for 3 h and then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—HeLa cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 30 h, cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Indianapolis, IN)), and 20 μl of the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were prepared as described previously (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and incubated with anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Immune complexes were detected using chemiluminescence. Signal intensity was quantified with a FluorImager and expressed as a percentage relative to the highest signal measured in each group. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assays—Mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD-3) and HeLa cells were grown as described previously (30Bai Y. Pontoglio M. Hiesberger T. Sinclair A.M. Igarashi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F839-F851Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well dishes (3 × 105 cells/well) and were cotransfected with 0.3 μg of pPkhd1-luc or pG5-luc and 0.01–0.3 μg of effector plasmids. Transfection was performed using Effectene (Qiagen). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To control for transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with 0.05 μg of phRL-TK(Int-) encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega), and relative luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of Photinus and Renilla luciferase. To produce cell lines stably expressing a Gal4-VP16 fusion protein under the control of a chromosomally integrated Pkhd1 promoter, mIMCD-3 cells were transfected with pPkhd1-Gal4-VP16 and grown in the presence of G418 (0.8 mg/ml) for 17 days. Six independent cell lines that expressed Gal4-VP16 were identified and used in subsequent experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) using in vitro translated proteins and a 32P-labeled DNA fragment containing the mouse Pkhd1 promoter (-81 bp to -38 bp) including the HNF-1 binding site. Animals—The plasmid pKsp-HNF1βΔC-V5 was generated by inserting the coding sequence of HNF1βΔC-V5 into a plasmid 3′ to the 1.3-kb Ksp-cadherin promoter and β-globin TATA box (29Shao X. Johnson J.E. Richardson J.A. Hiesberger T. Igarashi P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1824-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the Ksp-cadherin promoter, HNF1βΔC-V5 coding region, and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site was excised with BamHI and Asp718 and purified as described previously (29Shao X.

Transgenic mice were produced by the University of Texas Southwestern Transgenic Core Facility and analyzed at ages 30, 52, and 100 days. Tissues were harvested from anesthetized mice and were fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Paraffin embedding, sectioning, and histochemical staining were performed using standard procedures (31Woods A.E. Ellis R.C. Laboratory Histopathology, A Complete Reference. 1 and 2.

Immunofluorescence and Lectin Staining—Paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded kidney sections were stained with antibodies against the V5 epitope (Invitrogen), HNF-1α, HNF-1β (25Gresh L.

Secondary antibodies were conjugated to cyanine-3 (Cy3; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA), Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), or Alexa Fluor 488. Lectin staining was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (LTA; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence, lectin staining, and microscopy were performed as described previously (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin.

Isotopic in situ hybridization was performed using 35S-labeled Pkhd1 riboprobes essentially as described previously (32Shelton J.M. Lee M.H. Richardson J.A. Patel S.B. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following hybridization and washing, the sections were dipped in K.5 nuclear emulsion gel (Ilford, UK) and exposed for 21–28 days. HNF-1βΔC Mutant Is Capable of Dimerization and DNA Binding—To determine whether the C-terminal domain of HNF-1β is required for transcriptional activation of the Pkhd1 promoter, we produced a C-terminal truncated mouse mutant (HNF-1βΔC). The mouse HNF-1βΔC mutant lacks 236 amino acids at the C terminus, similar to a naturally occurring human MODY5 mutant (P328L329fsdelCCTCT) (20Bingham C. Ellard S. Allen L. Bulman M. Shepherd M. Frayling T. Berry P.J. Clark P.M. Lindner T. Bell G.I. Ryffel G.U. Nicholls A.J. Hattersley A.T. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The HNF-1βΔC mutant retains the N-terminal dimerization domain as well as the POU-specific domain and POU-homeodomain that mediate DNA binding (Fig. 1A). The human P328L329fsdelCCTCT mutant has previously been shown to bind to an HNF-1 site in the HP1 promoter (33Wild W. Pogge von Strandmann E. Nastos A. Senkel S. Lingott-Frieg A. Bulman M. Bingham C. Ellard S. Hattersley A.T. Ryffel G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4695-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test the ability of mouse HNF-1βΔC to interact with DNA, EMSA was performed using programmed reticulocyte lysates and a radiolabeled DNA fragment containing the HNF-1β binding site from the mouse Pkhd1 promoter. Lysates programmed with full-length FLAG-tagged HNF-1β produced a DNA-protein complex that was not seen in lysates programmed with empty expression plasmid (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Lysates programmed with V5-tagged HNF-1βΔC produced a DNA-protein complex of lower apparent molecular weight (lane 3). Lysates programmed with a constant amount of HNF1β-FLAG and increasing amounts of HNF1βΔC-V5 produced a complex of intermediate molecular weight (middle arrow in lanes 4–7). Increasing the amount of HNF1βΔC-V5 led to a progressive reduction of complexes containing full-length HNF-1β (upper arrow in lanes 4–7). To verify the composition of the complexes, EMSA was performed in the presence of antibodies directed against the FLAG and V5 epitope tags that were appended to wild-type and mutant HNF-1β, respectively. The presence of supershifted bands (lanes 8–15) indicated that the upper complex contained HNF-1β by itself, the lower complex contained HNF-1βΔC by itself, and the middle complex contained both proteins. These results demonstrated that the HNF-1βΔC mutant competed with wild-type HNF-1β for binding to the HNF-1 site in the Pkhd1 promoter. C-terminal Domain of HNF-1β Contains an Autonomous Activation Domain—The transcriptional activity of the C-terminal domain of HNF-1β was tested using mammalian one-hybrid assays. An expression plasmid encoding the yeast Gal4 DBD fused to the C-terminal domain of HNF-1β (amino acids 298–532) was co-transfected into mIMCD-3 cells with a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid. mIMCD-3 cells are derived from the renal collecting duct and endogenously express HNF-1β and Pkhd1 (22Hiesberger T. Bai Y. Shao X. McNally B.T. Sinclair A.M. Tian X. Somlo S. Igarashi P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Expression of the Gal4-HNF1β-(298–532) fusion protein produced a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity, whereas expression of the Gal4 DBD by itself had no effect (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that the C-terminal domain of HNF-1β contained an autonomous activation domain that was functional when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. To more precisely define the activation domain, Gal4 fusion proteins containing various deletions of the HNF-1β C terminus were tested in the one-hybrid assay. In addition to mIMCD-3 cells, the studies were performed in HeLa cells, which do not express endogenous HNF-1β but can support transactivation by exogenous HNF-1β (30Bai Y. Pontoglio M. Hiesberger T. Sinclair A.M. Igarashi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F839-F851Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The region containing amino acids 298–432 did not activate transcription when fused to the Gal4 DBD. Gal4 fusion proteins containing amino acids 311–483 induced the highest activity in HeLa cells, and further addition of the C-terminal sequence did not increase but instead decreased activation. In mIMCD-3 cells, further C-terminal additions led to an increase in reporter gene activity. Progressive deletions from either end of the C-terminal domain produced gradual reductions in transcriptional activation, indicating that the sequences contributing to transcriptional activation were distributed over a relatively broad region. Gal4 fusion proteins containing the core region of the activation domain from amino acids 352 to 483 retained 83% (HeLa cells) and 59% (mIMCD-3 cells) of the maximal activity. The integrity of this region was required for transcriptional activation because further deletion to amino acids 388–471 reduced the activity to 9.5% (HeLa cells) and 3.7% (mIMCD-3 cells). Deletion of the C-terminal Domain of HNF-1β Produces a Dominant-negative Mutation—Deletion of the C-terminal domain of HNF-1β produces a dominant gain-of-function mutation when assayed with an episomal promoter-reporter gene (30Bai Y. Pontoglio M. Hiesberger T. Sinclair A.M. Igarashi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F839-F851Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Wild W. Pogge von Strandmann E. Nastos A. Senkel S.

We report here the isolation and characterization of oligopeptidase B (OpdB) and its corresponding gene from Trypanosoma evansi, a pathogen of significant veterinary importance. The T. evansi opdB gene was present as a single copy per haploid genome containing an open reading frame of 2148 bp encoding a protein of 80.664 kDa. Purified OpdB hydrolyzed substrates with basic residues in P1 (kcat/Km for carbobenzyloxy-l-arginyl-l-arginyl-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, 337 s–1·μm–1) and exhibited potent arginyl carboxypeptidase activity (kcat/Km for Val-Lys-Arg↓Arg-OH, 231 s–1·mm–1). While not secreted, T. evansi released OpdB into the plasma of infected hosts where it retained catalytic activity. Plasma OpdB levels correlated with blood parasitemia. In vitro, OpdB cleaved the peptide hormone atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) at four sites: Arg3↓Arg4, Arg4↓Ser5, Arg11↓Ile12, and Arg27↓Tyr28, thereby abrogating smooth muscle relaxant and prohypotensive properties of ANF. Circulating plasma ANF levels in T. evansi-infected rats were depressed from 130 to 8 pg·ml–1, and plasma ANF levels inversely correlated with plasma OpdB activity. The in vitro half-life of ANF in rat plasma was reduced 300-fold in plasma from T. evansi-infected rodents, which contains high levels of OpdB activity. Addition of OpdB inhibitors to cell-free plasma from infected rodents significantly abrogated this ANF hydrolysis. Furthermore the in vivo ANF half-life was reduced 5-fold in T. evansi-infected rats. Thus, we propose a role for OpdB in peptide hormone dysregulation in trypanosomiasis, specifically in generating the depressed plasma levels of ANF in mammals infected with T. evansi.

Thus, we propose a role for OpdB in peptide hormone dysregulation in trypanosomiasis, specifically in generating the depressed plasma levels of ANF in mammals infected with T. evansi. The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma evansi (Steele 1885) is the etiological agent of a disease called surra, which is a major cause of livestock morbidity and mortality (1Hoare C.A. The Trypanosomes of Mammals. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1972Google Scholar) and is thus of significant economic importance in affected areas. It has the broadest geographic (1Hoare C.A. The Trypanosomes of Mammals. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1972Google Scholar) and host (2Brun R. Hecker H. Lun Z.R. Vet. Parasitol. 1998; 79: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) ranges of any pathogenic trypanosome. Acute infection causes a severe febrile illness characterized by coughing, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and immunosuppression, and death by respiratory distress or cardiac failure (1Hoare C.A. The Trypanosomes of Mammals. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1972Google Scholar). The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of these lesions have not been elucidated, although they are often attributed to bioactive substances, such as peptidases, phospholipases, lipopolysaccharides, and free fatty acids, released into the host circulation by dead and dying parasites (3Tizard I. Nielsen K.H. Seed J.R. Hall J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 664-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parasite-derived peptidases in particular are emerging as important pathogenic factors, and candidates include a cell surface metallopeptidase, gp63 (4Jaffe C.L. Dwyer D.M. Parasitol. Res. 2003; 91: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a cysteine peptidase (5Okenu D.M. Opara K.N. Nwuba R.I. Nwagwu M. Parasitol. Res. 1999; 85: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and a secreted collagenolytic serine peptidase (6Santana J.M. Grellier P. Schrevel J. Teixeira A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Other parasite peptidases enter the host circulation upon intravascular destruction of the parasites (7Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These peptidases hydrolyze biologically significant substrates in vitro. For example, a trypanosome cysteine peptidase can generate Lys-bradykinin from kininogen and can activate pre-kallikrein (8Del Nery E. Juliano M.A. Lima A.P. Scharfstein J. Juliano L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25713-25718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, these peptidases are rapidly inhibited by host plasma peptidase inhibitors upon release into the bloodstream. gp63 is complexed by α2-macroglobulin (9Heumann D. Burger D. Vischer T. de Colmenares M. Bouvier J. Bordier C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and trypanosome cysteine peptidases are rapidly (ka ≈ 5 × 107 m–1·s–1) and tightly (Ki ≈ 5 pm) complexed with cystatins and kininogen (10Troeberg L. Pike R.N. Morty R.E. Berry R.K. Coetzer T.H. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 728-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Mpimbaza G.W. Nkhungulu Z.R. Olobo J. Smith L. Tosomba O.M. Grab D.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with concomitant loss of catalytic activity. Thus, their catalytic activity in the host bloodstream is unlikely to contribute to pathology. Indeed no trypanosome cysteine peptidase activity is found in plasma from Trypanosoma brucei-infected rodents (10Troeberg L. Pike R.N. Morty R.E. Berry R.K. Coetzer T.H. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 728-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, a small subset of parasite peptidases is not affected by plasma peptidase inhibitors, and these peptidases retain their catalytic activity in the host bloodstream. Two members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family exemplify this group of peptidases.

The inability of the host to regulate the catalytic activity of these two peptidases is significant since in the bloodstream they are brought into contact with host peptide hormones. Abnormal degradation of these hormones could impair host physiological homeostasis, an idea supported by the reduction in plasma levels of some peptide hormones observed in trypanosome infections (17Ndung'u J.M. Wright N.G. Jennings F.W. Murray M. Parasitol. Res. 1992; 78: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the unusual cleavage observed when peptide hormones are incubated in serum from trypanosome-infected rodents (18Tetaert D. Soudan B.

Protein Res. 1993; 41: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and reports of endocrine dysfunction after trypanosome lysis in the host bloodstream (19Soudan B. Tetaert D. Hublart M. Racadot A. Croix D. Boersma A. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 101: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated, characterized, and cloned the gene encoding OpdB from T. evansi, the first peptidase ever cloned and characterized from this important veterinary pathogen. We then used a rodent model of T. evansi infection to address the following question: can peptidases released intravascularly by trypanosomes modulate peptide hormone levels in hosts? Although reports exist that document the extracellular release of parasite peptidases, this phenomenon has never been linked to the abnormal peptide hormone metabolism observed in trypanosome-infected hosts. Our data indicate that trypanosome peptidases can modulate circulating host peptide hormone levels. This has significant implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of trypanosomiasis in particular the dysregulation of processes controlled by peptide hormones that are perturbed in trypanosome infections. These include hypotension (20Boreham P.F. Wright I.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1976; 58: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), elevated blood volume (21Anosa V.O. Isoun T.T. Trop. Anim.

Affinity-purified antibodies were dialyzed extensively against Ringer's solution (4 × 6h, 4 °C) to remove residual reagents left over from the affinity purification procedure. Antibody preparations were concentrated in Centricon™ concentrators (30-kDa cut-off, Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzymatic Characterization of OpdB—Activity of OpdB was routinely determined against 5 μm N-carbobenzyloxy (Cbz)-l-Arg-l-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0 in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer (λex = 370 nm, λem = 460 nm) (12Morty R.E.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar). Active enzyme concentration was determined with 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-p-guanidinobenzoate (12Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Morehead J. Caler E.V. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H. Andrews N.W. Burleigh B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26149-26156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity of native and recombinant T. evansi OpdB was determined using AMC- or β-naphthylamine (βNA)-derived fluorogenic peptide substrates (Bachem) as described previously (12Morty R.E.

For carboxypeptidase activity of OpdB against unblocked peptides or peptides N-terminally blocked with a 3-(2-furyl)acryloyl moiety, reactions consisted of OpdB (18–50 fmol of active enzyme) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8 (50 μl), prewarmed to 37 °C. Prewarmed substrate solution (50 μl) was added, and at timed intervals reactions were stopped and resolved by HPLC as described previously (10Troeberg L. Pike R.N. Morty R.E. Berry R.K. Coetzer T.H. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 728-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The effect of pH on OpdB activity, the Ki for non-tight binding reversible competitive inhibitors, and the ka for irreversible inhibitors were investigated as described previously (12Morty R.E.

Degradation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was studied by incubating rat ANF-(1–28) (Bachem), the predominant circulating form of ANF (31Thibault G. Lazure C. Schiffrin E.L. Gutkowska J. Chartier L. Garcia R. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Genest J. Cantin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), at a 1:100 (mol:mol) OpdB:ANF ratio in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. At timed intervals, reaction products were resolved by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a μBondpack C18 column (Waters) eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml·min–1 with a linear gradient of H2O:CH3CN:trifluoroacetic acid (95:5:0.1) increasing to H2O:CH3CN: trifluoroacetic acid (55:45:0.1) over 30 min, monitored at 214 nm. The ANF degradation products in HPLC fractions were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) as described previously (32Hemerly J.P. Oliveira V. Del Nery E. Morty R.E. Andrews N.W. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Detection of OpdB Activity in the Plasma of T. evansi-infected Rodents—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g; n = 4) were infected intraperitoneally with T. evansi IL3298 (1 × 104 trypanosomes/rat). At peak bloodstream parasitemia (≈5 ×108 trypanosomes·ml of plasma–1) blood was drawn from the tail vein (150 μl) into an equal volume of ice-cold 57 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 44 mm NaC1, 56 mm d(+)-glucose, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 2% (m/v) sodium citrate, pH 7.4, and centrifuged (1500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were confirmed to be trypanosome-free by light microscopy. This procedure has previously been proven to yield parasite-free and cell-free plasma without destruction of live parasites in the plasma. Therefore, there is no artifactual extracellular release of intracellular trypanosome proteins (7Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasma, similarly prepared from rats that had been “mock-infected” with 1 × 104 heat-killed trypanosomes/rat, was used as a control. The inhibitors 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) were used to discriminate serine oligopeptidase from trypsin-like serine protease activity, while activity-neutralizing anti-OpdB antibodies (7Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were used to specifically detect OpdB activity. This combination of inhibitors is diagnostic for OpdB activity in complex biological fluids (7Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For detection of immunoreactive OpdB in infected rat plasma, rats were euthanized at peak parasitemia, and blood was harvested by cardiac puncture and processed as described above. Whole plasma yielded poorly resolved bands on a Western blot; therefore, cell-free plasma was partially fractionated by precipitation and chromatography on Q-Sepharose and agmatine-Sepharose as described for purification of OpdB from T. evansi lysates. Fractionated plasma was resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted for OpdB. Subcellular Fractionation of T. evansi—Subcellular fractionation was undertaken exactly as described previously (33Grab D.J. Webster P. Ito S. Fish W.R. Verjee Y. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly bloodstream-derived T. evansi trypomastigotes (1010 cells) were washed in 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Hepes, 25 mm KCl, pH 7.4 at 4 °C and disrupted in a French pressure cell. Cell fractions (designated as “nuclear,” “large granule,” “small granule,” “crude microsomal,” and “soluble supernatant” fractions) were prepared by centrifugation as described previously (33Grab D.J. Webster P. Ito S. Fish W.R. Verjee Y. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These fractions were screened for enrichment of fraction markers: hexokinase (a glycosome marker) (34Maugeri D.A. Cazzulo J.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 234: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), α-mannosidase (a dense granule marker) (35Steiger R.F. Opperdoes F.R. Bontemps J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and alanine aminotransferase (a cytosol marker) (35Steiger R.F. Opperdoes F.R. Bontemps J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to evaluate the fractionation. Fractions were also screened for OpdB activity (measured as Cbz-Arg-Arg-AMC-hydrolyzing activity sensitive to inhibition by anti-OpdB IgY at 75 μg·ml–1). In Vitro Release of OpdB by T. evansi—Secretion of OpdB by T. evansi IL3298 in vitro was studied as described previously (6Santana J.M. Grellier P. Schrevel J. Teixeira A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Bloodstream-derived T. evansi were resuspended (1 × 108 cells·ml–1) in minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.3 g·liter–1 l-glutamine, 0.25 mm l-cysteine, 0.01 mm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Aliquots (100 μl) were removed at 0, 10, 30, and 60 min and centrifuged (1500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C). Trypanosome-free supernatants were assayed for activity against Cbz-Arg-Arg-AMC (5 μm) and N-succinyl-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-AMC (5 μm) as described above. A Rat Model of Lethal Endotoxic Shock—Lethal endotoxic shock was induced in rats by slow (10-min) intravenous administration of 20 mg·kg–1 E. coli 0127:B8 lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) via the tail vein (36Wise W.C. Cook J.A. Tempel G.E. Reines H.D. Halushka P.V. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 299: 243-252PubMed Google Scholar). Rats generally expired between 9 and 16 h; therefore, plasma was harvested by cardiac puncture at 4 and 8 h post-LPS administration after which rats were sacrificed. Determination of Plasma ANF Levels—Blood samples (0.5 ml) were extracted from the tail vein of rats 2 and 4 days preinfection, on the day of infection, and at 2-day intervals postinfection. Blood was extracted into an equal volume of ice-cold 57 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 44 mm NaCl, 56 mm d(+)-glucose, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 2% (m/v) sodium citrate, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm DCI and centrifuged (1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). Plasma was first clarified on a C18 Sep-column (Bachem) after which plasma ANF levels were quantified with a rat ANF radioimmunoassay (Bachem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where necessary, larger quantities of blood were extracted from rats to bring the ANF levels within the detection limit of the assay (0.1–64 pg/tube). Half-life Determination for 125I-ANF—[125I-Tyr28]ANF-(1–28) (Bachem; 2000 Ci·mmol–1) was incubated in trypanosome- and cell-free plasma from trypanosome-infected and healthy rats for 5 min. At 30-s intervals, aliquots were resolved by HPLC as described above. Radioactivity associated with the intact ANF peak was quantified in a γ-counter. A ratio was determined for the fraction of radiation recovered at time t (Ct) representing intact ANF-(1–28) versus that initially applied (Ctot). Linear regression of a semilog plot of ln(Ct/Ctot) versus time yielded a graph with a slope = k where k is the rate of disappearance of intact ANF. The half-life, t½, is given by t½ = 0.693/k. For the estimation of ANF half-life in T. evansi-infected hosts, rats (≈300 g) were selected at midlevel parasitemia (between days 6 and 8, postinfection; blood parasitemia ≈107·ml–1). Rats with higher parasitemia did not tolerate surgery and catheter placement. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg·kg–1, intraperitoneal), and the left carotid artery and the right jugular vein were catheterized with PE-50 tubing. A bolus dose of [125I-Tyr28]ANF-(1–28) (1 μCi) was administered via the jugular catheter through which continuous infusion of Ringer's solution (50 μl·min–1) was maintained. At timed intervals (every 30 s for 5 min), arterial blood samples (0.5 ml) were extracted and processed for HPLC and γ-counting as described above. In some cases, either preimmune IgY or anti-OpdB IgY was infused via the jugular catheter at a rate of 17.5 μg·min–1 for 2 h prior to application of the [125I-Tyr28]ANF-(1–28) bolus. Smooth Muscle Contraction Assay for ANF—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (≈300 g) were sacrificed by decapitation, and the aortas were extracted and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit solution (119.1 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25.0 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5.5 mm d(+)-glucose) continuously gassed with 95% (v/v) O2, 5% (v/v) CO2. Adipose and connective tissue was gently removed, and the midthoracic region was cut into 2-mm sections. Aortic rings were mounted in a Mulvany myograph (J. P. Tra"
https://openalex.org/W2104656794,"AphA is a member of a new and largely uncharacterized family of transcriptional activators that is required for initiating virulence gene expression in Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the frequently fatal epidemic diarrheal disease cholera. AphA activates transcription by an unusual mechanism that appears to involve a direct interaction with the LysR-type regulator AphB at the tcpPH promoter. As a first step toward understanding the molecular basis for tcpPH activation by AphA and AphB, we have determined the crystal structure of AphA to 2.2 Å resolution. AphA is a dimer with an N-terminal winged helix DNA binding domain that is architecturally similar to that of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Unlike this family, however, AphA has a unique C-terminal antiparallel coiled coil domain that serves as its primary dimerization interface. AphA monomers are highly unstable by themselves and form a linked topology, requiring the protein to partially unfold to form the dimer. The structure of AphA also provides insights into how it cooperates with AphB to activate transcription, most likely by forming a heterotetrameric complex at the tcpPH promoter.

Cholera is a frequently fatal epidemic diarrheal disease caused by oral ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The two primary virulence factors responsible for the disease are the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), 1The abbreviations used are: TCP, toxin-coregulated pilus; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CNS, crystallography and NMR system. 1The abbreviations used are: TCP, toxin-coregulated pilus; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CNS, crystallography and NMR system. a critical colonization factor (1.Taylor R.K.

Morris Jr., J.G. Levine M.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 48-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of these genes from the Vibrio pathogenicity island (3.Karaolis D.K. Johnson J.A.

Mekalanos J.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), respectively, are dependent upon a pair of transcriptional regulators, AphA and AphB, which are encoded by genes not physically associated with each other or with these pathogenicity islands in the V. cholerae genome (5.Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4250-4256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).AphA is a member of a new and largely uncharacterized regulator family comprising at least 30 proteins with mostly unknown functions that show homology to PadR, a repressor that controls the expression of genes involved in the detoxification of phenolic acids (7.Barthelmebs L. Lecomte B. Divies C. Cavin J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6724-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). AphA activates the transcription of the tcpPH promoter on the Vibrio pathogenicity island by an unusual mechanism that appears to require a direct interaction with the LysR-type regulator AphB (8.Kovacikova G. Lin W. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon binding of AphA to a region of partial dyad symmetry at the tcpPH promoter (between –101 and –71, relative to the transcriptional start site), the protein enhances the binding of AphB to an adjacent and proximal site that lies between –78 and –43 (9.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Under the appropriate environmental conditions, this results in activation of the tcpPH promoter and initiates a transcriptional cascade that culminates in the production of TCP and cholera toxin. An important aspect of virulence gene regulation is that the expression of aphA is controlled by a quorum-sensing system that decreases its intracellular levels at high cell density (11.Miller M.B. Skorupski K. Lenz D.H. Taylor R.K. Bassler B.L. Cell. 2002; 110: 303-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 12.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This regulation reduces virulence gene expression at high cell density and is thought to contribute to the self-limiting nature of V. cholerae infections.To more fully understand the molecular mechanisms involved in virulence gene activation in V. cholerae, we have determined the 2.2-Å x-ray crystal structure of the AphA dimer (Protein Data Bank code 1YG2). Each AphA subunit consists of an N-terminal DNA binding domain that adopts a winged helix fold similar to that of the multiple antibiotic resistance repressor MarR (13.Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and a distinctive C-terminal dimerization domain comprising an extensive antiparallel coiled coil. The structure of AphA allows a number of predictions to be made regarding how the protein binds to DNA and how it interacts with AphB to initiate transcriptional activation of the virulence cascade.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Preparation and Crystallization—The purification of AphA using the IMPACT-CN protein fusion and purification system (New England Biolabs) has been described previously (14.Kovacikova G. Lin W. Skorupski K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4825-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli strain ER2566, expressing pWEL18, was grown in LB at 30 °C to an A600 ∼ 0.8, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thio galactopyranoside, and incubated at 16 °C for 20 h. AphA was purified from sonicated, clarified supernatant using a chitin column (New England Biolabs), dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and concentrated to 5 mg/ml using Centricon filters (Millipore). AphA crystals were obtained by mixing equal volumes of the protein, as described above, with 0.1 m MES, pH 6.3, and 1.3 m magnesium sulfate. Crystals appeared after 3–4 days of incubation at room temperature. A useful heavy atom derivative was obtained by soaking the native crystals in 0.01 mm methyl mercury chloride for 12 h. For both native and derivative crystals, 20% glycerol was used as the cryoprotectant.Data Collection and Structure Solution—Native and anomalous derivative data were collected on a Mar345dtb image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode generator operating with a CuKα target at 50 kV and 100 mA. The data were processed using the program XDS (15.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3213) Google Scholar) and resulted in a complete native data set to 3.0 Å and a derivative data set to 2.6 Å (Table I). Patterson maps, calculated with CNS (16.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16929) Google Scholar), clearly indicated two mercury peaks, and single isomonphous replacement and single anomalous dispersion phases were combined using the CNS program to produce an initial 3.0 Å electron density map. The quality of the map was excellent, allowing a complete polyalanine chain to be traced without difficulty. The presence of a number of tryptophan side chains allowed placement of the AphA sequence into the map. A 2.2 Å native data set was collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X6A, and the data were processed in space group C2221. Following molecular replacement using the program CNS to place the existing model into the new data set, multiple rounds of refinement were carried out with CNS, resulting in a final structure having an R-factor of 23.3% and a free-R of 28.0%. Analysis of the structure using the program PROCHECK showed 94.1% of residues in the most favored regions, 5.2% in additional allowed regions, and no residues in generously allowed or disallowed regions. The model was also checked by a composite omit map calculated in CNS, which showed good density for all amino acids, with the exception of the two N-terminal residues, the two C-terminal residues, the side chains of Tyr-19 and Lys-23, and all of residues 58–67, located in the wing, which are disordered.Table IData collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsData Collection CrystalNative (in-house)Anomalous Hg derivativeNative (synchrotron) Space groupC2221 Unit cell dimensionsa = 76.9, b = 94.3, c = 59.2 α = β = γ = 90°a = 77.0, b = 93.3, c = 59.7 α = β = γ = 90°a = 77.5, b = 94.6, c = 59.6 α = β = γ = 90° Resolution range (highest resolution shell)20-3.0 (4.0-3.0)20-2.6 (2.8-2.6)20-2.2 (2.4-2.2) Measured reflections48,899 (20,241)48,182 (9,013)80,959 (17,406) Unique reflections4,543 (2,574)12,614 (2,406)11,425 (2,546)Completeness (%)99.8 (100.0)98.5 (95.0)99.6 (99.2)Rsym aRsym = 100 × ΣhΣI|Ihi — Ih|/Σhi Ihi; where h is unique reflection indices.

Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure and Comparison with Other Winged Helix Proteins—The AphA protein forms a dimer in which the two subunits are related by a crystallographic two-fold rotation axis. Each molecule of AphA is 70 Å long × 30 Å wide × 40 Å deep, resulting in a dimer with overall dimensions of 90 × 30 × 40 Å. Each α/β subunit contains seven α helices and two β-strands and folds into two domains: a globular N-terminal DNA binding domain made up of amino acids 1–86, and a C-terminal coiled coil dimerization domain including amino acids 98–179 (Fig. 1A). These two domains are connected between helices α4 and α5 by an extended, eleven-amino-acid polypeptide linker.Although AphA does not have any homologs of known structure, its N-terminal end has a conserved domain architecture previously predicted by BLAST to strongly resemble the helix-turn-helix domain of the multiple antibiotic resistance repressor MarR (13.Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a DALI (18.Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) search of known crystal structures shows MarR (Fig. 1B) to be the closest structural relative to AphA (Z = 11.4), with 91 α carbons superposing with an root mean square deviation of 4.0 Å. Although the overall sequence identity between AphA and MarR is low (11%), an alignment of the two proteins (Fig. 1C) reveals analogous secondary structure in the DNA binding domain that produces a similar fold in the crystal structures (compare Fig. 1, A with B). These analogous structural elements include AphA α1 and MarR α2, AphA α2 and MarR α3, AphA α3 and MarR α4, as well as the two β-strands that form the wing between helices α3 and α4 in AphA and between helices α4 and α5 in MarR. The similarity between AphA and MarR appears to be limited to the DNA binding domain, however, because AphA is lacking the N-terminal helix α1 that is important for MarR dimerization (19.Alekshun M.N. Kim Y.S. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and MarR is lacking the C-terminal helix α7 that is important for AphA dimerization. In addition, the MarR helix α5, which is analogous to the AphA helix α4, is much longer and contributes to the dimerization interface, whereas the shorter MarR α6 has only a minor role in dimerization.Dimerization Domain and Interface—A variety of biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that the active form of AphA is a dimer. For example, AphA recognizes a site in the tcpPH promoter with partial dyad symmetry (its DNaseI footprint covers 25 bp) (9.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14.Kovacikova G. Lin W. Skorupski K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4825-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and when fused to the DNA binding domain of the E. coli LexA protein, it confers upon the protein the ability to dimerize (8.Kovacikova G. Lin W. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the dimer interface lies primarily between the C-terminal α7 helices, which are 30 amino acids long and pack in an antiparallel manner. This interface is composed of hydrophobic contacts as well as a number of conserved polar and ionic interactions. Notable among these is a cluster of salt bridges involving Arg-148, Arg-151, and Arg-155 of one subunit and Glu-170 and Glu-174 of the other subunit. The interactions between these antiparallel helices are duplicated by the two-fold dimer symmetry and result in salt bridge pairs forming at both ends of the interface (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Structure of the AphA and MarR dimers. A, the AphA dimer viewed along the crystallographic two-fold axis. In this top view, the DNA binding face is underneath the dimer. For one molecule, the N-terminal DNA binding domain is green, and the C-terminal dimerization domain is red. For the second molecule, the DNA and dimerization domains are blue and orange, respectively. Unresolved residues in the wing motif are shown as a dashed line. B, electrostatic surface potential of the AphA dimer, oriented as in A. The complementary positive (blue) and negative (red) charge clusters that stabilize the dimer interface can be seen at both ends of the α7 helices. C, the AphA dimer viewed from the side, colored as in A. The DNA binding surface is at the bottom in this orientation. D, side view of the MarR dimer. The DNA binding and dimerization domains are colored the same as for AphA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The α7 helix of each subunit is also stabilized by intermolecular interactions with the adjacent helix α6, which together form a coiled coil leucine zipper-like structure along their length. Although most of the interactions between these helices involve the interdigitation of hydrophobic residues, there are also stabilizing polar and ionic interhelical interactions, such as a salt bridge between Asp-169 and Arg-123. The shorter helix α5 packs below one end of the coiled coil, interacting primarily via the hydrophobic interactions of Phe-96 and Leu-100 with side chains from helices α6 and α7. A Leu-115→Pro alteration has previously been shown to significantly reduce the ability of the protein to dimerize (8.Kovacikova G. Lin W. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), consistent with the apparent function of this region.In forming a dimer, the two AphA chains literally wrap around each other (Fig. 2C). The extended linker from one subunit leaves one side of the DNA binding domain and then runs along the underside of the dimerization domain of the second subunit until reaching helix α5. The α5 helix of the first subunit packs against the top center of the DNA binding domain of the second subunit and leads into the coiled coil formed by helices α6 and α7. This pair of helices then extends back toward the first subunit DNA binding domain, where there is a minor hydrophobic interaction between Tyr-31 of the DNA binding domain and Leu-154, Tyr-129, and Ile-132 of the dimerization domain. Given the rather open and extended structure of the monomer, it is unlikely to be stable by itself.The AphA dimerization domain differs substantially from that observed in the MarR dimer (Fig. 2D) in which the ends of helices α1 and α5 pack together so that the helical pairs from the two subunits cross in an almost perpendicular orientation, rather than the four relatively flat and parallel helices in the AphA dimerization domain (Fig. 2A). In addition, unlike AphA, the subunits in the MarR dimer are not topologically entwined. Comparison of the AphA dimerization domain with all of the known structures of winged helix proteins listed at the structural classification of proteins website (20.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5565) Google Scholar) shows the AphA dimerization domain topology to be unique in the winged helix superfamily. A DALI (18.Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) search also indicates that the dimerization domain of AphA is not similar to any other members of this protein superfamily.An interesting and rare interaction observed in the AphA dimer is an edge-on polar bond between His-89 in the middle of the linker of one monomer and the π -electron ring of Trp-164 of helix α7 of the other monomer. Another feature of the dimer is the presence of a pocket that is formed by helices α1 and α2 from one subunit and helix α5 of the second subunit. The protein chains are poorly packed in this region and there appears to be a solvent-accessible tunnel leading ∼15 Å into the dimer. The interface between the two monomers in this region is nonspecific. As it is the only one forming direct contacts between the DNA binding region of one monomer and the dimerization domain of the other, this loose interaction may allow the DNA binding domains to swing away from the dimerization domain to form a tight binding interface with the DNA. It could also serve as a potential site of interaction with AphB.DNA Binding Domain—As discussed in the first section, the DNA binding domain of AphA forms a winged helix fold. The winged helix superfamily contains at least 36 structural families of proteins (20.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5565) Google Scholar) that all contain at least one winged helix domain but have highly divergent structures in other regions of the protein. These families include: the MarR (13.Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) family, containing members such as MexR (13.Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), SlyA (21.Wu R.Y. Zhang R.G. Zagnitko O. Dementieva I. Maltzev N. Watson J.D. Laskowski R. Gornicki P. Joachimiak A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20240-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), SarR, and SarS (22.Li R. Manna A.C. Dai S. Cheung A.L. Zhang G. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); the CAP family; and the LysR family (23.Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 24.Huffman J.L. Brennan R.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), among many others. As the winged helix superfamily is divided into families by structural similarities in regions of the protein outside of the DNA binding domain, it appears that AphA is the founding member of the 37th structural family of this large superfamily. In all winged helix proteins, the helix-turn-helix motif is followed by a wing composed of two antiparallel β-strands. In AphA, helices α2 and α3 form the helix-turn-helix with the wing following helix α3. The loop linking helices α2 and α3 contains a stretch of three amino acids in an α-helical geometry, labeled as α2′ in Fig. 1C. Although a third β-strand is often present in winged helix proteins, AphA contains only a small interaction of two β-strand-like hydrogen bonds between the wing strand β2 and Ala-16 of the loop connecting helices α1 and α2.The importance of helices α2, α3, and the wing for the DNA binding activity of AphA has been confirmed by mutational analyses (8.Kovacikova G. Lin W. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, dominant negative mutations, which typically define amino acids important for DNA binding activity, have been isolated in α2 (G18R, Y19C, and G30D), α3 (H37E, Q39R, and Y41H), and the wing (K63E, R66E, and K67E) (see Fig. 1C). Dominant negative mutations in MarR have also been isolated within the helix analogous to AphA α3 (MarR α4) and the wing (19.Alekshun M.N. Kim Y.S. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), supporting the functional similarity of these two proteins. In addition, this region of AphA contains a number of positively charged residues as has been observed in other winged helix proteins (19.Alekshun M.N. Kim Y.S. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21.Wu R.Y. Zhang R.G. Zagnitko O. Dementieva I. Maltzev N. Watson J.D. Laskowski R. Gornicki P. Joachimiak A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Interactions with DNA—Using existing structures of winged helix protein·DNA complexes, a model of the AphA structure in complex with DNA was generated (Fig. 3A). In this model, the wing packs along the side of the DNA, spanning the phosphate backbones of both strands on either side of the minor groove. This arrangement allows both nonspecific contacts with the phosphate backbone as well as specific interactions between side chains from the wing and bases in the minor groove. Major groove interactions would primarily involve helix α3. In our model, the second molecule in the dimer is oriented such that it sits above the second DNA binding site, related to the first molecule by a two-fold rotation axis. In this orientation, the AphA dimer would sit on one face of the DNA in a manner similar the model proposed for MexR (25.Lim D. Poole K. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29253-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), with the dimer spanning ∼26 nucleotide base pairs, consistent with the results of DNaseI footprinting (9.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Models of protein·DNA complexes. A, a model of the AphA dimer (one chain in blue and the other in green) bound to its DNA site with the complete AphA wing modeled in, based on the wing structure observed in MarR. The primary DNA binding interface is predicted to involve helix α3 from each monomer (orange), which fit into adjacent major grooves on the same face of the DNA. As the helices are not optimally spaced, some conformational change in the protein and/or DNA likely takes place. B, model of the AphA-AphB heterotetramer bound to DNA. The AphB dimer structure was modeled by threading the AphB sequence into the crystal structure of CbnR and then placing it next to the AphA-DNA model shown in A. In this orientation, the C-terminal domain of one molecule of AphB (red) would be able to interact with the AphA dimer (green and blue). Interaction between AphA and AphB could also form between the tips of the wings. This model predicts a linear mode of binding that would not significantly distort the DNA in which four adjacent major grooves are bound by the AphA dimer and the AphB dimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order for both subunits to pack against the DNA in a manner identical to that observed for other winged helix proteins, it appears that a small amount of structural rearrangement is necessary, as the recognition helices of the two AphA subunits are too far apart (by ∼6–8 Å) to fit symmetrically into the DNA binding sites. This rearrangement likely involves either a slight bending of the DNA, movement of the AphA DNA binding domains slightly toward each other, or both. It is also possible that neither the DNA nor the AphA dimer is distorted, in which case AphA would bind in an asymmetric fashion, as has been observed in the E. coli Rob transcription factor (26.Kwon H.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Implications for Transcriptional Activation with AphB—In addition to its ability to dimerize and bind to DNA, AphA must cooperate with the LysR-type regulator AphB to activate tcpPH transcription (6.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4250-4256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of evidence suggests that AphA enhances the ability of AphB to bind to DNA by an unusual mechanism that involves direct interaction with it (8.Kovacikova G. Lin W. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12.Kovacikova G. Skorupski K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For example, certain mutants of AphA unable to bind to DNA on their own have been found to be rescued for DNA binding in the presence of AphB. Additionally, insertion of half a helical turn between the AphA and AphB binding sites blocks this interaction by shifting the proteins to opposite faces of the DNA and prevents transcriptional activation. Once stably bound, it appears that AphB has the primary role in activation. The AphA structure presented here, together with the recent report of the first crystal structure of a full-length LysR-type transcriptional regulator CbnR from Ralstonia eutropha, (27.Muraoka S. Okumura R. Ogawa N. Nonaka T. Miyashita K. Senda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggests a model for this interaction (see Fig. 3B).The DNA binding domain of CbnR is composed of three α helices and two β-strands that form a winged helix-turn-helix motif. Modeling studies indicate the recognition helix (α3) of CbnR contacts the major groove of the DNA. The primary dimerization interface of CbnR, which forms a biological tetramer, involves helix α4 from each subunit. This CbnR dimer of dimers also forms complex interactions between the four C-terminal domains and is predicted to bend DNA upon binding. Because a variety of evidence suggests that AphB is a biological dimer, its apparent interaction with AphA at tcpPH raises the possibility that the AphA-dimer·AphB-dimer complex forms a heterodimer of dimers when bound to DNA analogous to the homodimer of dimers formed by CbnR. In this model (Fig. 3B), the C-terminal domain of at least one subunit of the AphB dimer would interact with an AphA dimer bound at the adjacent promoter site. A putative interaction site could include the solvent-exposed tunnel on AphA that is oriented toward AphB. Such an interaction with AphA would greatly stabilize AphB binding by providing a second binding site, in effect anchoring it on the DNA in a ternary complex. This dimer-of-dimers would be a novel evolutionary variation on the theme of tetrameric LysR-type regulators.Concluding Remarks—AphA is the first of a new family of winged helix transcriptional regulators to be crystallized. Its structure contains a distinctive C-terminal antiparallel coiled coil that is involved in self-dimerization. Although AphA is capable of binding to DNA on its own, it is unusual in its requirement that it interact with a second protein to activate transcription.

Evolution could assure this by designing families of kinase such as basophilic kinases and proline-directed kinase with distinct peptide specificity; their reciprocal peptide specificity would have to be very complete, since recruitment of substrate allows phosphorylation of even rather poor phosphorylation sites in a protein. Here we report a powerful evolutionary strategy that assures distinct substrates for basophilic kinases (PKA, PKG and PKC (AGC) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)) and proline-directed kinase, namely by the presence or absence of proline at the P+1 position in substrates. Analysis of degenerate and non-degenerate peptides by in vitro kinase assays reveals that proline at the P+1 position in substrates functions as a “veto” residue in substrate recognition by AGC and CAMK kinases. Furthermore, analysis of reported substrates of two typical basophilic kinases, protein kinase C and protein kinase A, shows the lowest occurrence of proline at the P+1 position. Analysis of crystal structures and sequence conservation provides a molecular basis for this disfavor and illustrate its generality.

Analysis of crystal structures and sequence conservation provides a molecular basis for this disfavor and illustrate its generality. Phosphorylation is a prevalent modification in cells that controls many functions such as signaling transduction, proliferation and apoptosis. It is estimated that at least one-third of all proteins in eukaryotic cell are phosphorylated at any given time (1Mann M. Ong S.E. Gronborg M. Steen H. Jensen O.N. Pandey A. Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 261-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 2Zolnierowicz S. Bollen M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). More than 500 human protein kinases have been identified so far (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6256) Google Scholar). A high degree of selectivity in substrate phosphorylation is necessary to maintain functional integrity of this very complicated signaling environment. Precision in phosphorylation is particularly critical when a substrate protein is phosphorylated at two (or more) phosphorylation sites, and those sites 1) are phosphorylated by distinct upstream kinases and 2) confer distinct properties on that substrate. To assure fidelity of signaling in this common situation, each upstream kinase must show high specificity by phosphorylating only the relevant phosphorylation site and not the inappropriate site(s). This requirement poses a major challenge in evolutionary design of kinase peptide specificity, since those upstream kinases are usually recruited to the substrate, and such recruitment can overcome much of the barrier provided by peptide specificity (4Zhu G. Liu Y. Shaw S. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These considerations raise the important issue as to what elements in kinase peptide specificity confer the strongest reciprocal specificity between kinases, i.e. which prevent one kinase from phosphorylating substrates phosphorylated by another. For Ser/Thr kinases, we propose that much of this reciprocal specificity is provided by the evolution of three broad classes (5Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar): basophilic kinases that phosphorylate sites with clustered positive charges, acidophilic kinases that phosphorylate sites with clustered negative charges, and proline-directed kinases that phosphorylate sites in which Ser/Thr is followed immediately by a proline (i.e. proline at the P+1 position). This classification by peptide specificity corresponds generally with classification of Ser/Thr kinases based on sequence similarity. Based on studies of a sampling of family members, two large families of kinases appear to be largely included in the basophilic group: the 61 gene AGC 1The abbreviations used are: AGC, PKA, PKG and PKC; CAMK, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; PK, protein kinase; PDB, protein data base.

The acidophilic kinase group is much smaller, including, for example, casein kinase I and casein kinase II. The basophilic kinases and acidophilic kinases would be expected to be largely non-overlapping in peptide specificity; the electrostatic interactions that promote phosphorylations of basic sites by basophilic kinases will create an aversion for acidic sites (and vice versa). Moreover, proline-directed kinases will eschew substrates of the other two which lack proline at P+1. However, a missing element in the foregoing paradigm is one that prevents basophilic kinases or acidophilic kinases from phosphorylating sites preferred by proline-directed kinases. Such an element may be greater importance for basophilic kinases, since their preference for basic residues is shared in a limited fashion by some proline-directed kinases (e.g. Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk5, Dyrk, GSK3) (5Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr.

We have identified an evolutionary strategy widely used by basophilic kinases that addresses that problem. We find a disfavor for proline at the P+1 position among AGC and CAMK kinases. That disfavor is stronger than for any other residues at positions around the phosphorylation site and is unusually consistent among members of these kinase families. As a result, proline at the P+1 position serves as a “veto residue” for phosphorylation by these kinases; this strategy established by kinase evolution provides tight reciprocal specificity between basophilic and proline-directed kinases. Degenerate Peptides and Kinases—Biotinylated single sequence peptides and degenerate peptides were synthesized as C-terminal amides on Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia) SynPhase Rink amide acrylic-grafted polypropylene solid support (loading 7.5 μmol) using conventional Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described previously (15Fujii K.

PKC-δ, PKC-ζ, PKA, and PKG were purchased from Calbiochem, and PKD2 and Cdk2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. A 6 × His-tagged construct corresponding to residues 615–874 of human PRK1 (GenBank™ accession number BC040061) was expressed in 293T cell by calcium phosphate transfection and the corresponding protein purified by nickel affinity chromotography.

In brief in vitro phosphorylation in the presence of γ-32P-labeled ATP (in 100 μm cold ATP) was performed in 50 μl of solution under standardized conditions resulting in stoichiometry of phosphorylation less than 10%. After reaction termination, 50 pmol of substrate was transferred to streptavidin-coated plates and emissions counted after extensive washing. Kinase buffer for PKC-δ, PKC-ζ, PKD2, PKG, PKA, and PRK1 is 100 mm HEPES, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm MgCl2. For kinase PKC-δ, PKC-ζ, and PKD2, 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were added to the kinase buffer immediately before the assay. Kinase buffer for CAMK II is 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 8 μg/ml calmodulin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, which was minimally modified from Madhavan (34Madhavan R. Jarrett H.W. Biochim.

A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) a strong disfavor for proline at the P+1 position was noted. Given the potential biological importance of P+1 proline disfavor, analysis was expanded to other AGC family members such as PKG (Fig. 1A). Markedly different levels of phosphorylation by PKG are observed between peptides that differ only by a single amino acid at their P+1 position. Since each peptide is a pool of about 1 billion individual peptides, the preference (or disfavor) observed must reflect a preference (or disfavor) of that kinase for many peptides in that huge pool. When Pro is present at the P+1 position, the amount of phosphorylation is much lower than with any other residue. Specifically, phosphorylation of peptide #13 (Pro at P+1) is about 1/10 of the average for all peptide pools. Thus, Pro must be unfavorable at the P+1 position for most of the phosphorylatable peptides in this degenerate peptide pool #13. We investigated whether the strong disfavor for Pro at P+1 was a characteristic shared with other kinases. Four additional members of the AGC kinase family (PKA, PKC-δ, PKC-ζ, and PRK1) were tested and each showed strong disfavor for Pro at P+1. One way to visualize this comparison of kinases is with a PSSM Logo showing preferences of those kinases at the P+1 position (Fig. 1B). Consider first the results for PKG (Fig. 1B, left column, which corresponds to data shown in Fig. 1A). The parameter represented in the PSSM Logo is log2 of the ratio to mean for each residue; this mathematical conversion gives favored residue positive scores and disfavored residues negative scores. The PSSM Logo shows the residue most favored by PKG at the top (I) and the most disfavored residue (P) at the bottom. The columns corresponding to other kinases show that the strong disfavor for proline at the P+1 position is observed for each of the four other AGC kinases (PKA, PKC-δ, PKC-ζ, and PRK1). To broaden the analysis, we also examined two members of the CAMK family (CAMK II and PKD2); since they share the preference for Arg at P-3 (and P-2) (5Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) they can be analyzed with the same sets of degenerate peptides. The results show that CAMK II and PKD2 also have strong disfavor for Pro at P+1 (Fig. 1B). One useful way to further characterize the proline disfavor at P+1 is to compare it with the preferences for residues in other positions near the phosphorylation site. Such a comparison is shown for the five basophilic kinases studied in further detail (Fig. 2). Consider first the results for PKG (Fig. 2, left panel). The distribution of scores is approximately centered on zero, and most residue preferences are close to zero. The outlier far to the left corresponds to Pro at P+1; its separation from the rest of the distribution demonstrates that this is a singular disfavor, i.e. distinctly stronger than the disfavor for any residue at any other position studied. At the opposite extreme, there are several outliers in the favored direction; these correspond to Arg and Lys at P-2 and P-3, as would be expected based on the known very strong PKG preference for those residues in those positions (5Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, disfavor for Pro at P+1 position is by far the single strongest disfavored residue for PKG. The frequency distribution of scores for these others kinases revealed that for each of them Pro at P+1 is the most disfavored residue among all residues at all positions tested. Scores for Pro at position P+1 range from -2.2 to -3.1; these scores are both more extreme than any other disfavored residue we have studied and more consistent between AGC/CAMK kinases than any other disfavored residue. The foregoing studies of in vitro peptide phosphorylation indicate that Pro at the P+1 position is a disfavored residue for many kinases of the AGC and CAMK family. If this characteristic is relevant not only to peptides but also to proteins, then the frequency of Pro at the P+1 position in reported substrates should be much less than the frequency of Pro in human proteins generally (6.5%). Such a comparison can be convincing only when a large number of substrates have been reported, as is the case for PKA and PKC. We have accumulated a list of 124 PKC substrates from review of the literature (15Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); the list was not biased by our hypothesis of Pro disfavor, since it was accumulated before that hypothesis was formulated. Analysis of the number and position of Pro residues in these PKC substrates strongly supports the prediction. The overall frequency of Pro residues in these substrates (from position P-8 to P+8) was 4.8% and thus not very different from the proteome at large. Notably the frequency of Pro at P+1 was very low; only 1 of 124 reported substrates had Pro at P+1, which represents a frequency of only 0.8%. It is useful to convert results of residue frequency analysis in substrates into a log score by determining the log base 2 of (observed frequency/expected frequency); that log2 score for Pro at P+1 from reported PKC substrate analysis is -3.1, which is comparable with our score of -2.6 derived from degenerate peptide analysis. Analysis was expanded to determine proline favor/disfavor at residue position P-7 to P+6 (Fig. 3A). There is generally good agreement between the scores derived from residue frequency in reported substrates and scores derived from degenerate peptides. We performed a similar analysis on PKA sites compiled by Shabb (8Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar); of those 136 were mammalian sites plausibly assigned to PKA based on the references cited. The frequency of Pro at P+1 in these substrates was 1.3%, which is again much lower than expected based on overall frequency in those substrates (5.5%) or human proteins generally (6.5%). As was seen with PKC, the position-specific scores for Pro frequency in substrates are in general agreement with scores from degenerate peptides (Fig. 3B). Thus, there is a very low Pro frequency at the P+1 position in reported PKC and PKA substrates and the P+1 position is the only one at which Pro disfavor occurs in both PKC and PKA. The potential importance of this disfavor is magnified when understood in the context of the virtual requirement for Pro at P+1 among proline-directed kinases (5Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17430-17440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consisting primarily of the CMGC family of kinases, such as Cdk2. As noted in the introduction, at least five proline-directed kinases have a modest basophilic preference, which creates the potential risk of poor discrimination between basophilic AGC/CAMK kinases and proline-directed kinases. We therefore tested whether the disfavor for Pro at P+1 is an important element in discrimination of AGC/CAMK sites from sites recognized by proline-directed kinases. As a proof of principle we chose “proteomic” peptides corresponding to basic sites in the proteome that our algorithms suggested could be good substrates for basophilic kinases in all respects except for their Pro at P+1. We then synthesized peptides with wildtype sequence (Pro at P+1) or with substitutions to two alternative residues at the P+1 position. One proteomic peptide was particularly informative for comparison of PKC-δ versus Cdk2 (Fig. 4A). PKC-δ was efficient in phosphorylating the peptide whose P+1 residues was Phe (PKC-delta PSSM score 1.0, also see Fig. 1B); less efficient with an His at P+1 (PSSM score 0.1, also see Fig. 1B) and almost inactive with a Pro at P+1 (PSSM score -3.1, also see Fig. 1B). In contrast Cdk2 efficiently phosphorylated only the peptide with Pro at P+1 and neither of the others. Thus, the specificity differences between Cdk2 and PKC-δ are as much a result of the aversion of PKC-δ for Pro as the preference of Cdk2 for Pro. Analysis of the second proteomic peptide (and P+1 variations thereof) was particularly informative for comparison of CAMK II with Cdk2 (Fig. 4B). CAMK II can efficiently phosphorylate the peptide with Phe at P+1 but is very inefficient in phosphorylating the peptide with Pro at the P+1 position. Note that phosphorylation of the peptide with Pro at P+1 (the most disfavored residue at P+1 for CAMK II, Fig. 1B) is much less than the peptide having Gln at P+1 (the second most disfavored residue, Fig. 1B); thus Pro has an exceptional capacity to veto phosphorylation by CAMK II. Based on the foregoing studies, we introduce the term “proline-aversive” kinase to describe those with a strong disfavor for Pro at P+1 and thereby highlight the reciprocity of their specificity to that of proline-directed kinases. The structural basis for the difference between the proline-directed kinases and proline-aversive kinase can be understood based on differences between the solved structures of proline-directed kinases with bound peptide (e.g. PDB code 1QMZ) and AGC/CAMK kinases with bound peptide (e.g. PDB code 1ATP). One of the regions of the kinase domain that is most important for substrate recognition region is the activation loop, a flexible region of the kinase that 1) lies along the catalytic cleft, 2) is involved in binding C-terminal residues of substrate, and 3) is subject to extensive conformational regulation (16Cox S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Taylor S.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J.

In the activation loop there is a critical residue which we refer to as the toggle residue whose conformation differs dramatically between proline-aversive and proline-directed kinases. In the two proline-aversive kinases with solved structure (AGK family kinase PKA and the CAMK member PHK) the toggle residue is a glycine, whose backbone carbonyl is oriented toward the catalytic cleft (Gly200 (G200, Fig. 5, A and B); that carbonyl facilitates binding of substrate by the formation of a H-bond with the backbone amide of the substrate P+1 residue (19Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 20Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Substrates having Pro at P+1 cannot form that H-bond because the proline amide is not an H-bond donor. In contrast, in proline-directed kinases (Erk2, Cdk2, GSK3) the carbonyl group of their toggle residue is oriented away from the catalytic cleft (21Bax B. Carter P.S. Lewis C. Guy A.R. Bridges A.

Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) (Val164 (V164), Fig. 5, C and 5D). So binding of all residues except Pro at P+1 position will be disfavored because of an uncompensated H-bond from the main-chain P+1 amide of the substrate (23Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 24Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The orientation of the toggle residue in proline-directed kinases is enforced by a strategically placed arginine (Arg169 (R169), Fig. 5D), which we refer to as a toggle-regulating residue. That arginine is located in the P+1 loop, which is a loop adjacent to the activation loop (that is firmly attached to the stable C-lobe of the kinase domain). That arginine forms an H-bond with the carbonyl of the toggle residue, thereby maintaining the usual conformation of that toggle residue (23Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 24Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5D). In the foregoing model, the single residue most pivotal to creating the two distinct conformations of the toggle residue is this toggle-regulating arginine. Sequence analysis of human kinases reveals a striking pattern of conservation of the toggle-regulating residue (Table I). All 61 kinases of the CMGC family have arginine at that position. In contrast, none of the 324 kinases in the AGC, CAMK, STE, TK, and TKL families have arginine at that position; instead they have acyclic hydrophobic residues, which cannot provide an H-bond to the carbonyl of the toggle residue. Therefore, this amino acid position has the property of absolute conservation within the CMGC family and complete discordance from AGC/CAMK and other kinases. Recently Kannan and Neuwald (26Kannan N. Neuwald A.F. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2059-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) noted that this arginine residue, which they refer to as the “CMGC-arginine,” is the most characteristic feature of the CMGC kinase family.Table 1Analysis of sequence conservation of the toggle-regulating residue and the toggle residue among human kinases Analysis is based on alignment of kinase domains of human kinases by Manning et al. (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S.

Nearly all CAMK and AGC kinases have A or G at this position (Table I). This makes sense from a structural perspective. Given the importance outlined above for hydrogen bond formation between the carbonyl group of the toggle residue and the P+1 backbone amide, it is essential that toggle residue have sufficient conformational flexibility to engage the backbone amide. This flexibility would be limited by spatial constraints imposed by a substantial side chain. To test these structural hypotheses we have mutationally swapped the toggle residue and toggle-regulating residues between Cdk2 and PKC-δ; however, both constructs are catalytically inactive (data not shown), indicating that these residues function normally only in the context of other kinase family-related residues. Nevertheless, these patterns of conservation of the toggle residue and toggle-regulating residue are fully consistent with their critical role in establishing a major difference between CMGC kinase and AGC/CAMK kinases. These results demonstrate that Pro at the P+1 position is a veto residue which virtually precludes phosphorylation by multiple AGC and CAMK kinases. As a result, Pro at P+1 provides tight control of reciprocal substrate specificity between proline-directed kinases and AGC/CAMK kinases. These findings for peptides are also relevant to proteins, since we find that Pro occurs at a much reduced frequency at the P+1 position among reported substrates for PKA and PKC. A structural explanation for this disfavor for proline is evident in crystal structures of AGC/CAMK in which a carbonyl group is strategically oriented toward the catalytic cleft. The ability of all substrate P+1 residues except proline to provide a backbone amide for H-bonding to that carbonyl gives such kinases a singular disfavor for proline. The foregoing analysis focuses on substrate binding but does not explicitly consider substrate positioning. A cardinal feature identified by structure/function analysis of protein kinases is that proper orientation of the activation loop and peptide is essential for catalysis (16Cox S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Taylor S.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 18Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For proline-directed kinases substrate positioning is provided by docking of proline into a proline-selective pocket (Fig. 5C). Remarkably those residues (Val63 and Glu162) form this proline-selective pocket only when the activation loop is phosphorylated at Thr160 and the kinase domain is bound to cyclin A; in the unphosphorylated inactive complex the conformations of these two residues are very different, and there is no such tight and specific docking site for proline (27Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). For proline-aversive kinases positioning is provided in a different manner; the H-bond between activation loop and the P+1 backbone amide positions the substrate into an orientation suitable for phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). This H-bond also stabilizes the P+1 residue in a preferred orientation in which its side chain is oriented into the hydrophobic P+1 pocket of PKA; this orientation is observed with isoleucine at P+1 in 1ATP and is consistent with the preference for hydrophobic residues at the P+1 position for PKA (6Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). But in the special case of peptides with proline at P+1, this positioning mechanism cannot operate for PKA (or other CAMK/AGC kinase). We hypothesize that proline at P+1, since it lacks the orientation/constraint of a H-bond, can find another binding site(s) in the wide hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu205, Leu198, or even Phe187 (Figs. 5A). Improper binding of the proline residue can be quite stable but fails to result in catalysis because of incorrect positioning of the substrate (and phosphorylatable residue) in the catalytic cleft or conformation changes resulting from ectopic binding of proline. Extensive in silico and experimental analysis will be required to properly test this hypothesis. Proline is unique among natural amino acids in having a substituted amide and resulting conformational rigidity. Those properties make it uniquely suited for particular structural roles. For example, it is an important element in the peptide sequences recognized by proline-specific binding domain such as SH3, WW, and EVH1 domains (28Bedford M.T. Sarbassova D. Xu J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10359-10369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M.

The role of proline in favoring recognition by proline-directed kinases has been well established but not its reciprocal role as a veto residue at P+1 for basophilic kinases. Prior to the present study, a disfavor for proline at P+1 was noted for PKA (6Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and γ-PAK (31Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16059-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The proline disfavor of γ-PAK is particularly interesting since it is a basophilic kinase that belongs to a distinct STE subfamily of kinase (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6256) Google Scholar). It suggests that disfavor for proline at P+1 extends beyond the AGC and CAMK families, as is suggested by our sequence analysis tabulated in Table I. The present findings raise the possibility that disfavor for proline at other substrate positions may also contribute to fine peptide specificity of kinases. For example, PKC has a moderate disfavor for proline at the P+2 and P+3 positions evident both in our peptide specificity determination and in analyses of reported substrates (Fig. 3A). In contrast PKA shows disfavor for proline at P-2 by the same two criteria (Fig. 3B). Moreover, a strong disfavor for proline at P-4 has been reported for a plant kinase belonging to the SNRK subfamily of CAMK (32Huang J.Z. Huber S.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that proline residues at substrate positions other than P+1 can contribute to fine peptide specificity differences among basophilic kinases. Detailed structural understanding of such preferences is not available; however, it is plausible that PKCs disfavor for prolines at P+2 and P+3 in substrates reflects disruption of anti-parallel β sheet formation between activation loop and substrate positions P+1 to P+3 that has been observed in the Ser/Thr kinase PHK (20Lowe E.D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). These results highlight the importance of disfavored residues in kinase peptide specificity. They demonstrate the singular importance of Pro at the P+1 position as a veto residue for diverse kinases of the AGC and CAMK families. The reciprocity of this pattern to proline-directed CMGC kinases constitutes a powerful evolutionary strategy to assure non-overlapping phosphorylation by these large and important families of kinases.

The rat protein exhibits a quite elongated shape in solution (axial ratio = 5.7), suggesting that the domains are extended and arranged linearly, at least in the ultracentrifuge (4Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1902-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The thioredoxin domains near the N and C termini termed the a and a′ domains, respectively, contain active sites, each with a sequence CXXC that facilitates thiol-disulfide exchange. The catalytic domains are separated by two non-catalytic domains, b and b′, and the multi-domain structure terminates in a highly acidic C-terminal tail termed the c domain (abb′a′c). The b′ domain and the interface between the b′ and a′ domains contribute to peptide and protein substrate interactions (5Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I.

In addition to its four active site cysteines, PDI contains two internal, non-active site cysteines whose function has been unclear. In mammals and birds, the internal cysteines are conserved, located in the b′ domain of the protein, and are separated by 30 amino acids. In yeast and fungi including Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the non-active site cysteines are located near the N-terminal active site in the a domain and are separated by only 6–8 residues. Luz and Lennarz (6Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) recently reported that mutation of the non-active site cysteines to serines in Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDI did not affect yeast growth rates; however, these cysteines were required for the efficient processing of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a non-essential PDI substrate whose folding, maturation, and secretion requires both the oxidase and isomerase activities of PDI, suggesting that mutation of the non-active site cysteines impaired the activity in vivo. In contrast, mutation of the non-active site cysteines of the mammalian protein has no effect on activity (7Schwaller M. Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recently, studies on the redox state of PDI in the yeast ER suggested that the non-active site cysteines of the a domain were present as a disulfide in vivo (2Xiao R. Wilkinson B. Solovyov A. Winther J.R. Holmgren A. Lundström-Ljung J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49780-49786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of the structure of the yeast a domain predicts that the non-active site cysteines are within the covalent bonding distance of each other, suggesting a structural role. Using a gel-shift assay to count the number of free sulfhydryl groups under various redox conditions and mass spectrometry to identify the redox state of the non-active site cysteines, we find that the non-active site cysteine pair forms an extremely stable disulfide whose reduction is only efficiently effected by a strong reducing agent such as DTT. In contrast to the mammalian protein (8Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in which the redox potentials of the two active sites are comparable, the redox potentials of the a and a′ domains of the yeast protein differ by almost 20-fold. In addition, mutating the two non-active site cysteines to alanines significantly increases the stability of the disulfide between the active site cysteines of the a domain and impairs the oxidase and isomerase activities of PDI. In the absence of the structural disulfide in the a domain, the active site cysteines are easier to oxidize by 18-fold, making the a domain active site a poorer oxidant thermodynamically. Thus, in the yeast protein, the non-active site cysteines function as a structural disulfide that destabilizes the N-terminal active site disulfide, making it a better oxidant. Materials—GSH, GSSG, DTT, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and trichloroacetic acid were obtained from Sigma. PCR primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Skokie, IL). DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification of PDI from Escherichia coli—The coding sequence of yeast PDI was PCR-amplified from pCT-38 (9Norgaard P. Westphal V. Tachibana C. Alsoe L. Holst B. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to contain a 5′-NdeI site and a 3′-XhoI site. After digestion with NdeI and XhoI, the PCR products were inserted between the corresponding sites of the pET23a vector (Novagen) to create plasmid pET23a-YPDI, which adds a C-terminal His6 tag to the mature sequence of yeast PDI. A PDI mutant with the two non-active site cysteines mutated to alanines, C90A,C97A yeast PDI (numbering starting with the coding sequence of the yeast enzyme, GenBank™ accession number NP_009887) was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. A pET23a-YPDI template was used along with appropriate mutagenic primers (5′-ACT GAA AAC CAG GAT CT GGCT ATG GAA CAC AA CAT TC GAA TGT TGT GTT CCA TAGC CAGA TCCT GGT TTT CAGT-3′ for the C-terminal cysteine and 5′-TAC CTT GGC CCA GAT CGA CGCT ACT GAA AAC CAG GAT CTG GCG CCA GAT CCT GGT TTT CAG TA GCG TCG ATC T G GGC CAA GGTA-3′ for the N-terminal cysteine). PCR products then were digested with NdeI and XhoI and subcloned back into a digested pET23a plasmid to generate pET23a-C90A,C97A yeast PDI. The sequences of the coding regions of the wild-type and mutant PDI1 genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli strain BL21 (Gold) DE3 (Invitrogen) transformed with the appropriate pET23a vector containing either wild-type or mutant yeast PDI was grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm and induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold loading buffer (pH 7.5, 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 mm NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole), and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) precharged with nickel and equilibrated with loading buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of loading buffer and then with 5 ml of elution buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Eluate fractions containing PDI were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 to remove the imidazole. The purity of proteins was analyzed by SDS/PAGE and estimated to be >90%. Redox Potential Measurements—Maleimide-conjugated polyethylene glycol (Mal-PEG) was obtained from Nektar Therapeutics (San Carlos, CA) and was purified before use by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove low-molecular weight maleimides. These lower molecular weight maleimides may react with free sulfhydryl groups but do not significantly increase the molecular weight, leading to incomplete shifts of the protein on SDS-PAGE in fully reduced controls (2Xiao R. Wilkinson B. Solovyov A. Winther J.R. Holmgren A. Lundström-Ljung J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49780-49786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant PDI (3.5 μm) was incubated in various GSH/GSSG-disulfide redox buffers in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature. Protein was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 40% trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration). The protein was resuspended in 5 mm Mal-PEG in non-reducing 2× SDS sample buffer (3% SDS, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, glycerol, and bromphenol blue), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then quenched by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 50 mm. Reduced and oxidized controls were prepared by incubating the proteins in either 10 mm DTT in 2× SDS sample buffer or 1 mm GSSG in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature, acid-precipitating the protein with trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration), resuspending in Mal-PEG, and then quenching by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 50 mm. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on precast 4–20% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Band intensities were determined after subtracting a constant background from the images using Scion Image software (www.scioncorp.com). The fraction of the total cysteines present as sulfhydryl groups was determined by multiplying the intensity of each band times the number of sulfhydryl groups represented in the band, summing, and dividing by the total intensity. Redox potentials were calculated by plotting the total number of free sulfhydryl groups versus [GSH]2/[GSSG]. Kox represents the equilibrium constant for the reaction shown in Equation 1. ProteinSHSH+GSSG⇄Protein|SS+2GSH(Eq. 1) The data were fit by non-linear least squares to a model (Equation 2) that contained a single intramolecular disulfide in the oxidized state and two independently titrating sites where each site contained two sulfhydryl groups in the reduced state. Total SH=2×[GSH]2/[GSSG][GSH]2/[GSSG]+Kox1+2×[GSH]2/[GSSG][GSH]2/[GSSG]+Kox2(Eq. 2) For both the wild-type and mutant proteins, the fit of the data to a two-site model was significantly better than the fit of the data to a one-site model (10Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Wild-type and mutant proteins were prepared in the fully oxidized form by incubation with 1 mm GSSG. Protein with two sites reduced was prepared by equilibration with 8 mm GSH plus 0.2 mm GSSG. The fully reduced protein was generated using 10 mm DTT. All of the incubations were performed in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature. Protein was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 40% trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration) and resuspended in 20 mm NEM in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Unreacted NEM was removed by centrifugal gel filtration through Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences) that had been swelled and prewashed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8. PDI samples (10 μg) then were digested with 1 μg of Lys-C (WAKO) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, for 20 h at 37 °C and desalted using a ZipTip. Peptides were eluted from the ZipTip with 3–6 μl of an aqueous solution of 60% methanol and 2% formic acid. 1 μl was spotted on a MALDI target plate, dried, and matrix-spotted (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), and dried followed by analysis in reflector mode on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Monoisotopic peptide masses detected were sent to ProFound (PROWL, Rockefeller University) or MS-FIT (Protein Prospector, University of California, San Francisco) for protein data base searches and protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting. Ribonuclease Refolding Assay—Renaturation of reduced RNase was followed in a continuous assay as described previously (11Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The formation of active RNase was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring hydrolysis of the RNase substrate cCMP at 296 nm. Each sample contained 4.5 mm cCMP, 1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm GSSG, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 8 μm reduced RNase, and 0–9 μm wild-type or mutant yeast PDI. The assay was performed at 25 °C and initiated by the addition of reduced RNase. The isomerase activity was determined from the linear increase in the amount of enzymatically active RNase with time after a short lag, which reflects the oxidase activity. The lag time was determined from the x-intercept of a plot of RNase activity against time. The oxidase activity was estimated evaluated from linear plots of 1/lag against time and is reported as the slope of this plot in units of μm-1 min-1. Previous observations of the redox states of yeast PDI in the yeast ER suggest that the non-active site cysteines are present as a disulfide (2Xiao R. Wilkinson B. Solovyov A. Winther J.R. Holmgren A. Lundström-Ljung J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49780-49786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This suggestion is strengthened by homology modeling the sequence of the yeast PDI-a domain onto the NMR structure of the human PDI-a domain with 3D-PSSM (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk) (Fig. 1). The homology model suggests that the two cysteines outside the active site are sufficiently close to form a disulfide. In the fully oxidized state produced by incubating the wild-type protein with 1 mm GSSG, there are no free cysteines in the molecule, consistent with the idea that all of the cysteines in the protein are present as disulfides. Redox Potential Measurements—The three disulfide bonds of yeast PDI have different stabilities as indicated by measurements of the number of free sulfhydryl groups after equilibration with different glutathione redox buffers. A gel-shift assay that adds a polyethylene glycol-conjugated maleimide to each sulfhydryl group (12Wu H.H. Thomas J.A. Momand J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was used to count the number of free sulfhydryl groups present in both wild-type yeast PDI and a mutant of yeast PDI in which the non-active site cysteines are mutated to alanines (C90A,C97A). Mal-PEG alkylation of a single sulfhydryl results in an apparent molecular mass shift of ∼15 kDa as observed by SDS-PAGE. The number of 15-kDa shift increments of PDI on a gel indicates the number of cysteines that are present as sulfhydryl groups, because cysteines that are participating in disulfide bonds will not shift upon Mal-PEG treatment. As seen in Fig. 2, equilibration of the wild-type protein with an increasingly more reducing glutathione redox buffer leads to the availability of additional sulfhydryl groups that can be modified with Mal-PEG. In the fully oxidized state (lane 1) produced by incubating the protein with 1 mm GSSG, no Mal-PEG adducts were formed. In a series of glutathione redox buffers, the predominant bands observed for the wild-type protein occurred at two and four free sulfhydryl groups, suggesting minimal formation of glutathione-mixed disulfides involving only one sulfhydryl group. At the highest [GSH]2/[GSSG] examined (380 mm), only four sulfhydryl groups could be modified. However, complete reduction with DTT (10 mm) resulted in six Mal-PEG additions, indicating that one of the three cysteine pairs forms a very stable disulfide that can only be reduced with DTT. The redox potential of a cysteine pair can be expressed as the equilibrium constant (Kox) for the oxidation of that cysteine pair by GSSG, which produces two molecules of GSH (Equation 1). If the redox potentials are sufficiently different, the three disulfides can be selectively reduced. Equilibration in a number of different redox buffers of differing [GSH]2/[GSSG] followed by acid quenching, removal of the redox buffer, and modification with a gel-shift sulfhydryl reagent, Mal-PEG, displays the redox state of the protein as a function of the redox buffer composition (Fig. 2). The number of sulfhydryl groups was determined by integrating the intensities of the bands on the stained gel after Mal-PEG modification. For both the wild-type and mutant proteins, equilibration with different redox buffers shows a broad titration of two disulfides (four sulfhydryl groups) (Fig. 3) as the value of [GSH]2/[GSSG] increases. For the wild-type protein, DTT (10 mm) is needed to reduce the remaining disulfide, but for the C90A,C97A mutant protein, DTT reduction does not reveal an additional disulfide. The redox potentials of the individual sites was determined by fitting the number of free sulfhydryl groups observed by Mal-PEG alkylation to a model (Equation 2) in which two disulfides equilibrate independently. DTT controls were omitted from the statistical analysis but are shown in Fig. 3 to indicate the residual disulfide that can be reduced only with DTT. Both the wild-type and non-active site mutant proteins show a biphasic titration of two disulfides as the redox buffer becomes more reducing. Non-linear least squares fitting provides estimates of the thiol-disulfide oxidation potentials (Kox) for each site (Table I). For the wild-type protein, the Kox values are 1.0 ± 0.2 mm and 17 ± 3 mm and a third disulfide is sufficiently stable to resist reduction by glutathione. Because <10–20% of the most stable disulfide could be reduced by glutathione, we can estimate that the Kox value for its formation is greater than 1600 mm. When the non-active site cysteines are mutated to alanines, all of the disulfides of the mutant protein can be reduced by glutathione. The measured redox potentials for the disulfide that is reduced at the lowest [GSH]2/[GSSG] are identical for the wild-type and mutant proteins. However, the Kox of disulfide that titrates next in the mutant protein is ∼20-fold higher (more difficult to reduce) than the disulfide that titrates second in the wild-type protein. Consequently, the two titratable disulfides in wild-type PDI could correspond to the two active sites or they could correspond to one active site and the non-active site disulfide, depending on which cysteine pair forms the most stable disulfide.Table IThiol/disulfide redox potentials (KOX) for wild-type and mutant yeast PDIPDIKox1Kox2mmWild type1.0 ± 0.217 ± 3C90A,C97A2.0 ± 0.4310 ± 78 Open table in a new tab The Non-active Site Cysteines of Yeast PDI Form a Structural Disulfide—To determine which of the cysteines form a disulfide that cannot be reduced with glutathione, wild-type yeast PDI was incubated with GSSG (1 mm) to yield a species that did not react with Mal-PEG (no shift). Digestion of the GSSG-oxidized protein with Lys-C and MALDI mass spectrometry revealed a peptide of mass 1764.81 Da corresponding to the peptide containing the active site cysteines of the PDI-a′ domain and a peptide of mass 3143.4 Da corresponding to the peptide expected from a disulfide between the non-active site cysteines. The larger peptide containing the PDI-a domain active site cysteines (expected monoisotopic mass of disulfide containing peptide is 3337.5) was not observed, suggesting that its ionization was suppressed under the conditions of the MALDI experiment. Wild-type yeast PDI was partially reduced with a glutathione redox buffer (8 mm GSH and 0.2 mm GSSG) so that there were four PDI sulfhydryl groups. After NEM alkylation to prevent thiol/disulfide rearrangements, Lys-C peptide maps show that the peptide containing the non-active site cysteines (3143.4 Da) is still present. Upon full reduction of the wild-type protein with DTT, the peptide containing the non-active disulfide (3143.4 Da) disappears, indicating that it is the non-active site disulfide that is resistant to glutathione reduction. Enzymatic Activity—Mutation of the non-active site cysteines to alanine also has a significant effect on the oxidase and isomerase activities of yeast PDI using reduced RNase as substrate. During the oxidative folding of reduced RNase, the oxidase activity of PDI converts the reduced RNase to a complex mixture of inactive oxidized forms that then are converted to native RNase by the disulfide isomerase activity (13Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The oxidase activity is indicated by the lag time for the appearance of active RNase after initiation of the refolding, whereas the isomerase activity can be measured after the lag by the appearance of enzymatically active RNase. Under these conditions, both the oxidase and isomerase activities of the mutant PDI are compromised (Table II). Thus, the integrity of the non-active site cysteines of the PDI-a domain is needed for full oxidase and isomerase activity.Table IIOxidase activities of wild-type and mutant yeast PDIPDIOxidase activityaAssays were performed using 8 μm rRNase in 4.5 mm cCMP, 100 mm Tris-HCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 25 °C in a glutathione redox buffer (1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm GSSG),bThe oxidase activity is reflected by the decrease in the lag time preceding the formation of native RNase from reduced RNase as the PDI concentration increases.

The vertebrate enzyme is 96% conserved from chicken to human (86% identical, 96% similar), and even the yeast and mammalian proteins share 38% identity in the catalytic domains. Along with the overall domain architecture in which four thioredoxin domains are linked together, the sequences around the active site cysteines are strictly conserved among all of the eukaryotes including yeast and fungi (Fig. 4). In vertebrate PDIs, including those of human and chicken, there are also two conserved cysteines outside the active site but they are located in the non-catalytic PDI-b′ domain. Their mutation to serine has no effect on enzymatic activity (7Schwaller M. Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the two non-active site cysteines appear to be somewhat shielded from solvent (5Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E.H. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol.

In yeast and fungal PDIs, including that of Dictyostelium discoidium, there are also two conserved cysteines outside the active site; however, in these organisms, they are conserved within the catalytic PDI-a domain. In the yeast ER, approximately two of the six cysteines of yeast PDI are present as sulfhydryls. Mutation of the non-active site disulfide does not appreciably change the number of free cysteines, suggesting that the non-active site cysteines are present as a disulfide in vivo (2Xiao R.

Westphal et al. (14Westphal V. Darby N.V. Winther J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) observed that mutating all of the catalytic active site cysteines to serines in the yeast PDI-a and PDI-a′ domains destroyed the catalytic activity, suggesting that the role of the remaining non-active site cysteines is structural rather than catalytic. Luz and Lennarz (6Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) investigated the contribution of the non-active site cysteines to the function of S. cerevisiae PDI in vivo by mutating them to serine. Although the non-active site cysteines of PDI were not essential for cell growth and viability, they were required for the efficient processing of CPY (6Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Expression of the yeast PDI-a′ domain supports normal doubling times and CPY processing in the yeast ER (2Xiao R. Wilkinson B.

This implies that mutation of the structural disulfides in the a domain has a more significant effect on protein maturation in the ER than deletion of three domains of the protein, including the a domain. The results of our in vitro activity assays (Table II) confirm that mutation of the structural disulfides of the yeast protein has a very significant effect on both the oxidase and isomerase activities, decreasing the oxidase activity to 36% wild-type protein and decreasing the isomerase activity to only 20% wild-type protein. The effects of mutating the structural disulfide of the a domain are more significant on catalytic activity than mutating the catalytic cysteines of the a domain. Westphal et al. (14Westphal V. Darby N.V. Winther J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found that a yeast PDI mutant with the catalytic cysteines replaced by serine had 50% oxidase activity of the wild-type protein and 50% isomerase activity. In contrast to the vertebrate protein whose two active sites have indistinguishable redox potentials of 1–2 mm (8Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Schwaller M. Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the active sites of the yeast protein titrate with independently measurable redox potentials. The most easily reduced disulfide in the yeast enzyme has the same oxidation potential (Kox) in both the mutant and wild-type protein, suggesting that it represents the redox potential of the a′ active site. Consequently, the Kox of the a′ domain of the yeast protein (1 mm) is quite similar to that of the active sites of the mammalian protein. Because partial reduction of the wild-type protein does not reduce the disulfide between the non-active site cysteines, the second disulfide to titrate in the redox titration of the wild-type protein must be the active site disulfide of the a domain. The Kox of the second disulfide to titrate is 17 mm. The active site disulfide of the a domain is almost 20-fold more difficult to reduce than the disulfide of the a′ domain (Kox = 1 mm). Thus, the disulfide formed at the active site of the yeast PDI-a domain is structurally more stable than the disulfide formed at the a′ domain by a difference that amounts to ∼1.6 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, when the non-catalytic structural disulfide in the a domain is destroyed by mutation, the active site disulfide of the a domain becomes significantly more stable. The Kox for reduction of this disulfide increases from 17 mm in the wild-type protein to ∼300 mm in the mutant protein, an 18-fold increase in disulfide stability in the mutant protein. This implies that the role of the structural disulfide in PDI from lower eukaryotes is to destabilize the disulfide of the a domain, making it a better oxidizing agent thermodynamically. The finding that the active sites have significantly different oxidation potentials may have implications for PDI catalysis in vivo. In the yeast ER, PDI has on average ∼1.4 free active site sulfhydryl groups/molecule (2Xiao R. Wilkinson B. Solovyov A. Winther J.R. Holmgren A. Lundström-Ljung J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49780-49786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Tsai and Rapoport (15Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have reported that the a′ active site is preferentially oxidized by Ero1 in the yeast ER, implying that in vivo the a domain active site cysteines are present as sulfhydryls, whereas the a′ domain active site cysteines form a disulfide. It is not unreasonable then to predict that in yeast, disulfide formation, which requires an oxidized PDI active site, is performed primarily by the a′ domain active site, whereas disulfide isomerization, which requires a reduced active site, is performed primarily by the a domain active site. Consistent with this speculation is the finding by Westphal et al. (14Westphal V. Darby N.V. Winther J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that the a domain is more important than the a′ domain for the maturation of CPY in vivo. Because the oxidase activity of PDI is more essential for yeast viability than its isomerase activity (2Xiao R. Wilkinson B. Solovyov A. Winther J.R. Holmgren A. Lundström-Ljung J. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49780-49786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), disrupting the domain responsible primarily for isomerization should have no effect on cell growth and viability. Luz and Lennarz (6Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) mutated the non-active site cysteines of yeast PDI and found no consequences on cell growth and viability (6Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, they did observe that CPY folding was impaired. In the absence of the non-active site disulfide, the a domain active site disulfide is stabilized 18-fold. Therefore, the a domain active site is 18 times more difficult to reduce in a mutant PDI lacking the non-active site cysteines than in the wild-type protein. The inability of the a domain active site of this mutant to be reduced under in vivo redox conditions and to catalyze disulfide isomerization could account for the impairment in CPY folding observed by Luz and Lennarz (6Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)."

Most of the inhibitors identified to date inhibit kinase activity by interfering with the ATP-binding site of CDKs. We recently proposed that the protein/protein interface and conformational changes required in the molecular mechanism of CDK2-cyclin A activation were potential targets for the design of specific inhibitors of cell cycle progression. To this aim, we have designed and characterized a small peptide, termed C4, derived from amino acids 285–306 in the α5 helix of cyclin A. We demonstrate that this peptide does not interfere with complex formation but forms stable complexes with CDK2-cyclin A. The C4 peptide significantly inhibits kinase activity of complexes harboring CDK2 in a competitive fashion with respect to substrates but does not behave as an ATP antagonist. Moreover, when coupled with the protein transduction domain of Tat, the C4 peptide blocks the proliferation of tumor cell lines, thereby constituting a potent lead for the development of specific CDK-cyclin inhibitors.

In higher eukaryotes, cell cycle progression is coordinated by several closely related Ser/Thr protein kinases resulting from the association of a catalytic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CBM, cyclin binding motif; CD, circular dichroism; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Rb, retinoblastoma. 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CBM, cyclin binding motif; CD, circular dichroism; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Rb, retinoblastoma. subunit with a regulatory cyclin subunit (1.Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). CDK-cyclin complexes are regulated by both phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and protein-protein interactions with different partners, including structural CDK inhibitors. Genetic evidence supports a strong correlation between alterations in the regulation of CDKs and the molecular pathology of cancer (2.Malumbres M. Carnero A. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 5-18PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the past few years there has been considerable interest in the development of inhibitors of CDK protein kinases (3.Gali-Muhtasib H. Bakkar N. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2002; 2: 309-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4.Dancey J. Sausville E.A. Nat. Rev.

A greater understanding of the cell cycle and the inherent complexity of CDK regulation offer a number of possible routes to its inhibition (6.Swanton C. Lancet Oncol. 2004; 5: 27-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). One of the currently most developed strategies to inhibit CDKs is based on the design of small molecules that target the ATP-binding site, thereby interfering directly with their catalytic activity. Despite the high degree of sequence conservation between the catalytic clefts of protein kinase family members, a number of kinase-specific ATP antagonists have been characterized (7.Huwe A. Mazitschek R. Giannis A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2122-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8.Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6606-6620Google Scholar). Another strategy for blocking malignant cellular proliferation involves the design of peptide-based inhibitors that target the substrate recruitment binding groove identified on cyclin partners and on a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins (11.McInnes C. Andrews M.J.I. Zheleva D.I. Lane D.P. Fischer P.M. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2003; 3: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recognition of this groove is mediated by a specific sequence termed the cyclin binding motif (CBM). Several CBM-derived peptides have been reported to induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro (12.Ball K.L. Lain S. Fåhraeus R. Smythe C. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13.Chen Y.N.P. Sharma S.K. Ramsey T.M. Jiang L. Martin M.S. Baker K. Adams P.D. Bair K.W. Kaelin W.G. Proc. Natl.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1020-1024PubMed Google Scholar) when conjugated to cellular delivery vectors. Determination of the crystal structure of several CDK and CDK-cyclin complexes has provided essential information on the mechanism of formation and activation of these protein kinases (15.Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Upon binding to CDK2, cyclin A induces a marked structural reorganization of the catalytic kinase subunit (16.Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), which involves rearrangement of the PSTAIRE helix and repositioning of the relative orientation of the N- and C-terminal lobes. The α3 and α5 helices of cyclin A clamp the PSTAIRE at its center through hydrogen bonds, thereby promoting reconfiguration of the ATP-binding site. The cyclin also interacts with the T-loop of CDK2, causing this loop to move away from the active site. A fully active complex is finally generated through the phosphorylation of CDK2 on Thr160, which induces further changes in the orientation of the T-loop and promotes additional contacts with cyclin A. In contrast, comparison of the crystal structures of cyclin A in its free (17.Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and CDK2-bound state (16.Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar) indicates that this regulatory subunit does not undergo any conformational changes upon complex formation. We have recently demonstrated that the molecular mechanism of CDK2-cyclin A complex formation is a two-step process (18.Morris C.M. Gondeau C. Tainer J.A. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23847-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The first step involves the rapid association between the PSTAIRE helix of CDK2 and helices α3 and α5 of the cyclin to yield a non-processive intermediate complex. Two residues in the PSTAIRE helix, Ile49 and Arg50, located in a hydrophobic pocket in close contact with the side chains of Lys263, Lys266, and Phe267 and those of Leu299 and Leu306 within the α3 and α5 helices of cyclin A, respectively, are essential for the initial assembly of the CDK-cyclin complex. The second step involves additional contacts between the C-lobe of the CDK and the N-terminal helix of the cyclin, which induce subsequent isomerization of the CDK into a fully mature form by promoting exposure of the T-loop for phosphorylation by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) as well as formation of the substrate-binding site. Both the conformational changes of the nonprocessive intermediate and phosphorylation have been reported to control the selectivity of the CDK for its cyclin partner (19.Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20.Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Lawrie A.M. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G.

We suggest that the steps of assembly and the activation of CDK-cyclin complexes both constitute key targets for the development of specific inhibitors. In the present work, we propose a new strategy to selectively inhibit kinase activity of CDK-cyclin complexes by targeting the protein/protein interface between the two subunits. We have designed a peptide of 22 residues derived from the α5 helix of cyclin A that forms stable complexes with CDK2-cyclin A. We demonstrate that this peptide inhibits CDK2 kinase activity in a competitive fashion with respect to protein substrates. Moreover, when coupled to the protein transduction domain of Tat, this peptide blocks proliferation of tumor cell lines and therefore constitutes a potent lead for the development of specific CDK-cyclin inhibitors. Chemicals—N,N-Dimethylformamide, piperidine, trifluoroacetic acid, and CH3CN (high performance liquid chromatography grade) were purchased from SDS (Peypin, France). The protected amino acids were from SENN Chemicals (Dielsdorf, Switzerland). O-Hexafluoro-phospho-[7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl]-N,N,N′, N′-tetramethyluronium (HATU), diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), and resins were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and thioanisole, ethanedithiol, and triisopropylsilane were from Sigma-Aldrich. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—All peptides were synthesized using an Fmoc continuous flow apparatus (Pioneer™; Applied Biosystems) starting from Fmoc-peptide amide liner-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene resins at a 0.2-mmol scale. The coupling reactions were performed with 0.5 m HATU in the presence of 1 m DIEA. Protecting group removal and final cleavage from the resin were carried out with trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/H2O/thioanisol/ethanedithiol (82.5:5:5:5:2.5%) for 4 h and 20 min for peptides C1, C3, and C7 and with trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/H2O/triisopropylsilane (88:5:5:2%) for 4 h in the case of C5, C4, and C8. Crude peptides were purified by semi-preparative reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Interchrom UP5 WOD/25 m Uptisphere 300, 5 ODB, 250 × 21.2 mm) and identified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Tat, C2, C6, and C9 peptides were obtained from NeoMPS (Strasbourg-France). The C4 peptide was conjugated to the Tat peptide GRKKRRQRRR-C through a disulfide bond using the cysteamide function at the C terminus of C4. All peptides were dissolved with deionized water to make a stock solution of 500 μm except for C1 and C8 which, because of their poor solubility in water, were first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Peptides were then diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 2.67 mm KCl, and 138 mm NaCl). Protein Expression and Purification—The GST-retinoblastoma fusion protein (GST-Rb), harboring residues 792 to 928, was provided by C. Sardet (IGMM, Montpellier, France). CDK2-cyclin E and CDK1-cyclin B1 complexes were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cell lysates as described previously (21.Desai D. Wessling H.C. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22.Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol.

Human CDK2 phosphorylated on Thr160 was produced in Escherichia coli (BL21) by coexpression of GST-CDK2 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae GST-CIV1 (a gift from J. Endicott, Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics and Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences, Oxford, UK). Full-length human cyclin A was expressed as an untagged or a GST-tagged protein in E. coli. Monomeric proteins as well as the CDK2-cyclin A complex were purified according to Brown et al. (17.Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing GST-CDK2 or cyclin A were lysed by sonication on ice. The clarified lysate of GST-CDK2 was applied onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) monothioglycerol) and extensively washed. The clarified lysate of cyclin A was then applied onto the CDK2-bound glutathione-Sepharose column. The GST-CDK2-cyclin A complex was eluted with buffer A containing 20 mm glutathione (Sigma). Following cleavage of the GST tag with protease 3C (1:50) (w/w) at 4 °C for 12 h, CDK2-cyclin A was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing CDK2-cyclin A were pooled and further purified by exclusion from glutathione-Sepharose. Kinase Assays—CDK kinase assays were carried out in a final volume of 30 μl containing 3 μm histone H1 (H4524; Sigma) or GST-Rb or 0.4 mm peptide substrate (histone H1-derived peptide PKTPKKAKKL; Promega Corporation, Madison, WI), 50 μm cold ATP, and 0.15 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The kinase concentration used was 20 nm. Reactions were performed for 15 min at 25 °C and then quenched by the addition of 2× SDS buffer. Phosphorylated products were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed on a PhosphorImager. Reaction samples performed with the peptide substrate were spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, washed five times in 0.5% phosphoric acid, and dried. Incorporation of 32P was then quantified by Cerenkov counting. Kinetic experiments were performed under the same conditions, except that the reaction was performed for 1 min. Reaction samples were spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. Four different concentrations of histone H1 (2, 3, 5, and 10 μm) were used in the kinetic analysis of enzyme inhibition. For each substrate concentration, three concentrations of C4 peptide (0, 1, and 1.5 μm) were used, and the concentration of ATP was maintained constant at 0.1 mm. Similarly, when the concentration of ATP was varied (5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 μm), C4 peptide concentrations were 0, 0.5, and 1 μm, and the concentration of histone H1 was kept constant at 15 μm. Using the Graphit Erithacus software, analysis of kinetic data for the inhibition of CDK2-cyclin A phosphorylation was performed by fitting the data to Equations 1 (non-competitive inhibition) and 2 (competitive inhibition), v=(Vmax·[S]/(1+[peptide]/Ki))/(Km+[S]) (Eq. 1) v=Vmax·[S]/(Km(1+[peptide]/Ki)+[S]) (Eq. 2) where Vmax is the maximum velocity, [S] is the concentration of the varied substrate (ATP or histone H1), and Ki is the dissociation constant for the CDK2-cyclin A-peptide complex. Peptide-CDK Binding Assays—8 μg of preformed GST-CDK2-cyclin A or CDK2-GST-cyclin A complexes were incubated in buffer A with increasing concentrations of C4 or C6 peptides (corresponding to ∼20, 40, and 90-fold the concentration of complex) at 25 °C for 30 min. GST complexes were then pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed and eluted with buffer A containing 20 mm glutathione. Both the flow-through and the elution were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies against CDK2 (affinity-purified PSTAIRE polyclonal antibody) and cyclin A (H-432; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). CD Experiments—Far UV CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) using a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. Spectra were corrected from the baseline buffer spectrum and smoothed with JASCO software. Peptides were dissolved to a fixed concentration of 50 μm in water or phosphate-buffered solution. CD spectra were collected at 23 °C, and each spectrum represents the average of four scans. Cell Culture and Growth Inhibition Assays—MCF-7, HepG2, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The human Jurkat lymphoma T cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium. Cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well dishes and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of peptides in 300 μl of Opti-MEM for adherent cells and RPMI for Jurkat cells. After 45 min, 300 μl of medium containing 20% serum was added. After 48 h, cells were counted on a Coulter counter. The total number of cells was calculated as the percentage of treated to untreated cells. Concentrations of peptides indicated in each experiment correspond to those added in the 300 μl of OptiMEM during the first 45 min of treatment. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—All experiments were performed at 25 °C using a Biacore 3000 (Biacore AB). CDK2, cyclin A, and complexes were immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran sensor chip by N-hydrosuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (NHS/EDC) coupling as described by the manufacturer. Peptide samples were prepared at different concentrations in the range of 50 to 1000 nm in 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl and were injected (30 μl) over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 10 μl·s–1. After completion of the injection phase, dissociation was performed for 200 s at the same flow rate. The apparent association and dissociation rate constants were calculated using BIA Evaluation version 3.0, and binding curves were fitted using a simple 1:1 Langmuir two-state reaction model.

The modeling package Discover/Insight II (MSI Inc.; San Diego, CA) and DeLano Scientific LLC PyMol software version 0.93 (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos CA) were used to analyze the structure of CDK2-cyclin A. Design of Peptides Targeting Activation of CDK2-cyclin A— Both the determination of the crystallographic structure of several CDKs and CDK-cyclin complexes in their inactive and active conformation and the characterization of their dynamics of association and activation have enabled identification of the critical features for activation of these complexes. The crystal structures of free CDK2 (24.De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H.

Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) CDK2-cyclin A complexes, respectively, have revealed that the regulatory cyclin subunit binds to one side of the catalytic cleft, interacting with both the N- and the C-lobes of the CDK to form a large, continuous protein-protein interface (Fig. 1). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that CDK2-cyclin A complex formation and activation is a two-step process (18.Morris C.M. Gondeau C. Tainer J.A. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23847-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The first step involves the rapid association between the PSTAIRE helix of CDK2 and helices α3 and α5 of cyclin A, followed by a slow conformational change of the complex involving interactions between the N-terminal helix of cyclin A and the C-lobe of CDK2. Based on these structural and biochemical characterizations, we propose a novel approach to specifically inhibiting the kinase activity of CDK-cyclin complexes by targeting protein-protein interfaces or conformational changes involved in their activation. To this aim, we have designed a peptide of 22 residues (C1) corresponding to the sequence of the α5 helix of cyclin A encompassing residues Thr285 to Leu306 (Table I). Although contacts between PSTAIRE and the α5 helix of cyclin A are common to all CDK-cyclin complexes (26.Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), the primary sequence of C1 is only partially conserved between different cyclins (Fig. 1).Table IDesign and characterization of peptides derived from cyclin A Open table in a new tab We first investigated the ability of C1 peptide to inhibit CDK2-cyclin A kinase activity. Three different substrates were used: (i) histone H1, which is most commonly used in standard kinase assays; (ii) a GST-fusion of the retinoblastoma protein (GST-Rb); and (iii) a peptide of 10 residues (PKTPKKAKKL) derived from histone H1 and reported to be a relevant substrate for measuring CDK1 or CDK2 kinase activity (27.Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, we found that C1 peptide significantly inhibits phosphorylation of all three of the above-mentioned substrates by CDK2-cyclin A in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 values of 3.9 ± 0.4, 22.8 ± 1.2, and 2.2 ± 0.1 μm were calculated for histone H1, GST-Rb, and the peptide substrate, respectively. Identification of Critical Residues for Inhibitory Activity of the C1 Peptide—To determine which residues were critical for inhibition of CDK2-cyclin A kinase activity by the C1 peptide, we replaced several individual residues with alanine and deleted residues reported to be involved in the contacts between CDK2 and the α5 helix of cyclin A. The ability of the different peptides (C1–C9) to affect the phosphorylation of histone H1 by CDK2-cyclin A is reported in Table I. Noteworthily, the peptide corresponding to part of C1 extended at its N terminus (C7) does not exhibit any inhibitory activity. Similarly, the addition of amino acids to the C-terminal Leu306 decreases the inhibitory potential of the peptide (C8), suggesting that the integrity of C1 is required for robust inhibition. However, the three first N-terminal residues of the C1 peptide are not essential (C9), in contrast to residues 293 to 296, which appear to play a key role in the functional integrity of C1 (except for Glu295 which is conserved between cyclins A, B, and E) (Fig. 1). Moreover, the greatest inhibition of kinase activity is obtained when Glu295 is mutated to an alanine (C4), a mutation that increases the solubility of the peptide. Additional residues, which are not directly involved in the interface with CDK2, are also required for inhibition, such as Leu299 (C6) and Met294 (C3). Taken together, these results suggest that the region in the peptide that contributes primarily to kinase inhibition is located between residues 293 and 306. Given that C4 exhibited the greatest potential to inhibit CDK2-cyclin A activity, it was chosen as the main focus for the rest of the study. The C4 peptide prevents phosphorylation of histone H1, GST-Rb, and the small peptide substrate derived from histone H1 by CDK2-cyclin A with estimated IC50 values of 1.8 ± 0.1, 16.7 ± 0.6, and 1.1 ± 0.3 μm, respectively. To evaluate the selectivity of the C4 peptide for the CDK2 isoform, we tested its ability to inhibit other CDK complexes, including CDK2-cyclin E and CDK1-cyclin B. The C4 peptide inhibits the kinase activity of CDK2 associated with either cyclin A (IC50 of 1.8 ± 0.1 μm) or cyclin E (IC50 of 1.5 ± 0.3 μm) to a similar extent, but it does not significantly affect CDK1-cyclin B kinase activity (IC50 > 200 μm). In addition, C4 was not found to inhibit protein kinase A or protein kinase C (data not shown), suggesting that this peptide is specific to the CDK-cyclin complex and does not affect other protein kinases. Structural Characterization of the Inhibitory Peptides by Circular Dichroism—To determine whether the inhibitory potential of the different peptides was associated with structural constraints, we examined their secondary structure by circular dichroism. Peptides are not folded in water solution. Each peptide was dissolved in the same phosphate buffer used for kinase activity assays at a final concentration of 50 μm. Peptides were divided into three classes based on their secondary structures as follows: (i) peptides C3, C6, C7, and C8, which are predominantly random coiled (Fig. 3A); (ii) peptides C2 and C9, which aggregate into β-structure, characterized by a positive contribution at 198 nm and a large negative band near 220 nm (Fig. 3B); and (iii) C4, which tends to adopt an α-helical structure characterized by two minima at 208 and 222 nm, respectively. The spectrum of C5 peptide is suggestive of a mixture of different structures. The crystal structure of CDK2-cyclin A indicates that interactions between the α5-helix of cyclin A and the N-terminal β-sheet of CDK2 are essentially hydrophobic. Thus the α-helical structure of C4 peptide, which is stabilized in the presence of salt, may favor hydrophobic interactions with CDK2-cyclin A associated with its inhibitory potential. Mechanism of Inhibition of CDK2 Activity by the C4 Peptide—C4-mediated inhibition of CDK2 can result from either direct competition with cyclin A for CDK2 or from the binding of the peptide to the preformed CDK2-cyclin A complex. To discriminate between these two hypotheses, we performed direct competition experiments in which various concentrations of peptide (inhibiting kinase activity by 90%) were added to a mixture of either GST-CDK2 and cyclin A or GST-cyclin A and CDK2 (Fig. 4). The different CDK2-cyclin A complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Levels of cyclin A associated with GST-CDK2 or CDK2 bound to GST-cyclin A were determined by Western blotting, and kinase activity of these complexes toward histone H1 was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of C4 strongly inhibits kinase activity of CDK2 without inducing dissociation of cyclin A from CDK2, irrespective of the method used. Moreover, similar kinase inhibition was obtained by adding the peptide either before or after reconstitution of the CDK2-cyclin A complex (data not shown). Based on these experiments, we infer that the C4 peptide maintains CDK2-cyclin A in an inactive or nonprocessive conformation but does not disrupt the complex. To gain further insight into the mechanism that governs binding of the C4 peptide to CDK2-cyclin A, we studied the kinetics of binding using surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 5A). Binding curves were recorded by injecting increasing concentrations of C4 onto a flow cell on which either CDK2, cyclin A, or CDK2-cyclin A had been cross-linked. As shown in Fig. 5B, C4 interacts tightly with CDK2-cyclin A with an estimated dissociation constant of 2.5 ± 0.4 nm and with an 18-fold lower affinity for cyclin A (Kd = 45 ± 2 nm). In contrast, C4 does not bind monomeric CDK2. These results support the idea that C4 forms a ternary complex with CDK2-cyclin A. Steady-state Analysis of CDK2 Inhibition by the C4 Peptide—We next investigated the steady-state kinetics of inhibition of CDK2-cyclin A by C4 using Michaelis-Menten equations. Phosphorylation of histone H1 by CDK2-cyclin A was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP and in the absence or presence of the C4 peptide. In this experiment, the concentration of the H1 substrate was fixed at 15 μm, which represents approximately three times the Km of CDK2-cyclin A for histone H1 (Km(H1) = 3.4 μm). The double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot reveals that C4 acts as a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP (Fig. 6A). The dissociation constant (Ki) of the C4 peptide from the free enzyme is 0.34 ± 0.04 μm. We next examined inhibition by C4 with respect to histone H1 substrate in the presence of a saturating concentration of ATP (0.1 mm ATP, Km(ATP) = 32 μm). The pattern of the double reciprocal plot for histone H1 is consistent with a competitive mode of inhibition with a value of Ki of 0.35 ± 0.04 μm. The C4 pe"

The only crystal structure reported for acetate kinase is the homodimeric enzyme from Methanosarcina thermophila containing ADP and sulfate in the active site (Buss, K. A., Cooper, D. C., Ingram-Smith, C., Ferry, J. G., Sanders, D. A., and Hasson, M. S. (2001) J. Bacteriol. 193, 680–686). Here we report two new crystal structure of the M. thermophila enzyme in the presence of substrate and transition state analogs. The enzyme co-crystallized with the ATP analog adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate contained AMP adjacent to thiopyrophosphate in the active site cleft of monomer B. The enzyme co-crystallized with ADP, acetate, Al3+, and F- contained a linear array of ADP-AlF3-acetate in the active site cleft of monomer B. Together, the structures clarify the substrate binding sites and support a direct in-line transfer mechanism in which AlF3 mimics the meta-phosphate transition state. Monomers A of both structures contained ADP and sulfate, and the active site clefts were closed less than in monomers B, suggesting that domain movement contributes to catalysis. The finding that His180 was in close proximity to AlF3 is consistent with a role for stabilization of the meta-phosphate that is in agreement with a previous report indicating that this residue is essential for catalysis. Residue Arg241 was also found adjacent to AlF3, consistent with a role for stabilization of the transition state. Kinetic analyses of Arg241 and Arg91 replacement variants indicated that these residues are essential for catalysis and also indicated a role in binding acetate. Acetate kinase catalyzes transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to acetate. The only crystal structure reported for acetate kinase is the homodimeric enzyme from Methanosarcina thermophila containing ADP and sulfate in the active site (Buss, K. A., Cooper, D.

Phosphoryl transfer is a key reaction in numerous biological processes, playing roles in signaling mechanisms, energy transfer, and energy storage in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (1Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 877-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). One of the earliest phosphoryl transfers identified was the phosphorylation of acetate by ATP to form acetyl phosphate (AcP) 1The abbreviations used are: AcP, acetyl phosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; TPP, thiopyrophosphate; PIS, residue name for thiopyrophosphate in Protein Data Bank file; ATP-AK, structure of acetate kinase co-crystallized with ATP, ATPγS-AK, structure of acetate kinase co-crystallized with ATPγS; AlF3-AK, structure of acetate kinase co-crystallized with ADP, acetate, and AlFX; ASKHA, acetate and sugar kinase-Hsp70-actin. and ADP, described in 1944 by Lippman (2Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 155: 55-70Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This reversible reaction is catalyzed by acetate kinase, which is widely distributed among anaerobic prokaryotes playing a central role in energy-yielding metabolism by synthesizing ATP from acetyl phosphate generated in fermentation pathways. The enzyme also plays an essential role in the fermentation of acetate to methane, which accounts for most of the one billion metric tons of methane produced annually from the decomposition of organic matter by anaerobic microbial consortia (3Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5489-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In Methanosarcina thermophila, acetate kinase catalyzes the first step in the pathway by activating acetate to acetyl phosphate prior to transfer of the acetyl moiety to CoA catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase (4Iyer P.P. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4244-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Iyer P.P. Lawrence S.H. Luther K.B. Rajashankar K.R. Yennawar H.P. Ferry J.G. Schindelin H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 559-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In later steps of the pathway, the acetyl moiety is further metabolized to methane and carbon dioxide (6Ferry J.G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 473-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although acetate kinase was one of the first enzymes to be investigated mechanistically, details remain elusive; indeed, the first crystal structure was obtained only recently for the M. thermophila enzyme, identifying acetate kinase as a member of the acetate and sugar kinase-Hsp70-actin (ASKHA) structural superfamily and the best candidate for the common ancestor of this family (7Buss K.A. Cooper D.C. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 193: 680-686Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The earliest kinetic studies of the enzyme from Escherichia coli suggested a ping-pong mechanism (8Purich D.L. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and evidence for a covalent phosphoryl intermediate supported this mechanism (9Todhunter J.A. Purich D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Todhunter J.A. Reichel K.B. Purich D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); however, it was later shown that the phosphoryl-enzyme complex is not kinetically competent (11Romaniuk P.J. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7322-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the discovery that the E. coli acetate kinase is able to phosphorylate enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system (12Fox D.K. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13498-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CheY (13Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3236-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in vitro indicates the phosphoenzyme functions in sugar transport. Later investigations reported inversion of the stereochemistry about the phosphorous (14Blattler W.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and isotope exchange kinetics inconsistent with the covalent kinase mechanism (15Skarstedt M.T. Silverstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6775-6783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and supporting a direct in-line phosphoryl transfer. More recently, the acetate kinase from M. thermophila was shown to be inhibited by components of a putative transition state analogue ADP-AlFx-acetate (16Miles R.D. Gorrell A. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22547-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in which the AlFx is proposed to mimic the meta-phosphate in a direct phosphoryl transfer mechanism. No structural evidence for either the covalent or in-line mechanism has been reported previously. Access to the crystal structure (7Buss K.A. Cooper D.C. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 193: 680-686Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and production of the M. thermophila acetate kinase in E. coli (17Latimer M.T. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6822-6829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have allowed experimental approaches not previously employed to investigate the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. The structure of the homodimeric acetate kinase co-crystallized with ATP (the ATP-AK structure) reveals ADP in a cleft with contacts that are conserved in the nucleotide binding sites of other ASKHA family members, which identifies the active site of the M. thermophila acetate kinase. The active site contains Arg91 and Arg241, a result consistent with roles for these residues in substrate binding, catalysis, or both. It was hypothesized that Arg91 binds acetyl phosphate and Arg241 binds acetate based on a postulated binding site identified in the crystal structure (7Buss K.A. Cooper D.C. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 193: 680-686Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The low specific activity reported for Arg91 and Arg241 replacement variants relative to the wild type is consistent with a role for both arginines in stabilizing the pentacoordinate transition state for the postulated direct in-line mechanism (16Miles R.D. Gorrell A. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22547-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, the low activity of the variants precluded a determination of the steady state kinetic parameters. The ATP-AK structure contains only ADP, with the β-phosphate repelled by a sulfate ion and pointing away from the arginines; thus, the catalytically competent orientation of the γ-phosphate of ATP relative to Arg91 and Arg241 is unknown. Here we present two novel M. thermophila acetate kinase structures obtained by co-crystallization with either the ATP analog ATPγS (the ATPγS-AK structure) or components of the putative transition state analog ADP-AlFX-acetate (the AlF3-AK structure) that, along with kinetic analyses utilizing an improved assay, allow us to further examine the roles for Arg91 and Arg241. The results also provide the first structural evidence for the proposed acetate binding site and a direct in-line phosphoryl transfer mechanism. Materials—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, VWR Scientific Products, or Fisher. The pH values of ATP, ADP, and ATPγS stock solutions were adjusted to 7.0 with sodium hydroxide, and concentrations were determined utilizing the extension coefficient (ϵ259 = 15.4 × 103m-1 cm-1). ATP and ADP stock solutions were prepared to be equimolar with magnesium chloride. Acetyl phosphate concentrations were determined by assay with hexokinase/glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase/acetate kinase. The pH of the acetate stock solution was adjusted to 7.0 with potassium hydroxide. Crystallization materials were obtained from VWR Scientific Products or Hampton Research. Heterologous Production and Purification of Acetate Kinase—Plasmids for the R91A, R91L, R91K, R241A, R241L, and R241K variant acetate kinases previously generated were utilized for this study (18Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The wild-type and variant acetate kinases were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) (F-dcm ompT hsdS (rB-mB-) gal λ(DE3)) and purified as described previously (16Miles R.D. Gorrell A. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22547-22552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33765-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein purity was examined by SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), using Bio-Rad dye and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The yields and dimeric state of the variants were similar to those of the wild type enzyme (data not shown). Enzymatic Assays—The hydroxamate assay adaptation of the Lipmann and Rose methods (2Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 155: 55-70Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 23Rose I.A. Grunberg-Manago M.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detects acetyl phosphate formation and was previously used to determine the kinetic parameters in the forward (ADP/acetyl phosphate synthesis) direction. In this study, the kinetic parameters were determined utilizing an enzyme-linked assay system with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as previously described by Allen et al. (25Allen S. Kellermeyer R. Stjernholm R. Wood H. J. Bacteriol. 1964; 87: 171-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and utilized by Aceti with slight modifications (24Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay solutions contained 60 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 16.7 units of pyruvate kinase, 36 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH with the nonvariable substrate held at 10× Km (unless otherwise noted). Fixed concentrations of ATP were equimolar with MgCl2 at 1 mm for wild-type or 10 mm for the variant enzymes, and the fixed concentration of acetate was 200 mm for wild type, 1 m for Arg91 variants, and 2 m for Arg241 variants. Assays contained 1–50 μg/ml wild-type or variant enzyme, depending upon its specific activity. Absorbance changes were monitored at 340 nm with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer, with assay times from 1 to 5 min, reading at 1-s intervals. Km and Vmax values were determined through nonlinear regression data analysis fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation utilizing the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The turnover (k,cat s-1) was determined from the Vmax utilizing Equation 1, kcat=(mol of ATP produced)(mol of enzyme)=ΔA340/min(60 s/min)(6.33 m M−1cm−1)(1 cm)(μg/ml)(mol/92,000 g)=248.08Vmax[E](μg/ml) (Eq. 1) where E is concentration of enzyme in μg/ml, and Vmax is the maximum ΔA340/min determined from the Michaelis-Menten equation. When determining kinetic parameters in the reverse direction (ATP/acetate synthesis), the previously described enzyme-linked assay was used (24Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay components were 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 4.4 mm glucose, 1 mm NADP, 10 units of hexokinase (yeast), and 10 units of glucose-6-phosphatase (yeast). The ADP concentration was held in excess at 5 mm when Km(AcP) was determined, and the AcP concentration was held in excess at 10 mm when Km(ADP) was determined. Enzyme concentrations varied from 1 to 50 μg/ml, depending upon enzyme activity to yield a linear rate over the duration of the assay. Kinetic constants were determined using nonlinear regression to fit data using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Determination of Inhibition Constants for ATPγS and Hydroxylamine—Inhibition constants for hydroxylamine and ATPγS were determined by a 5 × 5 matrix of conditions that systematically varies inhibitor and substrate concentrations (hydroxylamine versus ATP or acetate; ATPγS versus ATP). Assays contained 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 16.7 units of pyruvate kinase, 36 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, and 1 μg/ml wild-type acetate kinase, with 200 mm acetate when ATP varied and 5 mm ATP when acetate varied. ATP concentrations were varied between 20 μm and 1 mm, whereas acetate concentrations were varied from 0.2 to 10 mm. ATPγS concentrations ranged from 0 to 300 μm. Hydroxylamine concentrations ranged from 0 to 1 m. Kinetic parameters for inhibition were determined by linear regressing using the MINITAB program and a value for α of 2.0 (26Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Guanidine Rescue of Activity—The ability of the hydrogen-donating guanidine to rescue the activity of the arginine variants was determined by including guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) in the assay solution. Wild-type acetate kinase was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl to determine maximum concentration permissible in the assay conditions before enzyme activity is affected, and 200 mm GdnHCl was determined to be the maximum concentration tolerated (data not shown). Kinetic constants for wild-type, R91A, and R241A acetate kinases were determined utilizing the forward reaction assay solution (described under “Enzymatic Assays”) in the presence of 200 mm guanidine hydrochloride. Substrate concentrations, enzyme concentrations, and assay times are as previously described. Crystallization and Data Collection—The hanging drop method was used to co-crystallize acetate kinase with ATPγS as previously described for co-crystallization of the enzyme with ATP (7Buss K.A. Cooper D.C. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 193: 680-686Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Buss K.A. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2659-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Wild-type acetate kinase (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 1 mm ATPγS, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 315 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) in a drop that was equilibrated against a reservoir of 1.7 mm (NH4)2SO4 for 2 h at room temperature. The drop was then equilibrated against a reservoir of 0.8 mm (NH4)2SO4 at 37 °C, with small crystals first appearing overnight and reaching maximum size at 14 days. Crystals are stable for at least 3 months. A single ATPγS-AK crystal was transferred to a saturated glucose solution as a cryoprotectant and flash frozen in a liquid-N2 stream. Data were collected at 100 K on the F2 beam line at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), and image files were processed with DENZO/SCALE-PACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The hanging drop method was also used to co-crystallize acetate kinase in the presence of acetate, ADP, and AlFX. Prior to use in crystallization trials, 100 mm AlCl3 and 50 mm NaF were pre-equilibrated overnight. Wild-type acetate kinase (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 1 mm ADP, 1.5 mm LiCl, 0.1 mm AlCl3 plus 0.5 mm NaF, 10 mm acetate, 315 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) in a drop that was equilibrated against a reservoir of 1.7 mm (NH4)2SO4 for 2 h at room temperature. The drop was then transferred to a reservoir of 0.8 mm (NH4)2SO4. Crystallization was allowed to proceed as described above, although the crystals reached a smaller macroscopic size. The crystals were transferred to a saturated glucose solution as a cryoprotectant and frozen in liquid N2. Data were collected at 100 K at Argonne National Synchrotron (Argonne, IL), and image files were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—Since the unit cell dimensions of both the ATPγS-AK and AlF3-AK structures were nearly identical to the previously solved ATP-AK structure, molecular replacement was used to determine the structures of the complexes. The program AMORE (CCP4 suite, version 1.1) (29Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used to perform molecular replacement using as a search model the ATP-AK structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank data base (identifier 1G99) (7Buss K.A. Cooper D.C. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 193: 680-686Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed with CNS_solve (version 4.1) (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), and molecular models were built and visualized with O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Ideal parameter and topology files for AMP, ADP, SO42−, NH3, AlF3, and acetate for CNS_solve were obtained from HIC-Up (32Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Parameter and topology files for pyrophosphate were modified to include sulfur in place of one oxygen of the γ-phosphate for thiopyrophosphate (TPP; Protein Data Bank residue name PIS) for use in CNS_solve. Designations for chains A and B in both structures were assigned so that chain A contains the same heteroatoms as in the ATP-AK structure. Model suitability was determined with PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and overall molecular refinement statistics are presented in Table IV.

Since the data indicated that hydroxylamine binds to multiple sites other than the substrate binding sites and that hydroxylamine inhibition could have introduced errors in the kinetic parameters previously reported utilizing the hydroxamate assay (16Miles R.D.

A search of the data bases revealed that Arg241 and Arg91 of the M. thermophila enzyme are each conserved in 218 of 219 acetate kinase sequences retrieved (data not shown), strongly suggesting a role for these active site residues in substrate binding, catalysis, or both. The kinetic parameters in either direction have not been determined for Arg241 variants of the M. thermophila, and parameters are reported for only the R91K variant in the direction of ADP synthesis utilizing the hydroxamate assay that could have introduced errors (18Singh-Wissmann K.

Furthermore, kinetic parameters for the wild-type enzyme in the direction of ATP synthesis have not been determined. Thus, kinetic constants for the wild-type and arginine replacement variants (Tables I and II) were determined in both directions utilizing the enzyme-linked assays.Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type and variant acetate kinases in the forward (ADP/AcP synthesis) directionEnzymekcatKm(ATP)Km(Ace)s-1μmmmWild type913 ± 5280 ± 92.7 ± 0.3R91A0.11 ± 0.00416 ± 0.6250 ± 38R91L0.22 ± 0.04145 ± 3420 ± 40R91K3.7 ± 0.276 ± 370 ± 3R241A0.68 ± 0.10297 ± 27710 ± 130R241L1.38 ± 0.1017,000 ± 2800270 ± 67R241K1.3 ± 0.0611,400 ± 190077 ± 7 Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic parameters of wild-type and variant acetate kinases in the reverse (ATP/acetate synthesis) directionEnzymekcatKm(ADP)Km(AcP)s-1μmmmWild type1260 ± 6098 ± 70.47 ± 0.05R91A3.5 ± 0.863 ± 61.36 ± 0.20R91L7.7 ± 0.463 ± 52.3 ± 0.1R91K23 ± 0.2168 ± 60.61 ± 0.06R241A4.5 ± 0.4210 ± 280.84 ± 0.02R241L0.42 ± 0.061260 ± 891.64 ± 0.40R241K4.5 ± 0.4578 ± 210.92 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Although the kcat determined for the wild-type acetate kinase approximated the values (1050–1596 s-1) reported using the hydroxamate assay, the Km(ATP) and Km(acetate) values determined with the enzyme-linked assay in the direction of ADP synthesis (Table I) were at least 12- and 7-fold lower than those previously reported (18Singh-Wissmann K.

When assayed in the direction of ATP synthesis (Table II), the wild-type kcat approximated the value determined in the direction of ADP synthesis (Table I). The Km(ADP) approximated the Km(ATP); however, the Km(AcP) was nearly 6-fold less than the Km(acetate). It was reported previously that all of the variants shown in Tables I and II purified according to the wild-type are dimeric, and the CD spectra of the R91A and R241A variants are nearly identical to wild type, indicating no gross conformational changes in the variants relative to wild type (18Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All of the Arg91 and Arg241 variants showed large decreases in kcat relative to wild type when assayed in the direction of ADP synthesis, ranging from 250-fold for R91K to 8200-fold for R91A (Table I). The Km(ATP) values determined for all of the Arg91 variants changed little relative to the wild type, with the largest effect being a 5-fold decrease for the R91A variant; however, the Km(acetate) values increased 93-, 156-, and 26-fold for the R91A, R91L, and R91K variants, respectively (Table I). Only a modest increase in Km(ATP) compared with wild-type was determined for the R241A variant, arguing against an important role in binding ATP. In con"

Indeed, the formation of articulating chick joint cavities, which requires mechanical stimuli derived from skeletal movement, is dependent upon the accumulation of an ECM rich in hyaluronan (HA). However, the mechanisms responsible for such precise mechano-dependent regulation of cell behavior and the formation of a HA-rich ECM remain undefined. Here we show that extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is selectively activated in cells at sites of cavity formation and activity diminished by in ovo immobilization that induces cartilaginous fusion across presumptive joint interzones. In vitro analyses offer mechanistic support for the role of mechanical stimuli in promoting a MEK-dependent activation of ERK1/2. In addition, our direct regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation status via modulation of its up-stream “classical cascade” activator either pharmacologically or by transfection with dominant negative or constitutively active Mek confirms the essential role for ERK1/2 activation in the elaboration of HA-rich pericellular matrices. Together, our findings demonstrate that the MEK-ERK pathway, regulated by mechanical stimuli, controls HA-rich matrix assembly. The precision of ERK1/2 activation selectively distinguishing cells at the joint line suggests that it directly contributes to the loss of tissue cohesion essential for generating HA-rich cavities between joint elements during their development.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). An example of such localized enrichment in HA occurs during the formation of articular joints, where separation of opposed skeletal elements requires exact spatial control (3Craig F.M. Bayliss M.T.

Earliest commitment of cells to this fate is evident in the blastemal mesenchyme, between expanding cartilaginous elements, where intervening presumptive joint interzones persist in zones exhibiting restricted chondrogenesis (5Dudley A.T.

The mechanisms responsible for defining the precise site of cavitation, therefore, remain unclear, and factors regulating the accumulation of HA during the formation of the cell-free joint cavity remain the subject of speculation (12Dowthwaite G.P.

Dev. Biol. 1980; 75: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to an enrichment in HA, cells of the presumptive joint also express elevated levels of CD44 (principal HA-binding protein, HABP) and moesin, an actin-capping protein, to which HA-associated CD44 binds (14Dowthwaite G.P.

Our previous finding that HA oligosaccharide-induced blockade of HA-HABP interaction blocks joint formation highlights a central role for HA in cavitation (14Dowthwaite G.P. Edwards J.C. Pitsillides A.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Movement is crucial for joint cavitation (16Drachman D.B. Coulombre A.J.

Neuron Interact. 2002; 2: 448-456PubMed Google Scholar), but how these mechanically derived signals promote the joint-forming cellular phenotype has not been addressed. The extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) family of mitogen-activated protein kinases can act as a point of convergence for many signals, including those induced by mechanical perturbation (21Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 22Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar, 23Pearce M.J. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Whatley R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These pathways convert extracellular stimuli into signals that control gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Here we examine the hypothesis that the precision of cavity formation is regulated by a mechanically induced ERK1/2 activation and that this contributes to acquisition of the joint-forming cellular phenotype. Using in vitro and in ovo approaches, we show that active ERK1/2 localizes to cells at sites of cavity formation with a precision that explains cell behavior within joint interzones. We also show that this selective activation is lost after in ovo immobilization, indicating an integral role for ERK1/2 in joint formation. Together with transfection studies showing the essential role of ERK1/2 in HA-rich pericellular matrix assembly, these findings indicate that the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is a mechanically induced determinant of cell behavior regulating the accumulation of HA during the formation of the cell-free joint cavity. Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy—Transmission electron microscopy was performed on stage 44 embryonic chick tibiotarsi as described previously (24Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J.

For scanning electron microscopy, tissue was fixed and dehydrated as for transmission electron microscopy, dried in a critical point dryer (CPD, Samdri), mounted on aluminum stubs, coated in an Emscope SC500 sputter coater, and examined on a Hitachi S-450 scanning electron microscope. Immobilization during Chick Limb Development—Stage 36 chick embryos were treated in ovo with decamethonium bromide for 3 days as previously described (20Osborne A.C. Lamb K.J. Lewthwaite J.C. Dowthwaite G.P. Pitsillides A.A. J. Musculoskel. Neuron Interact. 2002; 2: 448-456PubMed Google Scholar). Controls were treated with vehicle alone. Chicks were killed at stage 40 by decapitation (Animal Scientific Procedures act 1986). Limbs were snap-chilled in n-hexane (low in aromatic hydrocarbons, VWR International) maintained below -70 °C, and cryostat sections (10 μm) were prepared (4Pitsillides A.A. Archer C.W. Prehm P.

Primary or first passage cells seeded onto plastic culture strips (Nunc) were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 5% chick serum and 50 μgml-1 ascorbic acid. Cells were cultured for 18 h in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium without serum then treated with fresh medium with or without 50 μm PD98059 (Promega) for 30 min immediately before strain application. Uniaxial dynamic mechanical strain (1 Hz, 3800 microstrain) was applied for 10 min by 4-point bending of strips as previously described (29Zaman G. Suswillo R.F. Cheng M.Z. Tavares I.A. Lanyon L.E.

This essentially imparts tensile strain in a controlled manner by bending the cell culture-treated plastic strips onto which cells have been previously seeded. Cells were incubated for the times specified, and control cells were unperturbed (static) but otherwise treated identically. Western Blotting—ERK activation was examined in cell lysates collected 20 min and 6 and 24 h post-strain. Protein levels were measured using a BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins (40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon P), and blots were incubated with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (33Houliston R.A. Pearson J.D. Wheeler-Jones C.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with p-ERK1/2 (as above), p-MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs, catalog number 9121, rabbit polyclonal antibody against dual phosphorylated MEK, Ser-217/Ser-221), and total ERK antibodies (as above) according to manufacturer's instructions. Microdensitometry of ERK Expression—Serial control and immobilized limb sections were labeled for p-ERK1/2, total ERK1, or ERK2 using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (see above), and expression per cell was measured with a Vickers M85A scanning and integrating microdensitometer at 535 nm (4Pitsillides A.A. Archer C.W. Prehm P. Bayliss M.T. Edwards J.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Individual cells at cartilaginous epiphyses (zone 10 cells deep) and presumptive articular surfaces were measured; at least 15 cells at identical sites in each of at least 2 sections per joint from at least 3 chicks were evaluated. The amount of reaction product/cell was expressed as the mean integrated extinction (×100) per 30 min. Paired data from both chondrocytes and joint line cells in control and immobilized limbs were compared by Student's t test. Erythrocyte Exclusion Assay—Erythrocyte exclusion assays, a measure of pericellular matrix area, were performed as described (34Clarris B.J. Fraser J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 49: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, AS cells (1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were treated in serum-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with or without PD98059 for 6 h, fixed in 750 μl of 4% formalin containing 1 × 108 horse erythrocytes ml-1 (Sigma), and viewed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100M inverted microscope. Cell and pericellular “coat” areas were measured using a drawing arm and semiautomated image analysis (Imaging Associates KS300, V3 software), and coat:cell area ratios were calculated; ratios <1 were considered to reflect the absence of a pericellular matrix. HA-dependent matrix assembly was verified by treatment for 1 h with 6 units ml-1Streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase (Sigma). Plasmids, Constructs, and Transfection—Dominant negative (DN) or constitutively active (CA) Mek1 constructs were generated by specific substitution of the serine 221 phosphorylation site to alanine and dual substitution of serine 217 and 221 to glutamic acid, respectively. These were gifts from Chris Marshall (35Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). These were cloned into the bicistronic GFP vector, pIRES-hr-GFP-1a (Stratagene). Transfection with pIRES-DN-Mek1, -CA-Mek1, and pIRES control vector were performed using Effectene (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 5% chick serum for 24 h. After re-plating cells were incubated for 6 h with fresh medium before erythrocyte exclusion assay or p-ERK1/2 immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry—Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by adaptation of previous methods (36Volmat V. Camps M. Arkinstall S. Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3433-3443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in ice cold methanol, and treated with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline before exposure to 1:20 anti p-ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs) in 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C followed by 1:1000 goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (Vector). p-ERK1/2 labeling intensity in cytoplasm and nuclei (propidium iodide-positive) of individual cells was assessed using a “display profile” function of a Zeiss LSM 510. Measurements were made in 10 randomly selected cells from control or strained strips with or without PD98059. Paired data from nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of each cell were compared by the Student's t test. Mechanical Loading Regulates the Phenotype of Cells at the Joint Line—Mechanical loading can modulate cell phenotype and ECM composition (20Osborne A.C. Lamb K.J. Lewthwaite J.C. Dowthwaite G.P. Pitsillides A.A. J. Musculoskel. Neuron Interact. 2002; 2: 448-456PubMed Google Scholar). Visualizing articular sites with differing post-hatch loading profiles shows that cells in high load-bearing sites are closely packed, with elongated dense nuclei (Fig. 1a). By comparison, cells in low load-bearing sites show rounder morphology with less dense nuclei (Fig. 1a). Evidence of intracellular polarity toward the articular surfaces was lacking, but association between load-bearing and surface cell morphology was evident. We have shown that cells at cavitation sites exhibit increased UDPGD, CD44, and moesin expression (14Dowthwaite G.P. Edwards J.C. Pitsillides A.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Pitsillides A.A. Archer C.W. Prehm P. Bayliss M.T. Edwards J.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). We, therefore, examined whether immobilization modifies such expression. We found reduced UDPGD, CD44, and moesin expression levels in immobilized limbs where cavitation was abrogated (Fig. 1b), suggesting their involvement in joint formation. Immunodetection of UDPGD may not, however, reflect enzyme activity. We, therefore, used a quantitative cytochemical assay to examine whether UDPGD activity was also modified by immobilization (4Pitsillides A.A. Archer C.W. Prehm P. Bayliss M.T. Edwards J.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells close to presumptive joint surfaces in normal limbs showed higher UDPGD activity that was lost in immobilized limbs (Fig. 1b), whereas activity in chondrocytes was unaffected. These decreases in joint line UDPGD activity are intriguing, because UDPGD is known to modulate intercellular signaling during development (37Hacker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development. 1997; 124: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Spicer A.P. Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. Seldin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25117-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Indeed, disruption in UDPGD in zebrafish (Jekyll mutant) blocks atrioventricular differentiation by modifying the signaling boundaries involved in valve formation (39Walsh E.C. Stainier D.Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The role of UDPGD-derived HA in boundary formation is also supported by similar cardiac valve disruption in HAS2 (HA synthase 2) knockouts, which is correctable by exogenous HA (40Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 41Lamb K.J. Lewthwaite J.C. Bastow E.R. Pitsillides A.A. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2003; 84: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In keeping with their aberrant head phenotype, Jekyll zebrafish showed reduced activity in cranial cartilage compared with controls (Fig. 1c). This confirms our UDPGD assays and shows for the first time a deficiency in the activity of this mutant Jekyll UDPGD (39Walsh E.C. Stainier D.Y. Science. 2001; 293: 1670-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Western analysis of normal and Jekyll fish protein also confirmed UDPGD antibody specificity (data not shown). HA synthesis requires UDPGD and its downregulation commensurate with CD44, moesin, and local HA content in immobilized limbs, supports a role for increased HA synthesis and binding during cavity formation. Joint Line-selective Cytoplasmic ERK Activation—HA binding to CD44 can regulate specific ERK signaling events (42Slevin M. Krupinski J. Kumar S. Gaffney J. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 987-1003PubMed Google Scholar, 43Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that cavity formation requires mechanically dependent activation of ERK, and to identify whether ERK1/2 is a candidate for such regulation, we examined its activation in developing limbs. Selective intense labeling specific for dualphosphorylated and, therefore, active ERK (p-ERK1/2) was found only in cells at developing articular joint surfaces (Figs. 2, a–c; specificity was confirmed by immunoblotting, see Fig. 4). The absence of label in control sections from which primary antibody was omitted or replaced with appropriate speciesmatched normal sera confirmed the specificity of labeling. These findings support regulatory mechanisms involving ERK activation, HA binding, and synthesis at the joint line.Fig. 4Mechanical strain induces MEK-dependent ERK activation in vitro. a, ERK1/2 is activated by mechanical strain and an increased ERK phosphorylation is observed with time in culture. This, in addition to strain-induced ERK1/2 activation, is diminished by treatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (50 μm). Phosphorylated MEK1/2 expression is enhanced by PD98059 treatment at times when ERK1/2 phosphorylation is most actively promoted. These results are representative of at least 20 experiments. b and c, PD98059 reduces ERK1/2 activation in vitro and diminishes mechanical strain-induced nuclear/cytoplasmic re-distribution of p-ERK1/2, revealing a MEK-dependent cytoplasmic enrichment of active ERK1/2 in response to mechanical strain. No change in total ERK (T-ERK) is evident at any time point. Results from a representative experiment (n = 2) are expressed as the mean ± S.E. relative expression in 10 cells measured from each of four control or strained strips with or without PD98059. **, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is known that p-ERK1/2 has both cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates (21Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 22Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). Subcellular distribution was, therefore, examined to identify the location of potential p-ERK1/2 targets in joint line cells. P-ERK1/2 was predominantly cytoplasmic in cells at articular surfaces but principally nuclear in chondrocytes (Fig. 2, d–f). The former exhibited an elongate distribution parallel with developing surfaces, reminiscent of polymerized actin labeling (Fig. 2e); the latter is consistent with a role in phosphorylating chondrocytic transcription targets. The absence of p-ERK1/2 colocalization with propidium iodide, along with its dual labeling with polymerized actin confirmed its cytoplasmic location (Fig. 2, f and g). Indeed, polymerized actin-p-ERK1/2 colocalization was joint line-selective in developing limbs (Fig. 2, h–j). To examine whether activation of ERK is an early determinant of cavitation, we investigated temporo-spatial expression patterns and found that p-ERK1/2 is expressed before joint formation and is conserved at congruent load-bearing joint surfaces after cavitation (Fig. 3a). It is currently not possible to selectively discriminate between active forms of ERK1 and ERK2 using commercially available antibodies in tissue sections. We have, therefore, used antibodies raised against total ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms in an attempt to determine whether enrichment of active ERK1 or -2 at the presumptive joint line likely reflected preferential phosphorylation of one or the other ERK isoforms. The anti-ERK1 antibodies show some cross-reactivity to ERK2. In contrast, the anti-ERK2 antibodies show no reactivity toward ERK1 and are, thus, considered specific to ERK2. We found that anti-total ERK1 labeling but not that achieved using the anti-total ERK2 antibody showed significantly greater selectivity for the articular surface of the joint. The fact that anti-total ERK1 antibodies selectively label developing joint regions but may recognize both ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms coupled with the lack of any such preferential labeling with anti-total ERK2 antibodies provides evidence supporting enrichment of ERK1 in its activated form at the joint line. Thus, examination of total ERK1 and -2 expression showed that ERK1, but not ERK2, increased at developing joint surfaces, with a distribution less restricted than activated ERK1/2 (Fig. 3a). ERK Is Activated by Mechanical Stimuli in Vivo—Immobilization blocks joint formation in the developing limb (18Mitrovic D.R. Am. J. Anat. 1977; 150: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Osborne A.C. Lamb K.J. Lewthwaite J.C. Dowthwaite G.P. Pitsillides A.A. J. Musculoskel. Neuron Interact. 2002; 2: 448-456PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to promoting joint fusion, we found that immobilization markedly diminished p-ERK1/2 labeling at the joint line (Fig. 3b). Examination of expression patterns alone may not, however, discriminate between local differences in cell density and modifications in the level of expression. A meaningful measure of expression/cell was, therefore, obtained by scanning and integrating microdensitometry in histologically defined “fused” and “unfused” sites. This confirmed the immobilization-induced decreases in p-ERK1/2 expression at joint fusion sites and the lack of any modification in chondrocytes (Fig. 3c)."
https://openalex.org/W2156267687,"CHX10 and VSX1 are homeodomain (HD) proteins essential for normal retinal development. CHX10 is required first for retinal progenitor cell proliferation and later for bipolar cell differentiation, whereas VSX1 is important in the terminal differentiation of a subset of bipolar cells. Elucidating the transcriptional activity of CHX10 and VSX1 is required to understand how these factors control retinal development. We show that CHX10 and Vsx1 can function as transcriptional repressors. When tethered to a promoter by a heterologous LexA DNA-binding domain or its HD, CHX10 repressed multiple classes of activators in different immortalized cell lines. CHX10 blocked TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters, repressed at a distance, and inhibited a complex enhancer positioned upstream or downstream of the reporter gene, whereas retinoblastoma protein (RB) inhibited the downstream enhancer only. Interestingly, CHX10 mildly potentiated a subset of activators in chick neuronal cultures. Thus, CHX10 is both a versatile repressor and a context-specific weak activator. The CHX10 HD and CVC domains were sufficient for DNA binding and repression. VSX1 contains closely related homeo and CVC domains and, like CHX10, also repressed transcription. A VSX1 HD mutation, R166W, that impairs DNA binding and causes keratoconus in humans, hindered repressor function. Therefore, CHX10 and VSX1 may control retinal bipolar cell specification or differentiation by repressing genes required for the development of other cell types.

The ocular retardation (orJ) mouse carries a mutation that generates a premature stop codon in helix I of the HD and loss of Chx10 protein (6Burmeister M. Novak J. Liang M.Y. Basu S. Ploder L. Hawes N.L. Vidgen D. Hoover F. Goldman D. Kalnins V.I. Roderick T.H. Taylor B.A. Hankin M.H. McInnes R.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). On a 129Sv background, a homozygous orJ mutation causes retinal development to go awry as early as embryonic day 10 (E10). The first detectable problems are a reduction in RPC proliferation and decreased cell death in the optic vesicle, followed by failure to form the optic fissure where the optic nerve normally exits the eye (6Burmeister M. Novak J. Liang M.Y. Basu S. Ploder L. Hawes N.L. Vidgen D. Hoover F. Goldman D. Kalnins V.I. Roderick T.H. Taylor B.A. Hankin M.H. McInnes R.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). RPCs in the periphery are severely affected by the proliferation defect and fail to differentiate. RPCs in the central retina are less affected and generate a very thin laminated retina that contains all major cell types except for bipolar neurons (6Burmeister M. Novak J. Liang M.Y. Basu S. Ploder L. Hawes N.L. Vidgen D. Hoover F. Goldman D. Kalnins V.I. Roderick T.H. Taylor B.A. Hankin M.H. McInnes R.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The more severe effects of Chx10 loss on peripheral RPC proliferation are linked to gradual transdifferentiation of the periphery into retinal pigment epithelium (4Rowan S. Cepko C.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Transdifferentiation is associated with loss of progenitor cell markers and/or genes implicated in promoting division (e.g. FGF15, E2F1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1), and induction of retinal pigment epithelium factors (e.g. MITF) and cell cycle inhibitors (e.g. GAS1 and p57Kip2) (4Rowan S. Cepko C.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is not known whether CHX10 directly regulates the expression of these genes. When the orJ allele is bred onto a Mus musculus castaneus background retinal development is partially rescued (8Bone-Larson C. Basu S. Radel J.D. Liang M. Perozek T. Kapousta-Bruneau N. Green D.G. Burmeister M. Hankin M.H. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Deletion of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 also partially rescues proliferation (9Green E.S. Stubbs J.L. Levine E.M. Development. 2002; 130: 539-552Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The number of cells in newborn orJ retina is 19-fold less than wild type, but in mice lacking both Chx10 and p27Kip1 this difference is only 4-fold (9Green E.S. Stubbs J.L. Levine E.M. Development. 2002; 130: 539-552Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, a mechanism linking CHX10 to cell cycle regulators controls the expansion of RPCs. Interestingly, bipolar neurons are absent in Chx10–/–, p27Kip1–/– retinas, suggesting that CHX10 plays a role in the development of these cells independent of its role in controlling RPC proliferation (9Green E.S. Stubbs J.L. Levine E.M. Development. 2002; 130: 539-552Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In mice carrying a reporter gene driven by Chx10 regulatory regions, expression was observed in a subset of retinal Müller glia as well as RPCs and bipolar cells (4Rowan S. Cepko C.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore CHX10 may affect the development of a subset of Müller cells, in addition to bipolar cells (4Rowan S. Cepko C.L. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Unlike CHX10, which is expressed in RPCs as early as E9.5 and is present in all mature bipolar cells (2Liu I.S. Chen J. Ploder L. Vidgen D. van der Kooy D. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1994; 13: 377-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), VSX1 is not induced in the retina until postnatal day 5 and is restricted to the outer tier of the inner nuclear layer (10Passini M.A. Levine E.M.

Given the important roles of CHX10 and VSX1 in retinal development, we sought to determine their transcriptional activity. We found that CHX10 inhibited activated transcription in multiple contexts. The minimal region required for CHX10 repressor function included the HD and CVC domains. However, CHX10 also enhanced the activation of a specific subset of activators in chick neuronal cultures. Interestingly, we found that VSX1 also repressed transcription. The VSX1 HD mutation R166W, linked to keratoconus, impaired VSX1-mediated repression. Cell Lines and Primary Chick Retinal Cultures—C33A cells or NG108 cells were grown on 100-mm diameter plates in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Retinal, brain, and liver cells isolated from E8–E9 chicks (staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (20Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9922) Google Scholar)) were dissociated by incubating in 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 30–40 min. The cells were plated onto 35-mm wells pre-coated with 50–100 μg/ml PORN in Dulbecco's H21 + 10% fetal bovine serum media at an optimal transfection density of 2–3 × 106 cells/well. CAT and Luciferase Assays—One day before transfection by the calcium phosphate method, cell lines were trypsinized and plated on 60-mm dishes at 70% confluency. E8 chick cultures were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) after 1–3 days in vitro. 0.3 μg of cytomegalorivus-β-galactosidase was included in each transfection and β-galactosidase activity used to normalize for transfection efficiency. CHX10, RB, and VSX1 expression vectors were used at 5 μg unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. All activator and reporter plasmids were used at 0.5 μg. CAT assays were performed 24 h post-transfection as described (21Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M. Hamel P.A. Ingles C.J. Gallie B.L. Philips R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The amount of lysate used and the incubation time for the CAT assay varied with transcriptional activator, such that sample activity was within the linear range of the assay (i.e. CAT assay reactions for a given activator were allowed to proceed such that the counts extracted were less than or equal to 20,000 cpm). 100% CAT activity is taken as that obtained in the presence of control effector plasmid. Plasmids—SVLex was built by replacing the N-Myc insert in SVN-Myc 2R. Bremner, unpublished data. with a ∼700-bp HindIII/XbaI fragment, derived from CDMLex (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SVLex contains the SV40 enhancer/promoter upstream of the gene coding the bacterial transcription factor, LexA (amino acids 1–202). LexRB encodes full-length human RB and has been previously described (21Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M. Hamel P.A. Ingles C.J. Gallie B.L. Philips R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). LexCHX10 was generated by inserting a 3-kb BspMI/blunt XbaI fragment from pBS-KS+-CHX10(Δ57) (a gift from R. McInnes) into SmaI/XbaI-digested SVLex. LexCHX10 encodes a protein in which LexA is fused to the complete human CHX10 protein (amino acids 1–361). The CHX10 upstream sequence adds 7 codons between the SVLex sequence and the CHX10 ATG. The plasmid used to express Chx10 alone was pECE-HACHX10, a gift from P. Hamel. Expression in this plasmid is also driven by the SV40 enhancer/promoter. To generate GAL4-CHX10, Gal-hRb (21Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M. Hamel P.A. Ingles C.J. Gallie B.L. Philips R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) was digested with SmaI/RI to remove RB, then a blunt SphI/RI fragment (full-length human Chx10) from LexCHX10 was cloned in. The Chx-ABCD series of deletion vectors were cloned into a cytomegalorivus-driven vector (pCDNA) that contained two C-terminal tags: SV40NLS (PKKKRKVE) and triple FLAG (DYK-DHDG-DYKDHD-IDYKDDDDK) (3.1NF). CHX-ABCD (amino acids 1–361) was generated from pBS-KS+-CHX10(Δ57) and the Chx10 stop codon was removed by inserting a PCR fragment containing the 3′ sequence downstream of the Cfr10I site. CHX-B (amino acids 147–208), CHX-BC (amino acids 147–264), and CHX-BCD (amino acids 147–361) were engineered by PCR to contain a 5′ Kozak sequence, which generated a methionine residue upstream of the indicated CHX10 coding sequence. Full-length human VSX1 was subcloned from pBSKS(–)hVSX1 (kind gift of R. McInnes) into 3.1NF at a BamHI/XhoI junction to generate hV3.1NF. The VSXI stop codon was removed by insertion of a synthetic double-stranded oligo containing the VSX1 sequence 3′ of the BstXI site. The R166W mutation was introduced into Vsx1 using the Promega site-directed mutagenesis kit. All activator expression plasmids have been described previously. GAL4-activator fusions express the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the following activation domains: VP16 (amino acids 410–490) (23Walker S. Greaves R. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5223-5244Google Scholar), HSF1 (amino acids 201 to 529) (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), c-JUN (amino acids 5 to 253) (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), c-MYC (amino acids 1 to 262 of c-Myc) (24Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and SP1 (amino acids 83 to 621) (25Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). A control vector, expressing amino acids 1–147 of GAL4 is pBXG1 (M. Ptashne). The reporter plasmids, X4G2CAT, X6G2CAT, X300G2CAT, and X1700G2CAT have all been described previously (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, X4G2CAT contains two GAL4 binding sites placed upstream of the human hsp70 TATA region (–40 to +160) and the CAT reporter gene. Four LexA binding sites were placed distal to activator binding sites, 20 bp upstream. X6G2CAT is identical to X4G2CAT, except that there are six LexA binding sites distal to the activator binding sites, instead of four. X300G2CAT is based on X6G2CAT and contains a fragment of ∼300 bp inserted between the LexA binding sites and the GAL4 binding sites. X1700G2CAT is also based on X6G2CAT and contains an ∼1,700-bp fragment inserted between the LexA binding sites and the GAL4 binding sites. X4G2PCNA CAT was built by inserting a BamHI/ blunt NcoI 0.7-kb fragment from UAS-PCNA-CAT (provided by M. Sopta) into SalI/blunt NcoI-digested X4G2CAT, which replaces the hsp70 promoter in the latter plasmid with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) promoter. pLD85 and pG5SV40CAT have also been described before (21Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M. Hamel P.A. Ingles C.J. Gallie B.L. Philips R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Yew P.R. Lui X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). HD4-pG5EC was built by J. Epstein, and contains four P3 sites (TAATtaaATTA) each separated by 8 bp, and positioned upstream of five GAL4 sites present in the parent vector pG5EC (M. Ptashne). Gel Shifts—CHX10 plasmids were in vitro translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega), in the presence of either 35S-labeled or unlabeled methionine. 2 μl of each in vitro translated sample was analyzed by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE for quantification of protein levels by phosphorimager analysis (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX) of [35S]methionine signal (adjusted for methionine content of each protein) or chemiluminescent densitometry of anti-FLAG Western-blotted proteins using a Bio-Rad Fluor MultiImager with Quantity One version 4.1.0 software. These two methods of normalizing the amount of in vitro translated protein generated similar results in the gel shift assays used to compare different CHX10 proteins, which were carried out a total of six times. 200 ng of double-stranded probe was end-labeled by T4 DNA kinase end labeling with [γ-32P] and polynucleotide kinase. Probe sequences were: HD4, top strand: 5′-CTCTAGCTAATTAAATTAGC-3′; HD4 mutant, top strand: 5′-CTCTAGCTCCTTAAAGGAGC-3′. Probes were purified using G25 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences catalog number 27-5325-01) and 40,000 cpm used per reaction (0.2–2 ng). In vitro translated protein was incubated with labeled probe for 15 min at 26–28 °C in a final volume of 15 μl (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton, 88 mm KCl, 150 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 ng/μl salmon sperm DNA). For competition reactions, excess unlabeled probe was first incubated with in vitro translated protein for 2–3 min at 26–28 °C, then labeled probe was added and the tubes incubated for 15 min at 26–28 °C. Samples were resolved on a 4.5% non-denaturing acrylamide gel using 0.5× TBE running buffer. Gels were dried and exposed overnight on phosphorimager screens. Western Blotting—In vitro translated proteins or cell lysates were separated on 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked in 1:10 BM Blocking reagent overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed briefly and incubated with 3 μg/ml mouse anti-FLAG antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (M2-Sigma). Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, blots were hybridized with rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary (Jackson Laboratories) at 1:5000 in 1:20 Roche blocking reagent in phosphate-buffered saline. Blots were washed and chemilumiscence was detected with Roche Western blotting kit and captured and quantified using a Bio-Rad Fluor MultiImager with Quantity One version 4.1.0 software. CHX10 Can Repress Transcription—Because CHX10 contains three regions that loosely resemble sequences in some activators (2Liu I.S. Chen J. Ploder L. Vidgen D. van der Kooy D. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1994; 13: 377-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), we tested whether it has positive regulatory activity. Transient transfection assays were performed with a LexCHX10 expression vector, encoding the bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA fused to human CHX10, together with a reporter plasmid, X4G2CAT, containing four LexA binding sites, two GAL4 binding sites upstream of the heat shock (hsp70) minimal promoter, and the CAT reporter gene. When a human cervical carcinoma line (C33A (27Scheffner M. Munger K. Byrne J.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar)) and a neuronal/glial line (NG108, generated by fusion of mouse neuroblastoma and rat glioma cells (28Daniels M.P. Hamprecht B. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), were transfected with X4G2CAT and LexCHX10 plasmids, no transcriptional activation was observed (data not shown). A plasmid expressing LexA alone (SVLex) had no effect (data not shown). To explore whether CHX10 might inhibit transcription, we tested the effect of Chx10 on several activators. GAL4 fusions used in these assays contained the ADs of HSF1, which are acidic (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); and c-JUN and c-MYC ADs, which are prolineand glutamine-rich (24Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 29Bohmann D. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). c-MYC has an additional AD that has no preponderance of specific amino acids (24Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). As a positive control for repression, cells were transfected with LexSu(z)2, which encoded LexA fused to the Drosophila polycomb group protein suppressor two of zeste (Fig. 1A), together with X4G2CAT and GAL4-c-MYC (GM1–262). Su(z)2 is a powerful transcriptional repressor responsible for maintaining the proper spatially restricted expression pattern of the homeotic loci during Drosophila development (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). LexCHX10 repressed activated transcription as effectively as LexSu(z)2 in C33A cells (Fig. 1A). LexA alone (SVLex) did not affect transcription. Repression was dependent on CHX10 being targeted to the promoter by LexA because CHX10 alone failed to repress (Fig. 1A). In NG108 cells, LexCHX10 inhibited GAL4-c-JUN and GAL4-HSF1 mediated activation by 80 and 87%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in C33A cells (data not shown). In NG108 cells, titration of LexCHX10 demonstrated dose-dependent repression of HSF1-mediated activation (data not shown). CHX10 Represses at a Distance—Some activators and repressors function even when bound far away from the transcription start site. For example, Su(z)2 represses transcription when positioned 1,700 bp away from activator binding sites (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, the HD protein Eve does not repress when placed 500 bp away from the activator binding sites (30Han K. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To determine whether CHX10 represses at a distance, reporter plasmids were used in which the LexA sites were separated from the GAL4 sites by 300 or 1700 bp (Fig. 1C) (22Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). LexCHX10 repressed most effectively when the LexA sites were directly upstream of the GAL4-activator binding sites. As the distance between these sites was increased, CHX10-mediated repression was compromised, but a similar degree of repression was observed when either LexChx10 or LexSu(z)2 were targeted to sites 1,700 bp upstream of the activator binding sites (Fig. 1C). Apart from showing that CHX10 represses from a distance, these data suggest that repression is not because of steric interference. CHX10 Also Represses TATA-less Promoters—Because TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters sometimes show differences in response to activators and repressors (31Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Aso T.H.

Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we also tested the properties of CHX10 on a TATA-less promoter, X4G2PCNACAT. Here, the TATA-containing hsp70 promoter in X4G2CAT was replaced by the TATA-less core promoter from the gene for PCNA (35Travali S. Ku D.H. Rizzo M.G. Ottavio L. Baserga R. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7466-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LexChx10 inhibited GAL4-c-JUN-mediated activation of this reporter by 85% (Fig. 1D), indicating that Chx10 does not require a TATA box to inhibit gene expression. CHX10 Represses a Complex Enhancer—The above experiments indicate that CHX10 represses individual activators (c-MYC, HSF1, and c-JUN). In vivo, however, these factors operate in the context of multiprotein structures, or enhanceosomes, which form by cooperative binding of activators to enhancers (36Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, we assayed the effect of CHX10 on the SV40 enhancer using the reporters pLD85 (21Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M. Hamel P.A. Ingles C.J. Gallie B.L. Philips R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), in which a GAL4 binding site lies upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter, CAT, and the SV40 enhancer, or G5SV40CAT (26Yew P.R. Lui X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), in which five GAL4 sites lie upstream of the SV40 enhancer/promoter (Fig. 1E). GAL4-CHX10, which encodes the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to CHX10, repressed both reporters by 85–90%, whereas the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone, encoded by pBXG1, had no effect (Fig. 1E). Thus, in addition to discrete activators, CHX10 can repress a complex enhancer. The retinoblastoma protein (RB) is another potent transcriptional repressor (21Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M.

https://openalex.org/W2015408928,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) serve crucial roles in innate immunity by mediating the activation of macrophages by microbial pathogens. The protein kinase interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK-1) is a key component of TLR signaling pathways via its interaction with TRAF6, which subsequently leads to the activation of MAP kinases and various transcription factors. IRAK-1 is degraded following TLR activation, and this has been proposed to contribute to tolerance in macrophages by limiting further TLR-mediated signaling. Using a mass spectrometric-based approach, we have identified a cohort of chaperones and co-chaperones including Hsp90 and Cdc37, which bind to IRAK-1 but not IRAK-4 in 293T cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 led to a rapid decline in the expression level of IRAK-1, whereas overexpression of Cdc37 enhanced the activation and oligomerization of IRAK-1 in 293T cells. Significantly, the inhibition of Hsp90 in macrophages resulted in the destabilization and degradation of IRAK-1 but not IRAK-4. Concomitant with the loss of IRAK-1 expression was a reduction in the activation of p38 MAP kinase and Erk1/2 following stimulation with the bacterially derived TLR ligands, lipopolysaccharide and CpG DNA. Moreover, TLR ligand-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines was also reduced. Thus we conclude that the level of on-going support provided to IRAK-1 by the Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone module directly influences the magnitude of TLR-mediated macrophage activation. In addition, because further TLR signaling depends on the synthesis of new IRAK-1, the Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone module could also contribute to tolerance in macrophages by controlling the rate at which nascent IRAK-1 is folded into a functional conformation.

The innate immune system represents the first line of defense of the host against infection by microbial pathogens. Macrophages are a key component of the innate immune system as they have the capacity to secrete inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFα 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IL, interleukin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; BMMs, bone marrow-derived macrophages; GA, geldanamycin; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RAD, radicicol; TLR, Toll-like receptor; KD, kinase-dead; HA, hemagglutinin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Hsc, heat shock cognate protein; IFN-γ, interferon-γ. and IL-1), as well as phagocytose, and degrade microbial pathogens. Subsequent presentation of pathogen-derived peptides to T-helper cells by macrophages is important for the adaptive immune response (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The detection of microbial pathogens by macrophages is largely mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (2Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar, 3Beutler B. Hoebe K. Du X. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Different TLRs are activated by specific components of microbial pathogens. For example, TLR4 is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (4Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M.

Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 538-544PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a number of host factors (e.g. fibrin(ogen) and hyaluronan) have been proposed to function as endogenous ligands for TLRs (7Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J.

Ligation of TLRs triggers the activation of a complex network of intracellular signal transduction pathways. Prominent components of these pathways include IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (e.g. IRAK-1 and IRAK-4), TRAF6, MAP kinases (e.g. p38 MAP kinase and Erk1/2), and the transcription factors, NF-κB and AP-1 (11Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Expression of various genes (e.g. TNFα, IL-1, IL-8, CD80, and CD86) mediates the ensuing innate and adaptive immune responses (2Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev.

The generation of IRAK-1 knock-out mice has revealed an important role for this protein kinase in signaling by TLR4 as well as the IL-1 receptor (12Kanakaraj P. Schafer P.H. Cavender D.E. Wu Y.

Such degradation of IRAK-1 may represent a negative feedback mechanism to prevent prolonged activation of cells in response to TLR ligands or IL-1. IRAK-1 is also subject to negative regulation via its interaction with Tollip and IRAK-M (20Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Tollip forms a complex with IRAK-1 in resting cells and prevents its activation in the absence of an appropriate stimulus (e.g. TLR ligand) (20Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). IRAK-M is a catalytically inactive kinase that suppresses IRAK-1 function by inhibiting phosphorylation of IRAK-1 or preventing its release from the receptor complex (21Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D.

Here we report that the stable expression of functional IRAK-1 in cells was dependent on its interaction with Hsp90. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that acts in concert with heat shock cognate protein (Hsc)/Hsp70 and various co-chaperones (e.g. Hop and Cdc37) to fold client proteins (e.g. steroid receptors and protein kinases) into functional conformations (22Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Hop serves to coordinate interactions between Hsp90 and Hsc/Hsp70 during client protein folding and is typically associated with “early/intermediate” folding complexes consisting of the client protein, Hsp70 and Hsp90 (22Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 23Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Cdc37 specifically stabilizes the interaction of Hsp90 with client protein kinases, thereby promoting the formation of “mature” complexes containing the client protein kinase, Hsp90, and Cdc37 (24Grammatikakis N.

The client protein kinase is subsequently released from the chaperone complex following its folding into a functional conformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 in macrophages resulted in the rapid loss of IRAK-1 expression and culminated in the impaired ability of TLR4 and TLR9 ligands to activate p38 MAP kinase and Erk1/2 and to stimulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Thus Hsp90 may play an important role in controlling the inflammatory response of macrophages by directly modulating the stability and hence signal transducing capacity of IRAK-1.

Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). An expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged IRAK-4 (i.e. FLAG-IRAK-4) was constructed by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and the plasmid pTriplEx-mIRAK-4 (from Dr. Wen-Chen Yeh, University of Toronto) as template. The resulting 1.4-kb PCR product was digested with MluI and subcloned into the corresponding site in pEF-BOS-FLAG (29Scholz G. Hartson S.D. Cartledge K. Hall N. Shao J. Dunn A.R. Matts R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6984-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An expression vector encoding HA-tagged Cdc37 (i.e. HA-Cdc37) was created by excising the cDNA for Cdc37 from pEF-FLAG-Cdc37 (29Scholz G. Hartson S.D. Cartledge K. Hall N. Shao J. Dunn A.R.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Human 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (29Scholz G.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared from 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice as described previously (30Jaworowski A. Wilson N.J. Christy E. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol.

Cell Lysis, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed directly in tissue culture dishes with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm sodium molybdate, and Complete™ protease inhibitors) for 60 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation of cell lysates were performed by standard techniques (29Scholz G. Hartson S.D. Cartledge K. Hall N. Shao J. Dunn A.R. Matts R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6984-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Scholz G.M. Hartson S.D. Cartledge K. Volk L. Matts R.L. Dunn A.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised from gels stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 and digested in situ with trypsin. The peptides then were extracted, and peptide mass fingerprinting was performed using a Voyager DE™ MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in linear mode or an Ultraflex™ MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in reflectron mode. The mass spectra were analyzed by searching the Mascot search engine (www.matrixscience.com) based on the NCBI and SwissProt protein databases. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 μm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The ability of immunoprecipitated IRAK-1 to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate was tested by supplementing the kinase reactions with 2.5 μg of myelin basic protein. Reactions were terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The reactions then were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose filter and exposure to x-ray film. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Size-Exclusion Chromatography—Transfected 293T cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The lysates (500 μl) then were applied to a Superose-6 column (HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol), and elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with fractions collected at each minute. The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), and equine myoglobin (17 kDa). Real-Time PCR Analysis of Gene Expression—Total RNA was isolated from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and then reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system and pre-developed TaqMan probe/primer combinations for TNFα, IL-1β, and 18 S rRNA (ABI). Threshold cycle numbers were transformed using the ΔΔCt and relative value method as described by the manufacturer and expressed relative to 18 S rRNA. IRAK-1 Forms a Complex with a Cohort of Molecular Chaperones and Co-chaperones in 293T Cells—To identify novel regulators or effectors of IRAK-1, FLAG-tagged versions of wild-type and kinase-dead IRAK-1 (i.e. FLAG-IRAK-1 and FLAG-IRAK-1 KD, respectively) were transiently expressed in human 293T cells and then affinity-purified using anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to agarose beads. IRAK-1-binding proteins were detected by subjecting the immunoprecipitates to SDS-PAGE followed by staining of the gel with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250. As shown in Fig. 1A, five distinct proteins (designated “1”, “2”, “3” “4,” and “5”) were detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates derived from 293T cells expressing FLAG-IRAK-1 (lane 2) or FLAG-IRAK-1 KD (lane 3) but not from empty vector control-transfected cells (lane 1). These five protein bands were excised from the gel and digested in situ with trypsin and the resulting peptides subjected to mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF or MALDI-TOF/TOF). The identities of the proteins (in order 1–5) were established as Hsp90, IRAK-1, Hsc70, Hsp70, and Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop). To confirm the mass spectrometric-based identification of the IRAK-1-binding proteins, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates of FLAG-IRAK-1 were also subjected to Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop were detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates derived from 293T cells expressing either wild-type or kinase-dead FLAG-IRAK-1 (lanes 2 and 3, respectively) but not in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with empty control vector (lane 1). Cdc37 is a 50-kDa protein that recruits a subset of protein kinases to Hsp90 to facilitate their folding into active conformations (24Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 25Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6984-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although a 50-kDa protein was not detected in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates, the heavy chain of the anti-FLAG antibody could have obscured the presence of Cdc37 (Fig. 1A). Indeed, Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates with an anti-Cdc37 antibody revealed co-immunoprecipitation of Cdc37 with both wild-type and kinase-dead FLAG-IRAK-1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments with an anti-Cdc37 antibody demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-IRAK-1 (kinase-active and kinase-dead) and Hsp90 with Cdc37 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). However, neither Hsp70 nor Hop was found to co-immunoprecipitate with Cdc37 (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–4). These findings suggest that FLAG-IRAK-1 is present in at least two distinct heterocomplexes, one consisting of FLAG-IRAK-1, Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop and another consisting of FLAG-IRAK-1, Hsp90, and Cdc37. To examine the specificity of the interaction of IRAK-1 with Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, and Cdc37, the ability of IRAK-4 to form a complex with these proteins was also determined. IRAK-4 is structurally related to IRAK-1 and has been proposed to mediate the activation of IRAK-1 in response to engagement of Toll-like receptors by their ligands (32Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). No interaction of FLAG-tagged IRAK-4 with Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, or Cdc37 was observed (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 4). Thus the interaction of IRAK-1 with Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, and Cdc37 appears to be specific and not the consequence of its overexpression in 293T cells. Stable Expression of IRAK-1 in 293T Cells Is Dependent on Hsp90 Activity—The importance of Hsp90 for IRAK-1 function was directly addressed by treating 293T cells expressing FLAG-IRAK-1 with two structurally dissimilar Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin (GA) and radicicol (RAD) (33Schulte T.W.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), several electrophoretically distinct forms of FLAG-IRAK-1 were observed upon its overexpression in 293T cells (Fig. 2A). Yamin and Miller (19Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) have previously shown that the more slowly migrating forms represent phosphorylated IRAK-1. Thus overexpression of FLAG-IRAK-1 in 293T cells results in ligand-independent autoactivation of the protein kinase (38Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with either GA or RAD resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the expression level of phosphorylated (i.e. activated) FLAG-IRAK-1 (Fig. 2A). Time course experiments with GA revealed a decrease in the level of phosphorylated IRAK-1 within 2 h of treating the cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor, which diminished significantly further by 8 h (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–6). To directly assess the effect of GA on the enzymatic activity of FLAG-IRAK-1, the capacity of immunoprecipitated FLAG-IRAK-1 to autophosphorylate as well as phosphorylate an exogenous substrate (i.e. myelin basic protein) was measured. These in vitro kinase assays confirmed a time-dependent loss of catalytically active FLAG-IRAK-1 in 293T cells treated with GA (Fig. 2C). To investigate the effect of GA on the composition of IRAK-1 heterocomplexes, FLAG-tagged IRAK-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected 293T cells and subjected to Western blotting. The data presented in Fig. 2D clearly revealed that treatment of the transfected cells with GA reduced but did not abolish the association of Hsp90 with FLAG-IRAK-1. By contrast, the levels of Hsp70 and Hop associated with FLAG-IRAK-1 increased in response to GA treatment, whereas the association of Cdc37 with FLAG-IRAK-1 was abolished within 60 min of treating the cells with GA (Fig. 2D, lane 2 versus lane 3). These findings clearly indicate that Hsp90 activity is required for the stable expression of catalytically active IRAK-1 in 293T cells. Furthermore, they suggest that the interaction of Cdc37 with IRAK-1 is necessary for the stabilization of IRAK-1 by Hsp90. Hsp90 Is Required for the Stable Expression of IRAK-1 in Macrophages—To establish whether a functional relationship also exists between endogenous IRAK-1 and Hsp90 in macrophages, primary mouse BMMs were treated with different concentrations of GA or RAD for 8 h and the expression levels of IRAK-1 were evaluated by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, the treatment of BMMs with either GA or RAD induced a dose-dependent decrease in the expression level of endogenous IRAK-1. Neither GA nor RAD had any significant effect on the expression levels of endogenous IRAK-4 or p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 3A). The expression levels of Hsp90 and Cdc37 were essentially unaltered in GA- or RAD-treated BMMs (data not shown). GA promoted the relatively rapid degradation of IRAK-1 in BMMs with the half-life of the protein kinase estimated to be ∼3 h in GA-treated macrophages (Fig. 3B). To establish whether the loss of IRAK-1 in GA-treated BMMs was the result of degradation of nascent and/or mature (i.e. folded) IRAK-1, the half-life of IRAK-1 in macrophages containing functional Hsp90 was established. BMMs were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and IRAK-1 levels were monitored by Western blotting. These experiments revealed that the half-life of mature IRAK-1 in macrophages is greater than 8 h (Fig. 3C). Likewise, the half-lives of IRAK-4, p38 MAP kinase, and Erk1/2 in BMMs were also greater than 8 h (data not shown). Thus our finding that the half-life of IRAK-1 is reduced in GA-treated BMMs (3 h versus >8 h) suggests that, even following its folding into a mature and functional conformation, IRAK-1 is still dependent on Hsp90 activity for its continued stable expression in macrophages. The functional dependence of IRAK-1 on Hsp90 and Cdc37 in macrophages was further illustrated by demonstrating co-immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 and Cdc37 with endogenous IRAK-1 (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the data presented in Fig. 2D, treatment of BMMs with GA for 1 h led to a reduction in the association of Hsp90 and Cdc37 with endogenous IRAK-1 (Fig. 3D). Cdc37 Enhances Autoactivation of IRAK-1 in 293T Cells— The finding that GA-induced degradation of IRAK-1 correlated with the loss of Cdc37 from IRAK-1 heterocomplexes suggested that Cdc37 played an important role in the stabilization of IRAK-1 by Hsp90. To address this issue, the effect of Cdc37 overexpression on IRAK-1 expression and activity was investigated. The data presented in Fig. 4A revealed that the proportion of total FLAG-IRAK-1 that was hyperphosphorylated (and thus activated) was higher in 293T cells expressing HA-Cdc37 compared with cells expressing FLAG-IRAK-1 alone (lane 4 versus lane 2). Notably, the enhanced activation of FLAG-IRAK-1 in 293T cells co-expressing HA-Cdc37 was still dependent on Hsp90 activity (Fig. 4A, lane 5 versus lane 4). Examination of the composition of FLAG-IRAK-1 heterocomplexes revealed that HA-Cdc37 competed with endogenous Cdc37 for binding to FLAG-IRAK-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 4 versus lane 2). Expression of HA-Cdc37 did not appear to affect the level of Hsp90 associated with FLAG-IRAK-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 4 versus lane 2). However, the association of Hsp70 and Hop with FLAG-IRAK-1 was markedly reduced upon co-expression of the kinase with HA-Cdc37 (lane 4 versus lane 2), although treatment of identically transfected cells wi"
https://openalex.org/W2141489712,"The unicellular stercorarian protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease. The epimastigote form of the parasite is covered in a dense coat of glycoinositol phospholipids and short glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mucinlike molecules. Here, we describe the purification and structural characterization of NETNES, a relatively minor but unusually complex glycoprotein that coexists with these major surface components. The mature glycoprotein is only 13 amino acids in length, with the sequence AQENETNESGSID, and exists in two forms with either four or five post-translational modifications. These are either one or two asparagine-linked oligomannose glycans, two linear α-mannose glycans linked to serine residues via phosphodiester linkages, and a GPI membrane anchor attached to the C-terminal aspartic acid residue. The variety and density of post-translational modifications on an unusually small peptide core make NETNES a unique type of glycoprotein. The N-glycans are predominantly Manα1–6(Manα1–3) Manα1–6(Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-Asn; the phosphate-linked glycans are a mixture of (Manα1–2)0–3Man1-P-Ser; and the GPI anchor has the structure Manα1–2(ethanolamine phosphate)Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4(2-aminoethylphosphonate-6)GlcNα1–6-myo-inositol-1-P-3(sn-1-O-(C16:0)alkyl-2-O-(C16:0)acylglycerol). Four putative NETNES genes were found in the T. cruzi genome data base. These genes are predicted to encode 65-amino acid proteins with cleavable 26-amino acid N-terminal signal peptides and 26-amino acid C-terminal GPI addition signal peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2041953777,"We have previously demonstrated that both isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) and one of its substrates, the RhoGTPase Rac1, are critical for the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) stimulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in endothelial cells (EC). Here, we have shown that ICMT regulates TNFα stimulation of Rac1 activity. TNFα stimulation of EC increased the membrane association of Rac1, an event that is essential for Rac1 activity. ICMT inhibitor N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC) blocked the accumulation of Rac1 into the membrane both in resting and TNFα-stimulated conditions. Similarly, the membrane-associated Rac1 was lower in Icmt-deficient versus wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). TNFα also increased the level of GTP-Rac1, the active form of Rac1, in EC. AFC completely suppressed the TNFα stimulation of increase in GTP-Rac1 levels. Confocal microscopy revealed resting EC Rac1 was present in the plasma membrane and also in the perinuclear region. AFC mislocalized Rac1, both from the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region. Mislocalization of Rac1 was also observed in Icmt-deficient versus wild-type MEFs. To determine the consequences of ICMT inhibition, we investigated the effect of AFC on p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation, which is downstream of Rac1. AFC inhibited the TNFα stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in EC. TNFα stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation was also significantly attenuated in Icmt-deficient versus wild-type MEFs. To understand the mechanism of inhibition of Rac1 activity, we examined the effect of ICMT inhibition on the interaction of Rac1 with its inhibitor, Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). The association of Rac1 with its inhibitor RhoGDI was dramatically increased in the Icmt-deficient versus wild-type MEFs both in resting as well as in TNFα-stimulated conditions, suggesting that RhoGDI was involved in inhibiting Rac1 activity under the conditions of ICMT inhibition. These results suggest that ICMT regulates Rac1 activity by controlling the interaction of Rac1 with RhoGDI. We hypothesize that ICMT regulates the release of Rac1 from RhoGDI. We have previously demonstrated that both isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) and one of its substrates, the RhoGTPase Rac1, are critical for the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) stimulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in endothelial cells (EC).

These results suggest that ICMT regulates Rac1 activity by controlling the interaction of Rac1 with RhoGDI. We hypothesize that ICMT regulates the release of Rac1 from RhoGDI. Some signaling proteins, such as small GTPases and the γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, end with a CAAX (C for cysteine, A for aliphatic amino acids, and X for almost any other amino acid) sequence, which is post-translationally modified in three ways (1Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clark S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 21. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 156-213Google Scholar). Isoprenylation (farnesylation or geranylgeranylation) at cysteine is followed by cleavage of the last three amino acids (AAX) (1Young S.G. Ambroziak P. Kim E. Clark S. Tamanoi F. Sigman D.G. 3rd Ed.

Finally, the isoprenylated cysteine is carboxyl methylated by an endoplasmic reticulum resident enzyme (4Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol.

This carboxyl methylation provides additional hydrophobicity to the isoprenylated proteins. Carboxyl methylation is dependent on the first two modifications and is potentially reversible. We demonstrated that ICMT and one of its substrates, the RhoGTPase Rac1, regulate in endothelial cells (EC) the inflammatory cytokine TNFα stimulation of redox-sensitive expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (6Ahmad M.

These studies raised the possibility that ICMT may regulate VCAM-1 expression by regulating Rac1 activity. Rac1, the most extensively studied Rac, is a ubiquitously expressed CAAX protein that plays a crucial role in endothelial cell biology by regulating gene transcription, actin remodeling, cell shape, motility, secretion, and proliferation (7Ridley A.J.

The activation of Rac1 involves multiple steps. In resting cells, GDP-Rac1 is predominantly present in the cytosol as a complex with the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, RhoGDI. After stimulation RhoGDI releases, by an unestablished mechanism, Rac1 (24Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which then translocates to the membrane where GTP is exchanged for GDP by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GTP-Rac1 then interacts with its effector molecules, e.g. p21-activated kinase (PAK), among others, to mediate its effects. GTP-Rac1 is inactivated by conversion of the GTP to GDP by GTPase activating protein. GDP-Rac1 is then extracted from the membrane by RhoGDI back into the cytosol, thereby completing the activation cycle. Thus, mechanisms regulating the accumulation of Rac1 into the membrane and GTP loading of Rac1 could be important in regulating its activity. The mechanism(s) regulating the translocation of Rac1 from cytosol to the membrane is not completely understood. Protein kinase C activators and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine stimulate the translocation of Rac to the membrane (18Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 25Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocked translocation of Rac in response to chemoattractant stimulation of human neutrophils (26Dorseuil O. Quinn M.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or to depolarization in EC (27Sohn H.-Y. Keller M. Gloe T. Morawietz H. Rueckschloss U. Pohl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18745-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). TNFα stimulation of neutrophils activates Rac translocation through a protein tyrosine kinase, but not through the protein kinase C pathway (25Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation analysis demonstrated Rac requires a polybasic region (KKRKRK) near the C terminus for its association with the membrane (28del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Hu J. Kiosses W.B. Altman A. Villalba M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of isoprenylation blocked Rac1 membrane translocation (29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of isoprenylation also prevents post-isoprenylation carboxyl methylation. Thus, the effect of inhibitors of isoprenylation on Rac translocation could also be due to the inhibition of carboxyl methylation. The role of carboxyl methylation in the translocation of Rac1 is not understood. We investigated the role of ICMT in the TNFα stimulation of Rac1 activity by assessing membrane-bound Rac1 and cellular GTP-Rac1 levels. We found that ICMT inhibition suppressed the accumulation of Rac1 into the membrane in both resting and TNFα-stimulated EC. Furthermore, levels of cellular GTP-Rac1, the active form of Rac1, were also suppressed, and Rac1 was found to be mislocalized both from the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region. These effects of ICMT inhibition were found to be mediated, at least in part, through an increase in the interaction of Rac1 with RhoGDI. Thus, post-isoprenylation carboxyl methylation is important in the regulation of Rac1 activity. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human aortic endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics and were grown and maintained in growth medium EBM-2 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and EGM-2 SingleQuots (hydrocortisone, human fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, R3-insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, human epidermal growth factor, GA-1000, and heparin). These cells were used between passages 3 and 7. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells immortalized with simian virus 40 product large T antigen (HMEC-1) were grown and maintained in MCDB131 medium as described elsewhere (30Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Icmt-deficient and wild-type control mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) cell lines were isolated and cultured as described (31Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC) was purchased from Biomol, and the stock solution was made at 100 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Antibodies against Rac1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-ICMT antibodies were raised against the 19-amino acid peptide (YKKRVPTGLPFIKGVKVDL) present at the C terminus of human ICMT and were purified by affinity column. Cell Extract Preparation and Western Analysis—After treating with various reagents, cells in 100-mm dishes were lysed in 0.7 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain and 1 mm each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium fluoride, and sodium orthovanadate). The cells were vortexed and put on a rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were spun for 10 min at 8,000 × g to pellet debris, and the supernatant was removed and placed in new tubes. Equal amounts of total protein were size fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad). To assess the levels of various proteins, the membranes were probed with their respective antibodies. Membranes were then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish conjugate and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence substrates. Membrane Preparation in Hypotonic Buffer—EC were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, drained, and incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 5 min. Cells were scraped and homogenized with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 3 min to pellet nuclei and intact cells. The supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to sediment particulates before being removed. The crude membrane was gently washed with a hypotonic lysis buffer. Membrane and cytosol fractions were then assayed for total protein. Equal amounts were analyzed by Western blotting and quantified by scanning densitometry. Preparation of Detergent-insoluble Membrane—EC were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm NaF) prior to being centrifuged (500 × g for 5 min) to separate unbroken cells and nuclei. After centrifugation of the supernatant (100,000 × g for 30 min, 4 °C), the pellet was dissolved in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer and boiled for 5 min. Rac1 was immunodetected by Western analysis using an antibody specific to Rac1. Rac1 Methylation Assays—The methylation of CAAX proteins by ICMT is base-labile. To determine the level of methylated Rac1, human aortic endothelial cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes and labeled with l-[methyl-3H]methionine (50 μCi/ml) in 4 ml of methionine-free medium (Clonetics) at 37 °C overnight. Cell extracts were prepared after treating the cells with either AFC or TNFα. Crude membrane was prepared as described earlier. The membrane was dissolved in 50 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE buffer, diluted to 1 ml with 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and incubated with agarose-conjugated protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and incubated with polyclonal antibodies specific to Rac1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured using agarose-conjugated protein A/G and separated by centrifugation. Pellets were washed three times with 1× lysis buffer, and Rac1 was immunodetected by Western analysis. Bands corresponding to Rac1 were cut out from Western blots and carefully placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf centrifuge tubes (without caps) containing 200–500 μl of 1N NaOH. Tubes were placed in 20-ml scintillation vials containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The vials were then capped and left at 37 °C overnight to release the [3H]methanol produced by hydrolysis of methyl esters. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plastic dishes, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with an antibody specific to Rac1 at 1:50 dilution overnight at 4 °C. Specific antibody binding was detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (green fluorescence) or TRITC-labeled (red fluorescence) secondary antibody. Normal rabbit or mouse IgG (5 μg/μl) was used, instead of a primary antibody, as a negative control in each case. Images were acquired using a Bio-Rad 1024 MRC laser scanning confocal imaging system and represent basic z-sections of the cells. Rac Pulldown Assays—Rac GTPase assays were performed essentially as described using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, GTP-Rac in cell lysates was pulled down using the Rac-binding domain of PAK linked to glutathione-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and then eluted with SDS-sample buffer. GTP-Rac was analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-Rac antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (32Ahmad M. Church R.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1991; 10: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) using a pH gradient of 3.5–10. TNFα Stimulation of EC Increases the Membrane-associated Rac1—The Rho GTPase Rac1 is a major target of the inflammatory signals stimulated by TNFα and is important in the TNFα stimulation of expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in EC (6Ahmad M. Zhang Y. Zhang Y. Papaharalambus C. Alexander R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rac1 association with membranes reflects its biological activity. To determine whether TNFα stimulates Rac1 activity, EC were treated with TNFα for 5–80 min, and a crude detergent-insoluble membrane fraction was prepared. Membrane-associated Rac1 was assessed by Western analysis. TNFα stimulation of EC for 5–80 min increased the level of membrane-associated Rac1 (Fig. 1). Total Rac1 level remained unchanged. Similar results were obtained when the membranes were prepared in buffer without detergent (data not shown). Thus, TNFα stimulation increases the level of membrane-associated Rac1. TNFα Stimulation of EC Increases the Level of Membrane-associated Methylated Rac1—Isoprenylation is necessary for the translocation of Rac1 to the membrane (29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). However, the role of the post-isoprenylation carboxyl methylation in the translocation of Rac1 is unknown. To determine whether translocated Rac1 is carboxyl methylated, Rac1 was immunoprecipitated from the membrane fraction, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western analysis. The band corresponding to Rac1 was cut out, and the level of carboxyl-methylated Rac1 was determined by vapor phase equilibration assays. EC membranes contained carboxyl-methylated Rac1 basally. TNFα stimulated a further increase in membrane-associated carboxyl-methylated Rac1 at 1 and 5 min (Fig. 2). Thus, TNFα stimulation of EC increases the level of membrane-associated carboxyl-methylated Rac1. ICMT Inhibition Suppresses the Level of Membrane-associated Rac1—To determine whether ICMT modulates the membrane association of Rac1, we measured the effects of the ICMT inhibitor AFC on membrane translocation after TNF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3A, TNFα stimulation increased the level of membrane-associated Rac1 and AFC pretreatment suppressed Rac1 to basal levels. AFC inhibited the level of membrane-associated Rac1 in resting cells. The total Rac1 level remained the same under these conditions. Thus, ICMT is involved in maintaining the membrane levels of Rac1 in both resting and TNFα-stimulated EC. To determine whether ICMT also affects Rac1 translocation in other cell types, we evaluated responses in Icmt-deficient and wild-type MEFs. As Fig. 3B shows, the membrane-associated Rac1 in resting wild-type MEFs was below the limit of detection. Stimulating the cells with TNFα for 1–60 min increased the level of membrane-associated Rac1. Under the same conditions the level of membrane-associated Rac1 in Icmt-deficient MEFs was very low, both in resting as well as in TNFα-stimulated cells, although the total level of Rac1 expressed in these cells was higher than that in the wild-type cells. Thus, Icmt also appears to be important for the accumulation of Rac1 in the membrane of MEFs. ICMT Inhibition Suppresses the GTP-Rac1 Levels in TNFα-stimulated EC—After accumulation into the membrane, Rac1 is loaded with GTP by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GTP-Rac1, the active form of Rac1, interacts with its effector molecules, e.g. PAK, to perform its functions. To validate the conclusions about Rac1 activity derived from the results obtained with membrane association studies, we performed Rac1 pulldown assays to measure directly GTP-Rac1 levels in EC. As shown in Fig. 4A, TNFα stimulation of the cells for 1–35 min increased the level of GTP-Rac1 in HMEC-1 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with AFC (25–50 μm) inhibited the increase in GTP-Rac1 levels in TNFα-stimulated EC (Fig. 4B). Thus, ICMT regulates the TNFα stimulation of GTP-Rac1 levels in EC. Mislocalization of Rac1 in AFC-treated EC—To elucidate the role of ICMT in the localization of Rac1, we performed confocal microscopy. As Fig. 5A demonstrates, Rac1 is present in the plasma membrane and also in the perinuclear region of resting cells. Treatment of EC with AFC mislocalized Rac1 from both the membrane and the perinuclear region to the nucleus. To determine whether AFC affects the methylation status of Rac1, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In resting EC, Rac1 had two major bands, “M” and “U” (Fig. 5B, lower panel). AFC treatment of the cells suppressed the level of band M and concomitantly increased the intensity of the U band of Rac1 (Fig. 5B, upper panel). Thus, the U band appears to represent unmethylated Rac1 and the M band likely represents methylated Rac1. AFC seems to suppress the level of methylated Rac1. These results suggest that ICMT is necessary for the localization of Rac1 to the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region in EC and that the effect is manifested by methylated Rac1. To determine whether ICMT also plays a role in Rac1 localization in other cells types, we performed studies on Icmt-deficient and wild-type MEFs. As shown in Fig. 5C, Rac1 is localized in the perinuclear region of resting wild-type MEFs but is diffusely located in Icmt-deficient MEFs. Thus, Icmt also plays a role in the targeting and intracellular localization of Rac1 in MEFs. ICMT Inhibition Suppresses the TNFα Phosphorylation of p38 MAP Kinase—p38 MAP kinase requires Rac1 for its activation by TNFα and has also been implicated in the regulation of expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in EC (33Pietersma A. Tilly B.C. Gaestel M. de Jong N. Lee J.C. Koster J.F. Sluiter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To determine whether ICMT plays a role in regulating the signaling pathways downstream of Rac1, we investigated the effect of AFC on p38 MAP kinase activation by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, lane 2, TNFα stimulated the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase in EC severalfold above baseline. AFC pretreatment of EC dose dependently suppressed the TNFα stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation (lanes 3 and 4), whereas the solvent Me2SO had no effect (lane 5). Under the same conditions the total amount of p38 MAP kinase remained unchanged. Thus, ICMT also regulates the TNFα stimulation of phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase that is downstream of Rac1. To determine whether ICMT also plays a role in the TNFα stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in other cell types, we performed studies on MEFs. As shown in Fig. 6B, TNFα stimulation of wild-type MEFs for 15 min robustly induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Under the same conditions, the TNFα stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation was significantly reduced in Icmt-deficient MEFs. The expression of p38 MAP kinase was also lower in Icmt-deficient versus wild-type MEFs. Taking into account the reduction in p38 MAP kinase expression, the TNFα stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in Icmt-deficient MEFs remained significantly lower compared with that in wild-type MEFs. Thus, Icmt plays a role in the TNFα stimulation of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in MEFs. ICMT Regulates the Interaction between Rac1 and RhoGDI— In resting cells, RhoGDI solubilizes and sequesters Rac1 in the cytosol by masking its isoprenyl group. Stimuli that activate Rac1 are thought to release GDP-Rac1 from RhoGDI through mechanisms that are unclear. GDP-Rac1 translocates to the membrane, where it is loaded with GTP. After performing its function in the membrane, GTP-Rac1 is converted to GDP-Rac1 through the action of RhoGTPase activating proteins. The GDP-Rac1 is then extracted by RhoGDI back to the cytosol. We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in Rac1 level in the membrane after ICMT inhibition could be due to an increase in the interaction of unmethylated Rac1 and RhoGDI. AFC also has an isoprenyl group that can interfere with the interaction of Rac1 with RhoGDI by competing for the isoprenyl binding pocket present within the RhoGDI structure (34Lian L.Y. Barsukov I.

These cells have been characterized and contain no residual biochemical activity capable of methylating isoprenylated substrates, such as AFC or N-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine (38Bergo M.O.

Rac1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of Icmt-deficient and wild-type MEFs. The level of RhoGDI in the immunoprecipitates was determined by Western analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2157442770,"The metzincin metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A, pappalysin-1) promotes cell growth by the cleavage of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins-4 and -5, causing the release of bound insulin-like growth factors. The proteolytic activity of PAPP-A is inhibited by the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (pro-MBP), which forms a covalent 2:2 proteinase-inhibitor complex based on disulfide bonds. To understand the process of complex formation, we determined the status of cysteine residues in both of the uncomplexed molecules. A comparison of the disulfide structure of the reactants with the known disulfide structure of the PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex reveals that six cysteine residues of the pro-MBP subunit (Cys-51, Cys-89, Cys-104, Cys-107, Cys-128, and Cys-169) and two cysteine residues of the PAPP-A subunit (Cys-381 and Cys-652) change their status from the uncomplexed to the complexed states. Upon complex formation, three disulfide bonds of pro-MBP, which connect the acidic propiece with the basic, mature portion, are disrupted. In the PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex, two of these form the basis of both two interchain disulfide bonds between the PAPP-A and the pro-MBP subunits and two disulfide bonds responsible for pro-MBP dimerization, respectively. Based on the status of the reactants, we investigated the role of individual cysteine residues upon complex formation by mutagenesis of specific cysteine residues of both subunits. Our findings allow us to depict a hypothetical model of how the PAPPA·pro-MBP complex is formed. In addition, we have demonstrated that complex formation is greatly enhanced by the addition of micromolar concentrations of reductants. It is therefore possible that the activity in vivo of PAPP-A is controlled by the redox potential, and it is further tempting to speculate that such mechanism operates under pathological conditions of altered redox potential. The metzincin metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A, pappalysin-1) promotes cell growth by the cleavage of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins-4 and -5, causing the release of bound insulin-like growth factors. The proteolytic activity of PAPP-A is inhibited by the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (pro-MBP), which forms a covalent 2:2 proteinase-inhibitor complex based on disulfide bonds. To understand the process of complex formation, we determined the status of cysteine residues in both of the uncomplexed molecules. A comparison of the disulfide structure of the reactants with the known disulfide structure of the PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex reveals that six cysteine residues of the pro-MBP subunit (Cys-51, Cys-89, Cys-104, Cys-107, Cys-128, and Cys-169) and two cysteine residues of the PAPP-A subunit (Cys-381 and Cys-652) change their status from the uncomplexed to the complexed states. Upon complex formation, three disulfide bonds of pro-MBP, which connect the acidic propiece with the basic, mature portion, are disrupted. In the PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex, two of these form the basis of both two interchain disulfide bonds between the PAPP-A and the pro-MBP subunits and two disulfide bonds responsible for pro-MBP dimerization, respectively. Based on the status of the reactants, we investigated the role of individual cysteine residues upon complex formation by mutagenesis of specific cysteine residues of both subunits. Our findings allow us to depict a hypothetical model of how the PAPPA·pro-MBP complex is formed. In addition, we have demonstrated that complex formation is greatly enhanced by the addition of micromolar concentrations of reductants. It is therefore possible that the activity in vivo of PAPP-A is controlled by the redox potential, and it is further tempting to speculate that such mechanism operates under pathological conditions of altered redox potential.

Known substrates of PAPP-A include insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs)-4 and -5, which function to inhibit the biological activities of IGF-I and -II, and cleavage by PAPP-A releases bioactive IGF (2Lawrence J.B.

However, the growth-promoting activity of PAPP-A is antagonized by the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (pro-MBP) of 206 residues (4Overgaard M.T. Glerup S. Boldt H.B. Rodacker V. Olsen I.M.

Pro-MBP inhibits the proteolytic activity of PAPP-A by the formation of an inactive, 2:2 proteinase-inhibitor complex, denoted PAPP-A·pro-MBP, covalently bound by disulfides (4Overgaard M.T.

Kristensen T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Lab. Investig. 1994; 71: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar). However, PAPP-A and pro-MBP expression has since been demonstrated in several other tissues (10Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Christiansen M. Lawrence J.B. Conover C.A. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L.

Wagner J.M. Kristensen T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Lab. Investig. 1994; 71: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar), and about 99% of circulating PAPP-A is present as a tetrameric complex with pro-MBP (5Overgaard M.T. Haaning J. Boldt H.B. Olsen I.M. Laursen L.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31128-31133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), showing that in vivo complex formation occurs outside the cell. In agreement with this, in vitro formation of the disulfide-bonded PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex after separate synthesis was recently demonstrated and shown to be required for inhibition of the proteolytic activity (4Overgaard M.T. Glerup S. Boldt H.B. Rodacker V. Olsen I.M. Christiansen M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Oxvig C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other proteinase inhibitors known to bind covalently to their target proteinase are the serpins (19Ye S. Goldsmith E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and α2-macroglobulin (20Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no prior examples of a proteinase inhibitor, in which the inhibitory mechanism is based on the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Disulfide bonds in nascent proteins are formed by the oxidation of cysteine residues in the endoplasmic reticulum. Because of the oxidizing nature of the extracellular milieu, disulfides have been considered to be inert. However, several recent reports suggest that the reduction or formation of specific disulfide bonds function in reversible and irreversible switches in the regulation of extracellular protein function. For example, the reduction of specific disulfide bonds in platelet integrin αIIbβ3 causes conformational changes in both integrin subunits and leads to exposure of ligand binding sites (21Yan B. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39964-39972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Also, the binding of platelets to multimers of the blood protein von Willebrand factor (vWf) is indirectly controlled by thrombospondin-1, which facilitates reversible reduction of vWf intersubunit disulfide bonds (22Xie L. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, several animal viruses (e.g. HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus) (23Matthias L.J. Yam P.T. Jiang X.M. Vandegraaff N. Li P. Poumbourios P. Donoghue N. Hogg P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Wallin M. Ekstrom M. Garoff H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) depend on the rearrangements of specific disulfides for virus-membrane fusion. Two systems of protein regulation based on disulfide switches relate to proteolysis. First, the reduction of two disulfide bonds in the fifth kringle domain of plasmin by phosphoglycerate kinase makes plasmin a substrate for proteolysis (25Lay A.J. Jiang X.M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Second, the serine proteinase inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) uses the disruption or the formation of a disulfide bond to switch between a stable, inhibitory monomeric conformation and a conformation that readily forms inactive polymers (26Wilczynska M. Lobov S. Ohlsson P.I. Ny T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1753-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have recently reported the connectivity of the 188 cysteine residues in the 2:2 PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex (7Overgaard M.T. Sorensen E.S. Stachowiak D. Boldt H.B. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2106-2117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We here show that oxidation does not promote complex formation, indicating that the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds is not a reaction between free thiol groups and molecular oxygen. To understand the process of complex formation, we determined the status of cysteine residues in both of the uncomplexed molecules and further performed mutagenesis of individual cysteines found to change their status upon complex formation. Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of pro-MBP cDNA cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) was carried out by overlap extension PCR (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). In brief, outer primers derived from pcDNA3.1+ were 5′-CCCCATTGACGCAAATGGGCGG-3′ (5′-end) and 5′-AGGAAAGGACAGTGGGAGTGG-3′ (3′-end). Internal primers with an overlap of ∼22 bp were used to generate mutated fragments that were digested with NheI/XhoI and swapped into the wild-type construct. Constructs encoding pro-MBP mutants (pro-MBP(C51S), 2The numbering of the 1547-residue mature PAPP-A polypeptide is used in this report. Glu-1 of mature PAPP-A corresponds to position 81 of prepro-PAPP-A (Swiss-Prot accession number Q13219).

Mutated PAPP-A constructs were obtained using two pBluescript II SK+ vectors containing PAPP-A cDNA corresponding to residues 1–407 (pB1-407) and 408–988 (pB408-988) (1Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T.

Mutagenesis was carried out by overlap extension PCR, and the mutated cDNA fragments were swapped into the HindIII/BspEI, or the BspEI/KpnI sites of pPA-BspEI (1Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S.

Outer primers, derived from pBluescript II SK+, were: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′. Plasmid pB1–407 was used for the construction of mutant PAPP-A(C381A), and plasmid pB408-988 was used for mutant PAPP-A(C652A). Proteolytically inactive variants of these two PAPP-A mutants, PAPP-A(C381A/E483Q) and PAPP-A(C652A/E483Q), were also constructed, using PAPP-A mutant E483Q (1Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as the template. All PCRs were carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), and constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using the QIAprep Spin Kit (Qiagen). At least two independent clones of each construct were used for further analysis. Tissue Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (293tsA1609neo) (28DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C.

Cells were plated onto 6-cm culture dishes, and were transfected 18 h later by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (29Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After another 48 h, the supernatants were harvested, cleared by centrifugation, and replaced by serum-free medium (CD293, Invitrogen) for another 48 h to facilitate Western blotting or purification. All PAPP-A mutants expressed at the level of wild-type PAPP-A, and all pro-MBP mutants, except for pro-MBP(C89S) and pro-MBP(C128S) (4Overgaard M.T. Glerup S. Boldt H.B. Rodacker V. Olsen I.M.

In Vitro Formation of the PAPP-A·pro-MBP Complex—The PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex was formed by mixing culture supernatants from 293T cells transfected separately with PAPP-A or pro-MBP cDNAs. The concentrations of PAPP-A and pro-MBP in the reaction mixtures were 20 and 200 nm, respectively, reflecting physiological concentrations (30Oxvig C. Haaning J. Kristensen L. Wagner J.M. Rubin I.

The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and samples were taken out and frozen at defined time points between 0 and 48 h. In some reactions, defined concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), reduced glutathione (GSH), dithiothreitol, or β-mercaptoethanol were added. Complex formation was visualized by Western blotting, and/or quantitatively monitored by an ELISA specific for the complex (see below). Western Blotting—Visualization of PAPP-A and pro-MBP was done by Western blotting following separation by SDS-PAGE in 3–8% precast Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the protein was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked in 2% skimmed milk powder diluted in 50 mm Tris, 500 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 9.0 (TST). After washing and equilibration in TST, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (mAb 234-2 for PAPP-A or mAb 234-10 for pro-MBP), diluted to 1 μg/ml in TST containing 2% skimmed milk powder, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (P0260, DAKO), diluted in TST containing 2% skimmed milk powder, was done for 0.5 h at room temperature. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences), and images were captured with a KODAK Image Station 1000. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—PAPP-A and pro-MBP concentrations were measured by sandwich ELISAs, in which polyclonal rabbit anti-(PAPP-A·pro-MBP) (31Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L.

In the latter assay, sample dilution and washing after sample incubation were carried out using PBST to which 800 mm sodium chloride was added, to avoid noncovalent association. The amount of complex formed was expressed as a percentage of the amount of complex formed upon completion of the reaction (100%). Dilution series of the PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex purified from pregnancy serum (31Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys.

Measurement of IGFBP-4 Proteolytic Activity—The IGFBP-4 proteolytic activity of PAPP-A-containing samples was measured as described (3Laursen L.S. Overgaard M.T. Soe R. Boldt H.B. Sottrup-Jensen L.

In brief, PAPP-A (0.6 nm, 0.12 μg/ml, corresponding to a ∼30-fold dilution of the sample), 125I-labeled IGFBP-4 (10 nm, 0.30 μg/ml), and IGF-II (50 nm, 0.35 μg/ml) (DSL) in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm calcium chloride, pH 7.5 were incubated at 37 °C. Samples of the reaction mixtures were taken out at time points from 0 to 30 min and separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (10–20% Trisglycine gels). The degree of cleavage was assessed by measuring band intensities with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and plotted as a function of time after subtraction of background (3Laursen L.S.

Culture supernatant with pH adjusted to 8.0 by the addition of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0 was incubated with 2 mm NTCB for 30 min at 37 °C. N-Ethylmaleimide was then added to the mixture to a final concentration of 20 mm, the pH was raised to 9.0 by the addition of 3 m Tris, pH 9.0, and the sample was incubated for 16 h at room temperature.

Thermolytic peptides were separated by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a 4 × 250 mm column packed with Nucleosil C18 100–5 (Macherey-Nagel). Gradients were formed from 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 90% (v/v) acetonitrile (solvent B), increasing the amount of solvent B to 90% over 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was operated at 50 °C, the eluate was monitored at 218 nm, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. One peptide was further digested with trypsin (1 h at 37 °C, 1:25 (w/w)) prior to mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry and N-terminal Sequence Analysis—Mass spectra were acquired with a Voyager-DE PRO matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) instrument (Applied Biosystems). Samples were prepared by co-crystallization of the peptide analytes with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma), and of intact pro-MBP with sinapinic acid (Sigma). The masses of reduced peptides were acquired by on-target reduction using dithiothreitol. Spectra were obtained by averaging 50–100 single shot spectra and were externally calibrated. Edman degradation was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with an on-line HPLC. For sample loading, isolated peptides or protein (50–200 pmol) were pipetted onto Polybrene-coated glass filters. Reductant, but Not Oxidant Promotes Covalent Complex Formation—To understand the process of PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex formation, we first analyzed the ability of reducing and oxidizing agents to influence the reaction. Culture supernatants from human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected separately with PAPP-A and pro-MBP cDNAs, were mixed to final PAPP-A and pro-MBP concentrations of 20 and 200 nm, respectively, reflecting physiological concentrations (30Oxvig C.

Under these conditions, about 10% of PAPP-A is found covalently complexed to pro-MBP after 1 h of incubation, while close to 100% is complexed after 48 h (4Overgaard M.T. Glerup S. Boldt H.B.

The status of complex formation after 1 h of incubation was analyzed by Western blotting with a PAPP-A-specific antibody following non-reducing SDS-PAGE: The addition of H2O2 (100 μm) to the mixture did not promote complex formation (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). However, the addition of reduced glutathione (GSH) (100 μm) caused a large fraction of PAPP-A to migrate in two discrete bands at 450 and 500 kDa, indicating the presence of both 2:1 and 2:2 PAPP-A·pro-MBP complexes (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Incubation of PAPP-A alone in the presence of GSH did not cause a shift in its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1A, lane 4). This interpretation was confirmed by analyzing the same samples with a pro-MBP specific antibody, showing that PAPP-A and pro-MBP comigrated after 1 h of incubation in the presence of GSH (Fig. 1B). Similar experiments were carried out at different concentrations of reductant or oxidant, and the amount of PAPP-A·pro-MBP complex formed after 1 h was measured quantitatively using an ELISA specific for the complex (Fig. 1C). Incubation of PAPP-A and pro-MBP in the presence of 10 μm GSH caused a 4-fold increase in the amount of complex formed, and incubation with 100 μm GSH led to an 8-fold in"

Kd values for Ca2+ vary from the millimolar to nanomolar range; however the molecular basis for this variation is poorly understood. We have measured Kd values for six fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains, each preceded by a transforming growth factor β-binding protein-like (TB) domain. Using NMR and titration with chromophoric chelators, we found that Kd values varied by five orders of magnitude. Interdomain hydrophobic contacts between TB-cbEGF domains were studied by site-directed mutagenesis and could be correlated directly with Ca2+ affinity. Furthermore, in TB-cbEGF pairs that displayed high-affinity binding, NMR studies showed that TB-cbEGF interface formation was strongly Ca2+-dependent. We suggest that Ca2+ affinity is a measure of interface formation in both homologous and heterologous cbEGF domain pairs, thus providing a measure of flexibility in proteins with multiple cbEGF domains. These data highlight the versatile role of the cbEGF domain in fine tuning the regional flexibility of proteins and provide new constraints for the organization of fibrillin-1 within 10-12-nm microfibrils of the extracellular matrix.

Many of these proteins, and particularly those found in the extracellular matrix, are required to withstand biomechanical forces and are involved in extensive protein-protein interactions. One of these proteins, fibrillin-1, is a 350-kDa Ca2+-binding glycoprotein that constitutes the major structural component of the 10–12-nm microfibrils of the extracellular matrix (1.Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). It has a highly modular domain organization dominated by 43 cbEGF domains and seven transforming growth factor β-binding protein-like (TB) domains (see Fig. 1b). Other domains include four non-Ca2+-binding epidermal growth factor domains, two hybrid domains, unique N and C termini, and a proline-rich sequence (2.Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R.

Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene result in Marfan syndrome and related disorders (3.Dietz H.C. Cutting G.R. Pyeritz R.E. Maslen C.L. Sakai L.Y. Corson G.M. Puffenberger E.G. Hamosh A.

Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the exact arrangement of fibrillin molecules in the microfibrils is unknown, current models based on structural and antibody localization data suggest that fibrillin forms either staggered parallel arrays of extended molecules (6.Handford P.A. Downing A.K. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or that fibrillin monomers are folded so that each monomer spans one interbead distance (7.Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U.

Fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains occur in multiple tandem repeats, usually separated by a TB domain. The solution structures of cbEGF domain pairs (8.Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M.

Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ca2+ also plays a role in protecting fibrillin-1 from digestion by proteases (12.Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and a large proportion of the mutations in fibrillin-1 associated with Marfan syndrome affect the folding or Ca2+-binding properties of the cbEGF domains (13.Collod-Beroud G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), potentially affecting the integrity and assembly of the microfibrils. Dissociation constants for Ca2+ binding to isolated fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains and cbEGF-cbEGF domain pairs have previously been determined using NMR by following the chemical shift changes of a highly conserved aromatic residue that forms part of the Ca2+-binding consensus sequence (14.Handford P.

Other techniques used to measure dissociation constants of fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains have included fluorimetry (15.Smallridge R.S. Whiteman P. Doering K. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. J. Mol.

Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to 0.3 μm (in the case of cbEGF31 in the cbEGF29–31 triple domain fragment) (20.Suk J.Y. Jensen S. McGettrick A.

Variation in Ca2+ affinity has also been suggested in TB-cbEGF domain pairs. Kettle et al. (21.Kettle S. Yuan X. Grundy G. Knott V. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) show that the TB6-cbEGF32 pair bound Ca2+ with low affinity (Kd = 1.6 mm). In contrast, Reinhardt et al. (16.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bachinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) show that the cbEGFs in the triple domain fragment cbEGF22-TB4-cbEGF23 bound Ca2+ with an average dissociation constant of 400 μm. However, as in the equilibrium dialysis work of Glanville et al. (17.Glanville R.W. Qian R.Q. McClure D.W. Maslen C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26630-26634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no domain-specific measurements of affinity have been derived. The recent x-ray crystal structure of the cbEGF22-TB4-cbEGF23 fragment of fibrillin-1 shows an extensive interface between the TB4 and cbEGF23 domains and suggests that the cbEGF23 domain may have a very high Ca2+ affinity in this context (22.Lee S.S. Knott V. Jovanovic J. Harlos K. Grimes J.M. Choulier L. Mardon H.J. Stuart D.I. Handford P.A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Variations in Ca2+ affinity across the fibrillin molecule are likely to be biologically significant. At physiological concentrations of free Ca2+ (∼1.0–1.2 mm in the extracellular matrix), moderate- to high-affinity domains (Kd values <100 μm) would be close to saturation and could indicate regions that need to be rigid for appropriate function. In contrast, low-affinity sites, such as the TB6-cbEGF32 junction, would only be partially saturated in vivo and may contribute to the extensibility and elasticity of the microfibrils (21.Kettle S. Yuan X. Grundy G. Knott V. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23.Yuan X. Werner J.M. Lack J. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the folded model of fibrillin organization in the microfibrils (7.Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), bends are postulated to form at the junction of domains TB3 and cbEGF11 and at the junction of domains TB7 and cbEGF37. At present, however, no high-resolution data on these regions are available to confirm the presence of such bends. To examine the variations in Ca2+ affinity across different regions of fibrillin-1, recombinant peptides corresponding to all six TB-cbEGF domain pairs were studied. Ca2+ dissociation constants were determined using chromophoric chelators and NMR spectroscopy. Most of the domain pairs were found to bind Ca2+ more tightly than previously observed for fibrillin-1 cbEGF domains, with Kd values as low as 16 ± 1 nm in the case of the TB4-cbEGF23 pair. Only the TB6-cbEGF32 junction, which had a low Ca2+ affinity, was likely to be flexible in vivo. “Domain-swapped” constructs, recombining domains from weak- and high-affinity TB-cbEGF pairs, were used to show that interdomain interactions at the TB-cbEGF interface have a significant effect on the observed Ca2+ affinity of these domain pairs. Site-directed mutants were used to map precisely regions involved in interdomain interactions. Two-dimensional NMR studies of high Ca2+-affinity fragments in the presence and absence of Ca2+ showed that Ca2+ stabilizes the interdomain interface. The significance of the variation in these Kd values and of TB-cbEGF interdomain interactions for recent models of microfibril organization, and the role of cbEGF domains in general, is discussed here. Production of Recombinant Fibrillin-1 TB-cbEGF Constructs—All TB-cbEGF domain pairs were expressed as His6-tagged fusions in Escherichia coli. The protein was refolded in vitro and the His6 tag removed by enzymatic cleavage as described previously (19.Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The construction of peptides TB4-cbEGF23 and TB6-cbEGF32, corresponding to residues 1527–1647 and 2054–2165, respectively, has been described previously (21.Kettle S. Yuan X. Grundy G. Knott V.

Handford P.A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Constructs TB2-cbEGF7 (residues 653–764), TB3-cbEGF11 (residues 952–1069), TB5-cbEGF25 (residues 1688–1807), and TB7-cbEGF37 (residues 2332–2443) were amplified from fibrillin-1 cDNA using Pfu polymerase and expressed from the vector pQE-30 as described previously (19.Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). No TB1-containing construct was made, as the fibrillin-1 TB1 domain does not appear in a TB-cbEGF context (see Fig. 1b). The domain-swapped construct TB4-cbEGF32 was produced by amplifying regions corresponding to domains TB4 (residues 1527–1605) and cbEGF32 (residues 2127–2165) separately from fibrillin-1 cDNA. Overlapping sequences introduced by primers for the 3′ end of the TB4 sequence and the 5′ end of the cbEGF32 sequence facilitated the ligation of gel-purified TB4 and cbEGF32 DNA fragments in a separate PCR, using primers for the TB4 forward and cbEGF32 reverse amplifications. Residues of all constructs were numbered according to the published sequence of fibrillin-1 (2.Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of all purified fragments were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. NMR spectra of all TB-cbEGF pairs also showed features consistent with a correctly folded protein, including upfield-shifted methyl resonances from residues positioned near aromatic residues in the TB domains and downfield-shifted Hα resonances consistent with the presence of an anti-parallel β-sheet. The correct folding of cbEGF domains was confirmed by the demonstration of Ca2+ binding. Ca2+ Chelator Competition Assays—Ca2+ dissociation constants of some of the TB-cbEGF domain pairs were determined by competition with chromophoric Ca2+ chelators, as described previously (24.Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize background levels of Ca2+ in protein solutions, all proteins were treated with 5 mm EDTA prior to purification by high pressure liquid chromatography. Ca2+-free solutions of proteins in Ca2+-free buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) were titrated with Ca2+ stock buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) in the presence of the chromophoric chelators 5,5′-Br2BAPTA or Quin-2. All titrations were performed with 20–30 μm chelator and 20–30 μm protein at 23 ± 2 °C using a Shimadzu UV mini 1240 spectrophotometer to monitor absorbance at 263 nm; at this wavelength the absorbance of the chelators is Ca2+-dependent. Background Ca2+ levels in the protein-containing samples were determined by extrapolating the initial linear region of each titration curve back to the y-axis. The initial Ca2+ concentration of each curve was adjusted so that the y-intercept was equivalent to that of a “chelator-only” control. Kd values for 5,5′-Br2BAPTA and Quin-2 were determined independently from chelator-only control experiments; Kd values of 1.6 μm for 5,5′-Br2BAPTA and 0.35 μm for Quin-2 were obtained. Free Ca2+ concentration at each titration point was calculated by the Newton-Raphson method, and dissociation constants were calculated by least squares fitting to the data, as described previously using in-house software (24.Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Stenberg Y. Linse S. Drakenberg T. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23255-23260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Errors in the measured Kd values were estimated from at least three repeats of each assay. The different shapes of the titration curves of protein with Ca2+, shown in Figs. 2, 3a, and 5, reflect the different degrees of competition for added Ca2+ between the protein and chelator. Protein samples with a high affinity for Ca2+ relative to the chelator show an initial lag in the decrease of absorbance versus Ca2+, because the protein binds most of the added Ca2+ (see Fig. 2, b–d). Protein samples with a low Ca2+ affinity, closer to that of the chelator, show a decrease in absorbance at low Ca2+ concentration, because both protein and chelator bind the added Ca2+ (see Figs. 2a, 3a, and 5b).Fig. 3Measurement of Ca2+-binding in TB3-cbEGF11. a, titration of 27.8 μm 5,5′-Br2BAPTA with 51.0 μm TB3-cbEGF11.

Data were processed using Felix 2.3 (Accelrys). Standard regression analysis was used to fit curves to the Ca2+ titration data using the equation Δ = Δ0 [Ca2+]free/(Kd + [Ca2+]free) as described previously (14.Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z.H.

Prediction of Chemical Shifts and NOEs—Chemical shift values for the aromatic residues of the TB4 and cbEGF23 domains were predicted using the program “total” obtained from Prof. M. P.

This program calculates the ring current shift contributions to 1H chemical shifts arising from the close contact (<∼10 Å) of the aromatic rings of Tyr, Phe, Trp, and His residues. Chemical shifts for the TB4 and cbEGF23 domains in the absence of Ca2+, where no interdomain interactions are predicted, were calculated using the x-ray coordinates for the isolated TB4 and cbEGF23 domains extracted from the cbEGF22-TB4-cbEGF23 Protein Data Bank file (22.Lee S.S.

Chemical shifts for TB4 and cbEGF23 domains in the presence of Ca2+, where extensive interdomain interactions are predicted, were calculated using a combined coordinate set containing both the TB4 and cbEGF23 domains and, therefore, included interdomain ring current shift effects. Chemical shifts for Phe-2146, the Phe introduced into the cbEGF32 domain, are assumed to be the same as those of Phe-1626, the homologous residue in cbEGF23. NOEs expected between the TB4 and cbEGF23 domains as a result of the interdomain interface were predicted using the x-ray coordinates for cbEGF22-TB4-cbEGF23 (22.Lee S.S. Knott V. Jovanovic J.

Short distances (<7 Å) were calculated from the Protein Data Bank file using in-house software. Fibrillin-1 TB-cbEGF Domain Pairs Exhibit a Wide Range of Ca2+ Affinities—Ca2+ affinities of the TB-cbEGF domain pairs (Fig. 1b) were measured with the chromophoric Ca2+ chelators Quin-2 or 5,5′-Br2BAPTA under physiological conditions of pH (7.5) and ionic strength (I = 0.15). The use of these chelators allows the measurement of Ca2+ dissociation constants ranging from 10 nm to 100 μm under these conditions (25.Stenberg Y. Linse S. Drakenberg T. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23255-23260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When no Ca2+ binding was detected in chelation assays, NMR analysis was used to estimate Kd values. Four of the six TB-cbEGF pairs were found to have relatively low Ca2+ dissociation constants in chelation competition assays (Table I; Fig. 2), indicating high-affinity binding. Kd values ranged from 16 ± 1 nm (in the case of TB4-cbEGF23) to 6.4 ± 0.8 μm (in the case of TB2-cbEGF7). TB6-cbEGF32 showed no competition with the chelators (not shown), consistent with the weak Ca2+ affinity (Kd = 1.6 mm) of this fragment measured previously by NMR (21.Kettle S. Yuan X. Grundy G. Knott V. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TB3-cbEGF11 showed weak competition with Br2BAPTA (Fig. 3a); however, its slow exchange behavior in Ca2+ titrations followed by one-dimensional NMR (Fig. 3b) suggested the presence of a relatively high-affinity site. On the basis of the chelator and NMR data, the Ca2+ dissociation constant of TB3-cbEGF11 was estimated to be <100 μm.Table ICalcium dissociation constants of native TB-cbEGF pairs and linker sequencesProteinMethodKdTB linker sequenceTB2-cbEGF7Chelatora5,5′-Br2BAPTA6.4 ± 0.8 μmCSSGPGMTSAGSTB3-cbEGF11Chelatora5,5′-Br2BAPTA< ∼100 μmCPRGPGFATKEITNGKPFFKTB4-cbEGF23ChelatorbQuin-216 ± 1 nmCPGGEGFRPNPITVILETB5-cbEGF25ChelatorbQuin-2136 ± 7 nmCGSQRPGFVIDIYTGLPVTB6-cbEGF32NMRcResult from Kettle et al.

This was most evident in a comparison of the dissociation constants for TB4-cbEGF23 and TB6-cbEGF32, where the TB4 linker is one residue longer, yet the Kd value for this fragment is ∼105-fold lower than that for TB6-cbEGF32. TB-cbEGF Interfacial Residues Affect Ca2+ Affinity—The role of interactions between the TB and cbEGF domains in the binding of Ca2+ was examined by engineering the domain-swapped construct TB4-cbEGF32, in which the high Ca2+-affinity cbEGF23 domain in TB4-cbEGF23 was replaced with the low Ca2+-affinity cbEGF32 domain. The linker region at the end of the TB domain was preserved (Fig. 4a). No measurable binding of Ca2+ in chelation competition assays was observed (not shown). Ca2+ binding to the TB4-cbEGF32 construct was therefore monitored by NMR spectroscopy. The chemical shift of the Tyr-2149 Hδ* resonance, corresponding to a conserved aromatic residue in domain cbEGF32 previously used to measure Ca2+ binding (14.Handford P. Downing A.K. Rao Z.H.

Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was measured against increasing [Ca2+]free (Fig. 5a). Fitting of these data gave a Kd value of 2.1 mm, which is comparable with the value of 1.6 mm previously measured for the TB6-cbEGF32 pair (21.Kettle S. Yuan X. Grundy G. Knott V. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The substitution of TB6 with TB4 at the N terminus of cbEGF32 therefore has little effect on the ability of cbEGF32 to bind Ca2+. To investigate further the effect of TB-cbEGF interdomain interactions on Ca2+ affinity, a series of site-directed mutants was created in the domain-swapped TB4-cbEGF32 with the aim of re-engineering it with a high Ca2+ affinity similar to that of TB4-cbEGF23. Introduced amino acid changes were based on information from the recent crystal structure of the cbEGF22-TB4-cbEGF23 triple domain fragment, which indicated significant interdomain hydrophobic interactions involving the conserved “XG” interdomain packing site and the “loop 1” region of the cbEGF domain (22.Lee S.S. Knott V. Jovanovic J. Harlos K. Grimes J.M. Choulier L. Mardon H.J. Stuart D.I. Handford P.A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a and Fig. 4). The crystal structure showed that packing of the XG site of cbEGF23 with the TB4 domain would bring Phe-1626 of cbEGF23 into contact with Phe-1595 of the TB4 domain (Fig. 4b). In the domain-swapped construct TB4-cbEGF32, the residue in the position corresponding to Phe-1626 of cbEGF23 is the acidic Asp-2146 of cbEGF32 (Fig. 4a), which would interact less favorably with Phe-1595 of TB4. Therefore, Asp-2146 was replaced with a Phe residue in TB4-cbEGF32DF. The crystal structure also showed that the loop 1 region of cbEGF23 packs against a hydrophobic region of domain TB"

We have previously identified the region of the HET-s protein involved in amyloid formation and prion propagation. Herein, we show that a recombinant peptide corresponding to the C-terminal prion-forming domain of HET-s (residues 218–289) displays infectivity. We used high resolution hydrogen/deuterium exchange analyzed by mass spectrometry to gain insight into the structural organization of this infectious amyloid form of the HET-s-(218–289) protein. Deuterium incorporation was analyzed by ion trap mass spectrometry for 76 peptides generated by pepsin proteolysis of HET-s-(218–289). By taking into account sequence overlaps in these peptides, a resolution ranging from 4-amino acids stretches to a single residue could be achieved. This approach allowed us to define highly protected regions alternating with more accessible segments along the HET-s-(218–289) sequence. The HET-s-(218–289) fibrils are thus likely to be organized as a succession of β-sheet segments interrupted by short turns or short loops.

The HET-s-(218–289) fibrils are thus likely to be organized as a succession of β-sheet segments interrupted by short turns or short loops. Amyloids are fibrillar protein aggregates composed of a “cross-β” structure in which β-strands are oriented perpendicular to the fiber axis. This type of protein aggregate is associated not only with prion diseases but with a variety of protein deposition diseases including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease (1.Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar). Resolution of the structure of amyloid assemblies is of foremost importance from both a fundamental and a biomedical point of view. As a consequence, much effort has been devoted to the acquisition of structural information on a number of amyloid proteins using a variety of methods including proline scanning mutagenesis (2.Williams A.D.

Various experimental approaches used for structural analysis of amyloid fibrils have been presented in a recent review by Tycko (11.Tycko R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Among the amyloidogenic proteins, prion proteins possess the unique ability to replicate the amyloid conformation and thus display an infectious character. In mammals, prions are infectious proteinaceous particles that cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases termed spongiform encephalopathies (12.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Mammalian prions correspond to an altered form of a cellular protein termed PrP that is converted to a protease-resistant aggregated form in diseased individuals. Proteins capable of propagating an altered conformational state have also been identified in eukaryotic microorganisms (13.Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The best characterized prion models are the yeast Ure2p and Sup35p proteins and the HET-s protein from the fungus Podospora anserina (14.Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Roberts B.T. Baxa U. Pierce M.M. Ross E.D. Brachmann A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 470-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All of these proteins form amyloid fibrils in vitro (15.Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C.

It is essential to gain insight into the structure of prion proteins in their infectious conformation to elucidate the details of prion replication and also to determine whether specific structural features are associated with the infectious character. The HET-s prion protein of P. anserina is involved in a genetically programmed cell death reaction termed heterokaryon incompatibility. This cell death reaction is triggered when the prion form of HET-s interacts with a natural variant of HET-s, designated HET-S, which differs from HET-s by 13 residues and is devoid of prion behavior (19.Coustou V. Deleu C. Saupe S. Begueret J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). HET-s aggregates specifically in vivo upon transition to the prion state (20.Coustou-Linares V. Maddelein M.L. Begueret J. Saupe S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant HET-s forms typical amyloid fibrils in vitro (18.Dos Reis S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Lascu I. Begueret J. Saupe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5703-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We were able to show that introduction of amyloid aggregates of recombinant HET-s into P. anserina cells induces the [Het-s] prion with a very high efficiency (21.Maddelein M.L. Dos Reis S. Duvezin-Caubet S. Coulary-Salin B. Saupe S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7402-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Hence, the amyloids generated in vitro represent infectious material that can propagate the [Het-s] prion. The HET-s protein is 289 amino acids in length and is composed of two distinct domains: an N-terminal globular domain spanning approximately residues 1 to 230 and a flexible domain spanning approximately residues 230 to 289 (22.Balguerie A. Dos Reis S. Ritter C. Chaignepain S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Bathany K. Lascu I. Schmitter J.M. Riek R. Saupe S.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2071-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the amyloid form of HET-s, the C-terminal domain of HET-s forms the protease-resistant amyloid core of the fibril, whereas the N-terminal domain remains accessible to proteolysis. The C-terminal domain of HET-s (residues 218–289) is sufficient for [Het-s] propagation in vivo and amyloid formation in vitro (22.Balguerie A. Dos Reis S. Ritter C. Chaignepain S. Coulary-Salin B.

This technique exploits the ability of mass spectrometry to determine the incorporation of deuterium atoms in proteins following a reaction of exchange with labile hydrogens located at backbone amide positions. Isotope exchange rates for amide hydrogens depend primarily on intramolecular hydrogen bonding and access to the solvent. This exchange rate depends also on the pH and the temperature of the exchange reaction. Protein dynamics can be studied by hydrogen exchange and depend on the unfolding and refolding rate constants of the protein (28.Englander S.W. Mayne L. Bai Y. Sosnick T.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 29.Raschke T.M. Marqusee S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For a detailed characterization of solvent accessibility in specific regions, the protein can be submitted to proteolysis after the exchange reaction (30.Zhang Z. Smith D.L.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8852-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been shown that amide protons in core regions of amyloid aggregates are highly resistant to hydrogen exchange (4.Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 6.Kheterpal I. Zhou S. Cook K.D. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

H/D exchange can thus be used to estimate the number of backbone amides involved in a highly hydrogen-bonded state. Kheterpal et al. (36.Kheterpal I. Wetzel R. Cook K.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have reported H/D exchange data for Aβ1–40 fibrils, showing that 48–55% of backbone amide protons are highly protected from exchange. H/D exchange can also be used to distinguish highly hydrogen-bonded peptide segments from regions that are not involved in stable secondary structure elements. Highly protected regions are generally interpreted as representing β-sheet core elements, whereas regions of higher exchange are interpreted as disordered or loop segments. Our previous analysis by hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry has revealed that the prion-forming domain of full-length HET-s protein is highly protected from hydrogen exchange in the amyloid form (35.Nazabal A. Dos Reis S. Bonneu M. Saupe S.J. Schmitter J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8852-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Herein we have verified by means of a biolistic procedure that the amyloid form of the recombinant HET-s-(218–289) peptide can induce the [Het-s] prion when introduced in vivo. We then used HXMS at high resolution to gain structural information on the infectious amyloid form of this peptide. HET-s-(218–289) Purification and Amyloid Formation—The histidine-tagged HET-s-(218–289) peptide was expressed and purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions as described previously (22.Balguerie A. Dos Reis S. Ritter C. Chaignepain S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Bathany K. Lascu I. Schmitter J.M. Riek R. Saupe S.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2071-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To eliminate urea, the peptide was then submitted to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column using 175 mm acetic acid as an eluent. Protein concentration was adjusted to 125 μm. To initiate the spontaneous amyloid aggregation of HET-s-(218–289), pH was brought to 8 by the addition of Tris base. Amyloid formation was monitored by thioflavin T binding and by electron microscopy as described previously (22.Balguerie A. Dos Reis S. Ritter C. Chaignepain S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Bathany K. Lascu I. Schmitter J.M. Riek R. Saupe S.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2071-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). After amyloid aggregation, aggregates were recovered by centrifugation (20 min at 12,000 × g), and aggregates were resuspended in H2O. Biological Ballistic Infectivity Assay—The biolistic infectivity assay was performed as described previously (21.Maddelein M.L. Dos Reis S. Duvezin-Caubet S. Coulary-Salin B. Saupe S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7402-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Strains of the het-s genotype expressing the HET-s protein in its non-prion form (designated [Het-s*]) were grown for 2 days at 26 °C on solid medium. Four strains were grown per Petri dish. 10 μg of HET-S-(218–289) or full-length HET-s protein was overlaid onto each [Het-s*] mycelium in a final volume of 100 μl of 180 mm Tris base, 175 mm acetic acid, pH 8. After evaporation of the buffer, plates were bombarded with 2 mg of tungsten particles (0.4 μm) in a Bio-Rad PDS-1000/helium system using 1100 p.s.i. rupture disks. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 26 °C, and two mycelial fragments were sampled from each strain confronted with a het-S tester strain. In this assay, strains that retained the prion-free [Het-s*] phenotype present a normal contact line with the het-S tester, whereas strains that acquired the [Het-s] prion phenotype present an abnormal contact line designated “barrage” and resulting from the incompatibility cell death reaction. If at least one of the two subcultures produced a barrage reaction with the het-S tester, the strain was scored as positive for the [Het-s] prion phenotype. Kinetics Study of Deuterium Incorporation in HET-s-(218–289)—A 1-ml suspension of aggregated HET-s-(218–289) at 90 μm, in Ultrapure milli-Q H2O (H2O MQ) was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of H2O MQ. A 5-μl aliquot (90 μm) of the aggregated solution was diluted at 1:20 in H2O. After an incubation time from 5 min to 12 h, 5 μl of the labeled protein was submitted to a C4 ZipTip. The elution fraction (3 μl, 5:5:1 of H2O/acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was loaded into a nanospray needle (PicoTip emitters, standard coating, New Objective, Woburn, MA) prior to ion trap mass analysis. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting of Aggregated HET-s-(218–289) Prion Protein—Aggregated HET-s-(218–289) (1 ml, 90 μm, H2O MQ) was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of H2O MQ. A 5-μl aliquot (90 μm) of the aggregated solution was diluted 1:20 in H2O. A 5-μl aliquot of the solution was treated under strong agitation in 4 m urea with immobilized pepsin (10 μl, 45 units) at pH 2.2 and 0 °C for 5 min. Digestion was followed by a short centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30s), and a 10-μl aliquot of the supernatant containing the HET-s digest was submitted to nanospray LC-MS/MS analysis. HET-s-(218–289) peptides were analyzed with an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DECA XP, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) interfaced to a Dionex-LC Packing chromatographic system (C18 column, 75 μm ID, 150 mm long). After analysis, the TurboSequest program was used to assign peptide sequences from their fragment ions. Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange on HET-s-(218–289) Amyloid Fibrils—Aggregated HET-s-(218–289) (1 ml, 90 μm, H2O MQ) was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of H2O MQ. A 5-μl aliquot (90 μm) of the aggregated solution was diluted 1:20 in D2O and vortexed before incubation at 25 °C, pH 7, for variable times (between 5 min and 12 h). After incubation, 5 μl of the labeled solution was treated under strong agitation in 4 m urea with immobilized pepsin (5 min, 10 μl, 45 units) at pH 2.2 and 0 °C (exchange quenching conditions). Digestion was followed by a short centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 s), and a 10-μl aliquot of the supernatant containing the HET-s digest was separated into three fractions by stepwise gradient elution from a C18 ZipTip. The three fractions were eluted with 2 μl of a solution containing 9:1:1; 8:2:1, and 6:4:1 of H2O/acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, respectively. Each elution fraction was loaded into a nanospray needle (PicoTip emitters, standard coating) prior to mass analysis. The time from sample loading to data collection was kept constant for each sample analysis. Mass value given in the text for exchange experiments correspond to m/z of the centroid of the envelope of a pseudo-molecular ion cluster. In- and Back-exchange Controls—For back-exchange control, a pepsin digest of HET-s-(218–289) was diluted 19:1 in D2O and incubated for 12 h at 25 °C, pH 7, to achieve complete exchange of backbone amide protons for deuterium atoms. After incubation, the exchange was quenched at 0 °C by the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce). After quenching, the peptide mixture was loaded on a C18 ZipTip (Millipore). The peptide fraction eluted from the ZipTip (the eluent was a solution containing 6:4:1 acetonitrile/H2O MQ with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid kept at 0 °C) was directly loaded into a nanospray needle (PicoTip) before mass analysis. The relative back-exchange (%) was determined for each peptide by comparing the maximal number of exchanged amide hydrogen atoms and the corresponding experimental value. For in-exchange control, a pepsin digest was diluted 19:1 in the quenched solution (H2O MQ, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0 °C). The peptide mixture was loaded on a C18 ZipTip and eluted with a solution containing 6:4:1 acetonitrile/D2O with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid kept at 0 °C. The incorporation of deuterium for in-exchange was determined in the same way as the back exchange control. MS Measurements—For MS experiments on the LCQ ion trap instrument, the samples were loaded in the source by mean of PicoTip needles (PicoTip Emitters, standard coating). The capillary temperature was set to 140 °C. The spray voltage was set to 0.90–1.40 kV. Microscopy—A fraction of the protein suspension (30 μm) used for exchange experiments on amyloid fibers was put onto a 400 mesh copper electron microscopy grid-coated with a plastic film (Formvar). To avoid rapid desiccation, sedimentation was allowed during 10 to 30 min in a moist Petri dish. Grids were then rinsed with 15–20 drops of freshly prepared 2% uranyl acetate in water (passed over 0.22-μm Millipore filters), dried with filter paper, and observed with a Phillips Tecnai 12 Biowin electron microscope at 80 kV. Data Analysis—Mass spectra were base line-corrected, and the number of deuterium atoms incorporated in a given peptide was determined from the centroid value of its isotopic peak cluster using the formula given in Equation 1 (37.Liu Y. Smith D.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). D(t)=m(t)−m(0)m(100)−m(0)×N (Eq. 1) Where m(t) is the observed centroid mass of the peptide at incubation time point t, m(0) is the observed mass at time point 0 (for unlabeled peptides, see in-exchange control procedure), m(100) is the observed mass for a fully exchanged peptide (see back-exchange control procedure), and N is the total number of peptide exchangeable amide protons in the peptide. The percentage of deuterium incorporation is calculated in Equation 2 for each peptides of the peptide mass fingerprint. %Deuterium incorporation=D(t)/N (Eq. 2) Amyloids of HET-s-(218–289) Are Infectious—The proteinase K-resistant amyloid core of HET-s amyloids corresponds to the region spanning residue 218–289 (22.Balguerie A. Dos Reis S. Ritter C. Chaignepain S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Bathany K. Lascu I. Schmitter J.M. Riek R. Saupe S.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2071-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 38.Balguerie A. Dos Reis S. Coulary-Salin B. Chaignepain S. Sabourin M. Schmitter J.M. Saupe S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2599-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that HET-s fibrils submitted to proteinase K digestion retain infectivity (21.Maddelein M.L. Dos Reis S. Duvezin-Caubet S. Coulary-Salin B. Saupe S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7402-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Together these experiments suggest that HET-s-(218–289) amyloids generated in vitro should be infectious. It however remained possible that infectivity of the proteinase K digested HET-s amyloids could be due to an undigested contaminating fraction of full-length protein or else that the HET-s-(218–289) domain adopts a different structure in full-length HET-s amyloid as in amyloids formed from the HET-s-(218–289) peptide. To directly ascertain that amyloid aggregates of HET-s-(218–289) display an infectious character, we introduced such aggregates into living cells using the previously used biolistic assay. The HET-s-(218–289) peptide was incubated for 5 h at 125 μm at pH 8. Aggregates were recovered by centrifugation. As previously shown under these conditions, HET-s-(218–289) formed typical amyloid aggregates. By electron microscopy, HET-s-(218–289) amyloids appeared as unbranched fibrils of about 5 nm in width (Fig. 1). HET-s-(218–289) amyloids were then overlaid on the surface of a mycelium of a wild-type [Het-s*] (prion-free) strain grown on solid medium. Mycelia were then bombarded under vacuum with tungsten particles as described previously (21.Maddelein M.L. Dos Reis S. Duvezin-Caubet S. Coulary-Salin B. Saupe S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7402-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to introduce the recombinant peptide into the fungal cells. 48 h after bombardment, the strains were tested for the presence of the [Het-s] prion in incompatibility tests (Fig. 2). Of the 88 [Het-s*] mycelia that were bombarded in the presence of HET-s-(218–289) amyloids, 87 had acquired the [Het-s] prion. In the control experiment with full-length HET-s fibers, 64 of 64 bombarded [Het-s*] mycelia acquired [Het-s]. With buffer alone, all 32 tested mycelia maintained the [Het-s*] non-prion state. We conclude from this experiment that, as shown previously for the full-length HET-s protein, amyloid aggregates of the recombinant HET-s-(218–289) peptide are infectious.Fig. 2Biolistic introduction of the HET-s-(218–289) peptide in Podospora induces the [Het-s] prion. [Het-s*] strains have been overlaid with either buffer alone (control), full-length HET-s fibers, or HET-s-(218–289) fibers, bombarded with tungsten particles, and tested for the presence of the [Het-s] prion by confronting the strains with het-S tester strains. Formation of a dark line in the confrontation zone indicates that the strain has acquired the [Het-s] prion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetics Study of Deuterium Incorporation in HET-s-(218–289) Amyloid Aggregates—H/D exchange was allowed to occur on HET-s-(218–289) amyloid aggregates for variable times from 5 min to 12 h. The deuterium content was found to increase rapidly during the first 60 min of incubation in the deuterium solvent (Fig. 3). Incorporation reached 38 deuterium atoms after 12 h, which corresponds to 48% of the total exchangeable hydrogens of the protein. Thus, after a 12-h incubation time in D2O, half of the exchangeable hydrogen atoms of HET-s-(218–289) are still protected in the amyloid aggregate. Because no significant difference was found for the incorporation of deuterium after 7 h of incubation time (36 deuterium atoms incorporated, 45% exchange rate), we chose to study the solvent accessibility of aggregated HET-s protein after this incubation time. This observation indicates that a majority of the residues are highly protected from exchange, thus confirming the results already obtained with the full-length HET-s protein (35.Nazabal A. Dos Reis S. Bonneu M. Saupe S.J. Schmitter J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8852-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results correlate well with those obtained by Kheterpal et al. (36.Kheterpal I. Wetzel R. Cook K.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for Aβ1–40 fibrils; in their study, after 100 h of incubation time in D2O, 48–55% of backbone amide protons were highly protected from exchange. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting of HET-s-(218–289)—The proteolysis of HET-s-(218–289) by immobilized pepsin generates a large number of peptides. After on-line LC-MS/MS analysis, 104 peptides could be assigned to their sequence. These peptides cover the sequence of the HET-s-(218–289) protein completely. However, to avoid a possible back-exchange caused by the chromatographic process, HXMS experiments were preferably conducted in the off-line nanospray mode. Thus, to find optimal analytical conditions, the pepsin digest was separated by micro-chromatography with a three-step gradient on a C18 ZipTip. In this way, 88 peptides of the 104 peptides assigned by on-line LC-MS/MS could be found in the three fractions (Fig. 4). Finally, 76 peptides yielded a separation of isotopic clusters sufficient for HXMS experiments, in order to determine the deuterium incorporation in HET-s-(218–289) aggregates. Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange on the Amyloid Form of the HET-s-(218–289) Protein—Aggregates of HET-s-(218–289) were obtained as described previously, and amyloid formation was monitored by electron microscopy (Fig. 1). Aggregates were then incubated for 7 h in the presence of deuterium. Three different experiments have been performed to determine the incorporation of deuterium atoms in aggregated HET-s-(218–289) after this 7-h incubation. For in- and back-exchange experiments, the incorporation of deuterium atoms was found homogeneous for all peptides. In the back-exchange control, after overnight incubation of the pepsin digest, the level of deuterium incorporation for each peptide reached (84 ± 4)%. In the in-exchange control, the level of deuterium incorporation for each peptide under exchange quenching conditions reached (12 ± 3)%. The deuterium incorporation along the HET-s-(218–289) sequence was found to be very heterogeneous. Individual peptides exchange levels were found as low as 10% (HET-s-(275–282)) or as high as 52% (HET-s-(222–224)) (Fig. 5). Globally, deuterium incorporation was higher in peptides corresponding to the N-terminal region of HET-s-(218–289) and lower in C-terminal peptides. Use of Shared Boundaries between Pe"

We found that nitric oxide (NO) inhibits methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity in rodent cell extracts. The inhibition of enzyme activity occurred within minutes and was not prevented by thiols, suggesting that enzyme inhibition was not occurring via NO reaction with cysteine residues to form nitrosothiol groups. Enzyme inhibition was dependent on the presence of substrate, implying that NO was reacting with cobalamin(II) (Cbl(II)) and/or the deoxyadenosyl radical (·CH2-Ado), both of which are generated from the co-factor of the enzyme, 5′-deoxyadenosyl-cobalamin (AdoCbl), on substrate binding. Consistent with this hypothesis was the finding that high micromolar concentrations (≥600 μm) of oxygen also inhibited enzyme activity. To study the mechanism of NO reaction with AdoCbl, we simulated the enzymatic reaction by photolyzing AdoCbl, and found that even at low NO concentrations, NO reacted with both the generated Cbl(II) and ·CH2-Ado indicating that NO could effectively compete with the back formation of AdoCbl. Thus, NO inhibition of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase appeared to be from the reaction of NO with both AdoCbl intermediates (Cbl(II) and ·CH2-Ado) generated during the enzymatic reaction. The inhibition of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase by NO was likely of physiological relevance because a NO donor inhibited enzyme activity in intact cells, and scavenging NO from cells or inhibiting cellular NO synthesis increased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity when measured subsequently in cell extracts.

In mammalian cells only two enzymes are known to require cobalamin (vitamin B12) as a cofactor: methionine synthase, which uses methylcobalamin, and methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase, which uses 5′-deoxyadenosyl-cobalamin (AdoCbl). 1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; Cbl(I) and Cbl(II), cobalamin in the +1 or +2 valency state, respectively; DEA-NONOate, 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide; DETA-NONOate, (Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate; DME medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; l-NAME, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; MEM medium, Eagle's minimal essential medium; NO, nitric oxide; OH-Cbl, hydroxycobalamin; TEMPO, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy.1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; Cbl(I) and Cbl(II), cobalamin in the +1 or +2 valency state, respectively; DEA-NONOate, 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide; DETA-NONOate, (Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate; DME medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; l-NAME, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; MEM medium, Eagle's minimal essential medium; NO, nitric oxide; OH-Cbl, hydroxycobalamin; TEMPO, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy. During the reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase, methylcobalamin is cleaved heterolytically generating cobalamin I (Cbl(I)) and a methyl carbocation, whereas during the reaction catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, AdoCbl is cleaved homolytically generating cobalamin II (Cbl(II)) and a deoxyadenosyl radical (·CH2-Ado) (1Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Banerjee R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2083-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The latter serves to abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate methylmalonyl-CoA, and after intramolecular migration of a thioester moiety, the hydrogen atom is transferred back to generate the product succinyl-CoA. In the final step of the reaction, the deoxyadenosyl radical recombines with Cbl(II) to regenerate AdoCbl (3Banerjee R. Vlasie M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 621-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the homolytic cleavage of AdoCbl occurs essentially only on substrate binding to the enzyme (3Banerjee R. Vlasie M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 621-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by a variety of mammalian cell types, and has a diverse array of cellular and physiological functions including regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and modulation of blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and synaptic plasticity (4Lloyd-Jones D.M.

At pharmacological concentrations, NO reacts with several different chemical groups, but at physiological concentrations, one of its major targets appears to be the iron atom in heme groups, and in particular the iron in heme-containing guanylate cyclase (7Traylor T.G.

We and others have shown that NO does not react with methylcobalamin (9Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B.

The effect of NO on methylmalonyl-CoA mutase has not been studied, and similar to methylcobalamin, NO does not react with AdoCbl (9Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous to the inhibition of NO for methionine synthase, it seemed possible that NO could inhibit mutase activity by binding to the Cbl(II) intermediate, or even to the free deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate because NO reacts readily with free radicals, but the two intermediates are generated only transiently, and their recombination rate back to AdoCbl is very high (18Lott W.B.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12987-12994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the Cbl(II) and deoxyadenosyl radical are generated at the active site, which at least in the case of the bacterial enzyme, is buried at the end of a (βα)8 TIM barrel (20Mancia F. Keep N.H.

Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). AdoCbl is light-sensitive being cleaved into Cbl(II) and the deoxyadenosyl radical, and when AdoCbl is subjected to complete photolysis in the presence of high NO concentrations, the NO reacts with the generated Cbl(II) (9Brouwer M. Chamulitrat W. Ferruzzi G. Sauls D.L. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it does not necessarily follow that at low physiological conditions NO will be able to compete with the back reaction of the deoxyadenosyl radical with Cbl(II). In addition, NO may not be able to penetrate to the active site of the enzyme.We, therefore, sought to determine the effects of NO on methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity, and found that the activity of the mammalian enzyme was inhibited by NO. The mechanism of inhibition appeared to be from NO reacting with Cbl(II) and the deoxyadenosyl radical, rather than with a sulfhydryl group(s). Based on in vivo work with cultured cells, it appeared that NO may be a physiological regulator of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsArginine-deficient Eagle's minimal essential media (MEM) was either from ICN Pharmaceuticals or was made as described previously (22Boss G.R.

AdoCbl and hydroxycobalamin (OH-Cbl) were from Sigma with the AdoCbl protected from light except as indicated.Cell Culture ConditionsBaby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblast-like cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection, and cultured as described previously (25Suhasini M. Li H. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6983-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Measurement of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Activity in VitroBHK cells were incubated for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of OH-Cbl. Parallel cultures were incubated in MEM containing 100 μm arginine and 10% dialyzed FBS. As indicated, cells received 10 nm OH-Cbl with or without 1 mml-NAME. The standard assay for measuring methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity was performed essentially as described by Kikuchi et al. (26Kikuchi M. Hanamizu H. Narisawa K. Tada K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and Riedel et al. (27Riedel B. Ueland P.M. Svardal A.M. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All steps were performed in subdued light, and when possible in complete darkness. Briefly, ∼1 × 106 cells were extracted in 0.1 ml of ice-cold 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, by three 5-s bursts of sonication. Tris-HCl was increased to 100 mm, the extracts centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence and presence of 5 μm AdoCbl (to measure the amount of enzyme in the extracts in the holoenzyme form, and to convert all enzyme to the holoenzyme form, respectively). The extracts were returned to 4 °C, and transferred to either polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes or gas tight glass syringes, both of which were sealed with a tight-fitting rubber septum. The extracts were deoxygenated by passing argon gas over the liquid surface for 15 min with frequent gently shaking of the tubes, and all subsequent additions to the extracts were performed using gas tight syringes. To some of the samples, 1 mm deoxygenated DEA-NONOate was added, and in the standard assay, the reaction was started immediately thereafter by adding deoxygenated methylmalonyl-CoA to a final concentration of 400 μm. Variations on the standard assay included: (i) adding 25 mm deoxygenated β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, or reduced glutathione simultaneous with the DEA-NONOate; (ii) preincubating extracts with DEA-NONOate for 10 min at 37 °C prior to adding AdoCbl or substrate, with half of the samples receiving 1 mm hemoglobin at the time of substrate addition; and (iii) adding 100 mm Tris buffer saturated with pure NO gas or oxygen with the final NO and oxygen concentrations calculated using the solubility of the two gases in aqueous solutions. After adding the methylmalonyl-CoA, samples were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C, with the reaction stopped by adding ice-cold perchloric acid (final concentration, 0.4 n). Acid-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were neutralized using 2.2 m KHCO3. The neutralized samples were injected onto a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column with methylmalonyl-CoA resolved isocratically from succinyl-CoA using 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0, with 12% methanol (26Kikuchi M. Hanamizu H. Narisawa K. Tada K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Riedel B. Ueland P.M. Svardal A.M. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The amounts of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA were determined by comparing the areas of their respective peaks at 254 nm to those of standards. The assay was linear with time from 2 to 15 min, and with protein concentration from 50 to 500 μg. Enzyme activity is expressed as nanomole/min/mg of protein with protein was measured by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar).Reactions of NO with AdoCblQualitative Rate Studies—To 3 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, in a spectrophotometer cuvette was added 85 μl of 3.2 mm AdoCbl yielding a final AdoCbl concentration of 88 μm. The cuvette was sealed with two rubber septums, and after passing ultrahigh purity argon gas through the solution for 30 min, the cuvette was transferred to the closed cell compartment of a Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments) with the lamp light covered. After a 2-h dwell time to allow the solution in the cuvette to equilibrate fully with the temperature in the spectrophotometer compartment, the lamp light was uncovered and allowed to shine on the cell. Absorbance changes were followed at 544 nm for 2 h, at which time 0.1 ml of NO-saturated phosphate buffer was added to the solution under subdued light. The solution was thoroughly mixed and absorbance changes were followed for an additional 2 h. By considering the total volume of the cuvette, the volume of the solution, and the solubility of NO in aqueous systems (1.946 mm at 24 °C), the calculated NO concentration in the solution was ∼6 μm, or ∼1/15th of the AdoCbl concentration.Spectroscopic Studies—Solutions were prepared as described above for the rate studies, but instead of observing absorbance changes as a function of time at a single wavelength, the solutions were scanned over the wavelengths indicated (using the Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer). Complete photolysis of AdoCbl was achieved by exposing cuvettes containing AdoCbl solutions to a 500 watt tungsten lamp for 3 min. In some experiments, photolysis of AdoCbl was conducted in the presence of the indicated concentrations of NO.Mass Spectral Analyses—AdoCbl (750 μm in water) was subjected to photolysis in the absence or presence of NO as described above. The samples were diluted 1:10 (v/v) into 50% water, 40.75% methanol, 0.25% formic acid, and then infused at a rate of 20 μl/min into a Finnegan LCQ mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with an ESI assembly, operating in positive-ion mode (5.0 kV spray voltage) with a 200 °C capillary temperature. Data were acquired in profile mode from m/z 100–2000 with spectra averaged over 1.5 min of continuous acquisition. Results are reported as the m/z of monoisotopic peaks, with all ions of interest present as the +1 charge state.Measurement of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Activity in VivoA standard method for measuring methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity in vivo is to incubate cells with [1-14C]propionic acid, and follow incorporation of radioactivity into acid-precipitable material (29Morrow G. Revsin B. Mathews C. Giles H. Clin. Genet. 1976; 10: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Willard H.F. Ambani L.M. Hart A.C. Mahoney M.J. Rosenberg L.E. Hum. Genet. 1976; 32: 277-283Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Wilkemeyer M. Stankovics J. Foy T. Ledley F.D. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The resulting propionyl-CoA is converted to methylmalonyl-CoA and then to succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. As an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, succinyl-CoA is a precursor to other molecules including amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines. We showed by removing DNA and RNA from the precipitates by a 30-min heating at 80 °C that >90% of the radioactivity in the precipitates was in protein (32Foiani M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 424-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because the assay includes multiple steps after methylmalonyl-CoA conversion to succinyl-CoA, we simultaneously measured [1,4-14C]succinic acid incorporation into acid-precipitable material. Because succinic acid is a completely symmetrical molecule, the radioactive labels from [1,4-14C]succinic acid will be incorporated into amino acids similarly to the radioactive label from [1-14C]propionic acid, allowing the former compound to control for effects of the experimental conditions on steps distal to the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction. To control for potential changes by the experimental conditions on propionyl-CoA conversion to methylmalonyl-CoA, we performed some experiments in which we incubated cells with [methyl-14C]methylmalonic acid. Although the radioactive label will be in carbon 2 of succinic acid rather than in carbons 1 or 4, this should not affect incorporation into amino acids because the full 4-carbon skeleton of succinic acid is converted to aspartate, the major amino acid derived from succinate. Briefly, –1 × 106 BHK cells were plated in a 6-well cluster dish, and after an overnight incubation, the growth medium was replaced by 1 ml of experimental medium. As indicated in the legend to Fig. 5A, the experimental medium was either DME supplemented with 10% FBS, or MEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 100 μm arginine. To half of the cultures, 1 mm DETA-NONOate was added, and immediately thereafter, 0.5 μCi of [1-14C]propionic acid, [1,4-14C]succinic acid, or [methyl-14C]methylmalonic acid were added to the cultures. The cells were incubated for 12 h, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted in 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 20 min on ice, acid-precipitated material was collected on glass microfiber filters, and radioactivity on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting as described previously (22Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of radioactive labels was linear with time for at least 16 h and cell number from 1 × 106 to 2 × 106. By comparing the effects of DETA-NONOate on the incorporation of propionic acid to the incorporation of succinic acid, one can focus on the effect of DETA-NONOate on methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesIn bar graphs, the data are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Spectrophotometric data were performed at least three times with highly reproducible results. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance.RESULTSEffect of NO on Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Activity in VitroMany standard tissue culture media including DME, MEM, and Medium 199 do not contain vitamin B12, and cells derive the vitamin from serum supplements. When BHK cells were grown in DME supplemented with 10% FBS, but lacking added OH-Cbl, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity in cell extracts was 0.52 ± 0.21 nmol/min/mg of protein (Fig. 1, open bar on left). When the cell extracts were preincubated with 5 μm AdoCbl, enzyme activity increased ∼4-fold to 2.01 ± 0.19 nmol/min/mg of protein (Fig. 1, diagonally striped bar on left). Similar amounts of total holoenzyme activity have been found in human fibroblasts and glioma cells (26Kikuchi M. Hanamizu H. Narisawa K. Tada K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Riedel B. Ueland P.M. Svardal A.M. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, under conditions of relatively limited cobalamin availability, about three-fourths of cellular methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was present as apoenzyme, and it could be converted to holoenzyme in vitro. Other workers have also found that the enzyme in vivo is largely in the apoenzyme form, including human skin and lung fibroblasts, human glioma cells, and human, mouse, and rat liver (26Kikuchi M. Hanamizu H. Narisawa K. Tada K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Riedel B. Ueland P.M. Svardal A.M. Clin.

When cells were incubated for 16 h in DME medium containing 10% FBS supplemented with 1 μm OH-Cbl, enzyme activity in the cell extracts increased to the same level as observed when extracts were incubated with AdoCbl (Fig. 1, open bar on right), and adding AdoCbl to the extract had only a marginal effect (Fig. 1, diagonally striped bar on right).Fig. 1The NO donor DEA-NONOate inhibits methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activityin vitro. Logarithmically growing BHK cells were incubated for 16 h in DME medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the absence or presence of 1 μm OH-Cbl as indicated. Under subdued light, cells were harvested, sonicated in hypotonic buffer, and the resulting extracts were clarified by centrifugation. The extracts were deoxygenated in tightly sealed microcentrifuge tubes, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity was measured for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 400 μml-methylmalonyl-CoA, with substrate and product separated and quantified by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As indicated, some of the extracts were preincubated for 10 min with 5 μm AdoCbl, and to some of the samples 1 mm DEA-NONOate was added during measurement of enzyme activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To study the effect of NO on methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity, we added the NO donor DEA-NONOate to cell extracts, and found that 1 mm DEA-NONOate inhibited methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity by ∼50% (Fig. 1, solid bars). Inhibition was observed when holoenzyme was generated either in vitro by adding AdoCbl to the extracts, or in vivo by adding OH-Cbl to the culture medium (Fig. 1). DEA-NONOate also inhibited the small amount of holoenzyme activity present in cell extracts not preincubated with AdoCbl. Although the initial DEA-NONOate concentration was 1 mm and DEA-NONOate liberates 1.5 mol of NO per mol with a half-life of 2 min at 37 °C, pH 7.4 (36Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the actual NO concentration was likely to be <50 μm during the 10-min incubation period because of partitioning of NO between the liquid (50 μl) and gaseous (1.5 ml) phases, with preferential partitioning into the gaseous phase (37Glasstone S. Textbook of Physical Chemistry. Second Ed. Macmillan and Co., London1955Google Scholar).Studies on NO Inhibition of Methylmalonyl-CoA MutaseNO could inhibit methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity by one or more of at least three possible mechanisms: by reacting with cysteine residues to form nitrosothiol groups, by reacting with the Cbl(II) generated during the enzyme reaction, or by reacting with the deoxyadenosyl radical generated during the enzyme reaction.NO reacts slowly with cysteine in aqueous solutions at neutral pH with a reaction time of 2½ h (38Pryor W.A. Church D.F. Govindan C.K. Crank G. J. Org. Chem. 1982; 47: 156-159Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Because we found that NO inhibited mutase activity during a 10-min incubation (Fig. 1), enzyme inhibition by nitrosothiol formation seemed unlikely. However, to address this issue further, we performed two additional experiments. First, we studied the kinetics of enzyme inhibition by NO, and found that even after 2 min (the earliest time point at which we could reproducibly measure enzyme activity), NO significantly inhibited mutase activity (Fig. 2A). Second, we found that NO inhibited enzyme activity even in the presence of a 25-fold excess of β-mercaptoethanol, which should prevent nitrosothiol formation or reduce any nitrosothiols formed back to –SH groups (Fig. 2B). Similar inhibitory effects of 1 mm DEA-NONOate were found in the presence of 25 mm glutathione and dithiothreitol. These results suggest that nitrosothiol formation is an unlikely cause of enzyme inhibition.Fig. 2NO inhibition of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity: kinetics, effect of β-mercaptoethanol, and substrate dependence. Logarithmically growing BHK cells were extracted and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity was measured in the cell extracts as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, kinetics. Enzyme activity was measured at 2, 5, and 10 min in the absence (closed circles) and presence (open circles) of 1 mm DEA-NONOate. B, effect of β-mercaptoethanol. To some extracts either 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol alone or 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol plus 1 mm DEA-NONOate were added immediately prior to adding substrate. C, substrate dependence.

https://openalex.org/W2026132887,"Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) is a covalent homodimeric enzyme homologous to pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A), endowed with a number of special biological functions. It is isolated as an equilibrium mixture of swapped (MxM) and unswapped (M=M) dimers. The interchanged N termini are hinged on the main bodies through the peptide 16–22, which changes conformation in the two isomers. At variance with other proteins, domain swapping in BS-RNase involves two dimers having a similar and highly constrained quaternary association, mainly dictated by two interchain disulfide bonds. This provides the opportunity to study the intrinsic ability to swap as a function of the hinge sequence, without additional effects arising from dissociation or quaternary structure modifications. Two variants, having Pro19 or the whole sequence of the hinge replaced by the corresponding residues of RNase A, show equilibrium and kinetic parameters of the swapping similar to those of the parent protein. In comparison, the x-ray structures of MxM indicate, within a substantial constancy of the quaternary association, a greater mobility of the hinge residues. The relative insensitivity of the swapping tendency to the substitutions in the hinge region, and in particular to the replacement of Pro19 by Ala, contrasts with the results obtained for other swapped proteins and can be rationalized in terms of the unique features of the seminal enzyme. Moreover, the results indirectly lend credit to the hypothesis that the major role of Pro19 resides in directing the assembly of the non-covalent dimer, the species produced by selective reduction of the interchain disulfides and considered responsible for the special biological functions of BS-RNase.

Domain swapping, a process by which two or more protein molecules exchange identical structural elements to form dimers or higher oligomers (1.Schlunegger M.P. Bennet M.J. Eisenberg D. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1997; 50: 61-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been observed in an increasing number of proteins. More than 50 crystal structures of domain-swapped proteins have been deposited in PDB 1The abbreviations used are: PDB, Protein Data Bank; BS-RNase, bovine seminal ribonuclease; CD, circular dichroism spectroscopy; mBS, monomeric N67D variant of BS-RNase with cysteines 31 and 32 linked to glutathione moieties; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation; RNase A, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease; Ala19-mBS, P19A variant of mBS; Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-mBS, G16S/N17T/P19A/S20A variant of mBS; Ala19-BS-RNase, P19A variant of BS-RNase; Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase, G16S/N17T/P19A/S20A variant of BS-RNase; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; PEG, polyethylene glycol. since the first x-ray structure of a protein showing the interchange of N-terminal regions between the two polypeptide chains was reported (2.Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 389-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the possible physiological significance of this phenomenon is still unclear (3.Rousseau F. Schymkovitz J.W.H. Itzaki L.S. Structure. 2003; 11: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a large number of proteins may undergo this process under physiological or pathological conditions; thus it could represent a mechanism to regulate function, or even an evolutionary strategy to increase protein complexity. In the panorama of the swapping proteins a special case is represented by bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), a homodimeric protein in which the two subunits are covalently linked through two disulfide bridges between cysteines 31 and 32 of one subunit with cysteines 32 and 31 of the partner subunit, respectively (4.D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Mazzarella L. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York.1997: 383-423Crossref Google Scholar). In this protein the swapping process involves two dimers, in which the two subunits change their tertiary structure within a basically invariant quaternary assembly imposed by the two interchain disulfides: in the dimer-dubbed MxM the N-terminal arms (residues 1–15) are exchanged, or swapped, between the two subunits, whereas in the dimer indicated as M=M no swapping occurs. Thus, in this particular system the swapping phenomenon does not depend on the overall concentration of the protein. Furthermore, in the quaternary structure of MxM, the acceptable values of the end-to-end distance, spanned by the hinge peptide, are almost as sharply restricted as they are within the tertiary structure of the unswapped dimer. This finding is at variance with what is usually observed in the swapping process, where a monomer to dimer (M/D) transition is commonly observed and the swapped dimer often presents a considerable degree of flexibility and, therefore, a certain degree of variability of the end-to-end distance of the hinge peptide. In the latter case, the swapped state is expected to become statistically more favored as the rigidity of the hinge is increased. Indeed, this argument has been used to explain the elevated frequency of proline in the hinge peptide sequence of proteins prone to swap (5.Bergdoll M. Remy M.H. Cagnon C. Masson J.M. Dumas P. Structure. 1997; 5: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in an M/D transformation other parameters may influence significantly the process, such as the nature and the extent of “O-interface,” i.e. the additional interface formed in the dimer and exposed to the solvent in the monomer (1.Schlunegger M.P. Bennet M.J. Eisenberg D. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1997; 50: 61-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the MxM/M=M equilibrium of BS-RNase, the quaternary structure is highly preserved and the O-interface 2Here an extensive use is made of this term, with reference to a monomeric species prior to its conversion to the unswapped (M=M) or to the swapped (MxM) species. varies only for the different conformation adopted by the hinge peptide in the two dimers (6.Berisio R. Sica F. De Lorenzo C. Di Fiore A. Piccoli R. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This feature offers the unique opportunity to isolate the effects of the hinge sequence on the equilibrium ratio between MxM and M=M. In the native protein the relative amount of the two dimers is about 70:30 (7.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the selective reduction of the interchain disulfides produces the species which could be involved into a M/D swapping transformation, as MxM gives rise to a non-covalent swapped dimer (NCD), whereas M=M readily dissociates into monomers. BS-RNase sequence is 81% identical to that of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A), the first protein that was shown to dimerize via the N termini interchange between the two intervening chains, upon lyophilization in acetic acid (8.Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 1: 217-222PubMed Google Scholar). For this protein, however, more recent experiments have demonstrated that only a minor fraction of the dimers is swapped at the N terminus, whereas a major fraction is swapped at the C terminus (9.Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10.Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 11.Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the former dimer the contacts at the so-called “C-interface,” i.e. the interface between the swapped domain (residues 1–15) and the major domain (residues 23–124), are identical to those found in the covalent dimers of BS-RNase. The sequence alignment of the two proteins shows that four substitutions out of a total of 23 are located in the 16–22-hinge region. In order to clarify the actual role of the hinge sequence in the swapping process of BS-RNase, a homologue-scanning mutagenesis approach has been followed, using as reference the sequence of RNase A. We have prepared two mutants, Ala19-BS-RNase and Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase, in which either Pro19 or all four residues of the BS-RNase sequence have been substituted with the corresponding ones of the pancreatic enzyme. Here we report the x-ray structures of the MxM form of the two mutants and discuss the results on the basis of the MxM/M=M equilibrium data measured in solution for Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase and those previously published for Ala19-BS-RNase and for the parent BS-RNase (12.Ercole C. Avitabile F. del Vecchio P. Crescenzi O. Tancredi T. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a megaprimer polymerase chain reaction method (13.Ke S. Madison E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3371-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) to produce the mutants coding for G16S/N17T/P19A BS-RNase and G16S/N17T/P19A/S20A BS-RNase, starting from the pET-22b(+) plasmid cDNA coding for the P19A BS-RNase (12.Ercole C. Avitabile F. del Vecchio P. Crescenzi O. Tancredi T. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed with an Eppendorf Mastercycler amplifier as previously described (12.Ercole C. Avitabile F. del Vecchio P. Crescenzi O. Tancredi T. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the tetramutant the two mutagenic primers 5′-TAGCAGAGGTGCTGCTGTC-3′ and 5′-AAGAGCTACCAGCAGAG-3′ were used in succession (nucleotides that represent mutations are underlined). The amplified, mutated genes were separated, excised, and purified from the agarose gel followed by cloning into the pET-22b(+) plasmid between HindIII and NdeI sites. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To avoid heterogeneity (see “Results and Discussion”), the basic sequence of BS-RNase contains the substitution of Asn67 with an aspartic residue. This modified sequence, together with the N-terminal Met, constitutes the parent protein (henceforth referred to as mBS for the monomeric species or BS-RNase for the dimers), whereas the unmodified one is referred to as native protein. Recovery of Proteins—The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in monomeric form, with cysteines 31 and 32 linked to two glutathione molecules, as previously described (14.Crescenzi O. Carotenuto A. D'Ursi A.M. Tancredi T. D'Alessio G. Avitabile F. Picone D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Monomers with cysteines 31 and 32 in the reduced form were obtained by selective reduction of the mixed disulfide bridges with a 5:1 molar excess of dithiothreitol for 20 min at room temperature in 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.4. The samples were either carboxyamidomethylated with iodoacetamide (15.D'Alessio G. Malorni M.C. Parente A. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), to obtain the monomeric proteins used for CD, or dialyzed against 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.4 for 20 h at 4 °C, to obtain dimers. The last step of the purification procedure was always a gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 to separate monomers from dimers. All dimerization steps were performed at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by UV spectrophotometry assuming ϵ (0.1%, 278 nm, 1 cm) = 0.5. Protein homogeneity was checked by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectra, registered at “Sezione di Spettrometria di Massa” of the CIMCF, University of Naples Federico II. The correct folding of all the monomers was checked by CD. The enzymatic activity on yeast (16.Kunitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was comparable to that of native mBS, so confirming the correct folding of the active site. CD Spectra Measurements—CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier type temperature control system (Model PTC-348WI). Molar ellipticity per mean residue, [θ]in deg cm2 dmol–1, was calculated from the equation: [θ] = [θ]obs·mrw/10·l·C, where [θ]obs is the ellipticity measured in degrees, mrw is the mean residue molecular mass, 117 Da (15.D'Alessio G. Malorni M.C. Parente A. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), C is the protein concentration in g l–1 and l is the optical path length of the cell in cm. A 0.1-cm path length cell and a protein concentration of about 0.3 mg ml–1 in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, were used. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a time constant of 16 s, a 2-nm bandwidth, and a scan rate of 5 nm min–1; they were signal-averaged over five scans at least, and baseline corrected by subtracting the buffer spectrum. Thermal unfolding curves were recorded in the temperature scan mode at 222 nm from 25 up to 85 °C with a scan rate of 1.0 K min–1. NMR—NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer. All spectra were collected using the standard Bruker pulse sequence library. Protein concentration was 2 mm in 95% H2O, 5% D2O, pH 5.65. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (17.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11630) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (18.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) programs. Kinetics of Interconversion of Dimeric Forms—To follow the interconversion kinetics, dimer samples were incubated at 37 °C. At given times, aliquots were withdrawn, the interchain disulfide bridges were selectively reduced as described (7.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the mixture was chromatographed on an analytical Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of MxM and M=M was evaluated by integrating the peaks of dimer and monomer, respectively. Extent of the N-terminal Swapping at Equilibrium—Cross-linking experiments were done using divinyl sulfone (DVS) as a 10% solution in ethanol. The dimers (20 μg) in sodium acetate buffer (100 mm, pH5, 100 μl) and DVS (1 μl of the 10% solution) were incubated at 30 °C (19.Ciglic M.I. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.I. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Ruf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is approximately a 1,000-fold excess of sulfone to each subunit of the protein. Aliquots were withdrawn over a period of 96 h, quenched with 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration 200 mm), incubated for 15–30 min at room temperature, and loaded on a gel for reducing SDS-PAGE. A qualitative estimation of the monomer to cross-linked dimer ratio was obtained by Coomassie Blue staining. Crystallization and Data Collection—The swapped dimers of Ala19-BS-RNase and Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase variants were crystallized using protein solutions containing the equilibrium mixture of the swapped and unswapped form without further purification. In detail, Ala19-BS-RNase and Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase crystals were grown at room temperature by the vapor diffusion sitting drop method. Equal volumes of protein (27 mg/ml) and of a solution containing 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and 0.2 m sodium acetate were mixed and equilibrated against a 750-μl reservoir containing the same precipitant solution. Single crystals of the two mutants were obtained after 1 day and present very similar morphology. They belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and are isomorphous to the wild-type protein crystallized under very similar conditions (PDB code 1R5D) (20.Merlino A. Vitagliano L. Sica F. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. Biopolymers. 2004; 73: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected on a ENRAF-NONIUS DIP area detector equipped with a FR591 rotating anode of the Istituto di Biostrutture e Bioimmagini (CNR, Naples). Ala19-BS-RNase data collection was carried out at room temperature up to 2.20-Å resolution. Because of the lower resolution of the diffraction data, a Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase crystal was cryo-cooled at 100 K by using 18% (v/v) glycerol as cryo-protector, and the diffraction data were collected up to the same resolution (2.20 Å). The two data sets were processed and scaled with the HKL package (21.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structures were solved by the molecular replacement method. The atomic coordinates of the native enzyme, stripped of all solvent molecules and hinge peptide residues, were used as starting model. Structure refinement, performed by using the CNS program (22.Brunger A.T. Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar), began with a cycle of rigid body refinement. In this step the starting model was divided in four groups formed by the two N-terminal helical segments (residues 1–15) and the two main bodies (residues 24–124). Each mutant was then refined by alternating positional and temperature refinement with manual building by using O (23.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The missing hinge peptide residues were built by fitting the electron density from difference Fourier maps. Water molecules were then added to the models through the automatic protocol of CNS together with the contribution of the disordered solvent. Reflections with intensity greater than 2σ(I) in all resolution range (20.00–2.20 Å for both mutants) were included in the minimization procedure. The final models of the two proteins have Rfactor/Rfree indexes of 0.171/0.202 and 0.208/0.259, respectively. The models have good geometry as evaluated with WHATCHECK (24.Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). The full lists of refinement statistics are reported in Table II. Superimposition of the mutants with the wild-type protein was achieved by using the Cα carbon atoms of residues 2–15 and 23–124 of the two chains. Because of the swapping, the quaternary structure was compared by first superimposing one structural unit (residues 2–15 of one chain and 23–124 of the second chain) and, successively, computing the angle needed to superimpose the second structural unit. Characterization of the Monomers—All the plasmids were coding for Asp at position 67 in order to avoid heterogeneity arising from the spontaneous deamidation of Asn67, which characterizes the native enzyme (25.Di Donato A. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7232-7237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Asn67 is located in a disulfide-linked octapeptide loop (65–72) exposed to the solvent and on the most far site with respect to the swapping domain and to the O-interface. This substitution in RNase A has been shown not to influence the correct folding of the chain and its thermal stability (26.Catanzano F. Graziano G. Capasso S. Barone G. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1682-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). mBS shows a similar behavior, and, in addition, the extent of the swapping phenomenon in the dimeric species is not altered (12.Ercole C. Avitabile F. del Vecchio P. Crescenzi O. Tancredi T. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first products of our purification procedure were about 15 mg/liter of recombinant BS-RNase or its variants in monomeric form, with cysteines 31 and 32 linked to two glutathione molecules. The thermal stability of the two mutant proteins was monitored by CD spectroscopy. Fig. 1 reports the folded fraction (fF), calculated as (θmeasured – θunfolded)/(θfolded – θunfolded) at 222 nm, as a function of the temperature for mBS, Ala19-mBS, and Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-mBS in comparison with that of recombinant RNase A. The values of Tm, calculated by linear regression analysis of the experimental data, indicate that both mutants display only a very small difference with respect to the parent form (Tm = 53 °C). On the other hand, the Tm of Ala19-mBS (55 °C) is 6 °C lower than that of RNase A; the difference is even higher in the mutant containing four substitutions in the hinge region (Tm = 53.5 °C), despite the greater similarity of its sequence to that of RNase A. In both cases the effect is significantly greater than that produced by the sole substitution of Asn67 (27.Catanzano F. Graziano G. Cafaro V. D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Barone G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14403-14408Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For a more accurate evaluation of the effect of the mutations on the solution structure of the monomeric proteins we resorted to two-dimensional NMR spectra. The overlay of TOCSY spectra of Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-mBS and mBS indicated that most resonances were coincident, thus confirming that the two monomers have a very similar conformation. In the expanded regions reported in Fig. 2 it is evident the presence of three new NH-CH3 connectivities in the spectrum of Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-mBS (black), tentatively assigned to Thr17, Ala19, and Ala20. The analysis of sequential contacts in the NOESY spectrum allowed the proton assignment of all the spin systems of the hinge residues, which is reported in Table I. The table also reports the proton resonances of the 16–22 region for mBS and for RNase A (28.Avitabile F. Alfano C. Spadaccini R. Crescenzi O. D'Ursi A.M. D'Alessio G. Tancredi T. Picone D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8704-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for comparison. Despite the sequence identity, the chemical shift values of Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-mBS show a striking difference with those of RNase A, suggesting that the hinge loop has a different local environment in the two proteins.Table IProton chemical shift of the 15–21 loop residues for mBS, Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-mBS and RNase A at pH 5.65, 300 KNo. of residuemBSSer16Thr17Ala19Ala20-mBSRNase A15SerNH8.90SerNH8.94SerNH8.89SerHA4.76SerHA4.24SerHA4.31SerHB13.79SerHB13.87SerHB13.96SerHB23.65SerHB23.74SerHB23.74GlyNH8.59SerNH8.18SerNH8.0216GlyHA14.09SerHA4.27SerHA4.32GlyHA23.87SerHB13.76SerHB1NDaND, not determined.SerHB23.69SerHB2NDAsnNH7.98ThrNH8.13ThrNH7.4617AsnHA4.63ThrHA4.20bOverlapped.ThrHA4.46AsnHB12.64ThrHB4.20bOverlapped.ThrHB4.07AsnHB22.58ThrMG1.04ThrMG0.96SerNH8.29SerNH8.75SerNH8.4118SerHA4.17SerHA4.38SerHA4.27SerHB13.63SerHB14.05SerHB1NDSerHB23.58SerHB24.00SerHB2NDProHA4.18AlaNH8.06AlaNH7.5619AlaHA4.02AlaHA3.44AlaMB1.14AlaMB1.00SerNH8.28AlaNH7.75AlaNHND20SerHA4.32AlaHA3.88AlaHANDSerHB13.78AlaMB1.00AlaMBNDSerHB23.62SerNH8.41SerNH8.30SerNH8.0421SerHA4.36SerHA4.47SerHA4.31SerHB13.90SerHB13.91SerHB13.92SerHB2NDSerHB23.78SerHB23.88a ND, not determined.b Overlapped. Open table in a new tab Although the hinge peptide was found to be flexible in RNase A too (28.Avitabile F. Alfano C. Spadaccini R. Crescenzi O. D'Ursi A.M. D'Alessio G. Tancredi T. Picone D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8704-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), its greatly enhanced mobility in Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-mBS clearly indicates that more substitutions external to the hinge region, such as Ser80 replaced by Arg in BS-RNase, play a role in fixing this peptide in RNase A. In conclusion, the disorder, observed for the hinge region of the monomeric derivative of BS-RNase in the solid state (29.Sica F. Di Fiore A. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. Proteins. 2003; 52: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in solution (28.Avitabile F. Alfano C. Spadaccini R. Crescenzi O. D'Ursi A.M. D'Alessio G. Tancredi T. Picone D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8704-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), appears to be also a feature of the mutants. Moreover, it seems reasonable to assume that similar disorder characterizes the corresponding unswapped dimers, where each subunit shares the global fold of the monomeric derivatives. Extent of the Swapping—BS-RNase and its variants in their monomeric form, with cysteines 31 and 32 linked to two glutathione molecules, can be easily converted into dimers by selective reduction of the disulfide bridges followed by air oxidation of the exposed sulfhydryls. The characterization of the swapping process for Ala19-BS-RNase has been already reported (12.Ercole C. Avitabile F. del Vecchio P. Crescenzi O. Tancredi T. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two independent methods have been used to evaluate the swapping tendency of the other mutant. The first protocol is based on the higher reactivity of the interchain disulfide bridges with respect to the intrachain ones (7.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As in the case of the parent protein and of Ala19-BS-RNase, Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase folds mainly in the unswapped form, and in freshly prepared samples the MxM content is about 15%. Fig. 3 displays the course of the M=M to MxM conversion as a function of the incubation time at 37 °C. The process in Ser16-Thr17-Ala19-Ala20-BS-RNase is very similar to that reported for BS-RNase, as it reaches the same 70:30 equilibrium between swapped and unswapped dimers, except for a slight increase in the conversion rate. Fig. 3 also reports the time course of the reverse process, namely the conversion of MxM into M=M, which confirms the equilibrium ratio previously found. Both reactions were essentially complete within 2 days, whereas at 4 °C the interconversion was effectively blocked (data not shown). The extent of swapping on the equilibrium mixtures was also assessed by cross-linking experiments with divinyl sulfone (DVS), followed by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions. DVS joins covalently the two histidines of the active site (His12 and His119), which belon"
https://openalex.org/W2084765627,"Enhanced flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) induces insulin resistance and facilitates lipid storage through the up-regulation of enzyme mRNA levels. Both actions occur over several hours and require gene expression. We now identify a regulatory arm of the HBP that involves rapid allosteric activation of glycogen synthase (GS) and stimulation of glycogen biosynthesis (GBS). When insulin-pretreated adipocytes were exposed to 2 mm GlcN, incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen doubled by 10 min (t½ of <5 min), whereas UDP-glucose levels were concomitantly decreased during this time (t½ of 1.4 min; >90% depletion). Stimulation of GBS and depletion of UDP-glucose both correlated with an early and rapid rise in the levels of glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P), a known activator of GS. The lowering of GlcN-6-P levels by removing extracellular GlcN (>80% reduction by 45 min) was accompanied by the restoration of UDP-glucose levels. Prolonged GlcN treatment (20 min to 2 h) inhibited GBS, which corresponded to a massive intracellular accumulation of GlcN-6-P (t½ of ∼32 min; >1,400 nmol/g). From these data, we conclude the following. 1) GlcN treatment elevated intracellular GlcN-6-P levels within minutes, resulting in allosteric activation of GS, stimulation of GBS, and a reduction in steady-state levels of UDP-glucose due to increased precursor utilization. 2) Prolonged treatment with high concentrations of GlcN caused massive accumulation of GlcN-6-P that adversely affected cellular metabolism and reduced GBS. 3) The biphasic actions of GlcN on GBS may explain many of the discrepant reports on the role of the HBP in glycogen metabolism.

In 1991 we discovered a unique metabolic pathway in isolated adipocytes that mediates glucose-induced desensitization of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system (GTS) 1The abbreviations used are: GTS, glucose transport system; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; GBS, glycogen biosynthesis; GlcN-6-P, glucosamine-6-phosphate; GS, glycogen synthase; HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. (1Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because a major function of this pathway is the generation of hexosamine metabolites, we postulated that under hyperglycemic conditions the enhanced flux of incoming glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) culminates in the induction of insulin resistance (1Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Traxinger R.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Desensitization is likely mediated by altered gene expression, because desensitization occurs relatively slowly over several hours and because transcriptional inhibitors completely block glucose-induced desensitization (3Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10148-10154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have now confirmed the role of the HBP in glucose-induced desensitization and extended the scope of this regulatory system to muscle tissue and other cell types (4Marshall S.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5172-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have used GlcN and isolated adipocytes to examine the hypothesis that GlcN-6-P can allosterically enhance glycogen biosynthesis (GBS) through in vivo stimulation of glycogen synthase (GS). This idea originated from earlier studies showing that GlcN-6-P can allosterically activate GS in vitro (10Virkamäki A. Yki-Järvinen H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The choice of adipocytes as our cellular model system derives from the fact that adipocytes represent a classical insulin-responsive target tissue. Moreover, adipocytes have proven useful in elucidating the mechanism(s) underlying glucose-induced insulin resistance (1Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Marshall S. Rumberger J. Walker M. Butler P. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Annual/13.

Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20910-20916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in identifying various genes regulated through the HBP (13Rumberger J.M. Wu T. Hering M.A. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 31: 28547-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our experimental approach entailed treating adipocytes with GlcN and then measuring the subsequent changes in glycogen metabolism (GBS and UDP-glucose levels) and the intracellular levels of two key hexosamine products (GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc). The rationale for this pharmacological approach is based on the finding that GlcN is rapidly transported into adipocytes through the insulin-responsive GTS, where it undergoes phosphorylation to GlcN-6-P, the first product of the HBP (1Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marshall S. Nadeau O. Yamasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35313-35319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, GlcN is relatively specific, because it directly enters the HBP and bypasses the first and rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, which is glutamine: fructose-6-phospahte amidotransferase. GlcN action was evaluated as a function of the treatment time (5 min to 4 h) and the GlcN dose (20 μm to 10 mm) by using insulin-pretreated cells, insulin- and glucose-pretreated cells, and control cells (no insulin or glucose pretreatment). The obtained results support the hypothesis that relatively small increases in GlcN-6-P can rapidly stimulate GBS (within minutes) through allosteric activation of GS. Moreover, enhanced formation of glycogen appears to result in a decrease in the steady-state levels of UDP-glucose through precursor utilization. In general, our findings are conceptually important because they add a new regulatory dimension to the HBP that encompasses very rapid control of glucose metabolism through an allosteric mechanism. Thus, we postulate that enhanced flux within the HBP orchestrates both short term (allosteric) and long term (transcriptional) regulatory actions in response to nutritional information derived from the internal and external environments. Materials—Sources of materials were as follows. Porcine insulin was from Sigma, collagenase was provided by Worthington Biochemicals (Freehold, NJ), bovine serum albumin came from the Armour Company (Kankakee, IL), and penicillin-streptomycin, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and DMEM formulated without d-glucose were purchased from Invitrogen. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise specified. Preparation and Treatment of Isolated Adipocytes—Isolated adipocytes were obtained from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–225 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously (15Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Geller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6376-6384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After digestion, cells were washed three times in Hepes-buffered balanced saline solution consisting of 25 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6. Cells were then diluted to a final concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml (12 ml of Hepes-buffered saline solution per gram of initial fat weight). From a common pool of cells, 400 μl of adipocytes were aliquoted into 17 × 100-mm sterile polystyrene tubes containing 1.6 ml of Hepes-buffered saline solution. Unless otherwise indicated, insulin was added (25 ng/ml, final concentration), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C to stimulate the GTS and facilitate the subsequent uptake of glucose and GlcN. After 30 min GlcN was added, and the adipocytes were further incubated at 37 °C for either 4 h (dose-response experiments) or for various time periods (time course experiments). Measurement of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucose Levels—After treatment the adipocytes were transferred to 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold, bovine serum albumin-free Hepes-buffered saline solution. During the final wash the cell volume was reduced to 150 μl, and 0.4 ml of cold perchloric acid (0.3 mol/liter) was added to adipocytes for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 20,800 × g (10 min at 4 °C), and the deproteinated metabolite extract (420 μl) was transferred to a new microfuge tube. After the extract was neutralized by adding a small amount of K2CO3 (5 m), extracts were frozen and stored at –20 °C. The concentration of UDP-GlcNAc was measured by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (16Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Liu R. Hu M.Z. Chen W. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2173-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) by first passing the cell extract through a strong anion-exchange Supelclean LC-SAX column (Supelco, Bellefornte, PA). Analysis was performed using a high performance liquid chromatography system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) and two reverse phase LC18T columns in series (Supelco). Metabolite concentration was quantitated by UV light absorption (260 nm), and levels were determined from a standard calibration curve. Recovery of standards added to adipocyte extract was >95%. Measurement of GlcN-6-P Levels—We have developed a fluorometric assay to measure GlcN-6-P levels based on the same enzymatic principles used to measure G-6-P levels. At high concentrations we found that G-6-P dehydrogenase can act on GlcN-6-P and NADP, resulting in equimolar production of NADPH, whereas at low concentrations (used to measure G-6-P) NADPH was not generated. Thus, the low affinity of G-6-P dehydrogenase for GlcN-6-P allows for the resolution of G-6-P from GlcN-6-P in the same sample by first carrying out the assay for G-6-P with a low amount of G-6-P dehydrogenase (1.2 units/ml) followed by the addition of a much greater concentration of G-6-P dehydrogenase (43 units/ml). Optimization of assay methods revealed that GlcN-6-P measurements are not affected by glucose, GlcN, fructose-6-phosphate, or N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate and that standard calibration curves (using GlcN-6-P) are linear (data not shown). To further validate the assay results, we incubated adipocytes for 4 h with various concentrations of GlcN, prepared metabolite extracts as described above, and then measured GlcN-6-P levels using two methods. The first method was the fluorometric assay. The second assay entailed derivatization of GlcN-6-P with o-pthaldialdehyde so that it could be detected fluorometrically (following separation by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography). Both assay methods yielded similar results, but the fluorometric enzymatic assay was faster, less expensive, and allowed for the measurement of numerous samples (using a 96-well assay format). Assessment of the Glycogen Biosynthesis Rate—GBS was measured using a modified method derived from Smith and Lawrence (17Smith R.L. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 260: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated adipocytes were added to 17 × 100 polypropylene tubes and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 ng/ml insulin (total volume of 200 μl). GlcN was then added for various time periods. After treatment, the rate of GBS was determined by adding 10 μl of [U-14C]glucose for 5 min at 37 °C. At the end of 5 min, the reaction was terminated by transferring 180 μl of adipocytes to a 400-μl microfuge tube and centrifuging the cells through silicone oil to separate cells from extracellular buffer and free the [14C]glucose. Adipocytes were then lysed, and glycogen was extracted by boiling cells for 10 min in 250 μl of 30% KOH. The mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 8,200 × g, after which time 200 μl of the solubilized cell extract was transferred to a 1.5-ml microfuge. To precipitate glycogen, 95% ethanol was added (600 μl). The samples were cooled for 10 min at –20 °C and centrifuged at 4 °C for 8 min at 8,200 × g. The glycogen pellet was then washed three times with 70% ethanol, resuspended, and transferred to a liquid scintillation vial. The amount of [14C]glucose incorporated into glycogen was determined by scintillation counting. Biphasic Actions of GlcN on Glycogen Biosynthesis—As shown in the time course study depicted in Fig. 1A, the addition of 2 mm GlcN to insulin-pretreated adipocytes rapidly enhanced the rate at which [14C]glucose was incorporated into glycogen. By 10 min, maximal stimulatory effects were seen (an ∼2-fold increase; t½ of <5 min). The rapidity of GlcN action is further illustrated by the fact that stimulatory effects were observed when GlcN was added immediately before the short 5-min assay (at time 0). As can also be seen in Fig. 1A, GlcN treatment longer than 20 min resulted in a progressive decrease in GBS, culminating in a GBS rate that was 50% below control levels at 2 h. In Fig. 1B, insulin-pretreated adipocytes were exposed to various concentrations of GlcN for 30 min. As depicted, a similar biphasic curve was obtained in which GlcN concentrations up to 1 mm stimulated GBS (ED50 of ∼300 mm), whereas greater GlcN concentrations inhibited GBS. GlcN Treatment Rapidly Lowers UPD-glucose Levels—In Fig. 2, we used insulin-pretreated cells to assess GlcN action on intracellular levels of GlcN-6-P, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-glucose as a function of GlcN treatment time (5 min to 4 h) or GlcN dose (20 μm to 10 mm GlcN). In Fig. 2A, it can be seen that 2 mm GlcN rapidly increased GlcN-6-P levels at 5 min from undetectable levels to ∼300 nmol/g. Because GlcN-6-P has been shown to be an allosteric activator of GS (10Virkamäki A. Yki-Järvinen H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we believe that elevated levels of this key hexosamine metabolite explain the rapid stimulation of GBS (Fig. 1). The data presented in Fig. 2A also show that prolonged treatment with 2 mm GlcN results in a massive accumulation of GlcN-6-P (>1,400 nmol/g) that reaches a plateau at 2–3 h (t½ of ∼32 min). In Fig. 2B, it can be seen that 2 mm GlcN had little or no effect on UDP-GlcNAc levels during the first 5 min of treatment but did double UDP-GlcNAc levels during the 1st h (t½ of ∼30 min). In Fig. 2C, it can be seen that GlcN treatment rapidly (t½ of ∼1.4 min) and profoundly (>95% decrease) reduced intracellular levels of UDP-glucose. Because the rapid decrease in UDP-glucose levels correlates with increased rates of GBS (Fig. 1), this result indicates that the increased demands of enhanced GBS quickly reduce the precursor pool of substrate (UDP-glucose). From the dose-response curve depicted in Fig. 2D, it can be seen that GlcN-6-P levels were minimally affected when cells were incubated for 4 h with GlcN concentrations <250 μm. At 500 μm GlcN the levels were only slightly elevated, whereas GlcN-6-P levels were maximally elevated at 4 mm GlcN (ED50 of 620 μm). Measuring UDP-GlcNAc levels as a function of GlcN concentration (Fig. 2E) revealed a very different pattern. Low doses of GlcN progressively increased UDP-GlcNAc levels (4-fold increase, ED50 of 60 μm), whereas higher GlcN doses (750 μm to 4 mm) diminished the maximal levels of UDP-GlcNAc. When UDP-glucose levels were measured under these conditions (Fig. 2F) we found that GlcN concentrations <100 μm had little or no effect on UDP-glucose levels, but as the concentration was increased from 100 μm to 1 mm a progressive decrease was observed (ED50 of 300 μm). Several conclusions can be drawn by comparing the dose-response curves in panels D, E, and F of Fig. 2. First, by comparing panels D and E in Fig. 2, it is apparent that low concentrations of GlcN can markedly elevate UDP-GlcNAc levels without measurably affecting GlcN-6-P levels. From this finding, we conclude that low concentrations of GlcN are rapidly taken up by adipocytes, phosphorylated to GlcN-6-P, and then routed through the HBP resulting in a 4–5-fold increase in UDP-GlcNAc levels. At higher levels of extracellular GlcN (>250 μm), we believe that the uptake and the intracellular phosphorylation of GlcN exceed the capacity of the HBP, which leads to a progressive accumulation of GlcN-6-P. The second conclusion is derived by comparing panels D and F in Fig. 2, which show that loss of UDP-glucose is closely correlated with the rise in GlcN-6-P levels. Thus, we believe that depletion of UDP-glucose is mediated by the accumulation of GlcN-6-P and the resulting allosteric activation of GS. Removal of Extracellular GlcN Decreases Intracellular GlcN-6-P Levels and Increases UDP-glucose Levels—To gain additional insights into the kinetics of hexosamine flux, we pretreated adipocytes for 30 min with insulin and then added 2 mm GlcN. After 1 h, adipocytes were washed three times to remove extracellular GlcN. As shown in Fig. 3A, we found that intracellular GlcN-6-P levels were reduced from 1500 nmol/g to <200 nmol/g after 45 min (t½ of 31 min). In contrast, UDP-GlcNAc levels actually increased during this time (Fig. 3B). From this observation we conclude that the high intracellular levels of GlcN-6-P were reduced by the continued flux of GlcN-6-P through the HBP. In Fig. 3C we measured UDP-glucose levels as a function of time following GlcN removal. As can be seen, the increase in UDP-glucose levels correlates well with the time-dependent decrease in GlcN-6-P levels (but not with UDP-GlcNAc levels). This finding adds further support for the supposition that GlcN enhances GBS through allosteric regulation of GS rather than O-linked glycosylation. GlcN Rapidly Lowers UPD-glucose Levels Under Euglycemic Conditions (Presence of 5 m m Glucose)—Several in vivo studies have shown that prolonged GlcN infusion in rats can increase skeletal muscle hexosamine levels and induce whole body insulin resistance (10Virkamäki A.

Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To reproduce euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp conditions under defined in vitro conditions, we modified the protocol used in Fig. 2 such that all treatment groups contained 5 mm glucose (in addition to GlcN). As can be seen in the time course experiment depicted in Fig. 4A, GlcN-6-P levels were again markedly increased by 5 min (undetectable to about 160 nmol/g) and reached maximal levels by 90 min (t½ of 12 min). It should be noted that compared with cells treated with GlcN alone (Fig. 2A), total intracellular accumulation was reduced by 50%. This can be explained by the fact that glucose competitively inhibits GlcN uptake through the insulin-responsive GTS. In other words, when a fixed concentration of GlcN is used (2 mm), less GlcN enters cells when glucose is present. As can be seen in Fig. 4C, although the rate and the extent of GlcN uptake was diminished, UDP-glucose levels were still rapidly and extensively reduced (>60% decrease by 5 min; t½ of 3 min). It is also apparent that the initial level of UDP-glucose in control cells treated with 5 mm glucose was higher than that in cells incubated under glucose-free conditions (∼7 nmol/g versus ∼2.5 nmol/g). This observation indicates that extracellular glucose was effectively internalized and that a portion of the incoming glucose was routed to the GBS pathway where it increased the precursor product used for glycogen formation (UDP-glucose). Thus, despite a continuing supply of substrate for GBS, steady-state levels of UDP-glucose were still reduced by >80%. Because both glucose and GlcN enter the HBP in adipocytes and raise the intracellular levels of UDP-GlcNAc, it is not unexpected that UDP-GlcNAc levels were slightly elevated in the presence of 5 mm glucose and continued to increase as a function of GlcN treatment time (Fig. 4B). As depicted in Fig. 4, D–F, GlcN dose-response curves for all three metabolites were shifted to the right in the presence of 5 mm glucose (compared with cells similarly treated in the absence of glucose as shown in Fig. 2). This rightward shift is most likely due to the reduced uptake of GlcN in the presence of glucose, because glucose has a higher affinity for cell surface glucose transporters and can competitively inhibit GlcN uptake. Although glucose was able to reduce the steady-state levels of GlcN-6-P by half (Fig. 4, A and D), no such reduction was observed when measuring UDP-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 4, B and E). In fact, the combination of glucose and GlcN increased UDP-GlcNAc levels by ∼30% above values obtained with maximally effective concentrations of GlcN alone (compare Fig. 4E with Fig. 2E). When the dose-response curves in Fig. 4, D and E are compared, it can be seen that that increases in UDP-GlcNAc levels occur before any measurable changes in GlcN-6-P levels. Specifically, 750 μm GlcN failed to elevate GlcN-6-P, whereas this dose almost maximally increased UDP-GlcNAc levels. This finding again illustrates that above a certain threshold concentration of GlcN, the ability of the HBP to process an incoming substrate becomes increasingly rate-limited, resulting in the progressive accumulation of GlcN-6-P. These studies, performed under euglycemic conditions, indicate that our in vitro results on metabolite levels are not due to glucose deprivation. GlcN Lowers UDP-glucose Levels in the Absence of Insulin—In the aforementioned experiments we used insulin to stimulate the insulin-responsive GTS and facilitate the uptake of GlcN. However, insulin itself initiates a rapid cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions that culminate in various pleiotropic actions, including the stimulation of GS. Therefore, we performed time course and dose-response experiments to assess the extent to which GlcN alone elevates GlcN-6-P levels and to determine whether GlcN can decrease UDP-glucose levels in the absence of insulin. As depicted in Fig. 5A, we found that 2 mm GlcN only modestly increased GlcN-6-P levels (to ∼120 nmol/g versus >1400 nmol/g) and that the time required to attain steady-state levels was much shorter (t½ of 8 min versus 32 min for insulin-treated cells). These differences are likely explained by a markedly reduced rate of GlcN uptake in the absence of insulin (10-fold reduction in uptake) and by the fact that the rate of incoming GlcN no longer exceeds the capacity of the HBP. As depicted in Fig. 5C, the decrease in UDP-glucose proceeded at a much slower rate (t½ of 8 min), which we believe results from the lower intracellular levels of GlcN-6-P. From dose-response studies (Fig. 5, D–F), we obtained results very similar to those in Fig. 2, D–F, except that the dose-response curves were right-shifted by ∼5–10-fold. This makes sense, because insulin stimulates GlcN uptake ∼10-fold in isolated adipocytes. It is interesting to note that insulin treatment alone can lower UDP-glucose levels but that it affects neither GlcN-6-P nor UDP-GlcNAc levels. From these insulin-free experiments, we conclude that GlcN is the major variable responsible for the observed metabolite changes and that insulin serves simply to enhance the rate of uptake by its ability to stimulate the GTS. It is also readily apparent from the time course studies that relatively small increases in GlcN-6-P (that do not exceed the biosynthetic capacity of the HBP) can have a profound effect on lowering UDP-glucose levels. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus and contributes to disease pathogenesis by impairing both insulin action and insulin secretion (24Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Investig. Med. 1996; 44: 413-428PubMed Google Scholar, 25Karam J.H. Horm. Metab. Res. 1996; 28: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Simonson D.C. Rossetti L. Giaccari A. DeFronzo R.A.

Rev. 1992; 13: 415-431PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hyperglycemia is not only a consequence of diabetes, it is a pathophysiological factor that can perpetuate and sustain the diabetic state. This detrimental effect of hyperglycemia is generally referred to as “glucose toxicity” (26Simonson D.C. Rossetti L. Giaccari A. DeFronzo R.A. Alberti K.G.M.M. Zimmet P. DeFronzo R.A. Keen H. International Textbook of Diabetes Mellitus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 713-744Google Scholar, 27Yki-Järvinen H. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 415-431PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rossetti L. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 544-553Google Scholar), and for many years the question of how hyperglycemia mediates desensitization at the cellular level remained unanswered. In 1991 we provided an explanation by showing that an excessive flux of glucose through the HBP culminates in the induction of insulin resistance in isolated adipocytes (1Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence supporting the hexosamine hypothesis of glucose toxicity included the finding that the induction of insulin resistance requires three components, namely insulin, glucose, and glutamine. When any one of these components is omitted, little or no desensitization is observed (1Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Traxinger R.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Marshall S. Rumberger J. Walker M. Butler P. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Annual/13. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2000: 97-112Google Scholar). This was explained by the fact that the formation of hexosamine products requires a supply of both glucose (in the form of fructose-6-phosphate) and glutamine as a cofactor for glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase in the transfer of an amide group to fructose-6-phosphate. The primary role of insulin in this scheme is to facilitate the uptake of glucose (∼10- to 20-fold) by increasing the number of cell surface glucose transpo"

The SsbB protein, in contrast, is a smaller protein that is specifically induced during natural transformation and has no counterpart in E. coli. In this report, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding properties of the SsbA and SsbB proteins were examined and compared with those of the SsbEc protein.

These results represent the first analysis of paralogous SSB proteins from any bacterial species and provide a foundation for further investigations into the biological roles of these proteins. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a naturally transformable Gram-positive bacterium that is able to take up DNA from its environment and incorporate this exogenous DNA into its chromosome (1Claverys J.P. Prudhomme M. Mortier-Barriere I. Martin B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This process, known as transformational recombination, serves as a general mutational mechanism that allows S. pneumoniae to change its genetic composition in response to environmental changes and stresses (1Claverys J.P. Prudhomme M. Mortier-Barriere I. Martin B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The transformational recombination reaction involves the assimilation of a single-stranded form of the exogenous DNA into a homologous region of the double-stranded S. pneumoniae chromosome (1Claverys J.P. Prudhomme M. Mortier-Barriere I. Martin B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An inspection of the genome sequence reveals that S. pneumoniae has two single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) proteins, designated SsbA and SsbB (see Fig. 1A). The SsbA protein (17,350 Da, 156 amino acids) is similar in size and sequence to the extensively studied SSB protein from Escherichia coli (18,874 Da, 178 amino acids), a non-sequence-specific ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ϕX, bacteriophage ϕX174.-binding protein that is involved in many aspects of DNA metabolism in E. coli (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The SsbB protein (14,926 Da, 131 amino acids), in contrast, is a smaller protein that is specifically induced during natural transformation in S. pneumoniae (3Peterson S.N. Sung C.K. Cline R.

These results suggest that the SsbA protein may be a general SSB protein involved in routine DNA functions (analogous to the E. coli SSB protein), and that the SsbB protein may be a specialized SSB protein used primarily during transformational recombination. This idea is consistent with a recent analysis of the genome sequences of 69 different bacterial species, which revealed that those naturally transformable Gram-positive bacteria that are closely related to S. pneumoniae (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) contain two ssb-like genes, whereas the non-naturally transformable Gram-negative bacteria related to E. coli (e.g. Salmonella typhimurium) contain only a single ssb gene (4Lindner C. Nijland R. van Hartskamp M. Bron S. Hamoen L.W. Kuipers O.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have recently amplified the ssbA and ssbB genes from S. pneumoniae genomic DNA, developed efficient expression systems, and purified the S. pneumoniae SsbA and SsbB proteins to near homogeneity (Fig. 1B). In this report, the ssDNA binding properties of the S. pneumoniae SsbA and SsbB proteins are examined and compared with those of the E. coli SSB protein. The results represent the first analysis of paralogous SSB proteins from any bacterial species. Materials—S. pneumoniae SsbA protein was prepared as described (5Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch.

Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). All ssDNA concentrations are expressed as total nucleotides. Gel-exclusion Chromatography—Gel-exclusion chromatography analysis of the SSB proteins was carried out using a Superose 12-gel-exclusion column (24 ml, Amersham Biosciences) with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The SSB proteins were detected by absorbance at 280 nm, and the apparent molecular masses were determined by comparison with a standard curve that was developed using the following gel-exclusion calibration proteins: albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—The reaction solutions contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(acetate)2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the concentrations of dTn and SSB protein given in the figure legends. Reaction solutions were incubated at 37 °C, as indicated in the figure legends. Aliquots (20 μl) were removed from each reaction solution and added to 2 μl of gel-loading solution (0.25% bromphenol blue, 40% sucrose). The aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel using a Tris borate/EDTA buffer system (45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.5)/1 mm EDTA). Bands corresponding to unbound and SSB-bound dTn oligomers were visualized by autoradiography (these reactions contained 32P-end-labeled dTn oligomers), and bands corresponding to unbound and dTn-bound SSB protein were visualized by G250 BioSafe Coomassie staining (these reactions contained only unlabeled dTn oligomers). Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—The reaction solutions contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(acetate)2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the concentrations of ϕX ssDNA and SSB protein given in the figure legends. Reaction solutions were incubated at 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends. Aliquots (20 μl) were removed from each reaction solution and added to 2 μl of gel-loading solution (0.25% bromphenol blue, 40% sucrose). The aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel using a Tris borate/EDTA buffer system (45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.5)/1 mm EDTA). Bands corresponding to unbound ϕX ssDNA and the various SSB-ϕX ssDNA complexes were visualized by GelStar® nucleic acid staining. Electron Microscopy—The SsbA and SsbB proteins were incubated with ϕX ssDNA in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6)/50 mm NaCl, at a protein to DNA ratio (μg:μg) of 20:1 in a total volume of 40 μl, for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were loaded onto a 2-ml column of Bio-Gel A-50m (Agarose Bead Technologies, Tampa, FL) previously equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5)/0.5 mm EDTA. The same buffer was then used to elute the sample from the column, and 250-μl fractions were collected. Aliquots of the protein-DNA-containing fractions were mixed with a buffer containing spermidine (6Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for 3 s and quickly applied to a mesh copper grid coated with a thin carbon film, glow-charged shortly before sample application. Following adsorption of the samples to the electron microscopy support for 2–3 min, the grids were subjected to a dehydration procedure in which the water content of the washes was gently replaced by a serial increase in ethanol concentration to 100% and then air-dried. The samples were then rotary shadowcast with tungsten at 10–7 torr and examined in a Tecnai G2 TEM instrument at 40 kV. Images of the SsbA-ϕX ssDNA and SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes were captured using a Gatan ultrascan US4000SP digital camera, and panels were arranged using Adobe Photoshop. The estimates of the relative areas of the SsbA-ϕX ssDNA and SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes were derived from the electron microscopy images using the NIH Image software. Oligomerization State of the SsbA and SsbB Proteins—The E. coli SSB protein (SsbEc) forms a stable tetramer in solution, and it is the tetrameric form of the protein that binds to ssDNA (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Therefore, before examining the ssDNA binding properties, the oligomerization states of the S. pneumoniae SsbA and SsbB proteins were determined by gel-exclusion chromatography. In the gel-exclusion analysis, the SsbEc protein eluted as a single peak at a position corresponding to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼72,400 Da (chromatograph not shown). This is in agreement with the calculated value of 75,496 Da for the SsbEc tetramer (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, the SsbA and SsbB proteins also eluted as single peaks at positions corresponding to proteins with apparent molecular masses of ∼63,300 and 54,100 Da, respectively (chromatographs not shown). These values are close to the calculated values of 69,400 and 59,704 Da for the SsbA and SsbB tetramers. These results indicate that the SsbA and SsbB proteins also form stable tetramers in solution, and it will therefore be presumed in the discussion below that it is the tetrameric form of these proteins that binds to ssDNA as well. Binding of SSB Proteins to dTn Oligomers—The ssDNA binding activities of the SsbA and SsbB proteins were compared with those of the SsbEc protein using a series of dTn oligomers ranging in size from n = 35–100. In these experiments, a fixed concentration of dTn was incubated with various concentrations of SSB protein, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. dT50—The binding of the various SSB proteins to dT50 is shown in Fig. 2. The amount of dT50 that was bound to SsbEc protein increased with increasing protein concentration until all of the dT50 was incorporated into an SsbEc-dT50 complex. Increasing the SsbEc concentration further did not result in the formation of any additional complexes. A similar pattern of binding was observed when the SsbA and SsbB proteins were added to dT50 (Fig. 2). Although the mobilities of the complexes that were formed with the various SSB proteins were different (presumably because of the difference in the sizes of the proteins), the dependence of complex formation on protein concentration was similar for the three proteins. These results indicated that each of the SSB proteins binds to dT50 to form a complex in which a single SSB tetramer is bound to dT50. Similar results were obtained for all three SSB proteins with the shorter oligomer, dT35 (data not shown). To evaluate the relative binding efficiencies of the SsbA and SsbB proteins, a set of reactions was carried out in which dT50 was incubated with a saturating concentration of either SsbA or SsbB protein alone or with a saturating concentration of each protein simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 3, either SSB protein alone was able to complex all of the dT50 in the reaction solution. When dT50 was incubated with both SsbA protein and SsbB protein simultaneously, bands corresponding to both the SsbA-dT50 and the SsbB-dT50 complex were observed. The intensity of the band corresponding to the SsbB-dT50 complex appeared to be somewhat more intense than that for the SsbA-dT50 complex, suggesting that the binding of the SsbB protein was more favorable under these reaction conditions. Furthermore, a similar distribution of the SsbA-dT50 and SsbB-dT50 complex bands was observed when dT50 was incubated with a saturating concentration of SsbA protein prior to the addition of SsbB protein or when dT50 was incubated with a saturating concentration of SsbB protein prior to the addition of SsbA protein (Fig. 3). These results indicated that even if dT50 was fully complexed by one of the SSB proteins prior to the addition of the second SSB protein, the SsbA and SsbB proteins were able to exchange on dT50 to generate a mixture containing both the SsbA-dT50 and SsbB-dT50 complexes. An additional set of reactions was carried out to assess the binding efficiencies of the SsbA and SsbB proteins, relative to that of the SsbEc protein. As shown in Fig. 3, when a saturating concentration of both SsbA and SsbEc protein was added to dT50, bands corresponding to both the SsbA-dT50 and SsbEc-dT50 complex were observed. The intensity of the SsbA-dT50 complex band was greater than that of the SsbEc-dT50 complex band regardless of the order of addition of the two proteins, suggesting that the binding of the SsbA protein was more favorable under these reaction conditions. The difference was more pronounced when a saturating concentration of both SsbB and SsbEc protein was added to dT50. In this case, the intensity of the SsbB-dT50 complex band was clearly greater than that of the SsbEc-dT50 band regardless of the order of addition of the two proteins, indicating that the binding of the SsbB protein was more favorable under these reaction conditions (Fig. 3). dT75—The binding of the various SSB proteins to dT75 is shown in Fig. 4. The amount of dT75 that was bound to SsbEc protein increased with increasing protein concentration until all of the dT75 was incorporated into an SsbEc-dT75 complex. In contrast to the results that were obtained with dT50, however, a further increase in the SsbEc protein concentration resulted in the disappearance of the initial complex and the appearance of a new complex of even lower gel mobility (Fig. 4). A similar pattern of binding was observed when SsbA protein was added to dT75 (Fig. 4). These results indicated that a second tetramer of SsbEc or SsbA protein was able to bind to dT75 at the higher protein concentrations. This conclusion is consistent with recent biophysical studies, which showed that the SsbEc protein forms a complex with one SsbEc tetramer bound to dT70 at lower binding densities and a complex with two SsbEc tetramers bound to dT70 at higher binding densities (7Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11611-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By comparison, when increasing concentrations of SsbB protein were added to dT75, an initial complex was formed at the same protein concentration that was observed for the formation of the first complex with the SsbEc and SsbA proteins (Fig. 4). In contrast to the results with the SsbEc and SsbA proteins, however, increasing the SsbB protein concentration further did not result in the formation of any additional complexes (Fig. 4). These results indicated that only a single tetramer of the SsbB protein was able to bind to dT75, even at the highest protein concentrations examined. Similar results were obtained for all three SSB proteins with the shorter oligomer, dT65 (data not shown). To further evaluate the binding of the SSB proteins to dT75, an additional set of experiments was carried out in which the polyacrylamide gels were treated with Coomassie stain to indicate the relative amounts of SSB protein present in various complexes. As shown in Fig. 5, the staining intensities of the bands that were formed by the SsbEc and SsbA proteins were consistent with there being approximately twice as much protein in the second complex (complex II) as in the first complex (complex I). Moreover, SsbEc or SsbA protein concentrations above that necessary to convert all of the dT75 into the second complex led to the appearance of a new staining band, which corresponded to excess unbound protein (Fig. 5). By comparison, concentrations of SsbB protein above that necessary to convert all of the dT75 into the first complex (complex I) did not result in the appearance of a new complex band but did lead to the appearance of a new staining band that corresponded to excess unbound SsbB protein (Fig. 5). These results provide further support for the conclusion that two tetramers of either SsbA or SsbEc protein, but only one tetramer of SsbB protein, were able to bind to dT75. dT100—The binding of the various SSB proteins to dT100 is shown in Fig. 6. The amount of dT100 that was bound to SsbB protein increased with increasing protein concentration until all of the dT100 was incorporated into an SsbB-dT100 complex. In contrast to the results with dT50 and dT75, however, a further increase in the SsbB protein concentration resulted in the disappearance of the initial complex and the appearance of a new complex of even lower mobility (Fig. 6). This result indicated that a second tetramer of SsbB protein was able to bind to dT100 at higher protein concentrations. By comparison, when increasing concentrations of SsbA protein were added to dT100, an initial complex and a second complex were formed at protein concentrations similar to those observed for the formation of the first and second complexes with the SsbB protein. However, a further increase in SsbA protein concentration resulted in the disappearance of the second complex and the appearance of a third complex of even lower mobility (Fig. 6). A similar pattern of binding was observed when SsbEc protein was added to dT100 (Fig. 6). These results suggested that three tetramers of SsbA or SsbEc protein, but only two tetramers of SsbB protein, were able to bind to dT100. Binding of SSB Proteins to ϕX ssDNA—The binding of the various SSB proteins to the long naturally occurring circular ϕX ssDNA (5386 nucleotides) was also examined. In these experiments, a fixed concentration of ϕX ssDNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of SSB protein, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. When increasing concentrations of SsbEc protein were added to ϕX ssDNA, there was a progressive decrease in the mobility of the ϕX ssDNA until a discrete slower moving complex was observed at higher SsbEc protein concentrations (Fig. 7). A similar pattern of binding was observed when SsbA protein was added to ϕX ssDNA (Fig. 7). These results are similar to agarose gel shift results that have been reported previously for the SsbEc protein (8Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and reflect the binding of increasing amounts of SSB protein until the ϕX ssDNA is saturated with SSB protein. In contrast, when increasing concentrations of SsbB protein were added to ϕX ssDNA, there was an increase in the mobility of the ssDNA until a discrete faster moving complex was observed at higher SsbB protein concentrations (Fig. 7). In a parallel experiment, ϕX ssDNA was first incubated with SsbB protein (to form the faster moving complex) and then treated with SDS (to remove the SsbB protein from the ssDNA) before loading onto the agarose gel. In this case, intact circular ϕX ssDNA was recovered, demonstrating that the formation of the faster moving complex was not because of degradation of the ϕX ssDNA (data not shown). In addition, when the agarose gels were treated with Coomassie stain, unbound SsbB protein was found to migrate more slowly than unbound SsbA protein (consistent with the calculated pI values of the SsbA protein (pI = 5.2) and SsbB protein (pI = 6.0)). This indicated that the rapid migration of the SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes was not due simply to an increased mobility of the SsbB protein relative to that of the SsbA protein (data not shown). Furthermore, a similar pattern of results was obtained for all three SSB proteins when the agarose gels were run using a Tris acetate buffer system in place of the Tris borate buffer system, showing that the difference in binding patterns was not specific to the gel-running buffer (data not shown). Finally, a similar pattern of results was obtained for all three SSB proteins when circular M13 mp18 ssDNA (7249 nucleotides) was used in place of circular ϕX ssDNA, demonstrating that the formation of the faster moving complex by the SsbB protein was not specific to ϕX ssDNA (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that the complexes that were formed with ϕX ssDNA by the SsbB protein were different from those formed by the SsbA and SsbEc proteins. The complexes that were formed by the SsbA and SsbB proteins with ϕX ssDNA were also examined by electron microscopy (Fig. 8). The results (obtained with saturating concentrations of the SSB proteins) showed that the SsbA protein formed open circular complexes in which the ϕX ssDNA was almost completely covered by extended tracts of SsbA protein. These complexes are similar to those that have been reported previously for the SsbEc protein (9Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Griffith J.D. Harris L.D. Register III, J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are consistent with the similar DNA binding patterns that were obtained for the SsbA and SsbEc proteins in the agarose gel-shift assays (Fig. 7). In contrast, the complexes that were formed by the SsbB protein were highly condensed in appearance and contained numerous stem-like projections that were not prominent in the SsbA complexes (Fig. 8). Furthermore, an analysis of the electron microscopy images revealed that the projected surface area of the SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes was 30% smaller than that of the SsbA-ϕX ssDNA complexes, indicating that there was less protein bound in the SsbB complexes than in the SsbA complexes. The condensed appearance of the SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes is presumably related to the anomalous mobilities that were observed for these complexes in the agarose gel-shift assays (Fig. 7). Because the SsbA and SsbB proteins appeared to form different types of complexes with ϕX ssDNA, an additional set of experiments was carried out to examine the complexes that would be formed if SsbA and SsbB protein were added together to ϕX ssDNA. In these experiments, ϕX ssDNA was incubated with a saturating concentration of either SsbA protein or SsbB protein alone, or with a saturating concentration of each protein simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 9A, the SsbA and SsbB proteins alone were able to convert all of the ϕX ssDNA in the reaction solution to the discrete slower or faster moving complexes, respectively. When ϕX ssDNA was incubated with SsbA and SsbB protein simultaneously, however, a single discrete slower moving complex was observed with a mobility that was identical to that of the complex formed with the SsbA protein alone (Fig. 9A). This single slower moving complex was observed even when the ϕX ssDNA was incubated with a saturating concentration of SsbA protein prior to the addition of SsbB protein, or when the ϕX ssDNA was incubated with a saturating concentration of SsbB protein prior to the addition of SsbA protein (Fig. 9A). These results indicated that either the SsbA protein was binding preferentially over the SsbB protein to form a complex with the ϕX ssDNA that contained only SsbA protein or that the SsbA and SsbB proteins were binding together to form a mixed SsbA/SsbB complex with the ϕX ssDNA that had a mobility indistinguishable from that of the complex formed with SsbA protein alone. To distinguish between these possibilities, ϕX ssDNA was incubated with a saturating concentration of either SsbA protein or SsbB protein alone, or with a saturating concentration of each protein simultaneously. The resulting complexes were then isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 9B, the slower moving complex that was formed in the presence of a mixture of SsbA and SsbB protein contained approximately equal amounts of the two proteins. Furthermore, the intensities of the bands corresponding to the SsbA and SsbB proteins were approximately one-half of the intensities of the SsbA and SsbB bands that were obtained from the complexes formed with SsbA or SsbB protein alone (Fig. 9B). These results indicated that although the complex that was formed in the presence of a mixture of SsbA and SsbB protein had a gel mobility that was indistinguishable from the complex formed with SsbA protein alone, the complex did contain approximately equal amounts of SsbA and SsbB protein bound to the ϕX ssDNA. The polyacrylamide gel shift results indicated that the SsbEc, SsbA, and SsbB proteins each bind to the shorter oligomer, dT50, to form a complex in which a single SSB tetramer is bound to the ssDNA. Furthermore, the competition experiments indicated that the affinity of the SsbB protein for dT50 is higher than that of either the SsbA or SsbEc protein. However, the gel shift results indicated that two SsbEc or SsbA tetramers are able to bind to the intermediate length oligomer, dT75, whereas only a single SsbB tetramer is able to bind to this ssDNA. Similarly, the gel shift results indicated that three tetramers of SsbEc or SsbA protein are able to bind to the longer oligomer, dT100, but only two SsbB tetramers are able to bind to this ssDNA. These results indicated that the SsbB protein interacts with ssDNA in a manner that is different from that of the SsbEc and SsbA proteins. The binding of the SsbEc protein to ssDNA has been analyzed extensively (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In general, at low DNA binding densities the SsbEc protein binds in the “(SSB)65 mode” in which all four subunits of the tetramer interact with ssDNA (occluding ∼65 nucleotides of ssDNA/tetramer). At high DNA binding densities, however, the SsbEc protein binds in the “(SSB)35 mode” in which only two subunits of the tetramer interact with ssDNA (occluding ∼35 nucleotides of ssDNA/tetramer). It cannot be determined from the gel-shift assays reported here whether the SsbEc and SsbA proteins are in the (SSB)35 or (SSB)65 mode when only a single SsbEc or SsbA tetramer is bound to dT75. However, the SsbEc and SsbA proteins presumably must be in the (SSB)35 mode when two tetramers are bound to dT75 (7Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11611-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, the SsbEc and SsbA proteins presumably must be in the (SSB)35 mode when three SsbEc or SsbA tetramers are bound to dT100. The finding that only one SsbB tetramer was able to bind to dT75 and only two SsbB tetramers were able to bind to dT100 suggests that either the SsbB protein is unable to bind to the dTn oligomers in an (SSB)35-like mode or that multiple SsbB tetramers are unable to bind in close proximity on the same dTn molecule. The agarose gel shift results indicated that the SsbB protein also forms complexes with circular ϕX ssDNA that are different from those formed by the SsbA and SsbEc proteins. At saturating protein concentrations, the SsbA and SsbEc proteins each formed a discrete complex with ϕX ssDNA that migrated more slowly than unbound ϕX ssDNA during agarose gel electrophoresis. Electron microscopy showed that these slower moving SsbA complexes corresponded to open circular complexes in which the ϕX ssDNA molecules were almost completely covered by SsbA protein. These open circular complexes were essentially identical to those that were reported previously for the SsbEc protein (8Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SsbB protein formed complexes with ϕX ssDNA that migrated more rapidly than unbound ϕX ssDNA during agarose gel electrophoresis. Electron microscopy indicated that these faster moving complexes were more condensed than the open circular complexes that were formed when ϕX ssDNA was covered with SsbEc or SsbA protein. Unbound circular ϕX ssDNA appears as a condensed bush-like structure when visualized by electron microscopy because of intrastrand DNA pairing interactions (9Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The open circular appearance of the complexes that were formed by the SsbA and SsbEc proteins indicates that these proteins are largely able to destabilize and bind to the regions of the secondary structure in the ϕX ssDNA. The condensed appearance of the complexes that were formed by the SsbB protein, in contrast, suggests that it may be less effective than the SsbA and SsbEc proteins in destabilizing and binding to regions of DNA secondary structure. It is not clear, however, whether this possibility would completely account for the anomalous mobilities of the SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes that were observed by agarose gel electrophoresis; the complexes that were formed with ϕX ssDNA at subsaturating concentrations of SsbEc and SsbA protein still migrated more slowly than unbound ϕX ssDNA, whereas the complexes that were formed by the SsbB protein migrated more rapidly than unbound ϕX ssDNA across the entire range of SsbB protein concentrations examined. An alternate possibility is that the SsbB protein may differ from the SsbA and SsbEc proteins by being able to interact with two spatially separated sites on the ϕX ssDNA and this is responsible for the condensed appearance and anomalous electrophoretic mobility of the SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes. Either of these possibilities would be consistent with the electron micrographs, which indicated that there was 30% less protein bound in the SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes than in the SsbA-ϕX ssDNA complexes, and with the results that demonstrated that the SsbA and SsbB proteins are able to bind together to ϕX ssDNA to form a mixed SsbA/SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complex. The determination of the physical basis for the unusual electrophoretic behavior of the SsbB-ϕX ssDNA complexes will require further investigation. A comparison of the primary sequences reveals that the N-terminal regions of the SsbA and SsbB proteins (amino acids 1–106) are highly similar in sequence to the corresponding region of the SsbEc protein (amino acids 1–115) (Fig. 1A). Structural studies have shown that this region of the SsbEc protein contains the subunit tetramerization and ssDNA binding sites (2Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Thus, the observations that the SsbA and SsbB proteins form stable tetramers in solution and bind to shorter ssDNAs (dT35 and dT50) with efficiencies that are at least as high as that of the SsbEc protein are consistent with the high sequence similarity of the N-terminal domains of the three proteins. In addition to the core N-terminal DNA binding/tetramerization domain, the SsbEc protein also has a C-terminal acidic tail (amino acids 166–177), which is connected to the N-terminal core domain by a proline/glycine-rich spacer region (amino acids 116–165). Although the SsbA and SsbB proteins also have C-terminal acidic tails, the SsbB protein differs from the SsbA and SsbEc proteins in having a much shorter spacer region between the acidic tail and the N-terminal core domain (Fig. 1A). A recent crystal structure shows that the entire C-terminal region (spacer plus tail) of the SsbEc protein is highly disordered and extends out laterally from the N-terminal core DNA binding domain of the protein (11Savvides S.N. Raghunathan S. Futterer K. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1942-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the shorter spacer region of the SsbB protein may bring the acidic tail closer to the core DNA binding domain, and this may modulate the DNA binding properties of the SsbB protein, relative to those of the SsbEc and SsbA proteins. It is also possible that some other structural feature is responsible for the differences between the ssDNA binding properties of the SsbB protein and those of the SsbEc and SsbA proteins. The close similarity of the ssDNA binding properties of the SsbA and SsbEc proteins is consistent with the SsbA protein being the S. pneumoniae analog of the SsbEc protein, a general purpose SSB protein involved in routine DNA functions. The recent reports that the expression of the SsbB protein is strongly induced during natural transformation, on the other hand, suggest that the SsbB protein may be a specialized SSB protein that plays a direct role in this process (3Peterson S.N. Sung C.K. Cline R. Desai B.V. Snesrud E.C. Luo P. Walling J. Li H. Mintz M. Tsegaye G. et al.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1051-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). During natural transformation, exogenous dsDNA binds to a DNA uptake site on the surface of the S. pneumoniae cell. One of the strands of the exogenous dsDNA is degraded by a cell surface nuclease, whereas the remaining complementary linear ssDNA is transported into the cell interior. The linear ssDNA is then incorporated into a homologous region of the double-stranded S. pneumoniae chromosome in a RecA-dependent process (1Claverys J.P. Prudhomme M. Mortier-Barriere I. Martin B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the role of the SsbB protein is to bind to the exogenous linear ssDNA (perhaps to protect it from cellular nucleases) as it is being transported into the cell interior. If this is the case, the particular ssDNA binding properties of the SsbB protein may reflect adaptations, which optimize the ability of the SsbB protein to carry out this function. It is also possible that the SsbB protein acts as an accessory protein for various recombination proteins during the assimilation of the exogenous ssDNA into the S. pneumoniae chromosome. In this regard, several studies have indicated that the C-terminal region of the SsbEc protein may be involved in the interaction of the SsbEc protein with a host of other proteins that are involved in various aspects of DNA metabolism in E. coli. The similar length of the C-terminal region of the SsbA protein is consistent with the idea that the SsbA protein plays a role in S. pneumoniae that is analogous to that of the SsbEc protein in E. coli. The shorter C-terminal region of the SsbB protein, on the other hand, may not only modify the ssDNA binding properties, but may also alter the spectrum of protein-protein interactions that are available to the SsbB protein and enable it to function more effectively in conjunction with various recombination proteins during natural transformation.

The formation of this complex may be important for modulation of the processing and function of APP. APP is proteolytically cleaved at multiple sites. The cleavages and their regulation are of central importance in the pathogenesis of dementias of the Alzheimer type. In cell cultures and perhaps in vivo, secretion of the α-cleaved APP ectodomain (sAPPα) is the major pathway in the most cells. Regulation of the process may require extracellular/intracellular cues. Neither extracellular ligands nor intracellular mediators have been identified, however. Here, we show novel evidence that the major isoform of FE65 (97-kDa FE65, p97FE65) can be converted to a 65-kDa N-terminally truncated C-terminal fragment (p65FE65) via endoproteolysis. The cleavage region locates immediately after an acidic residue cluster but before the three major protein-protein binding domains. The cleavage activity is particularly high in human and non-human primate cells and low in rodent cells; the activity appears to be triggered/enhanced by high cell density, presumably via cell-cell/cell-substrate contact cues. As a result, p65FE65 exhibits extraordinarily high affinity for APP (up to 40-fold higher than p97FE65) and potent suppression (up to 90%) of secretion of sAPPα. Strong p65FE65-APP binding is required for the suppression. The results suggest that p65FE65 may be an intracellular mediator in a signaling cascade regulating α-secretion of APP, particularly in primates.

FE65 is a multimodular adaptor protein, consisting of three major protein-protein interaction domains, a WW domain and two phosphotyrosine interaction domains (PID) 1The abbreviations used are: PID, phosphotyrosine interaction domain; Aβ, β-amyloid peptides; AICD, APP intracellular domain; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; ARC, acidic-residue cluster; CTF, APP C-terminal fragments; DAT, dementias of the Alzheimer type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; p97FE65, major full-length FE65 isoform; p97FE65a2, minor full-length FE65 isoform generated by alternative splicing; p65FE65, 65-kDa N-terminally truncated C-terminal fragment derived from p97FE65; p65FE65a2, 65-kDa N-terminally truncated C-terminal fragment derived from p97FE65a2; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; sAPPα, secreted α-cleaved APP ectodomain; HA, hemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: PID, phosphotyrosine interaction domain; Aβ, β-amyloid peptides; AICD, APP intracellular domain; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; ARC, acidic-residue cluster; CTF, APP C-terminal fragments; DAT, dementias of the Alzheimer type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; p97FE65, major full-length FE65 isoform; p97FE65a2, minor full-length FE65 isoform generated by alternative splicing; p65FE65, 65-kDa N-terminally truncated C-terminal fragment derived from p97FE65; p65FE65a2, 65-kDa N-terminally truncated C-terminal fragment derived from p97FE65a2; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; sAPPα, secreted α-cleaved APP ectodomain; HA, hemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.

Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The interaction between FE65 and APP mainly takes place between the C-terminal PID (PID2) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), although other regions may also potentially contribute to the action. The physiological effects of FE65-APP complexes are not well understood. Genetic evidence suggests that strong FE65-APP binding was favored by natural selection during animal evolution toward human lineage (3.Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). APP is a widely studied protein because of its role in the pathogenesis of dementias of the Alzheimer type (DAT). FE65 is predominantly expressed in central nervous system neurons, and its expression is regulated during development and aging, with high levels corresponding to the timing of neural tissue formation and high neuronal activity (4.Simeone A.

Selective knockout of the p97FE65 isoform results in modest impairments in learning but severe deficits in relearning spatial tasks (8.Wang B. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Shimizu K. Ware C.B. Liggitt D.H. Jin L.W. Cool B.H. Storm D.R. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These phenotypes reflect reduced synaptic plasticity. Thus, the APP-FE65 pathway may play roles in normal and abnormal cognitive functions. In addition to binding to AICD, FE65 can also interact, at least in vitro, with several other proteins through its WW and PID1 domains (1.Russo T. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Zambrano N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2.King G.D. Turner R.S. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). FE65 is able to translocate between the nucleus and cytoplasm, consistent with the distinct locations of its multiple binding partners. Through these protein-protein interactions, FE65 may impact upon APP processing (9.Ando K. Iijima K.I. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

Res. 2004; 75: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As a type I transmembrane protein, APP can undergo serial proteolytic processing at sites within or near the transmembrane domain; dysfunction of the process is thought to be the underlying mechanism of DAT (20.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar, 21.Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). APP processing involves at least two consecutive cleavages. Cleavages by α- or β-secretases release large soluble ectodomains, sAPPα or sAPPβ, into extracellular environments and leave small C-terminal fragments retained in membranes. These membrane-bound fragments may be further cleaved by γ-secretases leading to release and secretion of non-pathogenic p3 peptides or potentially pathogenic Aβ peptides and AICD (20.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, α-cleavage of APP is the major and ubiquitous pathway of APP metabolism in most cells. That cleavage precludes production of Aβ peptides, whereas suppression of α-cleavage of APP may potentially provide more substrates for β-secretase. The regulation of APP processing is thought to occur at the level of ectodomain shedding via extracellular or intracellular cues (22.Monning U. Sandbrink R. Weidemann A. Banati R.B. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7104-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23.Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Unlike some other γ-secretase-cleaved transmembrane proteins, the extracellular cues or ligands that are potentially responsible for the regulation of APP secretion have not yet been identified. Secretion of the ectodomains of APP in cell culture seems to occur constitutively (“by default”) (20.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar, 21.Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several lines of evidence consistently show that deletion of the AICD or introduction of mutations into this domain promotes APP secretion (24.Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kouchi Z. Kinouchi T. Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Eur. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19304-19310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This suggests that the conserved AICD may normally play a suppressive role. The regulation most likely requires interactions with AICD-binding proteins. Although AICD is rather small (only about 47 amino acid residues in length), it can be bound by more than 12 proteins and/or their family members, at least based upon in vitro evidence (2.King G.D. Turner R.S. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). FE65 is the prototypical AICD-binding protein. Despite direct binding, the impact of FE65 on secretion of APP ectodomains has been somewhat controversial (9.Ando K. Iijima K.I. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10.Guenette S.Y. Chen J. Ferland A. Haass C. Capell A. Tanzi R.E. J.

This inconsistency may be due to the results having been obtained under various experimental settings; it may also reflect the intrinsic complexity of the FE65 molecule and the cellular environments with which FE65 interacts in different biological contexts. We now demonstrate that p97FE65 can undergo endoproteolysis, leading to production of p65FE65. p65FE65 exhibits extraordinarily high affinity for AICD and strong suppression of secretion of sAPPα. These results suggest a novel cellular mechanism by which secretion of sAPPα is regulated, particularly in primate cells. Cell Cultures and DNA Transfection—Cell cultures were performed as described previously (6.Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Jin L.W. Bressler S.L. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, cells were seeded at 80–90% of confluence before transfection. Transfection was mediated by polyethylenimines (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) as described previously (29.Thomas M. Klibanov A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14640-14645Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Typically, 1.2 μg of total plasmid DNAs and 6 μl of polyethylenimines were used for one well of the 12-well plates. Downstream assays were usually performed at 24–48 h after transfection. Recombinant Constructs—All human FE65 constructs were derived from previously described parental constructs (3.Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or their modifications. Double-tagged pcDNA3.1-HA-p97fe65-myc was generated by insertion of a HA tag into the N-terminal FE65 in pcDNA3.1-p97fe65-myc. The modified construct was then used for generations of deletions/mutations by site-directed mutagenesis; these were utilized for the mapping of p97FE65 cleavage sites. Various non-tagged FE65 constructs in a pcDNA3.1 vector were used for the experiments where comparisons with endogenous FE65s were needed or for APP secretion assays. The C-terminal Myc-tagged pcDNA3.1-fe65-myc constructs were generated and used for the experiments on immunocytochemical localizations or APP secretion. pGEX-APPC48, coding for a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the 48 C-terminal amino acids of the human APP, was from the previous study (3.Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). pGEX-KG-Tip60(63–454), coding for a fusion protein between GST and Tip60, was a gift from Dr. Thomas C. Sudhof (the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). pGEX-LRPC101 (4445–4544), coding for a fusion protein between GST and the 101 C-terminal residues of human low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP), was PCR subcloned from pcDNA3.1-mLRP4T100, a gift from Dr. Guojun Bu (Washington University, St Louis). Constructs of pCA-APP695, pCA-SβC, and pCA-APPΔAICD were obtained from previous studies (30.Fukuchi K. Deeb S.S. Kamino K. Ogburn C.E. Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R.T. Wight T.N. Piussan H. Martin G.M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All insert sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. A synthetic peptide containing the C-terminal 57 residues of APP (C57) was purchased from rPeptide (Athens, GA). Antibodies—Affinity-purified anti-FE65 polyclonal antibodies FE27 and FE518 were described previously (3.Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8.Wang B. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Shimizu K. Ware C.B. Liggitt D.H. Jin L.W. Cool B.H. Storm D.R. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The epitope sequences have no homology to FE65L1 and FE65L2 and are completely conserved between human and mouse. Anti-HA monoclonal 16B12, Alexa-Fluor-594–16B12, anti-Myc monoclonal 9E10 and FITC-labeled 9E10 were purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA); anti-APP-N-terminal monoclonal 22C11 and anti-Aβ1–17 monoclonal 6E10 were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); anti-β-actin monoclonal and anti-APP-C-terminal polyclonal (for immunostaining) were from Sigma); anti-APP-C-terminal polyclonal (O443) (for Western blotting) was a generous gift from Dr. Kumar Sambamurti (the Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida) (31.Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L. Sambamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); anti-caspase-3 and anti-PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) polyclonal were from BD Biosciences; anti-cyclin B1 polyclonal was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Western Analysis and GST Pull-down Binding Assays—Western analysis was performed as described previously (3.Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8.Wang B. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Shimizu K. Ware C.B. Liggitt D.H. Jin L.W. Cool B.H. Storm D.R. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). FE65 antibodies were used at 1:20,000 dilutions; commercial antibodies were used at dilutions suggested by the manufacturers, except for antibodies 22C11 and 6E10, which were used at 1:15,000 dilutions. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (3.Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GST-APPC48 pull-down was performed in a modified binding/lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate) supplemented with EDTA-free Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) prior to use. GST-LRPC101 and GST-Tip60 pull-down were performed in LRP binding/lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with the same protease inhibitors. Fresh monkey cerebral cortex lysates (from a 10-year-old female Macaca nemestrina) were generous gifts from Dr. John Glomset (the Primate Center, University of Washington). Autopsy human brain tissues (with a post-mortem interval of ∼3 h) were from a non-demented 65-year-old female. Mouse brain tissues were from 6-month-old C57BL/6J females. The use of human subjects and animals in the study has complied with all relevant federal guidelines and institutional policies. Brain tissues were homogenized in corresponding binding/lysis buffers and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min; supernatants were used for Western analysis or pull-down assays. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed Student's t test. Immunocytochemistry—COS cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well plates. Immunostaining was conducted 24 h after transfection. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.15% Triton X-100/PBS at room temperature for 5 min, and blocked in 5% fetal bovine serum/PBS-T (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. For staining APP, cells were incubated with 22C11 or anti-APP-C-terminal polyclonal antibody at 1:500 dilutions in 1% fetal bovine serum/PBS-T at room temperature for 30–60 min. After washes with PBS-T, cells were incubated with an Alexa-Fluor-568-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:200 dilutions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For staining Myc-tagged FE65s or HA-tagged mLRP4, FITC-9E10 or Alexa-Fluor-594–16B12 was used at 1:200 dilutions. Samples were mounted in a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole medium and visualized by standard immunofluorescence microscopy with the facilities provided by the Keck Center at the University of Washington. An N-terminally Truncated C-terminal FE65 Fragment Exhibits High Affinity for AICD—In previous experiments, we observed an ∼65-kDa protein fragment that could be pulled down together with p97FE65 by GST-APPC48 and recognized by an FE65-specific antibody FE518 (3.Hu Q. Cool B.H. Wang B. Hearn M.G. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The results suggested that the fragment might be a truncated FE65. To map the fragment, a double-tagged neuronal isoform p97FE65 cDNA was generated (Fig. 2A) and expressed in COS cell cultures. Western analysis revealed that the 65-kDa fragment could be recognized by antibodies specific to C-terminal epitopes (FE518 or Myc) but not by those specific to N-terminal epitopes (HA and FE27) (Fig. 1A), indicating that it contains the distal two-thirds of the C-terminal region of p97FE65. We named the fragment p65FE65. Endogenous p65FE65 protein bands were also detected in cerebral cortex lysates of freshly prepared monkey brain (Fig. 1B) and in lysates prepared from human and non-human primate confluent cell cultures, including COS cells and a brain neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH (Fig. 1D). Similar results were also observed in HEK cells and brain neuroblastoma cell lines IMR32 and MC65 (data not shown). In contrast, endogenous p65FE65 was rarely detected in lysates of the counterpart tissues/cell cultures from rodents, although these tissues/cells expressed relatively abundant p97FE65 (Fig. 1, B and D). The results suggest that p65FE65 is predominantly produced in primates. The endogenous p65FE65 fragments could also be dramatically enriched by GST-APPC48 pull-down (Fig. 1, C and E, compare with Fig. 1, B and D), as ratios of p65FE65/p97FE65 were increased 10–40-fold after the treatments (Fig. 1F, left). The enrichments were not because of an AICD-induced event because p65FE65/p97FE65 ratios were not changed during incubation with GST-APPC48 (Fig. 1G). These results suggest that p65FE65 has extraordinarily high affinity for AICD. Although Western analysis of lysates prepared from autopsy human cerebral cortexes detected neither p97FE65 nor p65FE65 bands (data not shown), GST-APPC48 pull-down enriched the p65FE65 bands (Fig. 1C). To examine the interactions of p65FE65 with other binding partners, pull-down assays with GST-LRPC101 (a fusion protein between GST and the 101 C-terminal residues of human LRP) or GST-Tip60 (a fusion protein between GST and Tip60) were also performed. Both LRP and Tip60 have previously been shown to bind the PID1 domain (13.Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 32.Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P.

The results revealed that the p65FE65 (but not p97FE65) bands were also enriched by GST-LRPC101 or GST-Tip60 pull-down but not by incubation with these fusion proteins alone (controls) (Fig. 1F, right). A reasonable interpretation is that the N-terminal region of p97FE65 has inhibitory functions for multiple downstream protein-protein interactions; removal of this region is apparently responsible for the great enhancement of these bindings. A previously described 60-kDa p60FE65 detected in mouse brain tissues (8.Wang B. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Shimizu K. Ware C.B. Liggitt D.H. Jin L.W. Cool B.H. Storm D.R. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was also detected in non-human primates and human brain tissues (Fig. 1, B and C). Although both p60FE65 and p65FE65 are N-terminally truncated C-terminal fragments, p60FE65 is generated by alternative translation downstream of exon 2 and is rarely detected in cell cultures. In contrast, p65FE65 is generated by endoproteolytic cleavage within a region encoded by exon 2 (see below) and can be detected in confluent cultures. Because p60FE65 lacks part of the WW domain, this isoform may not have the same functional roles as p65FE65 does. 2B. H. Cool, Q. Hu, and G. M. Martin, unpublished observations. To investigate what caused rodent cells to produce only small amounts of p65FE65, we compared the ratios of p65FE65/p97FE65 in lysates of confluent HEK, Neuro-2a, and B103 cells expressing human or mouse p97FE65 cDNA sequences (Fig. 1H). The results suggest that neither rodent protein sequences nor cell environments favor the production of p65FE65. p65FE65 Is a Cleaved Product of p97FE65—Because p65FE65 is also produced from the cDNA construct coding for p97FE65, it is unlikely to be a product of alternative splicing. Instead, the fragment might be generated via endoproteolytic cleavage of p97FE65 or alternative translation from the p97FE65 open reading frame. To determine which mechanism is responsible for generation of p65FE65, we mapped the N terminus of p65FE65. Initial efforts at microsequencing of affinity-purified p65FE65 were unsuccessful because of N-terminal blockage. As an alternative approach, deletion (Δ) analysis was performed using a panel of mutant constructs generated from the pcDNA3.1-HA-p97fe65-myc (wild type) (Fig. 2A). The results showed that Δ (residues) 131–180 reduced the size of the larger band but did not affect the production of p65FE65, whereas Δ212–261 reduced the sizes of both the p65FE65 and p97FE65 bands, suggesting that the N terminus is located downstream of residue 180 but upstream of residue 212 (Fig. 2B). This assumption was confirmed by Δ171–220, which completely abolished the production of p65FE65. A further smaller deletion (Δ191–220 but not Δ171–200) within this region also partially disrupted generation of p65FE65 but resulted in some minor nonspecific bands (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, when deletion regions were smaller than 15 residues (Δ178–189, Δ186–199, Δ195–209, and Δ206–215) within this region, no significant interference occurred (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that generation of p65FE65 requires a specific secondary or tertiary structure. Large deletions might disturb the conformation, whereas small ones might not significantly perturb the structure. The results suggest the possibility of heterogeneous proteolytic cleavages at multiple sites within a small region rather than that of alternative translation, which usually involves initiation from a definite codon. A combination analysis of the results of Δ 131–180, Δ171–220, Δ212–261, and Δ191–220 suggests that the putative cleavage site most likely is located between residues 191 and 212, although Δ171–220 showed the most efficient interruption. The endoproteolytic cleavage hypothesis was further tested by a frameshift mutation (a single T insertion) introduced to residue 106 (FS106) that resulted in the premature termination of p97FE65 translation at residue 118, upstream of the putative cleavage site(s) (Fig. 2A). In addition to the premature termination of p97FE65, the mutation would also lead to two mutually exclusive outcomes: (a) uninterrupted expression of p65FE65, indicating that p65FE65 was generated by alternative translation from an internal in-frame codon; or (b) abolished expression of p65FE65, confirming that p65FE65 was generated by endoproteolytic cleavage of p97FE65. The results revealed that the frameshift mutation abolished the production of p97FE65 as well as p65FE65 (Fig. 2C, right), producing a single ∼18-kDa peptide corresponding to the size of the prematurely terminated N-terminal peptide (Fig. 2C, left). Therefore, we concluded that p65FE65 is derived from p97FE65 via endoproteolytic cleavage. In this particular experiment, we also observed an ∼28-kDa fragment corresponding to the size of the cleaved N-terminal product from the wild-type p97FE65 (Fig. 2C, left). The fragment was not often detectable (e.g. Fig. 1A), suggesting that it might be unstable. A comparative sequence analysis revealed the following. 1) FE65 residues 171–220 are not conserved in FE65L1 and FE65L2, members of the FE65 family. Thus, the endoproteolytic cleavage at this site is a unique feature"
https://openalex.org/W1964731473,"A conditional null mutation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-binding protein (PBP) gene was generated to understand its role in mammary gland development. PBP-deficient mammary glands exhibited retarded ductal elongation during puberty, and decreased alveolar density during pregnancy and lactation. PBP-deficient mammary glands could not produce milk to nurse pups during lactation. Both the mammary ductal elongation in response to estrogen treatment and the mammary lobuloalveolar proliferation stimulated by estrogen plus progesterone were attenuated in PBP-deficient mammary glands. The proliferation index was decreased in PBP-deficient mammary glands. PBP-deficient mammary epithelial cells expressed abundant β-casein, whey acidic protein, and WDNM1 mRNA, indicating a relatively intact differentiated function. PBP-deficient epithelial cells were unable to form mammospheres, which were considered to be derived from mammary progenitor/stem cells. We conclude that PBP plays a pivotal role in the normal mammary gland development."
https://openalex.org/W2139590595,"The PolC holoenzyme replicase of the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus pathogen has been reconstituted from pure subunits. We compared individual S. aureus replicase subunits with subunits from the Gram-negative Escherichia coli polymerase III holoenzyme for activity and interchangeability. The central organizing subunit, τ, is smaller than its Gram-negative homolog, yet retains the ability to bind single-stranded DNA and contains DNA-stimulated ATPase activity comparable with E. coli τ. S. aureus τ also stimulates PolC, although they do not form as stabile a complex as E. coli polymerase III·τ. We demonstrate that the extreme C-terminal residues of PolC bind to and function with β clamps from different bacteria. Hence, this polymerase-clamp interaction is highly conserved. Additionally, the S. aureus δ wrench of the clamp loader binds to E. coli β. The S. aureus clamp loader is even capable of loading E. coli and Streptococcus pyogenes β clamps onto DNA. Interestingly, S. aureus PolC lacks functionality with heterologous β clamps when they are loaded onto DNA by the S. aureus clamp loader, suggesting that the S. aureus clamp loader may have difficulty ejecting from heterologous clamps. Nevertheless, these overall findings underscore the conservation in structure and function of Gram-positive and Gram-negative replicases despite >1 billion years of evolutionary distance between them."
https://openalex.org/W2012704893,"Type II DNA topoisomerases catalyze changes in DNA topology and use nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to control conformational changes required for the enzyme reaction. We examined the ATP hydrolysis activity of a bisdioxopiperazine-resistant mutant of human topoisomerase IIα with phenylalanine substituted for tyrosine at residue 50 in the ATP hydrolysis domain of the enzyme. This substitution reduced the DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the mutant protein without affecting the relaxation activity of the enzyme. A similar but stronger effect was seen when the homologous mutation (Tyr28 → Phe) was introduced in yeast Top2. The ATPase activities of human TOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) and yeast Top2(Tyr28 → Phe) were resistant to both bisdioxopiperazines and the ATPase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate. Like bisdioxopiperazines, vanadate traps the enzyme in a salt-stable closed conformation termed the closed clamp, which can be detected in the presence of circular DNA substrates. Consistent with the vanadate-resistant ATPase activity, salt-stable closed clamps were not detected in reactions containing the yeast or human mutant protein, vanadate, and ATP. Similarly, ADP trapped wild-type topoisomerase II as a closed clamp, but could not trap either the human or yeast mutant enzymes. Our results demonstrate that bisdioxopiperazine-resistant mutants exhibit a difference in the stability of the closed clamp formed by the enzyme and that this difference in stability may lead to a loss of DNA-stimulated ATPase. We suggest that the DNA-stimulated ATPase of topoisomerase II is intimately connected with steps that occur while the N-terminal domain of the enzyme is dimerized.

We suggest that the DNA-stimulated ATPase of topoisomerase II is intimately connected with steps that occur while the N-terminal domain of the enzyme is dimerized. DNA topoisomerases change DNA topology by introducing transient strand breaks in DNA. Regulated changes in DNA topology are critical for many cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, chromosome condensation, and chromosome separation prior to cell division (1Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar, 2Walker J.V. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Investig. 2002; 20: 570-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Topoisomerases are divided into two major classes: type I enzymes, which introduce transient single strand breaks in DNA, and type II enzymes, which introduce double strand breaks. Structural and biochemical studies have led to a detailed picture of how type II enzymes carry out topological changes in DNA (3Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 4Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are homodimeric enzymes with an N-terminal domain capable of binding and hydrolyzing ATP; a central domain critical for DNA breakage and rejoining; and a C-terminal domain that is not essential for enzyme activity, but that is thought to be involved in regulation of enzyme activity and localization (2Walker J.V. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Investig. 2002; 20: 570-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerase II interacts with two double-stranded DNA segments, a segment that will be cleaved by the enzyme (the G-segment) and a strand that will be passed through the cleaved strand (the T-segment). In the normal reaction cycle, the enzyme binds the G-segment; and upon ATP binding, the N-terminal domains of the subunits dimerize, which can lead to the capture of the T-segment, which passes through a double strand break in the G-segment and ultimately exits the protein clamp through a C-terminal protein “gate” (6Roca J.

Following religation of the DNA strand break, ATP hydrolysis leads to the dissociation of the N-terminal dimerization, allowing release of the G-segment or initiation of another catalytic cycle (9Olland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Structural studies by Berger and co-workers (10Classen S. Olland S. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that ATP hydrolysis may play additional roles in enzyme dynamics beside controlling the N-terminal dimerization. Topoisomerases are targeted by two classes of inhibitors. The first class of inhibitors, which include topoisomerase poisons such as etoposide, stabilize the covalent intermediate formed when the enzyme generates DNA strand breaks (15Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The second class of inhibitors, termed catalytic inhibitors, do not lead to elevated levels of protein-DNA covalent complexes. Bisdioxopiperazines are catalytic inhibitors of type II topoisomerases that stabilize the closed clamp form of the enzyme, an intermediate in which the N-terminal domains of the protein have dimerized (16Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 17Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys.

Although earlier studies suggested that bisdioxopiperazines are cytotoxic solely due to reducing in vivo enzyme activity, recent studies have suggested that the closed clamp form of the enzyme may also interfere with DNA metabolism (20Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to stabilizing the closed clamp form of topoisomerase II, bisdioxopiperazines inhibit the ATP hydrolysis activity of the eukaryotic enzymes (17Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2613-2618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In studies with N-terminal fragments of human topoisomerase IIα, bisdioxopiperazines inhibited the ATP hydrolysis activity of these truncated proteins, although the extent of inhibition was less than that observed with the full-length protein, suggesting that protein domains outside of the N terminus influence bisdioxopiperazine inhibition (22Hu T.

A. 2003; 100: 10629-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) reported the first x-ray crystal structure of the ATP hydrolysis domain of a eukaryotic type II topoisomerase. The 1.9-Å structure of the ATPase domain of yeast topoisomerase II in complex with the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187 identified residues involved in the enzyme-drug interaction. The crystal structure of a bisdioxopiperazine bound to the ATPase domain provided a rationale for many of the bisdioxopiperazine-resistant mutations in human topoisomerase IIα that had been identified previously (24Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Holm B. Oliveri R.S. Kenwrick S. Creighton A.M. Nitiss J.L. Jensen P.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1460-1468PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Jensen P.B. Falck J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although some of the mutations clearly have the potential to alter drug binding, others also affect nucleotide binding and may alter the stability of the N-terminal dimerization. To understand in greater biochemical detail the action of bisdioxopiperazines on eukaryotic topoisomerase IIα, we began to characterize the ATP hydrolysis activity of the bisdioxopiperazine-resistant mutants. In this study, we describe the ATPase activity of hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) 1The abbreviation used is: hTOP2, human TOP2; yTop2, yeast Top2; ADPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate). and its yeast counterpart, yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe). Although the ATPase activity is bisdioxopiperazine-resistant, as expected, we also found that both mutant proteins have other alterations in their ATPase activity. Notably, both proteins have greatly diminished DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. In addition, we found that the mutant proteins are also resistant to other conditions that lead to the formation of a salt-stable N-terminal clamp. Our results indicate that the Tyr50 → Phe mutation alters the stability of the N-terminal clamp independent of effects due to bisdioxopiperazine binding and suggest that the stability of the clamp is important for the ability of the TOP2 ATPase activity to be stimulated by DNA. Chemicals—ICRF-193 was synthesized by Dr. Donald Witiak (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) as described previously (27Snapka R.M. Woo S.H. Blokhin A.V. Witiak D.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ICRF-187 was obtained from Chiron. ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. HEPES, NADH, phosphoenolpyruvate (trisodium salt hydrate), pyruvate kinase (5000 units/1.9 ml), and lactate dehydrogenase (from rabbit muscle, 8333 units/ml) were purchased from Sigma. Sodium orthovanadate was purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmids—Plasmid pCM1 was used for the expression of human topoisomerase IIα (28Walker J.V. Nitiss K.C. Jensen L.H. Mayne C. Hu T. Jensen P.B.

Mutations were introduced into this plasmid by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to express mutant forms of human topoisomerase IIα. Yeast Top2 and the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) mutant were expressed using YEpTOP2-pGAL1 or YEptop2(Y28F)-pGAL1. Assessment of DNA-stimulated ATPase activity with closed circular DNA was carried out using plasmid pUC18. Plasmid DNA was routinely purified from bacterial cells using Qiagen kits. Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—The Tyr28 → Phe mutation was introduced into YEpTOP2-pGAL1 using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit. The two mutagenic primers used were TTCAACAGAACCGATAAAAGTGTCTGGTCTTTT and AAAAGACCAGACACTTTTATCGGTTCTGTTGAA, where the underlined nucleotides indicate nucleotides that differ from the yeast wild-type sequence. The Tyr50 → Phe mutation was introduced into pCM1 using the mutagenic primers described previously (20Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M.

All mutations generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Purification of Topoisomerase II from Yeast Cells—Human wild-type topoisomerase IIα, yeast wild-type topoisomerase II, and the mutant proteins hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) and yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) were purified from the protease-deficient strain JELt1 (trp1, leu2, ura3-52, pbr1-1122, pep4-3, his3::pGAL10GAL4, top1::LEU2) as described previously (29Nitiss J.L.

Measurement of Topoisomerase II Relaxation Activity—DNA topoisomerase II activity assays were carried out as described previously (31Jannatipour M. Liu Y.X. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18586-18592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme was added to initiate reactions containing 200 ng of supercoiled pUC18 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm ATP. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min when using human topoisomerase IIα or at 30 °C when using yeast topoisomerase II. One microliter of 10× DNA loading buffer containing 0.25% orange-G dye, 0.1 m EDTA, and 30% glycerol was added to stop the reaction. The samples were then loaded onto a 1% agarose gel, and electrophoresis was carried out using Tris acetate/EDTA buffer. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. ATP Hydrolysis Assay for Topoisomerase II—The rate of enzymecatalyzed ATP hydrolysis was measured using a coupled enzyme assay as described by Harkins and Lindsley (32Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the 1-ml reaction mixture contained 6.3 units of pyruvate kinase, 8.8 units of l-lactic dehydrogenase, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 8 mm Mg(OAc)2, 150 mm KOAc, 3.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (trisodium salt), 160 μm NADH, 10-30 nm topoisomerase II, and ATP in the presence or absence of DNA. Samples containing DNA included either salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) or pUC18 prepared using Qiagen kits. Where indicated, sodium orthovanadate or ICRF-187 was also added to the reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures were equilibrated for 2 min at the appropriate temperature, and the reactions were then initiated by the addition of ATP. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for human topoisomerase IIα or at 30 °C for yeast topoisomerase II. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was monitored spectrophotometrically for 10 min by the decrease in NADH absorbance at λ = 340 nm, and rates were calculated using the extinction coefficient for NADH of ϵ = 6.22 m-1 cm-1. Assays for Closed Clamp Formation by Topoisomerase II—Assessment of the salt-stable closed clamp conformation of topoisomerase II was carried out as described previously (6Roca J. Wang J.C.

The reaction buffer for filter binding assays with the yeast enzyme contained 150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. The reaction conditions for the human enzyme were identical, except that the KCl concentration was 100 mm. All reactions also contained 500 ng of pUC18 and 500 ng of yeast or human topoisomerase II. Where indicated, reactions contained 2 mm ATP, 4 mm ADPPNP, 3 mm ADP, 300 mm sodium orthovanadate, and/or 50 μg/ml ICRF-187 in a final volume of 100 μl. Samples were incubated at 30 °C (for yTop2) or 37 °C (for hTOP2) for 10 min before loading onto the filters. Centrex MF glass microfiber centrifugal filters (catalog number 02200, Schleicher & Schüll) were preincubated with 200 μl of reaction buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 5-10 min at room temperature. The columns were centrifuged at 40 × g for 5 min and washed twice with reaction buffer before the addition of the samples. Samples were added to the filters and incubated for 2 min before centrifugation at 40 × g for 5 min. The filters were washed three times with 200 μl of reaction buffer (low salt wash), and the eluent and low salt filtrates were combined. The filters were then washed three times with 200 μl of high salt buffer (reaction buffer containing 1 m NaCl) and three times with 200 μl of SDS wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) that has been preheated to 65 °C. The nucleic acids in each sample were precipitated with 0.7 volume of isopropyl alcohol, resuspended in 10 μl of 1× loading dye, and run on a 1% agarose gel at 95 V for 45 min. Gels were then stained with ethidium bromide, and nucleic acids were visualized under UV light. Stimulation of the DNA-dependent ATP Hydrolysis Activity of Human Wild-type Topoisomerase IIα by Linear and Covalently Closed DNA—Eukaryotic type II DNA topoisomerases exhibit ATP hydrolysis activity that is stimulated 3-17-fold by the addition of DNA (22Hu T.

The extent of stimulation depends on both the DNA concentration and the source of topoisomerase II utilized (36Halligan B.D. Edwards K.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2475-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to an examination of the ATPase activity of bisdioxopiperazine-resistant enzymes, we determined the rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by human wild-type topoisomerase IIα as a function of DNA concentration using either supercoiled closed circular plasmid or heterogeneous double-stranded linear DNA (Fig. 1). The addition of either closed circular or linear DNA led to an ∼10-fold enhancement of the rate of ATP hydrolysis. With linear DNA (Fig. 1A), the rate increased from 41 ± 16 nmol/min/mg to a maximum of 435 ± 36 nmol/min/mg at a base pair:TOP2 holoenzyme ratio of 2500. A similar result was observed using the supercoiled pUC18 plasmid (Fig. 1B). The rate of ATP hydrolysis increased to a maximum of 440 ± 41 nmol/min/mg from 40 ± 19 at a base pair:TOP2 holoenzyme ratio of 2500. Because there were no significant differences between the rates of DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis using closed circular plasmid or linear DNA, linear DNA was used in subsequent experiments to examine the ATP hydrolysis activity of topoisomerase II unless otherwise indicated. The highest rate of topoisomerase II ATP hydrolysis occurred at a base pair:TOP2 holoenzyme ratio of 2500. DNA was used in subsequent experiments to maintain a base pair:TOP2 holoenzyme ratio at 2500 when examining the DNA-dependent rate of ATP hydrolysis. The hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) Mutant and Its Yeast Counterpart Have Reduced Levels of DNA-dependent ATP Hydrolysis Activity—To assess the effect of substituting Phe for Tyr50 on the ATP hydrolysis activity, we compared the rates of DNA-independent and DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the wild-type and mutant enzymes as a function of ATP concentration (Fig. 2). Human wild-type topoisomerase IIα in the absence of DNA (Fig. 2A, open circles) and the hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) mutant (Fig. 2B, open circles) displayed similar levels of ATP hydrolysis activity. However, although DNA stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity of the hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) mutant, the stimulation was lower than that seen with the wild-type enzyme. At 1 mm ATP, the addition of DNA to the wild-type enzyme produced an ∼7-fold stimulation of the rate of ATP hydrolysis, whereas the hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) mutant showed an ∼4-fold stimulation. These results are consistent with our analysis of other N-terminal domain mutants of human topoisomerase IIα that also displayed a reduction in DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis activity (28Walker J.V. Nitiss K.C. Jensen L.H. Mayne C. Hu T. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Hsieh T. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25947-25954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 2J. Vaughn, S. Huang, I. Wessel, T. K. Sorensen, T. Hsieh, L. H. Jensen, P. B. Jensen, M. Sehested, and J. L. Nitiss, unpublished data. To further examine the effect of the Tyr50 → Phe mutation on DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, we constructed the homologous mutation in the gene encoding yTop2 and overexpressed and purified the mutant protein. As shown in Fig. 3A, the purified yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) protein had similar DNA relaxation activity compared with wild-type yTop2. This result is similar to what we observed previously for hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) (24Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Holm B. Oliveri R.S. Kenwrick S. Creighton A.M. Nitiss J.L. Jensen P.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1460-1468PubMed Google Scholar). Because the results suggested a possible defect in ATP utilization by the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) protein, we also examined relaxation at low ATP concentrations. Fig. 3B shows DNA relaxation carried out by the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) protein under the same conditions as described for Fig. 3A, but with varying ATP concentrations, and Fig. 3C shows the results obtained with wild-type yTop2. The relaxation activities of the two proteins at suboptimal ATP concentrations were not significantly different, with complete relaxation requiring an ATP concentration of ∼100 μm. The yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) protein may be slightly more active at low ATP concentrations than the wild-type protein since 50 μm ATP in the reaction led to nearly complete relaxation by the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) protein and clearly less relaxation by the wild-type protein. We then examined the DNA concentration required for maximum stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis activity of the yeast wild-type protein by titration with heterogeneous doublestranded linear DNA (Fig. 4A). We determined a maximum level of DNA stimulation using a base pair:yTop2 holoenzyme ratio of 2500 (a ratio used in subsequent experiments). Yeast wild-type topoisomerase II and the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) mutant exhibited similar levels of DNA-independent ATP hydrolysis, as shown in Fig. 4 (B and C). However, the addition of DNA to the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) mutant generated only a 1.5-fold stimulation of the rate of ATP hydrolysis at 1 mm ATP compared with the wild-type enzyme, which was stimulated ∼5-fold under the same conditions. To further characterize the effects of the Tyr50 → Phe mutation, we next determined the kinetic parameters Km(app), kcat, and Vmax for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Alterations in the binding of the nucleotide substrate may be reflected as changes in the Michaelis binding constant Km for ATP, whereas changes in other steps in the reaction could result in changes in the kinetic parameters Vmax and kcat. The rates of ATP hydrolysis as a function of ATP concentration were used to construct Lineweaver-Burk plots and to obtain values for kcat, Km, and Vmax (Table I). In the absence of DNA, human wild-type topoisomerase IIα and the hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) mutant show no significant alterations in kcat, Km and Vmax. In the presence of DNA, the kcat for the wild-type enzyme was 3.6 ± 1.1 s-1, a 7-fold difference above the level seen without DNA. These values agree reasonably with values determined previously for topoisomerase II purified from HeLa cells (33Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32696-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The kcat for hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) in the presence of DNA was 1.5 ± 0.01 s-1, significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Although there was a significant reduction in the kcat for hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe) in the presence of DNA, the Km(app) for the two proteins was similar whether DNA was present or absent.Table IKinetic parameters for ATP hydrolysis by yeast and human topoisomerase IIEnzymeVmaxKmkcat(DNA)μmol/min/mgmms−1With DNAWTaWT, wild-type. hTOP2α0.7 ± 0.20.5 ± .33.6 ± 1.1hTOP2α(Tyr50 → Phe)0.3 ± 0.0020.3 ± 0.041.5 ± 0.01WT yTop20.7 ± 0.020.3 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.1yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe)0.2 ± 0.010.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.03yTop2bValues reported by Lindsley and Wang (13) were recalculated to match the units used here.

Open table in a new tab Similar results were obtained with yeast topoisomerase II and the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) mutant. For wild-type yTop2, the kcat in the absence of DNA was 1.1 ± 0.2 s-1 compared with 1.0 ± 0.1 s-1 for yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe). These values are slightly higher than the value of 0.4 s-1 obtained by Lindsley and Wang (13Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is clear that the DNA-independent hydrolysis is not altered in the yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe) mutant. In the presence of DNA, the kcat for the yeast wild-type enzyme was 3.6 ± 0.1 s-1 compared with 1.2 ± 0.03 s-1 for yTop2(Tyr28 → Phe). As was seen with the human enzyme, the Km(app) did not change significantly between the wild-type and mutant enzymes, nor did the addition of DNA significantly alter the Km(app). Taken together, our results indicate that the mutation Tyr50 → Phe and its yeast counterpart do not change the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ATP, but likely change the rates of other steps of the reaction that influence the rate of ATP hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2049239407,"A heterodimer formed by the A14 and A43 subunits of RNA polymerase (pol) I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is proposed to correspond to the Rpb4/Rpb7 and C17/C25 heterodimers in pol II and pol III, respectively, and to play a role(s) in the recruitment of pol I to the promoter. However, the question of whether the A14/A43 heterodimer is conserved in eukaryotes other than S. cerevisiae remains unanswered, although both Rpb4/Rpb7 and C17/C25 are conserved from yeast to human. To address this question, we have isolated a Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene named ker1+ using a yeast two-hybrid system, including rpa21+, which encodes an ortholog of A43, as bait. Although no homolog of A14 has previously been found in the S. pombe genome, functional characterization of Ker1p and alignment of Ker1p and A14 showed that Ker1p is an ortholog of A14. Disruption of ker1+ resulted in temperature-sensitive growth, and the temperature-sensitive deficit of ker1delta was suppressed by overexpression of either rpa21+ or rrn3+, which encodes the rDNA transcription factor Rrn3p, suggesting that Ker1p is involved in stabilizing the association of RPA21 and Rrn3p in pol I. We also found that Ker1p dissociated from pol I in post-log-phase cells, suggesting that Ker1p is involved in growth-dependent regulation of rDNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2028899262,"Initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes requires the origin recognition complex (ORC) and other proteins that interact with DNA at origins of replication. In budding yeast, the temperature-sensitive orc2-1 mutation alters these interactions in parallel with defects in initiation of DNA replication and in checkpoints that depend on DNA replication forks. Here we show that DNA-damaging drugs modify protein-DNA interactions at budding yeast replication origins in association with lethal effects that are enhanced by the orc2-1 mutation or suppressed by a different mutation in ORC. A dosage suppressor screen identified the budding yeast co-chaperone protein Mge1p as a high copy suppressor of the orc2-1-specific lethal effects of adozelesin, a DNA-alkylating drug. Ectopic expression of Mge1p also suppressed the temperature sensitivity and initiation defect conferred by the orc2-1 mutation. In wild type cells, ectopic expression of Mge1p also suppressed the lethal effects of adozelesin in parallel with the suppression of adozelesin-induced alterations in protein-DNA interactions at origins, stimulation of initiation of DNA replication, and binding of the precursor form of Mge1p to nuclear chromatin. Mge1p is the budding yeast homologue of the Escherichia coli co-chaperone protein GrpE, which stimulates initiation at bacterial origins of replication by promoting interactions of initiator proteins with origin sequences. Our results reveal a novel, proliferation-dependent cytotoxic mechanism for DNA-damaging drugs that involves alterations in the function of initiation proteins and their interactions with DNA.

Mge1p is the budding yeast homologue of the Escherichia coli co-chaperone protein GrpE, which stimulates initiation at bacterial origins of replication by promoting interactions of initiator proteins with origin sequences. Our results reveal a novel, proliferation-dependent cytotoxic mechanism for DNA-damaging drugs that involves alterations in the function of initiation proteins and their interactions with DNA. Initiation of DNA replication is regulated by protein complexes assembled at origins of replication, the sites on chromosomes where DNA synthesis begins. In Escherichia coli, initiation complexes are nucleated by the initiator protein DnaA, which interacts with specific sequences at oriC, the E. coli chromosomal origin of replication. DnaA also interacts with and regulates origins of replication of several bacterial viruses and plasmids (1.Kaguni J.M. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 145-157PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the assembly of initiator protein complexes occurs in G1 and requires interactions between the highly conserved six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) 1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; ORC HS, ORC hypersensitive site; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate.1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; ORC HS, ORC hypersensitive site; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate. and/or other proteins and DNA (reviewed in Ref. 2.Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although the specificity of these protein-DNA interactions varies in different organisms or at different developmental stages, they are critically important to origin function. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the temperature-sensitive orc2-1 mutation alters the structure of ORC and its interactions with DNA in parallel with defects in initiation of DNA replication (3.Bell S.P.

The orc2-1 mutation also causes defects in checkpoints that depend on ORC to establish DNA replication forks (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol.

When shifted to non-permissive temperatures, the effects of the orc2-1 mutation are lethal in cells synchronized in G1 before the temperature shift, but much less lethal in cells first synchronized in S phase, and mitotic cells or non-cycling cells in G0 are refractile to these effects (3.Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Science. 1993; 262: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The lethality of the orc2-1 mutation is caused by the inhibition of origin licensing in G1 and subsequent entry into S phase and mitosis with defective checkpoints and insufficient replication forks to completely replicate the genome. This induces DNA damage and an apoptotic phenotype that includes production of reactive oxygen species and activation of a budding yeast metacaspase. 3M. Weinberger, P. A. Trabold, L. Feng, and W. C. Burhans, submitted for publication.3M. Weinberger, P. A. Trabold, L. Feng, and W. C. Burhans, submitted for publication. A similar cell cycle-specific and proliferation-dependent pattern of lethality occurs in wild type budding yeast and human cells treated with adozelesin (8.Blanchard F. Rusiniak M.E. Sharma K. Sun X. Todorov I. Castellano M.M. Gutierrez C. Baumann H. Burhans W.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1536-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), an experimental DNA-alkylating antitumor drug that inhibits the initiation of DNA replication in both of these organisms (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8.Blanchard F. Rusiniak M.E. Sharma K.

In budding yeast, this pattern of lethality is exacerbated by the orc2-1 mutation at semi-permissive temperatures; that is, the orc2-1 mutation increases sensitivity to adozelesin when cells are synchronized in G1 before treatment, and orc2-1 cells in other phases of the cell cycle or in G0 are less sensitive to the lethal effects of this drug (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This observation contrasts with the S phase-specific lethal effects of the DNA-alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) that have been reported in checkpoint-defective mec1 and rad53 cells (9.Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the orc1-161 mutation, which also causes defects in initiation and S phase checkpoints, suppresses rather than enhances the G1-specific lethal effects of adozelesin (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that one component of adozelesin-induced lethality in budding yeast is related to effects on ORC function specifically in G1 cells that are only indirectly related to the requirement for ORC in S phase checkpoints. Many other DNA-damaging drugs exert similar proliferation-dependent and cell cycle-specific lethal effects in mammalian cells (10.Tannock I.F. Hill R.P. The Basic Science of Oncology. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1998Google Scholar). The nature of the relationship between the cell cycle and sensitivity to these cytotoxic agents remains unclear. A primary function of ORC in G1 cells of both mammals and yeast is to establish pre-replicative complexes that “license” origins of replication for subsequent initiation of DNA replication in S phase (11.Diffley J.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R367-R370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The absence of origin licensing in G0 or mitosis (12.Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and the conservation of licensing mechanisms from yeast to mammals suggested the hypothesis that some of the G1-specific and proliferation-dependent cytotoxic effects of adozelesin might be related to the inhibition of pre-replicative complex-dependent origin licensing (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, in both budding yeast and mammals adozelesin induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of Cdc6, which interacts with ORC and is required for origin licensing in all eukaryotes (8.Blanchard F. Rusiniak M.E. Sharma K. Sun X. Todorov I. Castellano M.M. Gutierrez C. Baumann H. Burhans W.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1536-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To better understand the cytotoxic effects of adozelesin and other DNA-damaging drugs, in this study we further characterized the ORC-related effects of adozelesin on viability in budding yeast. As part of this effort, we performed a dosage suppressor screen to identify S. cerevisiae genes that, when expressed at high levels, eliminate the increased sensitivity to adozelesin conferred by the orc2-1 mutation. This screen identified wild type Orc2p and the mitochondrial co-chaperone Mge1p as high dosage suppressors of the orc2-1-dependent lethal effects of adozelesin. Overexpression of Mge1p also stimulated initiation of DNA replication in both orc2-1 and wild type cells and partly suppressed the sensitivity of wild type cells to adozelesin. DNase I footprinting revealed that adozelesin and the DNA alkylating agent MMS altered the interactions of proteins with DNA at origins of replication and that the altered interactions induced by adozelesin were suppressed by ectopic expression of Mge1p in concert with binding of the precursor form of this protein to nuclear chromatin. These findings reveal a novel proliferation-dependent cytotoxic mechanism for DNA-damaging drugs that involves alterations in the function of proteins that operate at origins of replication in G1 cells. Because ORC and other initiation proteins are highly conserved, a similar mechanism may contribute to the lethal, apoptosis-inducing effects of DNA-damaging drugs in proliferating mammalian cells. Yeast Strains, Cell Cycle Synchronization, and Adozelesin Treatment—The strains employed in this study are W303 (MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11 trp1-1 leu2-3, 112 can1-100), YB0057 (W303 orc2-1), OAY660 (MATa ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 can1-100 ade2–1 bar1Δ:hisG lys2Δ::hisG leu2::ORC1 (LEU2)), and OAY661 (OAY660 leu2::orc1-161 (LEU2)). The W303 and orc2-1 strains were a gift of Bruce Stillman, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, and the orc1-161 strain was a gift of Stephen Bell, Massachussetts Institute of Technology. Cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) medium, YP galactose or YP raffinose medium in the case of strains engineered to express Mge1p from a galactose-inducible promoter after integration, or minimal medium with galactose or raffinose for strains expressing Mge1p from a plasmid. G1 arrest was obtained by culturing wild type cells for 3 h with 3 μm α-factor (Invitrogen) or 12 μm α-factor in the case of orc2-1 cells. Cells were arrested in G2/M by 2.5–3 h of treatment with nocodazole (20 μg/ml; Sigma). Adozelesin (gift of Upjohn Pharmacia, Kalamazoo, MI) was added to the media of cells cultured at 23 °C at indicated concentrations for 4 h or at 4 μm for indicated times. All cell cycle arrests were monitored and confirmed by flow cytometry. In Vivo DNase I Genomic Footprinting—The genomic footprinting technique was employed as described previously (13.Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were grown at 25 °C in YPD medium to a concentration of 1–1.5 × 107 cells/ml, arrested in the appropriate cell cycle phase, and then treated with either MMS (Sigma) or adozelesin. DNase I digestion with increasing amounts of enzyme occurred on ice for 6 min. Immediately after the lysis of cells, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. DNA concentration was estimated by gel electrophoresis and the comparison of ethidium bromide signals to 500 ng of BstEII-digested λ DNA using Alpha Imager 2200 version 5.1 (Alpha Innotech). Primer JD60 was used to detect the 2-μm origin (12.Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Primers were 5′-end-labeled with 32P. DNA sequencing samples were obtained using the Circumvent DNA sequencing kit (New England Biolabs). The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% sequencing gel, and the dried gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Viability Assays—Cells were grown in YPD or a minimal medium at the indicated temperature to a concentration of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. Cell cycle arrests were performed as described above and monitored by flow cytometry. For each data point, cells were plated in triplicate on YPD at room temperature. Viability is normalized to the viability of the cell cycle arrested cells in the absence of drug treatment. The values presented are averages of at least three independent experiments. Dosage Suppressor Assay, Cloning, and Strain Construction—A yeast genomic library (American Type Culture Collection number 37323) was transformed into YB0057 (W303 orc2-1), and transformants were exposed to 4 μm adozelesin in minimal medium at 35 °C for 4 h. These conditions were chosen based on the fact that the minimal medium and the elevated temperature maximized the lethal effects of adozelesin (first cycle survival was 0.2%). Survivors were cultured and similarly exposed to the drug to produce 98.3% cell death. Preliminary characterization of the library sequences in the survivors of the second round of drug exposure was performed by probing Southern blots with a 622-bp SalI-HindIII YEp24 fragment, which flanks the site of insertion of the library sequences. 115 colonies were screened, but only three distinct patterns were seen in the Southern blots. Representatives of these groups were re-transformed into orc2-1 cells and treated with adozelesin to ensure that resistance required plasmid sequences. To identify the library inserts, the plasmids were partially sequenced using YEp24 sequences flanking the site of insertion of the library clones as primers. The MGE1 gene and its native upstream control elements were amplified from one of these isolates by PCR and inserted into the 2 μm-based pRS426 (14.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce pMW492. A galactose-inducible MGE1-integrating plasmid (pMW509) was constructed by ligating a PCR-amplified MGE1 structural gene into the pLD3 plasmid backbone (15.Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) at a BamHI restriction site. PMW509 was linearized with NheI, transformed into W303, and integrants were selected for histidine prototrophy. Selected MGE1 integrants were verified by Southern blotting. pMW497 is an Orc2p-expressing plasmid that was constructed by excising ORC2 sequences from pJR1263 (gift of Jasper Rine, University of California, Berkeley) as a 2.8-kb SacI fragment and ligating this fragment into pRS426. Chromatin Experiments and Neutral-Neutral Two-dimensional Gels—Crude nuclei were prepared from whole cells by the procedure described in Ref. 16.Amati B.B. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar. Briefly, spheroplasts were generated with zymolyase (Seikagaku, Inc. Japan) and then disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer, and the nuclei were recovered by differential centrifugation. Crude nuclei were lysed by the addition of 1% Triton X-100. Chromatin-associated and nuclear soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation as described by Ref. 17.Frei C. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 81-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Crude lysates were prepared by bead beating in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 with one protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 5 ml of lysis buffer. 30 μg of protein from different samples were size-fractionated on 12% PAGE gels, and blotted proteins were visualized by immunodetection using an ECL kit from Amersham. Anti-Mge1p (20.Laloraya S. Gambill B.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was a gift of Elizabeth Craig (University of Wisconsin) and used at a dilution of 1:2000; the secondary antibody was anti-rabbit at 1:7000 dilution. Anti-actin was used at 1:1000 and detected with anti-goat diluted 1:2000. All other antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel analysis was performed as described previously (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using cells transformed with the empty vector pRS426 or pMW492 expressing Mge1p and grown in a minimal selective medium to maintain these plasmids. ORC-related Cytotoxic Effects of Adozelesin and MMS—We first sought to further characterize the orc2-1-dependent sensitivity of budding yeast cells to adozelesin. The orc2-1 mutation also causes greater sensitivity to MMS (6.Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and, thus, we examined the effects of this compound as well. Treatment of budding yeast cells with adozelesin or MMS caused time- and dose-dependent cytotoxic effects that were exacerbated by the orc2-1 mutation (Fig. 1, A–D). In contrast, as reported earlier for adozelesin (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), both adozelesin and MMS effects on viability were reduced rather than enhanced by the orc1-161 mutation (Fig. 1, E and F). These findings establish the existence of DNA damage effects on viability that are directly related to ORC function. To better understand the increased sensitivity of orc2-1 cells to DNA damaging agents, we performed a dosage suppressor assay to search for genes that, when expressed at high levels, would suppress the increased sensitivity to adozelesin conferred by the orc2-1 mutation. orc2-1 cells were transformed with a genomic library of budding yeast sequences cloned into a high copy number vector and subjected to multiple rounds of selection for resistance to adozelesin. Of the large number of drug-resistant colonies selected for further characterization, most harbored a single library isolate expressing the wild type ORC2 gene. Analysis of adozelesin-induced lethality in cells re-transformed with this plasmid indicated that expression of Orc2p at high levels in orc2-1 cells suppressed the orc2-1-dependent sensitivity to adozelesin (Fig. 2A; line labeled ORC2). One resistant colony harbored a different plasmid expressing two genes. Transformation of orc2-1 cells with each of these genes separately cloned into plasmids identified one of them, MGE1, as an additional dosage suppressor of the sensitivity specifically conferred by the orc2-1 mutation (Fig. 2A; line labeled MGE). High level expression of Mge1p also suppressed the sensitivity of wild type cells to adozelesin (Fig. 2B). Most of the increased sensitivity to adozelesin of orc2-1 cells occurs in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and the suppression of adozelesin sensitivity by the orc1-161 mutation also occurs specifically in G1 (5.Weinberger M. Trabold P.A. Lu M. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35975-35984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mge1p suppression of orc2-1-dependent sensitivity was also greatest in the G1 phase compared with mitosis or G0 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of DNA content in cells transformed with the empty vector control plasmid or a plasmid expressing Mge1p indicated that the expression of high levels of Mge1p caused a slight increase in the number of cells in G1 phase (Fig. 2D), similar to the findings of an earlier report (18.Stevenson L.F. Kennedy B.K. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3946-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, suppression of adozelesin cytotoxicity by Mge1p is not caused by redistribution of cells to phases of the cell cycle other than G1, where they are more refractile to the cytotoxic effects of adozelesin. orc2-1p is less stable than its wild type counterpart (7.Shimada K. Pasero P. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3236-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Suppression of orc2-1 sensitivity to adozelesin was also not related to increased stability of orc2-1p associated with the ectopic expression of Mge1p (data not shown). Binding of Unprocessed Mge1 to Chromatin in the Nucleus and Stimulation of the Initiation of DNA Replication—Mge1p is a budding yeast homologue of the E. coli co-chaperone GrpE. Mge1p cooperates with Ssc1p and Mdj1p, which are homologues of the E. coli DnaK and DnaJ proteins, to unfold other proteins in order to facilitate their import into mitochondria (19.Westermann B. Prip-Buus C. Neupert W. Schwarz E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3452-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20.Laloraya S. Gambill B.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the GrpE-DnaK-DnaJ chaperone machinery modulates initiation of DNA replication in chromosomal, bacteriophage, and plasmid replicons by modulating the interactions of initiator proteins with origin sequences (reviewed in Ref. 21.Konieczny I. Zylicz M. Genet. Eng. 1999; 21: 95-111Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although Mge1p has not been shown to reside in the nucleus of budding yeast cells, this possibility has not been excluded. The GrpE-DnaK-DnaJ paradigm in bacteria and previously described alterations in protein-DNA interactions caused by the orc2-1 mutation (4.Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6671-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) suggested that the suppression of orc2-1-dependent sensitivity to adozelesin by Mge1p might be related to its stabilization of initiator protein complex interactions with DNA. To determine whether native or ectopically expressed Mge1p can be detected in the nucleus, immunoblots of total cell, nuclear soluble, and nuclear chromatin proteins isolated from wild type cells and cells that can express a large amount of Mge1p from a galactose-inducible promoter were probed with an antibody against Mge1p. Mge1p exists in two forms; one of these is a precursor protein with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa containing a leader sequence that targets this protein to mitochondria, and the other is a processed form of apparent 21 kDa produced by removal of the leader sequence in mitochondria. Although very little of either protein was detected by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates of wild type cells grown in either raffinose or galactose in short exposures of these blots to film (Fig. 3A; lanes labeled wt-raf and wt-gal), these same short exposures detected large amounts of Mge1p in lysates from two independently isolated colonies of cells transformed with an integrating plasmid harboring galactose-inducible MGE1 when these cells were grown in galactose (Fig. 3A; lanes labeled #9-gal and #12-gal) but not raffinose (Fig. 3A; lanes labeled #9-raf and #12-raf). However, the amount of the larger, unprocessed Mge1p was significantly greater than the processed form of Mge1p in extracts of cells from the #9 compared with the #12 isolate. When grown in galactose, cells from the #9 isolate were also less sensitive to adozelesin compared with cells from the #12 isolate (Fig. 3B). Approximately equal amounts of galactose-induced processed and unprocessed Mge1p were also detected in nuclear extracts isolated from the #9 isolate cells (Fig. 3C; lanes labeled #9 NE). Because the precursor form of Mge1p is processed in mitochondria, its presence in nuclear extracts may reflect significant contamination of nuclear preparations with mitochondria, as has been observed previously (16.Amati B.B. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In fact, when nuclei from #9 isolate cells ectopically expressing large amounts of both forms of Mge1p were fractionated into soluble proteins and proteins bound to chromatin (Fig. 3C; lanes labeled #9 chromatin), most of the 21-kDa processed Mge1 induced by galactose was found in the soluble (Fig. 3C; lane labeled gal, s) fraction rather than the chromatin pellet (Fig. 3C; lane labeled p), and very little 26 kDa unprocessed Mge1 was observed in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3C; lane labeled gal, s). However, the chromatin pellet was enriched for the unprocessed, but not the processed, form of Mge1p (Fig. 3C; lane labeled gal, p). As expected, chromatin pellets, but not supernates, from cells grown in either raffinose or galactose were also enriched for Orc2p (Fig. 3C; row labeled Orc2p). The association of the unprocessed and not the processed, mitochondrion-specific form of Mge1p with chromatin indicates that this association is specific and is not related to contamination of chromatin preparations with mitochondria or mitochondrial proteins. These results are consistent with a nuclear role for ectopically expressed unprocessed Mge1p in the suppression of the cytotoxic effects of adozelesin. In the absence of DNA-damaging drugs, the initiation defect and reduced viability conferred by the orc2-1 mutation are associated with destabilized protein-DNA interactions at origins, even at semi-permissive temperatures (4.Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6671-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The bacterial GrpE-DnaK-DnaJ paradigm suggests that ectopically expressed Mge1p bound to chromatin in the nucleus might stabilize ORC interactions with DNA, which is expected to suppress the temperature sensitivity and initiation defect associated with the orc2-1 mutation. In fact, overexpression of Mge1p increased the viability of orc2-1 cells at the semi-permissive temperature of 30 °C (Fig. 3D). To determine whether this was accompanied by suppression of the orc2-1 initiation defect, we examined the effect of Mge1p overexpression on DNA replication intermediates at ORI501 in orc2-1 cells at the semi-permissive temperature of 23 °C using neutral-neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (22.Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Passive replication of a region of DNA by a single replication fork emanating from an origin of replication outside this region is detected in these gels by a “fork arc” in restriction fragments from this region, and fragments that initiate DNA replication (and thus have two replication forks) are detected in a “bubble arc” (Fig. 3E). Very few replication intermediates were detected at ORI501 in orc2-1 cells transformed with an empty vector plasmid, and those that were detected were single replication forks passively replicating this locus (Fig. 3F; section labeled orc2-1 vector). This finding is consistent with the relatively low initiation activity of ORI501 (23.Ferguson B.M. Brewer B.J. Reynolds A.E. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 507-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and defective initiation caused by the orc2-1 mutation. Significantly more replication intermediates were detected at ORI501 in orc2-1 cells transformed"
