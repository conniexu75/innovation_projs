https://openalex.org/W2147343434,"Previous microarray studies on breast cancer identified multiple tumour classes, of which the most prominent, named luminal and basal, differ in expression of the oestrogen receptor alpha gene (ER). We report here the identification of a group of breast tumours with increased androgen signalling and a 'molecular apocrine' gene expression profile. Tumour samples from 49 patients with large operable or locally advanced breast cancers were tested on Affymetrix U133A gene expression microarrays. Principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering split the tumours into three groups: basal, luminal and a group we call molecular apocrine. All of the molecular apocrine tumours have strong apocrine features on histological examination (P=0.0002). The molecular apocrine group is androgen receptor (AR) positive and contains all of the ER-negative tumours outside the basal group. Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing indicates that oestrogen signalling is most active in the luminal group, and androgen signalling is most active in the molecular apocrine group. ERBB2 amplification is commoner in the molecular apocrine than the other groups. Genes that best split the three groups were identified by Wilcoxon test. Correlation of the average expression profile of these genes in our data with the expression profile of individual tumours in four published breast cancer studies suggest that molecular apocrine tumours represent 8-14% of tumours in these studies. Our data show that it is possible with microarray data to divide mammary tumour cells into three groups based on steroid receptor activity: luminal (ER+ AR+), basal (ER- AR-) and molecular apocrine (ER- AR+)."
https://openalex.org/W2002714006,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) mutations are frequent in superficial urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC). Ras gene mutations are also found in UCC. As oncogenic activation of both FGFR3 and Ras is predicted to result in stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, we hypothesized that these might be mutually exclusive events. HRAS mutation has been widely studied in UCC, but all three Ras gene family members have not been screened for mutation in the same sample series. We screened 98 bladder tumours and 31 bladder cell lines for mutations in FGFR3, HRAS, NRAS and KRAS2. FGFR3 mutations were present in 54 tumours (55%) and three cell lines (10%), and Ras gene mutations in 13 tumours (13%) and four cell lines (13%). These included mutations in all three Ras genes; ten in HRAS, four in KRAS2 and four in NRAS and these were not associated with either tumour grade or stage. In no cases were Ras and FGFR3 mutation found together. This mutual exclusion suggests that FGFR3 and Ras gene mutation may represent alternative means to confer the same phenotype on UCC cells. If these events have biological equivalence, Ras mutant invasive UCC may represent a novel subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W2098180530,"We have demonstrated that VEGF receptor blockade in combination with chronic hypoxia causes in rats severe angioproliferative pulmonary hypertension (SAPH) associated with arterial occlusion by proliferating endothelial cells, and we postulate that the established, lumen-occluding lesions are the result of the emergence of apoptosis-resistant proliferating cells. To study the dependence of exuberant endothelial cell proliferation on initial apoptosis, we adapted the CELLMAX artificial capillary system to analyze the effects of a VEGF receptor antagonist (SU5416) on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells under pulsatile shear stress. Immunohistochemical staining for caspase-3 and PCNA and flow cytometry for Annexin-V and BrdU supported our concept, since SU5416 caused initial apoptosis (35.8% at 24 h after the SU5416 addition and 4.8% in control cells) whereas the surviving cells became hyperproliferative (PCNA positive). Flow cytometry showed that apoptosis inhibition prevented the proliferation following the initial apoptosis. These lumen-filling endothelial cells were apoptosis resistant, grew without serum, and were phenotypically altered in that they express the tumor marker survivin. Hyperproliferative apoptosis-resistant cells were also generated by adding apoptosed cells instead of the VEGF receptor blocker to the CELLMAX system. In conclusion, endothelial cell death resulted in the selection of an apoptosis-resistant, proliferating phenotypically altered endothelial cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2060151133,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core, known to be involved in liver carcinogenesis, is processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We thus investigated the impact of three HCV core isolates on ER stress, ER calcium signalling and apoptosis. We show that HCV core constructs trigger hyperexpression of Grp78/BiP, Grp 94, calreticulin and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, inducing ER stress. By using the ER-targeted aequorin calcium probe, we found that ER calcium depletion follows ER stress in core-expressing cells. HCV core induces apoptosis through overexpression of the CHOP/GADD153 proapoptotic factor, Bax translocation to mitochondria, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Furthermore, reversion of HCV core-induced ER calcium depletion (by transfection of SERCA2) completely abolished mitochondrial membrane depolarization, suggesting that both ER stress (through CHOP overexpression) and calcium signalling play a major role in the HCV core-mediated control of apoptosis. ER stress and apoptosis were also found in a proportion of HCV-full-length replicon-expressing cells and in the liver of HCV core transgenic mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that HCV core deregulates the control of apoptosis by inducing ER stress and ER calcium depletion providing new elements to understand the mechanisms involved in HCV-related liver chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2024202249,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce differentiation and/or apoptosis in a variety of cell types by activating transcription of target genes. Activation of the death receptor (DR) pathway by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis preferentially in cancer cells. Here, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide, MS-275 and trichostatin A) enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in breast cancer cells in vitro. A synergism in apoptosis was observed in both TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant cells upon sequential treatments with HDAC inhibitors followed by TRAIL. HDAC inhibitors synergized with TRAIL by inducing DRs DR4/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2 through NFkappaB activation and some of the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and engaging the mitochondrial pathway. The ability of HDAC inhibitors to sensitize TRAIL-resistant cells suggests that HDAC inhibitors may induce fundamental alterations in cell signaling pathways. Thus, the sequential treatments with HDAC inhibitors followed by TRAIL may be used as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1964662687,"Gain of chromosome 1q31-1q32 is seen in >50% of retinoblastoma and is common in other tumors. To define the minimal 1q region of gain, we determined genomic copy number by quantitative multiplex PCR of 14 sequence tagged sites (STSs) spanning 1q25.3-1q41. The most frequently gained STS at 1q32.1 (71%; 39 of 55 retinoblastoma) defined a 3.06 Mbp minimal region of gain between flanking markers, containing 14 genes. Of these, only KIF14, a putative chromokinesin, was overexpressed in various cancers by real-time RT-PCR. KIF14 mRNA was expressed in 20/22 retinoblastoma samples 100-1000-fold higher than in retina (t-test P=0.00002); cell lines (n=10) had higher levels than tumors (n=12) (P=0.009). KIF14 protein was overexpressed in retinoblastoma tumors and breast cancer cell lines by immunoblot. KIF14 was expressed in 4/4 breast cancer cell lines 31-92-fold higher than in normal breast tissue, in 5/5 medulloblastoma cell lines 22-79-fold higher than in fetal brain, and in 10/22 primary lung tumors 3-34-fold higher than in normal lung. Patients with lung tumors that overexpress KIF14 showed a trend toward decreased survival. KIF14 may thus be important in oncogenesis, and has promise as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1976617857,"TRIM5α is a cytoplasmic protein that mediates a post-entry block to infection by some retroviruses. TRIM5α contains a tripartite motif (TRIM), which includes RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains, and a C-terminal B30.2 (SPRY) domain. We investigated the contribution of the RING and B-box 2 domains to the antiretroviral activity of rhesus monkey TRIM5α (TRIM5αrh), which potently restricts infection by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus of African green monkeys (SIVagm). Disruption of the RING domain caused mislocalization of TRIM5αrh so that the cytoplasmic level of the protein was decreased compared with that of the wild-type protein. Nonetheless, partial ability to restrict HIV-1 and SIVagm was retained by the RING domain mutants. By contrast, although TRIM5αrh mutants with disrupted B-box 2 domains were efficiently expressed and correctly localized to the cytoplasm, antiretroviral activity was absent. The B-box 2 mutants colocalized and associated with wild-type TRIM5αrh and exerted dominant-negative effects on the antiretroviral activity of the wild-type protein. Taken together with other data, these results indicate that functionally defective TRIM5αrh molecules that retain a coiled coil can act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type TRIM5αrh function. The RING domain of TRIM5αrh is not absolutely required for retrovirus restriction but can influence cytoplasmic levels of the protein and thus indirectly alter function. The B-box 2 domain, by contrast, appears to be essential for efficient retrovirus restriction. TRIM5α is a cytoplasmic protein that mediates a post-entry block to infection by some retroviruses.

The B-box 2 domain, by contrast, appears to be essential for efficient retrovirus restriction. Host cell factors influence the infectivity of retroviruses. Following entry into the host cell, uncoating of the viral core, reverse transcription, nuclear access, and integration of the viral DNA into the host genome must occur to establish a permanent infection (1Arts E.J.

These species-specific restrictions occur prior to or concurrent with reverse transcription; at most, low levels of early reverse transcripts are made in restricted cells (3Himathongkham S.

The early restriction to HIV-1 and SIV is mediated by dominant host factors, the activity of which can be titrated by the introduction of virus-like particles containing proteolytically processed capsid proteins of the restricted viruses (7Cowan S.

Thus, in the cells of specific monkey species, host restriction factors apparently interact, directly or indirectly, with the HIV-1 or SIV capsid and prevent its progression along the infectious pathway. A genetic screen identified TRIM5α as a major restriction factor in monkey cells that acts on HIV-1 and, to a lesser extent, on SIVmac (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The expression of rhesus monkey TRIM5α was shown to be sufficient to confer potent resistance to HIV-1 infection in otherwise susceptible cells. Moreover, TRIM5α was necessary for the maintenance of the block to the early phase of HIV-1 infection in Old World monkey cells, as demonstrated by interference with TRIM5α expression in these cells. Differences among the sequences of TRIM5α proteins of primate species account for the different abilities to restrict infection by particular retroviruses (6Song B. Javanbakht H. Perron M. Park D.

Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The tripartite motif includes a RING domain, B-box 2 domain and coiled-coil (cc) domain; TRIM proteins have also been called RBCC proteins. TRIM proteins exhibit the propensity to assemble into cytoplasmic or nuclear bodies (24Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Many cytoplasmic TRIM proteins contain a C-terminal B30.2 or SPRY domain. Differential splicing of the TRIM5 primary transcript gives rise to the expression of several isoforms of the protein product. The TRIM5α isoform is the largest product (∼493 amino acid residues) and contains the B30.2(SPRY) domain. The B30.2(SPRY) domain of rhesus monkey TRIM5α is essential for anti-HIV-1 activity (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Moreover, the difference in the anti-HIV-1 potency of rhesus and human TRIM5α proteins is determined by B30.2(SPRY) sequences (25Stremlau M. Perron M. Welikala S. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3139-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Yap M. Nisole S. Stoye J.P. Curr.

A. 2005; 102: 2832-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). An intact RING domain also contributes, either directly or indirectly, to the anti-HIV-1 activity of rhesus monkey TRIM5α (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the contribution of the RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains to the antiviral activity of rhesus monkey TRIM5α. Plasmid Construction—The plasmids expressing the wild-type and mutant TRIM5αrh proteins were constructed using PCR-directed mutagenesis. The TRIM5αrh cDNA was PCR-amplified (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar) and digested with EcoRI and ClaI, whose sites were introduced in each of the PCR primers. These fragments were cloned into the EcoRI and ClaI site of pLPCX (Stratagene). The plasmid expressing TRIM5αrh-V5 was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified TRIM5αrh cDNA into the Viral Power plasmid using directional TOPO® cloning (Invitrogen). Creation of Cells Stably Expressing TRIM5α Variants—Retroviral vectors encoding wild-type or mutant TRIM5αrh proteins were created using the pLPCX vector (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The pLPCX vectors contain only the amino acid-coding sequence of the TRIM5α cDNA. The TRIM5αrh proteins encoded by the pLPCX vectors possess C-terminal epitope tags derived from influenza hemagglutinin (HA). Recombinant viruses were produced in 293T cells by cotransfecting the pLPCX plasmids with the pVPack-GP and pVPack-VSV-G packaging plasmids (Stratagene). The pVPack-VSV-G plasmid encodes the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G envelope glycoprotein, which allows efficient entry into a wide range of vertebrate cells. TRIM5αrh-V5 was made using the Viral Power system (Invitrogen). The TRIM5αrh-V5 protein possesses a V5 C-terminal epitope tag. Recombinant lentiviruses were produced according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The resulting virus particles were used to transduce ∼1 × 106 HeLa cells in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene. Cells were selected in either 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) or 1 μg/ml puromycin and 2 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Infection with Viruses Expressing GFP—Recombinant HIV-1, SIVmac, and SIVagm expressing GFP were prepared as described previously (6Song B. Javanbakht H. Perron M. Park D. Stremlau M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3930-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). HIV-1 viral stocks were quantified by measuring reverse transcriptase activity. For infections, 3 × 104 HeLa cells seeded in 24-well plates were incubated in the presence of virus for 24 h. Cells were washed and returned to culture for 48 h and then subjected to FACS analysis with a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Protein Analysis—Cellular proteins were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of protein by Western blotting utilized monoclonal antibodies that are specifically reactive with the HA (Roche Applied Science) or V5 (Invitrogen) epitope tags, and monoclonal antibodies to β-actin (Sigma). Detection of proteins was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using the following secondary antibodies obtained from Amersham Biosciences: anti-mouse (for V5 and β-actin) and anti-rat (for HA). Colocalization Experiments—Colocalization was studied as previously described (28Diaz-Griffero F. Hoschander S.A. Brojatsch J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12866-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown overnight on 12-mm-diameter coverslips and fixed in 3.9% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Cellgro) for 30 min. Cells were washed in PBS, incubated in 0.1 m glycine (Sigma) for 10 min, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin (Sigma) for 30 min. Samples were blocked with 10% donkey serum (Dako, Carpentaria, CA) for 30 min, and incubated for 1 h with antibodies. The anti-HA fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated 3F10 antibody (Roche Applied Science) and anti-V5 Cy3-conjugated antibody (Sigma) were used to stain HA- or V5-tagged TRIM5α proteins, respectively. Subsequently, samples were mounted for fluorescence microscopy by using the ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were obtained with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope with Nikon 60× numerical aperture 1.4 optics. Immunoprecipitations—At 48 h after transfection, 293T cells were removed from the plate and washed with PBS. 293T cells from nearly confluent 100-mm plates were lysed in 500 μl of RIPA buffer. Insoluble material was pelleted at 22,000 × g for 2 h, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of protein (∼200–500 μg, as determined by the Bio-Rad assay) were incubated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50%) and 5 μl of anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with RIPA buffer and twice with PBS. After the final supernatant was removed, 30 μlof2× sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added, and the precipitate was boiled for 5 min to release the precipitated proteins. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Role of the RING and B-box 2 Domains in Retrovirus Restriction—TRIM5αrh contains a tripartite motif that includes a RING (residues 15–59) and B-box 2 (residues 97–129) domains (19Stremlau M.

To investigate the role of these domains in retrovirus restriction, we generated rhesus monkey TRIM5α mutants with alterations affecting either one or both of these domains (Fig. 1A). The TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 protein lacks the RING domain, and the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 protein lacks the RING and B-box 2 domains. We also altered specific cysteines and histidines within these domains; these residues are critical for zinc binding and are thought to contribute to the proper folding of these domains (29Borden K.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the C15A/C18A mutant, two key cysteines within the RING domain of TRIM5αrh-HA were altered to alanines. In the C97A/H100A mutant, cysteine and histidine residues conserved among B-box 2 domains were changed to alanines. The wild-type and mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins were expressed stably in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). The TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93, C15A/C18A, and C97A/H100A mutants were expressed at levels comparable to that of the wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA protein. The TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 protein was expressed at higher levels than that of the wild-type protein. The HeLa cells expressing the wild-type and mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins were incubated with recombinant retroviruses (HIV-1-GFP, SIVmac-GFP, and SIVagm-GFP) pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein and expressing GFP. The wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA protein potently restricted HIV-1-GFP infection (Fig. 2A). Cells expressing the C15A/C18A or Δ93 mutants were less susceptible to HIV-1-GFP infection than the control cells transduced the empty pLPCX vector, although the level of restriction observed was significantly less potent than that observed in the cells expressing wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA. HIV-1-GFP infection of cells expressing the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 and C97A/H100A proteins was slightly more efficient than that of cells transduced with the empty pLPCX vector. We conclude that disruption of the RING domain partially attenuates the HIV-1-restricting activity of TRIM5αrh, whereas disruption of the B-box 2 domain completely eliminates HIV-1 restriction. One explanation for the partial anti-HIV-1 activity of the TRIM5αrh-HA RING domain mutants is functional complementation by the endogenous human TRIM5α in the HeLa cells. To investigate this possibility, the TRIM5αrh-HA C15A/C18A mutant and wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA were expressed in Cf2Th canine thymocytes. Dogs do not have a TRIM5 gene (32Song B. Gold B. Ping A. Dean M. Javanbakht H. Stremlau M. Winkler C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The Cf2Th cells were incubated with HIV-1-GFP. The wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA protein potently blocked HIV-1 infection, whereas the C15A/C18A mutant partially restricted HIV-1 (Fig. 3). The degree and pattern of HIV-1 restriction observed for the wild-type and RING domain mutant TRIM5αrh proteins in canine cells were comparable to those observed in human cells. Therefore, the partial HIV-1-restricting activity seen for RING domain mutants is not dependent upon complementation by endogenous TRIM5α. It is possible, however, that another TRIM protein in canine cells complemented the activity of the RING domain-deleted TRIM5αrh mutant. The rhesus monkey TRIM5α protein potently blocks infection by SIVagm (13Towers G. Bock M. Martin S. Takeuchi Y. Stoye J.P. Danos O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12295-12299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Bieniasz P.D. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 286-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The activities of the mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins in restricting SIVagm-GFP infection were similar to those observed for HIV-1-GFP infection (Fig. 2B). The TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 and C15A/C18A mutants slightly inhibited SIVagm-GFP infection, compared with the level of infection observed in control cells transduced with the pLPCX vector. By contrast, cells expressing the Δ132 and C97A/H100A mutants were infected more efficiently than the control cells transduced with the empty vector. As was observed for restriction of HIV-1, restriction of SIVagm by rhesus monkey TRIM5α apparently requires the B-box 2 domain and is potentiated by the RING domain. The moderate inhibition of SIVmac infection previously observed for the rhesus monkey TRIM5α protein (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar) was abrogated by disruption of either the RING or B-box 2 domain (Fig. 2C). Subcellular Localization of TRIM5αrh Mutants—The subcellular localization of the wild-type and mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins was examined by staining cells with an antibody directed against the HA epitope tag. As has been described for several TRIM proteins (24Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), TRIM5αrh-HA formed cytoplasmic bodies and also exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 4B). Compared with the wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA protein, the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 and C15A/C18A mutants exhibited less intense cytoplasmic staining. The bodies formed by TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 were larger than those of the wild-type TRIM5αrh protein, and were found in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). Cells expressing TRIM5αrh-HA C15A/C18A exhibited bodies that were larger and more numerous than those formed by the wild-type protein; the bodies formed by the C15A/C18A mutant were located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 4D). Thus, disruption of the RING domain causes significant changes in the subcellular localization of TRIM5αrh; notably, decreases in the levels of diffuse cytoplasmic staining were observed for these mutants compared with that of the wild-type TRIM5αrh protein. The TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 mutant lacking the RING and B-box 2 domains exhibited diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining; the intensity of staining was consistent with the high steady-state level of expression observed for this protein (Fig. 4E). The TRIM5αrh-HA C97A/H100A mutant exhibited a diffuse pattern of cytoplasmic staining with occasional small speckles evident (Fig. 4F). Thus, disruption of the B-box 2 domain, either alone or in combination with the RING domain, alters the pattern of TRIM5αrh localization in cells; nonetheless, the cytoplasmic levels of the B-box 2 mutants were equal to or greater than that of the wild-type TRIM5αrh protein. Dominant-negative Activity of TRIM5α Mutants—We wished to investigate whether the RING or B-box 2 mutants might exhibit a dominant-negative phenotype with respect to the antiviral function of wild-type TRIM5αrh. To this end, we transduced the HeLa cell lines expressing the wild-type or mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins with a lentivirus vector expressing a wild-type TRIM5αrh protein with a V5 epitope tag at the C terminus (TRIM5αrh-V5). The expression level of TRIM5αrh-V5 varied in the transduced cell lines (Fig. 5), possibly reflecting the effect of the initially expressed TRIM5αrh-HA proteins on transduction efficiency or on the ability of the cells to tolerate TRIM5αrh-V5 expression. To determine whether the expression of the mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins might affect TRIM5αrh-V5 function, the cell lines were incubated with different amounts of HIV-1-GFP, SIVagm-GFP and SIVmac-GFP. For all three virus infections, the percentage of GFP-positive cells in the cell lines initially containing the pLPCX vector and transduced with the vector expressing wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 was lower than that in control cells expressing only the vector (Fig. 6, A–C). For all three viruses, the percentages of GFP-positive cells were comparable for the cells initially containing the LPCX vector and the cells initially containing the RING domain TRIM5αrh-HA mutants, both of which were subsequently transduced with the vector expressing TRIM5αrh-V5. These results indicate that the RING domain mutants exert minimal dominant-negative effects on the ability of TRIM5αrh-V5 to restrict HIV-1, SIVagm, or SIVmac infection. By contrast, infection by all three viruses was more efficient in the cells initially expressing the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 and C97A/H100A mutants and subsequently transduced with the vector expressing TRIM5αrh-V5, compared with the infection of cells initially containing the empty pLPCX vector and transduced with the vector expressing TRIM5αrh-V5. In the case of SIVagm and SIVmac infections, the percentages of GFP-positive cells in the Δ132- and C97A/H100A-expressing cells transduced with TRIM5αrh-V5 were similar to those seen in the control cells containing only the empty pLPCX vector. We conclude that the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 and C97A/H100A mutants can inhibit the antiretroviral activity of the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein in a dominant-negative manner. We examined the subcellular localization of the wild-type and mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins in the cells expressing the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein by confocal microscopy (Fig. 7). The HA and V5 epitope-tagged proteins were detected by direct immunofluorescence, using anti-HA-fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-V5-Cy3, respectively. Thus, the TRIM5αrh-HA proteins exhibit green fluorescence (left panels, Fig. 7) and the TRIM5αrh-V5 proteins exhibit red fluorescence (middle panels, Fig. 7). The right panels represent overlays of the green and red fluorescence from the HA-tagged and V5-tagged TRIM5αrh proteins, respectively. The TRIM5αrh-V5 expressed in the cells with the empty pLPCX vector exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining as well as small, scattered cytoplasmic bodies (Fig. 7A), as seen previously for the TRIM5αrh-HA protein (Fig. 4B). As expected, the wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA and TRIM5αrh-V5 proteins colocalized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7B). In cells coexpressing TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 and TRIM5αrh-V5, both proteins exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 7C). Both proteins also colocalized in nuclear bodies, indicating that the coexpression of the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 mutant causes relocalization of some of the wild-type TRIM5αrhV5 protein to these nuclear structures. Minimal colocalization was observed for the TRIM5αrh-HA C15A/C18A mutant and the TRIM5αrh-V5 protein (Fig. 7D). In cells coexpressing TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 and TRIM5αrh-V5, the former protein exhibited diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 7E). The wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein in these cells did not form cytoplasmic bodies, but maintained a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern of staining that colocalized with the cytoplasmic portion of the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 protein. The TRIM5αrh-HA C97A/H100A and wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 proteins colocalized in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern of staining (Fig. 7F). As was seen in cells expressing the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 protein, the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein did not form cytoplasmic bodies in the cells coexpressing TRIM5αrh-HA C97A/H100A. The above studies suggest that the TRIM5αrh-HA mutants with disrupted B-box 2 domains exhibit dominant-negative phenotypes. To examine this dominant-negative activity in a primary monkey cell that naturally expresses TRIM5αrh, primary rhesus lung (PRL) fibroblasts were transduced with the empty pLPCX vector or with vectors expressing the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 or TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 proteins. PRL cells have been previously shown to restrict HIV-1 infection potently; furthermore, this restriction can be relieved by TRIM5-directed siRNA or by the expression of the TRIM5γ isoform (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The expression of the TRIM5α-HA Δ132 protein in the PRL cells significantly increased the susceptibility of these cells to HIV-1 infection (Fig. 8). By contrast, expression of the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ93 protein resulted in only a minor increase in the level of HIV-1 infection, compared with control PRL cells transduced with the empty pLPCX vector (Fig. 8). Thus, the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ132 protein exhibits dominant-negative activity in interfering with the HIV-1-restricting function of the wild-type rhesus monkey TRIM5α protein. Hetero-oligomerization of Mutant and Wild-type TRIM5α Proteins—TRIM5 has been reported to form homo-oligomers (24Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TRIM5αrh-HA mutants studied above can associate with the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein, the TRIM5αrh-HA protein variants were precipitated and co-immunoprecipitation of the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein was examined. In addition to the TRIM5αrh-HA mutants discussed above, we studied TRIM5αrh-HA Δ297, which consists of the TRIM5αrh B30.2(SPRY) domain alone. Of note, the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ297 mutant lacks the coiled-coil domain, which has been implicated in the self-association of some TRIM proteins (24Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 33Shoham N.G.

To obtain comparable levels of expression of the wild-type and mutant TRIM5αrh proteins, 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding TRIM5αrh-V5 and either wild-type or mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins. Forty-eight hours afterward, the cells were lysed. One portion of the cell lysate was Western blotted with antibodies direct against the HA or V5 epitope tags or against β-actin. Fig. 9A shows that all of the TRIM5αrh-HA variants and the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein were efficiently expressed in the 293T cells. The remaining portion of the cell lysates was incubated with an anti-HA antibody and Protein A-Sepharose beads. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an anti-V5 antibody. Fig. 9B shows that the wild-type TRIM5αrh-HA protein as well as the RING and B-box 2 mutant TRIM5αrh-HA proteins associate efficiently with the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein. By contrast, the TRIM5αrh-HA Δ297 mutant containing only the B30.2(SPRY) domain did not associate detectably with the wild-type TRIM5αrh-V5 protein. These results are consistent with a role for the coiled-coil domain in self-association of TRIM5αrh. The tripartite motif components of the RING and B-box 2 domains were investigated for their contribution to the antiretroviral function of TRIM5αrh. Disruption or deletion of the RING domain resulted in partial activity against HIV-1 and SIVagm, even in cell types that do not express an endogenous TRIM5α protein. In other proteins, RING domains contribute to a variety of functions, including protein-protein interactions, translational repression, and ubiquitin ligation (24Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 29Borden K.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 30Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D.

Biol. 2002; 320: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The basis for the partial loss of antiretroviral activity of TRIM5αrh associated with RING domain disruption is unknown. Because TRIM5α is known to act between the introduction of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm and reverse transcription (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic levels of TRIM5α are likely important for antiretroviral function. It is probable that at least part of the decrease in HIV-1-suppressive activity of the TRIM5αrh RING domain mutants is due to mislocalization of the mutant proteins in the cell. Levels of diffusely staining, cytoplasmic TRIM5αrh proteins were decreased for the RING-disrupted or -deleted mutants, compared with those observed for the wild-type TRIM5αrh protein. The RING mutants instead accumulate in large nuclear or perinuclear bodies. Thus, deletion or disruption of the RING domain decreases the amount of TRIM5αrh available in the cytoplasm to mediate restriction of the incoming retroviral capsid. Whether the RING domain contributes in ways besides subcellular localization to TRIM5αrh antiviral function remains to be investigated. The RING domain may also be important for other, as yet undetermined, functions of TRIM5α or the other TRIM5 isoforms that lack antiretroviral activity. The phenotypes of the TRIM5αrh mutants in which the B-box 2 domain is disrupted distinctly differ from those of the RING domain mutants. Deletion of the RING and B-box 2 domains, or disruption of only the B-box 2 domain, completely eliminated the antiretroviral activity of TRIM5αrh. These mutants were expressed efficiently, at least as well as wild-type TRIM5αrh, and localized in the cytoplasm. Apparently, the B-box 2 plays an important role in retroviral restriction mediated by TRIM5αrh, although further studies are required to elucidate this role. In promyelocytic protein (TRIM19), disruption of either of the two B-boxes interferes with nuclear body formation without affecting homo-oligomerization. In contrast, the structural integrity of the B-box contributes to the self-association of the ret finger protein TRIM27. The B-box 2 mutants associate with the wild-type TRIM5αrh protein, suggesting that these may retain the ability to oligomerize. The B-box 2 potentially contributes to the TRIM5αrh interaction with the retroviral capsid or host cofactors for restriction. B-box domains have been reported to be important for the association of TRIM1, TRIM18, and TRIM20 with elements of cell signaling pathways (33Shoham N.G. Centola M. Mansfield E. Hull K.M. Wood G. Wise C.A. Kastner D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13501-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 34Short K.M. Hopwood B. Yi Z. Cox T.C. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our observation that the TRIM5αrh Δ132 but not the Δ297 mutant associates with wild-type TRIM5αrh implies that the coiled-coil domain makes a major contribution to TRIM5αrh self-association. Coiled-coil domains have been implicated in the ability of other TRIM proteins to form homo-oligomers (24Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 33Shoham N.G. Centola M. Mansfield E. Hull K.M. Wood G. Wise C.A.

Our results suggest that B-box 2 mutants can interfere with the antiretroviral activity of the wild-type TRIM5αrh protein in a dominant-negative manner. The mild increase in the susceptibility of HeLa cells expressing the B-box 2 mutants to HIV-1 and SIVagm infection may reflect dominant-negative inhibition of the modest antiviral activity of the endogenous human TRIM5α in these cells (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The TRIM5γrh isoform, which lacks the B30.2(SPRY) domain and exhibits no antiretroviral activity, has been shown to exhibit dominant-negative activity (19Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). TRIM5γrh can associate with TRIM5αrh when the two proteins are coexpressed in cells (data not shown). The ability of TRIM5 variants to associate with and to interfere with the antiretroviral activity of wild-type TRIM5α may be related. Of interest, all of the TRIM5 variants that retain these two properties contain a coiled-coil domain. The levels of expression of TRIM5αrh Δ132 and C97A/H100A mutants were greater than or equal to those of the wild-type TRIM5αrh in the cells where restriction by the wild-type protein was relieved. These levels of expression likely contribute to the ability of the dominant-negative mutants to compete with the wild-type TRIM5αrh protein for factors, binding to which is necessary for antiviral function. Candidates for such factors include the viral capsid, TRIM5α itself, and cellular cofactors. Future studies will be directed toward a more complete understanding of the importance of specific elements of the tripartite motif of TRIM5α in retrovirus restriction.

https://openalex.org/W2067837009,"Malignant mesotheliomas (MMs) are very aggressive tumors that respond poorly to standard chemotherapeutic approaches. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway has been implicated in tumor aggressiveness, in part by mediating cell survival and reducing sensitivity to chemotherapy. Using antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated/activated form of AKT kinases, we observed elevated phospho-AKT staining in 17 of 26 (65%) human MM specimens. In addition, AKT phosphorylation was consistently observed in MMs arising in asbestos-treated mice and in MM cell xenografts. Consistent with reports implicating hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met receptor signaling in MM, all 14 human and murine MM cell lines had HGF-inducible AKT activity. One of nine human MM cell lines had elevated AKT activity under serum-starvation conditions, which was associated with a homozygous deletion of PTEN, the first reported in MM. Treatment of this cell line with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin resulted in growth arrest in G1 phase. Treatment of MM cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in combination with cisplatin had greater efficacy in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis than either agent alone. Collectively, these data indicate that MMs frequently express elevated AKT activity, which may be targeted pharmacologically to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy. These findings also suggest that mouse models of MM may be useful for future preclinical studies of pharmaceuticals targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2107454005,"Fatty acid synthase (FAS), a key enzyme of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, has been shown to be overexpressed in various types of human cancer and is, therefore, considered to be an attractive target for anticancer therapy. However, the exact mechanism of overexpression of the FAS gene in tumor cells is not well understood. In this report, we demonstrate that the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN has a significant inverse correlation with FAS expression in the case of prostate cancer in the clinical setting, and inhibition of the PTEN gene leads to the overexpression of FAS in vitro. We also found that the combination of the expression status of these two genes is a better prognostic marker than either gene alone. Furthermore, our results indicate that the specific inhibition of FAS gene by siRNA leads to apoptosis of prostate tumor cells, and inhibition of PI 3-kinase pathway synergizes with FAS siRNA to enhance tumor cell death. These results provide a strong rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of an inhibitor of the PTEN signaling pathway in conjunction with the FAS siRNA to inhibit prostate tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W2039854741,"In advanced breast carcinomas, the alpha6beta4 integrin is associated with a migratory and invasive phenotype. In our current study, we show that expression of the alpha6beta4 integrin in MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells leads to increased expression of the autocrine motility factor autotaxin, as determined by Affymetrix gene chip, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses. We further demonstrate that increased autotaxin secretion from integrin alpha6beta4 expressing cells acts to enhance chemotaxis through its ability to convert lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and accounts for 80% of the motogenic activity of the conditioned medium. We determine that integrin alpha6beta4-dependent overexpression of autotaxin in MDA-MB-435 cells is mediated by NFAT1, but not NFAT5, through the use of siRNAs that specifically target autotaxin, integrin beta4, NFAT1 and NFAT5. Finally, we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that two consensus NFAT binding sites found in the autotaxin promoter strongly and specifically bind NFAT1 from integrin alpha6beta4 expressing cells. In summary, we find that the alpha6beta4 integrin potentiates autotaxin expression through the upregulation and activation of NFAT1. These observations highlight for the first time a mechanism by which NFAT transcription factors can facilitate an invasive and motile phenotype downstream of integrin alpha6beta4 signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2054512985,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a eukaryotic single-stranded DNA-binding protein consisting of three subunits of 70-, 32-, and 14-kDa (RPA70, RPA32, RPA14, respectively). It is a protein essential for most cellular DNA metabolic pathways. Checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA damage-induced checkpoint response. In this report, we presented the evidence that Rad9–Rad1–Hus1 (9–1–1) complex directly interacted with RPA in human cells, and this interaction was mediated by the binding of Rad9 protein to both RPA70 and RPA32 subunits. In addition, the cellular interaction of 9–1–1 with RPA or hyperphosphorylated RPA was stimulated by UV irradiation or camptothecin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Such treatments also resulted in the colocalization of the nuclear foci formed with the two complexes. Consistently, knockdown of the RPA expression in cells by the small interference RNA (siRNA) blocked the DNA damage-dependent chromatin association of 9–1–1, and also inhibited the 9–1–1 complex formation. Taken together, our results suggest that 9–1–1 and RPA complexes collaboratively function in DNA damage responses, and that the RPA may serve as a regulator for the activity of 9–1–1 complex in the cellular checkpoint network."
https://openalex.org/W2025962043,"We previously reported that 17-β-estradiol (E2)-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) act as signaling molecules. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of E2-induced mtROS on cell cycle progression. E2-induced cell growth was reduced by antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), catalase, and the glutathione peroxidase mimic ebselen. Flow cytometry showed that mitochondrial blockers of protein synthesis (chloramphenicol), transcription and replication (ethidium bromide), and function (rotenone, rhodamine 6G) blocked E2-induced G1 to S transition. Reduction of E2-induced DNA synthesis in the presence of mitochondrial blockers occurred without influencing the level of ATP. Additionally, the mitochondrial blockers inhibited the E2-induced expression of early cell cycle genes such as cyclins D1, D3, E1, E2, and B2. NAC or rotenone reduced E2-induced cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, E2-induced binding of AP-1 and CREB to the TRE and CRE response sequences, respectively, in the promoter of cyclin D1 was inhibited by NAC or rotenone. In addition, E2-induced expression of PCNA, PRC1, and bcl-2 were inhibited by mitochondrial blockers. These data indicate that E2-induced mtROS are involved in the regulation of early G1-phase progression. Since neither antioxidants nor mitochondrial blockers used in this study are reported to bind the estrogen receptor (ER), our findings suggest that E2-induced mtROS modulates G1 to S transition and some of the early G1 genes through a nongenomic, ER-independent signaling pathway. Thus, our results suggest (1) a new paradigm that estrogen-induced mitochondrial oxidants control the early stage of cell cycle progression and (2) provide the basis for the discovery of novel antioxidant-based drugs or antioxidant gene therapies for the prevention and treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2090205684,"ID4 gene is a member of the inhibitor of DNA-binding (ID) family, which inhibits DNA binding of basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors. Certain human primary breast cancers reportedly have low or no expression of ID4 protein, but its role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression is unknown. To determine its possible role, we examined epigenetic inactivation of ID4 gene by promoter hypermethylation in human breast cell lines and T1 breast cancer tissues. Methylation status of ID4 promoter CpG island was assessed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP); ID4 mRNA level was assessed by quantitative real-time RT–PCR. Of eight cell lines, two were fully methylated, four were partially methylated, and two were not methylated. ID4 mRNA level was suppressed in fully methylated cell lines. ID4 hypermethylation was observed in 16 of 24 (67%) node-positive and seven of 36 (19%) node-negative T1 primary breast cancers matched by patient age and tumor diameter. It was a significant risk factor for nodal metastasis (OR 13.1, P=0.0004). ID4 mRNA level was suppressed in hypermethylated cancer specimens (P=0.014). ID4 may play an important suppressive role in tumor progression, and its silencing by hypermethylation may increase the risk of regional lymph node metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2017108583,"The expression of the αvβ3 integrin (CD51/CD61) on human melanoma cells has been shown to be associated most closely with tumor progression and metastases formation in melanoma. Here, we demonstrated a specific interaction of the αvβ3 integrin on melanoma cells with the human Thy-1, an inducible cell adhesion molecule expressed on the cell surface of activated endothelial cells (EC). The interaction was shown by the binding of purified Thy-1 protein to αVβ3 transfected cells, to αvβ3-expressing melanoma cells and to purified αVβ3 integrin. Moreover, melanoma cells adhere specifically to Thy-1 transfectants via αvβ3 on melanoma cells showing the functional relevance of this interaction for cell adhesion. Finally, the importance of the αvβ3/Thy-1 interaction for the adhesion of melanoma cells to the activated endothelium was confirmed under static and flow conditions by the inhibition of melanoma cell adhesion to and transmigration across activated EC by blocking the αvβ3/Thy-1 interaction. In conclusion, we have identified a new pair of adhesion molecules Thy-1 and αvβ3 mediating the interaction of melanoma cells and activated EC. These data explain at least in part the high tumorigenicity of αvβ3-expressing melanoma cells and the association of αvβ3-positive melanoma cells with a high risk of metastasis and poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2072313217,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has a fundamental role during postnatal liver development and is essential for mediating dioxin toxicity. However, the genetic programs mediating, both, the toxic and physiological effects downstream of the transcription factor AhR are in major parts unknown. We have identified the proto-oncogene c-jun as a novel target gene of AhR. Induction of c-jun depends on activation of p38–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by an AhR-dependent mechanism. None of the kinases that are known to phosphorylate p38-MAPK is activated by AhR. Neither the dephosphorylation rate of p38–MAPK is reduced. Furthermore, increased p38–MAPK phosphorylation in response to dioxins does not require ongoing transcription. These findings establish activating ‘cross-talk’ with MAPK signaling as a novel principle of AhR action, which is apparently independent of the AhR's function as a DNA-binding transcriptional activator."
https://openalex.org/W1966668240,"DNA gyrase is unique among type II topoisomerases in that its DNA supercoiling activity is unidirectional.

DNA topoisomerases solve the topological problems that arise in the course of normal DNA metabolism. Among the numerous functions of these essential enzymes are resolution of DNA catenation during replication and cell division and relaxation of DNA (+) and (–) supercoiling 1For our purposes, the term “supercoil” is restricted to topological changes that alter the linking number in a topologically linked DNA.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). In addition to relieving torsional stress, some topoisomerases are also capable of introducing supercoils (2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). In particular, bacterial DNA gyrase catalyzes the ATP-dependent introduction of (–) supercoils (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). This activity, unique to gyrase among all topoisomerases, helps maintain prokaryotic genomes at a (–) superhelical density, which in turn is thought to lower the energy barrier for unwinding DNA during transcription and replication (3Espeli O. Marians K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Zechiedrich E.L. Khodursky A.B. Bachellier S. Schneider R. Chen D. Lilley D.M.J. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

Gyrase, similar to all members of the type II topoisomerase family (Topo IIs), 2The abbreviations used are: Topo, DNA topoisomerase; GyrA, gyrase A; NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; βME, 2-mercaptoethanol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; β-CA loop, the loop containing residues 555–576. 2The abbreviations used are: Topo, DNA topoisomerase; GyrA, gyrase A; NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; βME, 2-mercaptoethanol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; β-CA loop, the loop containing residues 555–576. catalyzes the ATP-dependent passage of one DNA duplex (T-segment) through another (G-segment), a process that requires transient introduction of a double-stranded DNA break (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). Intramolecular passage of a T-segment results in relaxation or induction of supercoils, whereas intermolecular passage results in decatenation. Most Topo IIs perform both decatenation and relaxation; yet, interestingly, gyrase exhibits an overriding preference to perform intramolecular and unidirectional ((+) to (–) node) transfer of a T-segment through a contiguous G-segment. Gyrase is an A2B2 tetramer comprising GyrA and GyrB subunits. ATPase activity resides in the N-terminal domain of GyrB (GyrB-NTD); the core cleavage-reunion complex is made up of the C-terminal domain of GyrB (GyrB-CTD) (5Noble C.G. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) plus the N-terminal domain of GyrA (GyrA-NTD) (2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar, 6Hockings S.C. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both of the hallmark functional features unique to gyrase, its unidirectional supercoiling activity and strong preference for compact intramolecular T-segment transfer, have been attributed to the C-terminal domain of GyrA (GyrA-CTD) (7Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This domain is conserved among gyrases and also members of the Topo IV family, in which it is known as ParC-CTD. Eukaryotic Topo IIs possess a CTD, but it appears to be completely different in structure and function from the prokaryotic CTDs (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar, 8Caron P.R. Watt P. Wang J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3197-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Caron P.R.

Selective removal of the GyrA-CTD from Escherichia coli gyrase results in loss of the ability to introduce (–) supercoils in relaxed and negatively supercoiled DNA, a gain of the ability to relax (–) supercoils, and a 30-fold increase in decatenation activity (7Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); addition of the GyrA-CTD in trans results in restoration of the capacity to introduce (–) supercoils (11Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3540-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Critchlow S.E. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7387-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Plasmid nicking/religation experiments indicate that the E. coli GyrA-CTD and full-length gyrase (in the absence of ATP) both bind DNA such that (+) superhelicity is introduced, whereas GyrB + GyrA-NTD does not alter global DNA topology upon binding (7Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, E. coli gyrase preferentially binds and processes (+) supercoiled DNA (16Bates A.D. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1408-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas GyrB + GyrA-NTD has no such preference (14Kampranis S.C. Bates A.D. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These data have been interpreted to suggest that DNA wraps around gyrase in a manner dependent upon the presence of the GyrA-CTD, producing (+) superhelicity, and that this wrapping plays a crucial role in controlling the directionality of supercoil induction. Additional support for the notion that the full E. coli gyrase wraps a large continuous stretch of DNA has been provided by transient electric dichroism (17Rau D.C. Gellert M. Thoma F. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and atomic force microscopy experiments (18Heddle J.G. Mitelheiser S. Maxwell A. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); footprinting experiments have shown that gyrase protects ∼128 bp of DNA, nearly all of which shows a cleavage periodicity typical for DNA bound to a surface (19Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Morrison A. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas eukaryotic Topo IIs, which lack any counterpart to the GyrA-CTD, protect only ∼35 bp (23Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Thomsen B. Bendixen C. Lund K. Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Together, these experiments imply a unique role for the GyrA-CTD in DNA wrapping and T-segment presentation by gyrase. Type IV topoisomerases (Topo IVs), the other type II subclass containing a GyrA-like CTD, are unlike gyrases in that they are unable to introduce (–) supercoils in relaxed and negatively supercoiled DNA. Furthermore, Topo IV has a much higher decatenation activity than gyrase (25Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31549-31555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding these differences, both classes show an overriding preference to process (+) nodes (26Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Charvin G. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This (+) node preference is absent in all type II topoisomerases not belonging to the gyrase or Topo IV subclasses; these other Topo IIs relax and decatenate (+) and (-) nodes at similar rates (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). Although less biochemical data are available on the ParC-CTD than the GyrA-CTD, it is reasonable to infer that the ParC-CTD also gives rise directly to the preference of Topo IV to process (+) nodes (28Hsieh T.J. Farh L. Huang W.M. Chan N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55587-55593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Representative structures of the GyrA-NTD (29Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and the GyrB-ATPase domain from E. coli gyrase are known (30Berger J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), but the structure of the E. coli GyrA-CTD has not been available until now. The first and only structure of a GyrA-CTD, derived from the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, was recently published and revealed an intriguing new fold, designated a β-pinwheel (32Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we report the structure of the E. coli GyrA-CTD (Fig. 1A) along with Topo I relaxation assays. Together these data form the basis of a model for how the directional bias of supercoil induction by E. coli gyrase is imparted by its C-terminal domain. The E. coli model is distinct from that proposed for B. burgdorferi, as supported by significant structural differences and divergent biochemical properties of these two GyrA-CTDs. Such differences reveal an unexpected richness of diversity in the mechanisms of DNA strand management by gyrase. Protein Preparation—Plasmids encoding E. coli GyrA-CTD (532–853 or 532–841) and B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD (501–810) were cloned from E. coli K12 or B. burgdorferi (American Type Culture Collection 35210D), respectively, into pET30a (Novagen) with tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable N-terminal His6 tags and fully sequenced. Proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS or Rosetta2(DE3)-pLysS cells at 37 °C. Lysis was accomplished by sonication in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, 10 mm βME, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Both proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The E. coli GyrA-CTD was further purified by a Hi-Trap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm βME, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 300–2000 mm NaCl. The B. burgdorferi and E. coli GyrA-CTDs for Topo I relaxation assays were finally purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm βME, and 1 mm EDTA. Structure Determination—Crystals (∼300 × 200 × 100 μm) of the E. coli GyrA-CTD (532–853), with an N-terminal His6 tag, were grown by hanging drop vapor equilibration in Nextal plates as follows: 5 μl of 10–15 mg/ml protein solution (10–20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4–7.8, 650 mm NaCl, 5 mm βME, and 1 mm EDTA) were mixed with 5 μl of well solution (100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6–8.2, and 1–4% polyethylene glycol 1500) and equilibrated at room temperature overnight against 1 ml of well solution. Extensive additive screening, removal of the N-terminal His6 tag, and a smaller protein construct comprising residues 532–841 failed to improve the crystal quality. Crystals were cryoprotected by the stepwise addition of ethylene glycol and glycerol (to final concentrations of 20 and 8%, respectively) to a polyethylene glycol 1500-fortified mother liquor. The selenomethionine derivative of the CTD was prepared in the same strain used for the native protein production (33Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). In addition, 10 mm dithiothreitol supplanted βME as the reducing agent throughout the SeMet protein purification and crystallization. The native x-ray diffraction dataset (dmin = 2.6 Å) was collected at the Macromolecular Diffraction at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) A1 beamline, and a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion dataset (dmin = 3.0 Å) was obtained at the National Synchrotron Light Source X-4 station at 100 K. Reflection data were integrated and scaled with the HKL2000 program (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38523) Google Scholar). Real-space locations of all twelve of the expected selenomethionines in the asymmetric unit were placed using SOLVE (35Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The initial model was built, using Quanta 2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), into a density-modified map generated using the DM module of the Collaborative Computational Project 4 suite (36Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar, 37Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). This model was subjected to rounds of simulated annealing, energy minimization, individual B-factor refinement in crystallography NMR software (version 1.1) against the native dataset interspersed with manual rebuilding to produce a model with final values of Rwork = 22.7% and Rfree = 26.7%. Noncrystallographic symmetry was not employed during the refinement. Electron density was weak or absent for a significant number of side chains: protomers A and B had 2102 and 2091 atoms built with 32 and 46 side-chains partially disordered (110 and 175 atoms not modeled), respectively. The figures were created with Ribbons 3.22 and GRASP1.2 software (the GRASP surface was created with a model in which the disordered parts of side chains with β-carbon density were modeled to most appropriately reflect surface charge distributions) (38Petrey D. Honig B. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 492-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar). PROCHECK and SFCHECK were used to inform model building and validate the final model (40Laskowski R.J. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar, 41Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1999; D55: 191-205Crossref Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Topo IB Relaxation Assays—Negatively supercoiled pBR322 was prepared using a GigaKit (Qiagen) (14Kampranis S.C. Bates A.D. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 10397-10401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The pBR322-resuspended pellet was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and concentrated on a 30 K polyethersulfone membrane (Vivaspin) to 0.85 μg/ml. To obtain undamaged pBR322, it is essential to never freeze the DNA. The reaction buffer included 35 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1.85 mm MgCl2, 5 mm spermidine, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 9 μg/ml tRNA, 6.5% glycerol, 5.5 mm βME, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 300 nm pBR322, and 0.6–6.0 μm GyrA-CTD (E. coli (532–841) or B. burgdorferi; the results are identical with or without His6 tags). T4 DNA ligase (100 units, New England Biolabs) was added to each reaction. After 10 min, DNA Topo IB from vaccinia virus (10 units, Epicentre) was added to a final volume of 10 μl, and the reactions were incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C. Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25: 24:1) buffered to pH 8.0 was used to extract the protein from the reactions, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Gels with ∼0.5 μg of DNA/lane (1.1% agarose in 1× TPE (Tris phosphate, EDTA) or 1× TAE (Tris acetate, EDTA)) were run at 4 V/cm for 10 min and then 1.0 V/cm for 19–21 h. After ethidium bromide staining, the topoisomer bands were quantitated in ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences) and plotted in Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software), where they were fit to gaussian curves. Structure Analysis—Crystals of the E. coli GyrA-CTD (residues 531–853 plus an N-terminal hexahistidine tag) produced diffraction data to a limiting resolution of 2.6 Å (supplemental Table I). Experimental phases were determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using selenomethionine-labeled protein crystals and then applied to a native data set. The final model includes two protomers/asymmetric unit, each comprising residues 535–841, with a large disordered loop from 555 to 576 in protomer A and 563 to 575 in protomer B (Fig. 1C). This disordered loop, hereafter referred to as the β-CA loop, contains a known trypsin cleavage site plus the “GyrA box,” an indel used to distinguish GyrA from ParC replete with positively charged residues (43Reece R.J.

The version of the GyrA-CTD that yielded the highest quality diffraction data contained an R562C mutation in the β-CA loop, but the loop was similarly disordered in the 2.9-Å structure of the non-mutated protein (data not shown); because the two proteins were indistinguishable structurally, we used the R562C protein for complete refinement and structural interpretation. We note that the dissociation constant of the GyrA-CTD for DNA is unaffected by the presence of the R562C mutation (data not shown). The two protomers possess nearly identical overall structures and can be superimposed with a Cα r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å. Significant structural differences between the two are localized entirely to flexible elements located at the crystal packing interface, namely the ordering of a small stretch of the β-CA loop (residues 555–562) in protomer B into a short α-helix and the minor adjustment of a nearby loop (residues 608–617) (Fig. 1D, wedges). Upon removal of these parts from the superposition, the r.m.s.d. drops to 0.7 Å. Because the short helix in protomer B appears to be a crystal packing artifact, we have used protomer A for all figures, except Fig. 1, C and D. The crystal structure of the E. coli GyrA-NTD (29Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) was ordered through residue 522, thus only 12 amino acids are missing between the structures of the two domains of GyrA (Fig. 2A). The overall fold of the E. coli GyrA-CTD is similar to that recently described for the structure of the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD (32Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), with both bearing a superficial similarity to the well known β-propeller (45Jawad Z. Paoli M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 447-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similar to β-propeller proteins, the GyrA-CTDs contain serially repeated subdomains known as “blades,” each of which is composed of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1, A and B). Closer inspection, however, reveals that the topology of the blades in the GyrA-CTDs is completely different from that in β-propeller proteins; this distinction prompted Corbett et al. (32Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to describe the GyrA-CTD fold as a β-pinwheel. Whereas the β-strands that make up the blades in a β-propeller reside on a contiguous stretch of polypeptide sequence, the β-pinwheel is a more interdigitated structure, with the polypeptide chain meandering back and forth between adjacent blades (Fig. 1, A and B). Although each blade in the β-pinwheel fold of the E. coli GyrA-CTD is nearly identical to its counterpart in the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD β-pinwheel (average r.m.s.d. = 1.5 Å), the spatial arrangement differs significantly; while the blades of the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD form a toroidal β-pinwheel, the blades of the E. coli GyrA-CTD are arranged in an ascending spiral around a screw axis (Fig. 3). If the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD has the appearance of a flat washer, then the E. coli GyrA-CTD has the appearance of a lock washer. Consequently, a global superposition of the B. burgdorferi and E. coli proteins yields an r.m.s.d. of 4.59 Å (5.45 Å for protomer B), in marked contrast to the excellent correspondence of blade-to-blade superpositions. The significant divergence in overall shape can clearly be observed in a Cα superposition using the N-terminal blade of each structure (Fig. 3). To gain a more quantitative estimate of the difference in helicity of the two proteins, we computed a screw axis (Fig. 3, blue rod) and measured the displacement of the center of mass for blades 1 and 6 (Fig. 3, spheres) along the axis. Although the B. burgdorferi β-pinwheel has almost no axial displacement (0.04 Å) from blade 1 to 6, the E. coli β-pinwheel exhibits pronounced axial displacement (11.03 Å). Consonant with the axial displacement of the propeller blades, the interface between blades 1 and 6 is much more extensive in the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTD structure than in the E. coli structure (2,150 Å2 of solvent-inaccessible surface versus 466 Å2, respectively). In the B. burgdorferi structure, a significant fraction of this interface is contributed by the GyrA box on the β-CA loop (991 Å2), whereas the whole loop is disordered in the E. coli GyrA-CTD. The Bacillus stearothermophilus ParC-CTD (Topo IV) structure, reported while this work was under review, also has a β-pinwheel fold with the blades arranged in an ascending spiral (28Hsieh T.J. Farh L. Huang W.M. Chan N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55587-55593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); the E. coli GyrA-CTD and the B. stearothermophilus ParC-CTD superimposed with an overall r.m.s.d. of 1.5 Å (Fig. 3). The most notable structural difference between these two domains is the presence of α-helices in the β-CA loop and at the C terminus of the ParC-CTD. The latter packs against strand A of blade 1, resulting in a much more extensive interaction between blades 1 and 6 (1086 Å2) than in the E. coli GyrA-CTD structure (466 Å2). It is formally possible that the differences in overall fold between these three structures result from crystal packing. Two independent lines of evidence suggest this is not likely. Protomers A and B of the E. coli GyrA-CTD asymmetric unit are virtually identical in fold, despite packing differently within the unit cell (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 3). Further, the B. stearothermophilus ParC-CTD, which also shares this spiral fold, packs in yet another form (space group P32) (supplemental Fig. 3) (28Hsieh T.J. Farh L. Huang W.M. Chan N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55587-55593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the charge density and distribution on the surface of the E. coli GyrA-CTD, we calculated its surface electrostatic potential (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, a positively charged strip extends along the midriff of the protein, following the right-handed superhelical rise of the β-pinwheel. When DNA is modeled into the structure so as to maximize its electrostatic interactions with this positive strip, the right-handed superhelical rise in the positive strip imparts a corresponding superhelical rise in the bound DNA (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, although the B. burgdorferi structure also contains a positive strip (32Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it lacks a spiral sense and hence is not expected to impart any superhelical rise upon its bound DNA. In either case, most of the predicted DNA contacts can be attributed to the preponderance of arginines and lysines on the long loops connecting the 310 helix of one propeller blade with the outermost β-strand in its neighbor (Figs. 1A and 4). It is conceivable and perhaps even likely that these basic loops undergo some local conformational adjustment upon DNA binding but unlikely that they change so drastically as to alter the overall course of the positive strip. The right-handed helical arrangement of blades from N to C terminus suggests a model for DNA wrapping, whereby binding along the midriff of the protein surface imparts right-handed superhelicity in the DNA (Fig. 2B). Topo I Readout of Wrapping—To compare changes in DNA topology upon binding of the E. coli or the B. burgdorferi GyrA-CTDs, Topoisomerase IB was used to relax pBR322 plasmids in the presence of either CTD (Fig. 5) (14Kampranis S.C.

Unfortunately, some tumor cells remain resistant to TRAIL. Therefore, agents that sensitize malignant cells to TRAIL-mediated cell death might be of particular importance for the development of novel antitumor therapeutic regimens. Recent studies establish a critical role of selenium in prostate cancer prevention in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that concomitant administration of TRAIL and methylseleninic acid (MSA) produces synergistic effects on the induction of apoptosis in androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent DU-145 prostate cancer cells. MSA rapidly and specifically downregulates expression of the cellular FLICE inhibitory protein, a negative regulator of death receptor signaling. In addition, we demonstrate that the synergistic effects of MSA and TRAIL result from the activation of the mitochondrial pathway-mediated amplification loop. Addition of MSA effectively blocked TRAIL-mediated BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 and Ser136 in DU-145 cells and was accompanied by induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and release of apoptogenic cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO proteins from the mitochondria and into the cytosol. These results suggest that selenium-based dietary compounds may help to overcome resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells."

After active immunotherapy, we detected TRP-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Tumor cells from postvaccination resections showed significantly lower TRP-2 expression and higher sensitivity to carboplatin and temozolomide than those autologous cell lines from prevaccination resections in two patients who demonstrated CTL response to TRP-2. One of two patients underwent treatment with temozolomide after recurrence and responded dramatically. TRP-2-transfected cell line (TRP-2-U373) resulted in significant drug resistance to carboplatin and temozolomide compared to wild-type U-373 (W-U373). There was no significant difference, however, in the mRNA expression of other common drug resistance related proteins, such as BCRP-1, MGMT, MDR-1, MRP-1 and MRP-3, after TRP-2 transfection. TRP-2-U373 tumor cells were immunoselected by a TRP-2-specific CTL line. The immunoselected cells (IS-TRP-2-U373) demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity to carboplatin and temozolomide compared to TRP-2-U373. For the first time, we provide evidence that immunological targeting of tumor-associated antigen TRP-2 significantly increases sensitivity to chemotherapy."

TGF-beta induction of stress fibers in epithelial cells requires high molecular weight tropomyosins encoded by TPM1 and TPM2 genes. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the failure of TGF-beta to induce stress fibers and inhibit cell migration in metastatic cells. RT-PCR analysis in carcinoma cell lines revealed a significant reduction in TPM1 transcripts in metastatic MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and SW620 cell lines. Treatment of these cells with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increased mRNA levels of TPM1 with no effect on TPM2. Importantly, 5-aza-dC treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells restored TGF-beta induction of TPM1 and formation of stress fibers. Forced expression of TPM1 by using Tet-Off system increased stress fibers in MDA-MB-231 cells and reduced cell migration. A potential CpG island spanning the TPM1 proximal promoter, exon 1, and the beginning of intron 1 was identified. Bisulfite sequencing showed significant cytosine methylation in metastatic cell lines that correlated with a reduced expression of TPM1. Together these results suggest that epigenetic suppression of TPM1 may alter TGF-beta tumor suppressor function and contribute to metastatic properties of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089794529,"Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 develop aggressive Schwann cell neoplasms known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Although tumor suppressor gene mutations play an important role in MPNST pathogenesis, it is likely that dysregulated signaling by as yet unidentified growth factors also contributes to the formation of these sarcomas. To test the hypothesis that neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) growth factors promote mitogenesis in MPNSTs, we examined the expression and action of NRG-1 in human MPNSTs and neurofibromas, the benign precursor lesions from which MPNSTs arise. Multiple α and β transmembrane precursors from the class II and III NRG-1 subfamilies are present in both tumor types. Neoplastic Schwann cells within these neoplasms variably express the erbB kinases mediating NRG-1 responses (erbB2, erbB3 and/or erbB4). Human MPNST cell lines (Mash-1, YST-1, NMS-2 and NMS-2PC cells) similarly coexpress multiple NRG-1 isoforms and erbB receptors. These MPNST lines are NRG-1 responsive and demonstrate constitutive erbB phosphorylation. Treatment with PD168393 and PD158780, two structurally and mechanistically distinct erbB inhibitors, abolishes erbB phosphorylation and reduces DNA synthesis in these lines. These findings suggest that autocrine and/or paracrine NRG-1/erbB signaling promotes neoplastic Schwann cell proliferation and may be an important therapeutic target in neurofibromas and MPNSTs."

https://openalex.org/W2099231523,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene is activated in response to DNA damage resulting in either growth arrest or apoptosis. We previously demonstrated the specific involvement of homeodomain interacting protein-kinase 2 (HIPK2), a nuclear serine/threonine kinase, in inducing p53-dependent apoptosis through selective p53 phosphorylation at serine 46 after severe genotoxic damage. Here we show that HIPK2 contributes to p53 regulation, independently from serine 46 phosphorylation upon nonapoptotic DNA damage such as that induced by cytostatic doses of cisplatin. We show that HIPK2 depletion by RNA interference inhibits p53 binding to the p21Waf1 promoter affecting its p53-induced transactivation thereby allowing cell proliferation. We found that nonapoptotic DNA damage induces p53 acetylation mediated by the HAT protein PCAF and this p53 post-translational modification is abolished by HIPK2 depletion. In this regard, we found that HIPK2 cooperates with PCAF to induce selectively p53 transcriptional activity toward the p21Waf1 promoter while depletion of either HIPK2 or PCAF abolished this function. These data show that HIPK2 regulates the p53 growth arrest function through its PCAF-mediated acetylation."

https://openalex.org/W2032471809,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA ligase D (PaeLigD) exemplifies a family of bacterial DNA end-joining proteins that consist of a ligase domain fused to a polymerase domain and a putative nuclease module. The LigD polymerase preferentially adds single ribonucleotides at blunt DNA ends and, as we show here, is also capable of adding up to 4 ribonucleotides to a DNA primer-template. We report that PaeLigD has an intrinsic ability to resect the short tract of 3′-ribonucleotides of a primer-template substrate to the point at which the primer strand has a single 3′-ribonucleotide remaining. The failure to digest beyond this point reflects a requirement for a 2′-OH group on the penultimate nucleoside of the primer strand. Replacing the 2′-OH by a 2′-F, 2′-NH2, 2′-OCH3, or 2′-H abolishes the resection reaction. The ribonucleotide resection activity resides within a 187-amino acid N-terminal nuclease domain and is the result of at least two component steps: (i) the 3′-terminal nucleoside is first removed to yield a primer strand with a ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 terminus, and (ii) the 3′-PO4 is hydrolyzed to a 3′-OH. The 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase activities are both dependent on a divalent cation, specifically manganese. PaeLigD preferentially remodels the 3′-ends of a duplex primer-template substrate rather than a single strand of identical composition, and it prefers DNA primer strands containing a short 3′-ribonucleotide tract to an all-RNA primer. The nuclease domain of PaeLigD and its bacterial homologs has no apparent structural or mechanistic similarity to previously characterized nucleases. Thus, we surmise that it exemplifies a novel phosphoesterase family, defined in part by conserved residues Asp-50, Arg-52, and His-84, which are essential for the 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase reactions.

Homologous recombination and NHEJ pathways coexist in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryal NHEJ requires a DNA end-binding protein (Ku) and a specialized ATP-dependent DNA ligase (LigIV) (2Lieber M.R. Ma Y.

Although this is the case for Escherichia coli, the detection of homologs of Ku in a subset of bacterial proteomes raised interest in a putative bacterial NHEJ pathway (4Aravind L. Koonin E.V.

Mycobacterial NHEJ is highly mutagenic (∼50% error rate), even when repairing complementary 5′-overhang ends. An analysis of the recombination junctions from individual NHEJ events revealed the participation of several DNA end-remodeling activities, including template-dependent fill-in of 5′-overhangs, non-templated addition of single nucleotides at blunt ends, and nucleolytic resection (8Gong C.

The C-terminal segment of MtuLigD (amino acids 412–759) and the central segment of PaeLigD (amino acids 188–527) are autonomous ligase domains capable of DNA nick sealing and ATP-dependent autoadenylylation in vitro (7Gong C.

Non-templated blunt-end addition in vitro is limited to the incorporation of only 1 or 2 nucleotides at the primer terminus. During templated synthesis, the primer is elongated to the end of the template strand and is then further extended with a single non-templated nucleotide. Fill-in and addition of a single non-templated nucleotide are the molecular signatures of mycobacterial NHEJ in vivo at 5′-overhang double-strand breaks (DSB) and blunt-end DSB, respectively (8Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is notable that rNTPs are preferred over dNTPs as substrates for non-templated blunt-end addition. This property led to speculation that the initial insertions preceding the strand-sealing step of NHEJ of a blunt DSB might involve rNMP incorporation and that the ability of LigD to use rNTPs as substrates might be advantageous for the repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks that arise in quiescent cells, insofar as the dNTP pool might be limiting when bacteria are not actively replicating. There is less known at present about the nuclease function of bacterial LigD. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of the putative nuclease domains of the LigD proteins from eight species of bacteria (P. aeruginosa, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bordetella bronchiseptica, M. tuberculosis, M. avium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Mezorhizobium loti, and Nocardia farcinica); the native LigD proteins range in size from 759 to 892 amino acids. Also included in the alignment are two archaeal homologs from Methanosarcina mazei and Methanosarcina acetivorans, which are single-domain proteins of 152 and 156 amino acids, respectively. The side chains conserved in all of the aligned proteins are denoted by dots above the sequence in Fig. 1. Initial informatics analysis focused on the presence of clusters of conserved histidines and aspartates that were predicted to form a metal-coordinating cluster composed of β-strands. On this basis, a deoxynuclease function was suggested (4Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Della et al. (10Della M. Palmbos P.L. Tseng H.M. Tonkin L.M. Daley J.M. Topper L.M. Pitcher R.S. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson T.E. Doherty A.J. Science. 2004; 306: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have reported that MtuLigD has an associated metal-dependent DNA 3′-exonuclease activity that digests either single-stranded DNA, a 3′-tailed duplex DNA, or a DNA flap structure with a 3′-tail. Here we describe a nuclease activity intrinsic to Pseudomonas LigD. We discovered the nuclease activity while analyzing the capacity of PaeLigD to incorporate ribonucleotides at the 3′-end of a DNA primer-template. We show that PaeLigD and its isolated N-terminal nuclease domain catalyze the removal of 3′-ribonucleotides from a 5′-DNA-RNA-3′ primer-template substrate via a novel metal-dependent mechanism entailing hydrolysis of the terminal DNA-(rN)p(rN) phosphodiester to yield a DNA-(rN)p species, which is subsequently converted to DNA-(rN)OH product. Consistent with the proposed reaction scheme, the PaeLigD nuclease domain has an intrinsic metal-dependent 3′-phosphatase activity on a DNA-(rN)p primer-template substrate. We discuss the potential role of the LigD 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase activities in healing damaged ends via ribonucleotide incorporation at NHEJ junctions. Nuclease Domain of PaeLigD—A gene fragment encoding LigD-(1–187) (Nuc domain) was amplified by PCR with a sense strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site at the beginning of the open reading frame and an antisense primer that introduced a new stop codon and a flanking BamHI site. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b to generate an expression plasmid encoding a His10-tagged version of the putative Nuc domain of PaeLigD. Alanine mutations were introduced into the pET-PaeLigD-(1–187) plasmid by the two-stage overlap extension PCR method. The inserts of the wild-type and Ala-mutant pET-PaeLigD-(1–187) plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. The pET-PaeLigD-(1–187) plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Induction of protein expression with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, preparation of soluble bacterial lysates, and initial purification of the recombinant wild-type LigD-(1–187) protein by Ni-agarose affinity chromatography were performed as described previously (9Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for full-length PaeLigD and the LigD Pol domain. The affinity column was eluted stepwise with 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The polypeptide compositions of the fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. LigD-(1–187) was recovered predominantly in the 200 and 500 mm imidazole eluate fractions, which were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). A protein-containing precipitate that formed upon dilution was removed by centrifugation. The clarified supernatant was applied to an 8-ml Source 15S (Amersham Biosciences) cation exchange column that had been equilibrated with buffer B. The adsorbed LigD-(1–187) protein was eluted with a 250-ml linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in buffer B. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration, and stored at –80 °C. The yield at the Source S step was ∼6 mg of LigD-(1–187) protein from a 1-liter bacterial culture. The LigD-(1–187)-Ala mutants were purified through the Ni-agarose step. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—An aliquot (40 μg) of the Ni-agarose preparation of the PaeLigD Nuc domain was mixed with catalase (30 μg), bovine serum albumin (30 μg), and cytochrome c (30 μg). The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. An aliquot (50 μg) of the phosphocellulose preparation of the full-length PaeLigD (9Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was applied to a separate glycerol gradient without internal markers. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. The polypeptide compositions of the gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for activity as specified in the figure legends. Primed RNA Polymerase Assay—Activity was gauged by NTP-dependent extension of a 12-mer 5′ 32P-labeled DNA, RNA, or mixed DNA-RNA primer. Oligoribonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and deprotected as instructed by the vendor. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). The 12-mer primer strands were end-labeled by reaction with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ32P]ATP, purified by native gel electrophoresis, and annealed to a 4-fold excess of an unlabeled complementary 24-mer DNA strand to generate the 5′-tailed substrates depicted in Fig. 2. Polymerase reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.8 pmol 5′ 32P-labeled primer-template, 50 μm each ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, and the Pae-LigD Pol domain as specified were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 10 mm EDTA and 48% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The products were visualized by autoradiography. The fraction of input primer extended was determined by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. Nuclease Assay—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 pmol 5′ 32P-labeled D10R2 or other primer-template as specified and enzyme were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 7 mm EDTA and 31% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 40-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. 3′-Phosphatase Assay—The 5′ 32P-labeled, 3′-phosphate-terminated D10R1-p and D9R1-p strands were prepared by digesting the 5′ 32P-labeled D10R2 and D9R3 primer oligonucleotides with ribonuclease A. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 pmol radiolabeled D10R2 or D9R3 oligonucleotide, 5 mm DTT, and 20 μg RNase A were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The mixtures were extracted with phenol-chloroform. The oligonucleotides were precipitated with ethanol in the presence of glycogen carrier and then annealed to a 4-fold excess of an unlabeled complementary 24-mer DNA strand to generate the 5′-tailed substrates depicted in Fig. 4C. The 3′-phosphatase reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.25 pmol 5′ 32P-labeled D10R1-p or D9R1-p primer-template and enzyme as specified were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 7 mm EDTA and 31% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 40-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The products were visualized by autoradiography. The extent of conversion of the 3′-PO4 oligonucleotide to the slower migrating 3′-OH product was determined by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. Primer-template-directed RNA Polymerization by the Pol Domain of PaeLigD—Previous studies showed that rNTPs are preferred over dNTPs as substrates for non-templated blunt-end addition by PaeLigD (9Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we queried whether the PaeLigD polymerase could incorporate ribonucleotides during a templated fill-in synthesis reaction. The DNA primer-template used was composed of a 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer DNA strand annealed to a complementary 24-mer strand to form the 5′-tailed molecule shown in Fig. 2A. Control experiments showed that the isolated PaeLigD Pol domain catalyzed dNTP-dependent extension of the primer strand until the overhang was filled in completely, after which an extra non-templated dNMP was added to the blunt 3′-end (Ref. 9Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and data not shown). When dNTPs were replaced by rNTPs, the efficiency of primer utilization (defined as the percent of the primer strands elongated by at least one nucleotide) remained high, but the number of rNMPs added was reduced. At enzyme concentrations sufficient to elongate 85–95% of the DNA substrate, rNMP incorporation was limited to 1–3 nucleotides. Further increases in the enzyme concentration resulted in the accumulation of a predominant product with four added rNMPs. Only a very low fraction of the primers was extended beyond the n+4 template position. This result suggested that the LigD polymerase might be sensitive to the pentose sugar composition of the primer strand. To address this point, we used a substrate consisting of a 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer RNA hybridized to the 24-mer DNA template strand (Fig. 2E). The efficiency of RNA primer utilization for RNA synthesis was reduced compared with the DNA primer, e.g. only 12–14% of the ends were extended by levels of polymerase that sufficed to extend 95% of the DNA primer (Fig. 2E versus A). Raising the enzyme concentration resulted in up to 49% primer utilization, but only 1 rNMP was added to the RNA primer at all levels of input enzyme tested. This finding shows that PaeLigD polymerase strongly prefers a DNA primer terminus versus an RNA primer. The basis for the RNA interference effect was revealed by testing a series of 12-mer primers consisting of 11, 10, or 9 deoxynucleotides at their 5′-ends plus 1, 2, or 3 ribonucleotides at their 3′-ends. We observed that substitution of even a single ribonucleotide at the 3′-OH terminus (in the D11R1 substrate shown in Fig. 2B) reduced the efficiency of primer utilization compared with the all-DNA D12 primer. Moreover, most D11R1 primers that were extended at the lower enzyme concentration were elongated by 1 nucleotide, and the product distribution at the highest enzyme concentrations included a mixture of 13-, 14-, 15-, and 16-mer species, but nothing larger (Fig. 2B). When the primer contained two terminal ribonucleotides (D10R2 in Fig. 2C), the primer utilization efficiency declined again, and the major product was the n+1 species, even at high enzyme concentrations. Increasing the RNA tract to 3 nucleotides suppressed primer utilization even further, to the point that the D9R3 substrate phenocopied the all-RNA R12 primer-template construct (Fig. 2D). Together, these data explain the restricted addition of only 4 nucleotides at a DNA primer terminus, as follows: (i) productive use by the PaeLigD Pol domain of the primer 3′-OH terminus depends on contacts with deoxynucleotides at the three terminal positions of the primer strand; (ii) each serial rNMP incorporation event diminishes the ability of the ribo-extended primer to undergo the next round of reaction with an rNTP; and (iii) after 3 ribonucleotides are added, activity is suppressed strongly and effectively limited to only one more cycle of extension under the conditions analyzed. Thus, the impediment to the RNA polymerase activity of LigD is imposed by the primer, not the rNTP substrate. Consistent with this model, we found that RNA tracts at the 3′-primer terminus also suppressed the efficiency of deoxynucleotide incorporation by the LigD Pol domain (data not shown). The implication is that LigD utilization of ribonucleotides for fill-in synthesis during NHEJ is plausible only for short repair tracts. This could include the fill-in events observed in vivo in M. smegmatis at double-strand breaks containing 4-nucleotide 5′-overhangs (8Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Removal of a 3′-Ribonucleotide by PaeLigD—An initial experiment showed that reaction of full-length PaeLigD with the D10R2 primer-template construct in the absence of nucleotides resulted in the shortening of the 5′-radiolabeled primer strand to yield a predominant product that migrated as an 11-mer (see below). No shorter products were detected when PaeLigD was reacted in parallel with the D12 or D11R1 primer-templates, suggesting that the reaction required a diribonucleotide 3′ terminus. To test whether this putative 3′-ribonuclease was intrinsic to PaeLigD, we tracked the activity after sedimenting PaeLigD in a glycerol gradient. We showed previously that ligase and polymerase activities cosedimented with the Pae-LigD protein, which was judged to be a monomer compared with internal standards (9Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When sedimented by itself, the 97-kDa LigD polypeptide comprised a single discrete peak centered at gradient fractions 13–15 (Fig. 3A). The products of the reaction of the glycerol gradient fractions with the D10R2 primer template are shown in Fig. 3B. Fractions 13–15 contained the peak of activity that removed the 3′-terminal ribonucleotide. The peak fractions converted the input 12-mer D10R2 strand to a major species corresponding to an 11-mer D10R1, whereas the flanking fractions 11 and 17 generated a second more rapidly migrating species, which we will identify below as the terminal-phosphorylated 11-mer, D10R1-p. Based on cosedimentation, we would attribute the 3′-ribonuclease activity to the recombinant PaeLigD protein. An Autonomous 3′-Ribonuclease Domain of PaeLigD—We produced an N-terminal fragment, the LigD polypeptide spanning amino acids 1–187 (the putative nuclease domain) in E. coli, as a His10 fusion and purified the recombinant Nuc domain from a soluble bacterial lysate by Ni-agarose and cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 4A). We also produced in parallel a mutated version of the nuclease domain in which the invariant His-84 side chain was replaced by alanine. The H84A protein was purified by Ni-agarose chromatography. The wild-type and mutant LigD-(1–187) preparations were nearly homogeneous with respect to the ∼29 kDa Pae polypeptide (Fig. 4A). The wild-type Nuc domain displayed the same 3′-processing activity on the D10R2 primer-template that was noted above for full-length PaeLigD (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the 3′-processing function was abolished by the H84A mutation, arguing that the observed activity was intrinsic to the Nuc domain (Fig. 4B). The quaternary structure of the Nuc domain was examined by zonal velocity sedimentation in a 15–30% glycerol gradient (Fig. 5). Marker protein catalase (native size 248 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were included as internal standards. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the odd-numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Nuc domain sedimented as a discrete peak (fractions 19–23) between bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c (Fig. 5A), as did the activity responsible for 3′ shortening of the D10R2 substrate (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with a monomeric structure for the isolated Nuc domain. Sequential Mechanism of 3′-Ribonucleotide Removal—A kinetic analysis of the reaction of the Nuc domain with the D10R2 primer-template is shown in Fig. 6A (and, in a separate experiment, in Fig. 8B). The 5′-labeled primer was rapidly converted to a fast migrating species (with apparent size of 10 nt) that comprised 52% of the total labeled material after 1–2 min and decayed steadily at 5, 10, 20, and 30 min. A second product, migrating as an 11-mer, comprised 15% of the total label after 1 min and increased steadily in abundance thereafter, concomitant with the decay of the “10-mer-sized” species. The kinetic data (plotted in Fig. 8C) support a precursor product relationship between the more rapidly migrating species and the 11-mer end product. Because chain length obviously cannot increase with time in the absence of added nucleotides, we suspected that the initial faster migrating intermediate was an 11-mer D10R1-p molecule containing a phosphate at the processed 3′-end and that this intermediate was subsequently converted to an 11-mer D10R1"
https://openalex.org/W2067437913,"Androgen ablation therapy is eventually followed by a more metastatic and androgen-refractory stage of prostate cancer. The detailed molecular mechanism of this gradual transition is not clearly understood. Recent reports correlate the high abundance of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) to the lymph node metastasis seen in human prostate cancer (Tsurusaki et al., 1999). In this study, we report that androgen ablation in LNCaP cells augment the transcriptional upregulation of VEGF-C and the downregulation of the IGF-IR pathway, due to androgen withdrawal, is a potential mechanism for this observed VEGF-C transcription. Forkhead transcription factor FOXO-1, activated by SIRT-1, was identified as the downstream molecule within this pathway. Furthermore, the VEGF-C-induced increase of Bag-IL expression in LNCaP cells suggests that VEGF-C plays a role in the androgen-independent reactivation of the androgen receptor, resulting in androgen-refractory prostate cancer growth."

https://openalex.org/W1517564090,"Rad51 protein plays an essential role in recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks and DNA crosslinking adducts. It is part of complexes which can vary with the stage of the cell cycle and the nature of the DNA lesions. During a search for Rad51-associated proteins in CHO nuclear extracts of S-phase cells by mass spectrometry of proteins immunoprecipitated with Rad51 antibodies, we identified a centrosomal protein, γ-tubulin. This association was confirmed by the reverse immunoprecipitation with γ-tubulin antibodies. Both proteins copurified from HeLa cells nuclear extracts following a tandem affinity purification of double-tagged Rad51. Immunofluorescence analysis showed colocalization of both Rad51 and γ-tubulin in discrete foci in mammalian cell nuclei. The number of colocalized foci and their overlapping area increased in the presence of DNA damage produced by genotoxic treatments either during S phase or in exponentially growing cells. These variations did not result from an overall stress because microtubule cytoskeleton poisons devoid of direct interactions with DNA, such as taxol or colcemid, did not lead to an increase of this association. The recruitment of Rad51 and γ-tubulin in the same nuclear complex suggests a link between DNA recombination repair and the centrosome function during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1967738861,"Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a member of the transforming growth factor-β family responsible for regression of Müllerian ducts during male sexual differentiation and for regulation of gonadal steroidogenesis. AMH is also a gonadal tumor suppressor which mediates its effects through a specific type II receptor and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-specific Smad proteins, suggesting that AMH and BMPs could also share type I receptors, namely activin-like kinases (ALKs)2, 3 or 6. However, attempts to identify a unique AMH type I receptor among them were unsuccessful. Here, using kinase-deficient type I receptors and small interfering RNA technology, we demonstrate that, in an AMH Sertoli target cell line, ALK3 mediates AMH effects on both Smad1 activation and P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme. In addition, transfecting a combination of normal and kinase-deficient receptors, we show that ALK2 can compensate for the absence of ALK3 and probably acts in synergy with ALK3 at high concentrations of AMH to activate Smad1, whereas ALK6 has a competitive inhibitory effect. These results are a first step in understanding how AMH transduces its effects in immature Sertoli cells."
https://openalex.org/W2168982956,"The HOX11/TLX1 homeobox gene is aberrantly expressed in a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we employed oligonucleotide microarrays to compare the expression profiles of the K3P and Sil leukemic cell lines originating from patients with HOX11+ T-ALL to that of Jurkat cells, which originated from a distinct subtype of T-ALL (TAL1+). To distinguish potential HOX11 target genes from those characteristic of the stage of HOX11 leukemic arrest, we also performed gene expression analysis on Jurkat cells, genetically engineered to express exogenous HOX11. The resulting HOX11 gene expression signature, which was validated for representative signaling pathways by transient transfection of reporter constructs, was characterized by elevated expression of transcriptional programs involved in cell proliferation, including those regulated by E2F, c-Myc and cAMP response element-binding protein. We subsequently showed that ectopic HOX11 expression resulted in hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which correlated with inhibition of the major Rb serine/threonine phosphatase PP1. HOX11 also inhibited PP2A serine/threonine phosphatase activity concomitant with stimulation of the AKT/PKB signaling cascade. These results suggest that transcriptional deregulation of G1/S growth-control genes, mediated in large part through blockade of PP1/PP2A phosphatase activity, plays an important role in HOX11 pathobiology."
https://openalex.org/W2086620010,"Wilms tumor is one of the most frequent neoplasias in children. Our previous microarray screening in a large series of Wilms tumors revealed several candidate genes that are deregulated in advanced tumors and are part of the retinoic acid signaling pathway. To investigate whether retinoic acid could be employed as a novel therapeutic agent in these tumors, we treated cultured Wilms tumor cells with different concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and assessed gene expression changes by real-time RT–PCR as well as microarray analysis. Several genes like RARRES1, RARRES3, CTGF, CKS2, CCNA2, IGFBP3, UBE2C, CCL2 or ITM2B that were previously found to be deregulated in advanced tumors exhibited opposite expression changes after ATRA treatment. In addition to enhanced retinoid signaling, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) pathway was strongly activated by ATRA treatment of Wilms tumor cells. Both the retinoic acid and the TGFβ pathway mediate inhibition of cell growth. These findings represent the first molecular evidence of a potential benefit from ATRA treatment in Wilms tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2030045830,"Evi-1 is a transcription factor that is implicated in leukemic transformation of hematopoietic cells. Two distinct alternative forms, Evi-1a and Evi-1c, are generated from the EVI-1 gene. Whereas Evi-1a is widely recognized as an oncoprotein, a role for Evi-1c, which has an additional PR domain in the amino-terminus of Evi-1a, in leukemogenesis, has not been elucidated thus far. Aberrant oligomerization of transcription factors has recently emerged as a prevalent mechanism for activating their oncogenic potential in hematopoietic malignancies. Here, to study the mechanisms that underlie Evi-1-mediated oncogenesis, we investigated formation of oligomeric complexes by the Evi-1 proteins. We show that Evi-1a forms homo-oligomers, whereas Evi-1c exclusively exists as a monomer in mammalian cells. Remarkably, Evi-1c has lost the ability to interact with CtBP, a transcriptional corepressor that associates with Evi-1a. As a consequence, the ability of Evi-1c to repress transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling is significantly abrogated. These results identify a novel function of a PR domain to regulate oligomerization of transcription factors and suggest that homo-oligomerization may play a critical role in corepressor recruitment by the Evi-1 proteins. In addition, we found that the chimeric oncoprotein acute myelocytic leukemia (AML)1-Evi-1, generated in t(3;21) leukemia, also forms homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with Evi-1a, while it did not interact with Evi-1c. Consistent with the results, repression of TGF-β by AML1-Evi-1 was significantly enhanced by Evi-1a, whereas it was hardly affected by the presence of Evi-1c. These results suggest that oligomerization may contribute to the oncogenic potential of Evi-1-containing proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2092532006,"Nuclease A (NucA) is a nonspecific endonuclease from Anabaena sp. capable of degrading single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA in the presence of divalent metal ions. We have determined the structure of the Δ(2-24),D121A mutant of NucA in the presence of Zn2+ and Mn2+ (PDB code 1ZM8). The mutations were introduced to remove the N-terminal signal peptide and to reduce the activity of the nonspecific nuclease, thereby reducing its toxicity to the Escherichia coli expression system. NucA contains a ββα metal finger motif and a hydrated Mn2+ ion at the active site. Unexpectedly, NucA was found to contain additional metal binding sites ∼26 A apart from the catalytic metal binding site. A structural comparison between NucA and the closest analog for which structural data exist, the Serratia nuclease, indicates several interesting differences. First, NucA is a monomer rather than a dimer. Second, there is an unexpected structural homology between the N-terminal segments despite a poorly conserved sequence, which in Serratia includes a cysteine bridge thought to play a regulatory role. In addition, although a sequence alignment had suggested that NucA lacks a proposed catalytic residue corresponding to Arg57 in Serratia, the structure determined here indicates that Arg93 in NucA is positioned to fulfill this role. Based on comparison with DNA-bound nuclease structures of the ββα metal finger nuclease family and available mutational data on NucA, we propose that His124 acts as a catalytic base, and Arg93 participates in the catalysis possibly through stabilization of the transition state."

https://openalex.org/W1970336048,"Prothrombin is activated to thrombin by two sequential factor Xa-catalyzed cleavages, at Arg271 followed by cleavage at Arg320. Factor Va, along with phospholipid and Ca2+, enhances the rate of the process by 300,000-fold, reverses the order of cleavages, and directs the process through the meizothrombin pathway, characterized by initial cleavage at Arg320. Previous work indicated reduced rates of prothrombin activation with recombinant mutant factor Va defective in factor Xa binding (E323F/Y324F and E330M/V331I, designated factor VaFF/MI). The present studies were undertaken to determine whether loss of activity can be attributed to selective loss of efficiency at one or both of the two prothrombin-activating cleavage sites. Kinetic constants for the overall activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with saturating concentrations of recombinant mutant factor Va were calculated, prothrombin activation was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and rate constants for both cleavages were analyzed from the time course of the concentration of meizothrombin. Prothrombinase assembled with factor VaFF/MI had decreased kcat for prothrombin activation with Km remaining unaffected. Prothrombinase assembled with saturating concentrations of factor VaFF/MI showed significantly lower rate for cleavage of plasma-derived prothrombin at Arg320 than prothrombinase assembled with saturating concentrations of wild type factor Va. These results were corroborated by analysis of cleavage of recombinant prothrombin mutants rMz-II (R155A/R284A/R271A) and rP2-II (R155A/R284A/R320A), which can be cleaved only at Arg320 or Arg271, respectively. Time courses of these mutants indicated that mutations in the factor Xa binding site of factor Va reduce rates for both bonds. These data indicate that the interaction of factor Xa with the heavy chain of factor Va strongly influences the catalytic activity of the enzyme resulting in increased rates for both prothrombin-activating cleavages. Prothrombin is activated to thrombin by two sequential factor Xa-catalyzed cleavages, at Arg271 followed by cleavage at Arg320.

Kinetic constants for the overall activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with saturating concentrations of recombinant mutant factor Va were calculated, prothrombin activation was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and rate constants for both cleavages were analyzed from the time course of the concentration of meizothrombin. Prothrombinase assembled with factor VaFF/MI had decreased kcat for prothrombin activation with Km remaining unaffected. Prothrombinase assembled with saturating concentrations of factor VaFF/MI showed significantly lower rate for cleavage of plasma-derived prothrombin at Arg320 than prothrombinase assembled with saturating concentrations of wild type factor Va. These results were corroborated by analysis of cleavage of recombinant prothrombin mutants rMz-II (R155A/R284A/R271A) and rP2-II (R155A/R284A/R320A), which can be cleaved only at Arg320 or Arg271, respectively. Time courses of these mutants indicated that mutations in the factor Xa binding site of factor Va reduce rates for both bonds. These data indicate that the interaction of factor Xa with the heavy chain of factor Va strongly influences the catalytic activity of the enzyme resulting in increased rates for both prothrombin-activating cleavages. Blood coagulation is necessary to stop blood from leaking out of the vasculature and involves a number of specific serine proteases that are activated by limited proteolysis. The end result of this process is the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, which in turn cleaves fibrinogen to produce the insoluble fibrin mesh (1Kalafatis M. Egan J.O. van't Veer C. Cawthern K.M. Mann K.G. Crit. Rev. Eukariotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 241-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Prothrombin is activated physiologically by the prothrombinase complex, which is composed of the non-enzymatic cofactor, factor Va, the enzyme, factor Xa, and the substrate, prothrombin, associated on a cell membrane surface in the presence of Ca2+ (2Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Blood. 2003; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of prothrombin to thrombin is a consequence of two cleavages at Arg271 and Arg320 by factor Xa. Depending on the order of peptide bond cleavage, different intermediates are formed (Fig. 1). Initial cleavage at Arg271 will produce fragment 1·2 and prethrombin-2, whereas initial cleavage at Arg320 results in the formation of meizothrombin, which has optimal amidolytic activity but diminished clotting activity (4Heldebrant C.M.

Although factor Xa alone cleaves prothrombin sequentially at Arg271 followed by Arg320 to produce thrombin (Fig. 1, pathway I), the rate of the overall reaction for thrombin formation is slow and incompatible with survival. The prothrombinase complex catalyzes the activation of prothrombin following the second pathway (Arg320 followed by Arg271, Fig. 1, pathway II), resulting in a 300,000-fold increase in the rate of the overall reaction compared with the rate of prothrombin activation observed with factor Xa alone and represents the physiological relevant pathway for prothrombin activation (3Nesheim M.E.

Although both cleavages are phospholipid-dependent, only initial cleavage of prothrombin at Arg320 is strictly dependent on factor Va. The overall increase in the catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase when compared with the activation of prothrombin by factor Xa alone appears to arise from a 100-fold decrease in the Km and a 3,000-fold increase in the kcat of the enzyme (10Rosing J.

Human prothrombin is composed of 579 amino acids and circulates in blood at a concentration of 1.4 μm (17Degen S.J.F. Sun W.Y. Crit. Rev. Eukariotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the importance of the contribution of factor Va to the activity of factor Xa for rapid thrombin generation by prothrombinase at the place of vascular injury has been long established, the consequence of the interaction of the cofactor with the components of prothrombinase and the molecular mechanism by which factor Va reverses the order of cleavages and increases the rate of the overall catalysis remain enigmatic and are the subjects of intense investigation. Proteolytic processing of factor V by thrombin at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 is required for the interaction of the cofactor with the members of prothrombinase and produces a factor Va molecule that consists of a heavy chain (Mr 105,000) and a light chain (Mr 74,000) (18Nesheim M.E.

Chem. 1982; 257: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both chains of factor Va and Ca2+ are required for the interaction with factor Xa, only the heavy chain of the cofactor binds prothrombin in a Ca2+-independent manner (20Esmon C.T. Owen W.G.

Cleavage of factor Va by APC at Arg506/Arg679 results in decreased affinity of the molecule for factor Xa and eliminates its interaction with prothrombin (21Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Subsequent cleavage of the membrane-bound cofactor at Arg306, completely abolishes the ability of factor Va to interact with factor Xa (23Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The interaction of factor Va with factor Xa and prothrombin has been long established as a requirement for optimum rates of prothrombin activation (3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

However, the consequences of these associations on the mechanism of catalysis and the discrete amino acid regions from the molecules that are involved in protein-protein interaction have remained puzzling. Furthermore, earlier findings as well as data using mutant prothrombin molecules have suggested that the rate of cleavage at Arg320 largely benefits from incorporation of factor Va into prothrombinase while the rate of cleavage at Arg271 appears to be less affected (12Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

We have recently identified binding sites for factor Xa and prothrombin in the middle portion and the COOH terminus of the heavy chain of factor Va, respectively (27Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Mann K.G.

Our findings suggested that factor Va has a crucial effect on prothrombinase activity, orchestrating the spatial arrangement of enzyme and substrate, ultimately directing cleavage and activation of prothrombin by factor Xa at two spatially distinct proteolytic sites (28Beck D.O.

The present study was undertaken to identify and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution factor Va to the two factor Xa-mediated prothrombin-activating cleavages following its incorporation into prothrombinase.

Normal reference plasma and the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme-TH were from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, CT). The thromboplastin reagent for the clotting assays was purchased from Organon Teknika Corp. (Durham, NC). The fluorescent thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA), RVV-factor V activator, human factor Xa, human thrombin, a sheep anti-human factor V polyclonal antibody, and the monoclonal antibody αhFV#1 coupled to Sepharose were from Hematologic Technologies Inc.

A final step was included in the purification procedure that included the use of hydroxy-apatite column chromatography (Bio-Rad) to eliminate a proteolytic product from prothrombin that was consistently present in all final prothrombin preparations. Recombinant prothrombin molecules rMZ-II (prothrombin with the substitutions Arg155 → Ala, Arg284 → Ala, and Arg271 → Ala) and rP2-II (prothrombin with the substitutions Arg155 → Ala, R284 → Ala, and R320 → Ala) were prepared and purified as described previously (13Brufatto N.

The sequence of this cDNA molecule is identical to the cDNA published by Jenny et al. (34Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and all other molecular biology and tissue culture reagents and media were from Invitrogen or as indicated. Human plasma factor V and factor Va were purified and concentrated using methodologies previously described employing the monoclonal antibody αhFV#1 coupled to Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose (30Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 80: 243-275Google Scholar). The cofactor activity of the plasma-derived and recombinant factor Va preparations was measured by a clotting assay using factor V-deficient plasma using an automated coagulation analyzer (START-4, Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ). Phospholipids vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS (referred to as PCPS vesicles throughout the manuscript) were prepared as previously described (36Barenholz Y. Gibbs D. Litmann B.J. Goll J. Thompson T. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The concentration of phospholipid vesicles was determined by phosphorous assay as described earlier and is given as the concentration of inorganic phosphate (37Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and Transient Expression of Recombinant Factor V Molecules—All mutant factor V molecules described herein were synthesized by PCR-based methods as described (28Beck D.O. Bukys M.A. Singh L.S. Szabo K.A. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3084-3095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Singh L.S. Bukys M.A. Beck D.O. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28335-28345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The activity and the integrity of the molecules were verified before and after activation by thrombin by clotting assays using factor V-deficient plasma and by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using well characterized monoclonal antibodies (provided by Dr. Ken Mann, Department of Biochemistry, University of Vermont). Measurement of Rates of Thrombin Formation in a Prothrombinase Assay—All factor V species (plasma and recombinant) were activated with thrombin for 15 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of diisopropylfluorophosphate (2 mm, Sigma). The assay verifying the activity of the recombinant molecules was conducted as described by measuring thrombin formation by the change in the absorbance of a chromogenic substrate at 405 nm (Spectrozyme-TH) monitored with a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) (31Singh L.S. Bukys M.A. Beck D.O. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28335-28345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 405 nm was compared with a standard curve prepared daily using purified thrombin (0-50 nm). For the functional calculation of the apparent dissociation constants ( KDapp) between the recombinant factor Va molecules and factor Xa, experiments were performed in the presence of a limited concentration of factor Xa (between 15 and 30 pm) and varying concentrations of factor Va (up to 20 nm). The initial rates of thrombin generation in the various assay mixtures under the conditions employed were linear, and in all experiments no more than 10% of prothrombin was consumed during the initial course of the assay. The initial rate of the formation of thrombin (initial velocity in nm·IIa·min-1) was calculated, and the data were analyzed and plotted assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between factor Va and factor Xa (one binding site) using the software Prizm (Graph-Pad, San Diego, CA) as described (27Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33550-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 20527-20534Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Once the value of the KDapp for the bimolecular interaction of each species of factor Va with factor Xa was determined, the amount of recombinant factor Va required to completely saturate factor Xa and provide similar amount of enzyme (prothrombinase) when using various mutant recombinant factor Va molecules (between 90% and >99% saturation) can be calculate as abundantly described in the literature (39Krishnaswamy S. Williams E.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9684-9693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 272: 23696-23706Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For the calculation of the kinetic constants of prothrombinase assembled with the various recombinant mutant factor Va molecules as well as with plasma factor Va (Km and Vmax), experiments were conducted in the presence of a limited amount of factor Xa (5 pm) in the presence of a fixed and saturating concentration of factor Va (5-30 nm) while varying the amount of the substrate (plasma-derived prothrombin) from 25 nm to 6 μm. Kinetic constants (Km and kcat) were extracted directly from the plotted data. Additivity of the Mutational Effects of Substitutions 323EY324 → FF and 330EV331 → MI on Prothrombinase Function—Prothrombinase is composed of factor Va and factor Xa assembled on a membrane surface in the presence of divalent metal ions. Any perturbation in the interaction between the two molecules caused by a mutation may influence or modify the stability of the catalytic site of the enzyme and can be measured by the change in the transition-state stabilization of free energy for prothrombin activation as extensively described (41Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 42LiCata V.J. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 44Mildvan A.S.

Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the consequence of the mutations in factor Va affecting factor Xa catalytic efficiency and their additivity can be measured relative to the change in transition-state stabilization free energy (ΔΔG‡) of the enzyme as previously established (41Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 42LiCata V.J. Ackers G.K.

Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To assess whether the two sets of mutations affecting the interaction of factor Va with factor Xa (E323F/Y324F; E330M/V331I) energetically interact, four separate free energies associated with the catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase must be measured: ΔGwt, the functional free energy in prothrombinase assembled with wild-type factor Va; ΔGFF, the functional free energy in prothrombinase assembled with factor VaFF; ΔGMI, the functional free energy in prothrombinase assembled with factor VaMI; and ΔGFF/MI, the functional free energy in prothrombinase assembled with factor VaFF/MI. In general, the perturbation to the function of prothrombinase assembled with wild type factor Va (state A), caused by a mutation in factor Va (state B) affecting the transition state, can be defined in general as follows,ΔΔGB=ΔGB−ΔGA(Eq. 1) and because we are measuring prothrombinase activity assembled in the presence of various factor Va molecules against the same substrate (prothrombin), the changes in transition-state stabilization free energy (ΔΔG‡) during catalysis caused by a mutation in factor Va (state B) can be calculated from the following general equation,ΔΔG‡A→B=−RTln[(kcat/Km)B/(kcat/Km)A(Eq. 2) with R being the universal gas constant (2 cal·K-1·mol-1), T the absolute temperature in Kelvin (298 K in all our experiments), kcat is the turnover number, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant for prothrombinase assembled with either wild-type or mutant factor Va molecules. In addition, the free energy of the interaction between two mutations in factor Va (A → B and A → C; where A represents the wild type factor Va, B and C represent cofactor molecules with two different mutations, and B/C represent a double mutant factor Va molecule) can be calculated with the following general equation (42LiCata V.J.

A value of ΔΔGint >0 or <0 implies that the side chains of the mutated amino acids interact with each other, reducing or enhancing, respectively, the catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase. Analysis of Prothrombin Activation by Gel Electrophoresis—Plasma-derived prothrombin or recombinant mutant prothrombin molecules (1.4 μm) were incubated with PCPS vesicles (20 μm), DAPA (50 μm), and factor Va (10 nm or as indicated in the figure legends) in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ in 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by the addition of factor Xa (0.5 nm or as indicated in the figure legends) at room temperature. At selected time intervals (also indicated in the figure legends) aliquots from the reaction were removed and immediately diluted into 2 volumes of 0.2 m glacial acetic acid and concentrated using a Centrivap concentrator attached to a Centrivap cold trap (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). The dried samples were dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-base, pH 6.8, 1% SDS (final concentration), 1% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration), heated for exactly 75 s at 90 °C, mixed again, and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 9.5% gels according to the method of Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Usually, 6 μg of total protein per lane were applied. Protein bands were visualized following staining by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained by diffusion in a methanol/acetic acid/water solution.

Primases play an indispensable role in DNA replication by synthesizing theRNA primers needed for initiation of de novo DNA synthesis(1Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, bothleading and lagging strand syntheses are primed by the polymeraseα-primase complex (2Waga S. Stillman B. Annu.Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Inbacteriophage T4, the leading strand primer is synthesized by theEscherichia coli RNA polymerase during the early phase of phage DNAreplication, or provided through strand invasion via homologous recombinationin the late phase of replication(3Mathews C.K.

Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Gp61 primase recognizes two trinucleotide sequences in vitro,5′-GTT-3′ and 5′-GCT-3′, but uses only the formersequence in vivo as the priming site(5Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J.Biol.

Although gp61 alone is ableto synthesize primers on a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate, its maximumactivity is achieved only through interaction with the helicase (gp41) to formthe primosome complex (6Hinton D.M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several other T4 proteins,including the helicase accessory protein (gp59) and the single-strandedDNA-binding protein (gp32), also modulate primase activity presumably byeither facilitating the formation of the primosome or directly interactingwith it (7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Among all the T4 replisome proteins, the helicase exhibits the greateststimulatory effect on the priming activity of the primase. T4 helicase, likeT7 and E. coli DnaB helicases(8Singleton M.R.

Chem. 1994; 50: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), acts as a hexamer and formsa ring structure encircling the lagging strand(10Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Spiering M.M. Ishmael F.T.

Movement of thishexameric ring is driven by ATP hydrolysis along the lagging strand in the5′ to 3′ direction and simultaneously unwinds the duplex DNA infront of the entire replisome(12Liu C.C.

Alberts B. J.Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16678-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).On the other hand, gp61 dissociates during lagging strand synthesis, whichresults in repeated assembly and disassembly of the primosome duringreplication (16Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Yang J. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49839-49849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the primase interacts closely with the helicase, it has been ofinterest to understand the structural features of such an interaction. Onequestion is whether gp61 also forms a multimeric structure like gp41.Oligomerization of the replicative primase has been observed in several othersystems. T7 primase forms a hexameric ring because of the fact that theprimase and the helicase activities reside on the same peptide(17Toth E.A. Li Y. Sawaya M.R. Cheng Y. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1113-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggestthat E. coli DnaG primase also forms a higher order trimericstructure when interacting with the DnaB helicase(18Mitkova A.V. Khopde S.M. Biswas S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52253-52261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the T4 system,several analytical methods previously failed to detect the oligomerization ofgp61 in the absence of DNA and gp41(7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,19Dong F. von Hippel P.H. J.Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19625-19631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the presence of DNAand/or gp41, a study using gel mobility shift analysis suggested a monomericprimase as the active component of the primosome(19Dong F. von Hippel P.H. J.Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19625-19631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although transient orunstable protein-protein interactions may not be detected by such an approach.In contrast, a more recent investigation that employed isothermal titrationcalorimetry (ITC) and chemical cross-linking techniques revealed the existenceof oligomeric states of the gp61 primase(7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this work, we confirm the oligomerization of gp61 upon binding to DNA bymonitoring the change in fluorescence anisotropy. Moreover, a recent electronmicroscopy study revealed a symmetric, hexameric structure for the primase inthe presence of ssDNA (10Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Spiering M.M. Ishmael F.T. Trakselis M.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3623-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The measured 6:1 stoichiometry of gp61/DNA binding further supports theformation of a hexameric T4 primase. The priming kinetics for various, mixedpopulations of oligomers derived from WT and an inactive mutant gp61demonstrate that the multimeric gp61 is the functional form and that subunitinteractions within the gp61 oligomer affect its priming activity. Our resultsalso indicate that oligomer formation is an intrinsic property of gp61 uponinteracting with DNA and takes place even in the absence of the gp41helicase. [α-32P]CTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Unlabeled ribonucleotides were purchased from Roche Biochemicals. Oregon Green488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, 5-isomer (OG) was obtained fromMolecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bacteriophage T4 proteins gp41, gp61, and gp61(E234Q) were purified as previously described(7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J.

Pfu Turbo DNA polymerasewas from Stratagene and all restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs.All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. The DNA Substrate—Two oligomeric single-stranded DNAsubstrates were used in this study. Oligo A (67-mer) has the sequence of5′-GATGGGTAGAGATGAGGTTATTAGTGGTAGTGTGTAGTGAGTGTGATTCGTAGTGGTCATGGATGGG-3′and was used in all priming reactions. Oligo B (20-mer) has the sequence of5′-TGGGTGATGTTGATGTCTAG-3′ and was used in thefluorescence anisotropy and chemical cross-linking experiments. The primingsites in both oligos are underlined. Before use, the DNA oligos were purifiedon denaturing polyacrylamide Hoefer gels. The desired bands were cut out andrecovered by a crush-and-soak method in pH 7.5 TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA), purified on Sep-Pak columns, dried bySpeedVac, and redissolved in deionized water. The concentration of DNA oligoswas determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The molar absorptioncoefficient was calculated as the sum of those of individual nucleotides:ϵ = 15,400 (dA), 9,100 (dC), 13,700 (dG), and 9,600m–1 cm–1 (dT)(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. ColdSpring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: C5-C10Google Scholar). The purity of all oligoswas analyzed on a 16% denaturing acrylamide sequencing gel and is greater than95%. The procedure for labeling oligo B with fluorophores is given below. OligoB was synthesized with a 5′ amino-modifier C2-dT (Glenn Research,Sterling, VA) at its 5′ end using standard β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry and purified as described above. The oligo was thenlabeled with a 50-fold excess of OG in a pH 8.5, 100 mm sodiumtetraborate buffer for 4 h at room temperature protected against light. Thereaction mixture was then precipitated with ethanol and microcentrifuged forat least 30 min. The resulting pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, dried,redissolved in water, and purified by anion-exchange high performance liquidchromatography (solvent A, pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA; solvent B, pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1m NaCl; gradient, 90% A to 70% A over 5 min, then to 45% A over 10min, then to 25% A over 15 min and to 0% A over 5 min). The labeled oligo wascollected and subject to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography(solvent C, acetonitrile; solvent D, 100 mm triethylamine acetate,pH 6.8; gradient, 0% C for 5 min, to 30% C over 10 min, then to 90% C over 1min and maintained at 90% C for 13 min). The desired labeled oligo wascollected and dried. The Standard Priming Reactions—Priming reactions werecarried out in a complex buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH7.5, 125 mm KOAc, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. Thestandard priming reactions in the presence of gp41 helicase contained 2μm oligo A, 3.4 μm gp41, 4 mm ATP, 400μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP and various ratios of WT gp61 tomutant gp61 (E234Q) (as indicated in figure legends) in a typical reactionvolume of 20 μl. [α-32P]CTP was used for labeling theprimer. In the absence of gp41 helicase, DNA (20 μm) and higherconcentrations of WT gp61 and gp61 mutants (see figure legends) were used inthe standard priming reactions. In all reactions, DNA and the proteins werefirst mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of rNTPsto initiate the reaction. Reaction aliquots were withdrawn at various timesand quenched with an equal volume of 500 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Primingproducts were analyzed by 20% denaturing acrylamide sequencing gelelectrophoresis. Autoradiography was accomplished with a Molecular DynamicsStorm 800 Phosphoimager system (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of primersynthesized was quantified using Quantity One Quantitation Software (Bio-Rad)and comparing it to a standard obtained by spotting a known amount ofradioactive sample directly onto the DE81 filter paper. Steady-state Fluorescence AnisotropyMeasurements—Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy experiments wereperformed using an ISA Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer equipped with apolarizer (Edison, NJ). The OG label was irradiated at 492 nm and the emissionwas measured at 523 nm. Slit widths were set at a 2-nm band pass for theexcitation and a 16-nm band pass for the emission. The integration time was0.3 s. The fluorescence anisotropy (A) measures the level ofpolarization of light emitted when a fluorophore is irradiated with polarizedlight: A = (I⊥ – G ×I∥)/(I⊥ + G × 2I∥), whereI∥ and I⊥ are intensities of the emitted lightparallel to and perpendicular to the polarization plane of excitation andG is the correction for instrument response to polarized light at aparticular emission wavelength(22Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Titration experimentswere performed by the addition of a constant volume of primase solution into acuvette containing OG-labeled oligo B (100 nm) in the assay buffer(pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-OAc, 50 mm KOAc, 6 mmMg(OAc)2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). A typical samplevolume was 1.4 ml and an average of 10 to 13 readings over a 2–4-minspan was used to determine the final reading at each concentration ofprimase. Assuming that primase has independent but identical binding sites, thedissociation constant and the molar ratio of primase to DNA substrate atsaturation were determined by fitting the binding isotherm toEquation 1 using a non-linearleast square curve fit program, Origin 5 (MicroCal Software, Inc.,Northampton, MA).A=Af+(Ab−Af)×(Lt+Kd+nRt)+[(−Lt−Kd−nRt)2−4LtnRt)]1/22Lt(Eq. 1) Lt, the total added concentration of ligand;Rt, the total concentration of receptor;Af, the anisotropy for the free ligand;Ab, the anisotropy for the fully bound ligand; A,observed anisotropy value; Kd, the dissociation constantbetween ligand and receptor; n, the binding ratio between ligand andreceptor. Limited Subtilisin Proteolysis of Gp61 Primase and N-terminalSequencing of the Proteolytic Fragment—A typical subtilisindigestion was carried out in a 40-μl solution containing 10 mmTris acetate, pH 7.8, 25 mm KOAc, 5 mmMg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 14 μm gp61,and 1.4 μm subtilisin (Sigma). Before the addition ofsubtilisin, a 10-μl aliquot was removed, quenched with 2 μl of 5mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and mixed with 4 μl of SDS gelloading buffer to serve as the zero time point of digestion. After theaddition of subtilisin, 10-μl aliquots were removed at specified timepoints, quenched with 2 μl of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and mixed with 4 μl of SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. The sampleswere analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels. A major proteolyticfragment with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa that built up during theproteolytic treatment was subjected to N-terminal sequencing (MicromolecularCore Facility, the Huck Institute of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania StateUniversity). The N-terminal sequence of KEKGK was unambiguously determined forthe gp61 C-terminal proteolytic fragment. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Truncated Gp61 C-terminalDomain Protein—The limited proteolysis of gp61 revealed a majorcleavage site before Lys-95. The C-terminal portion of gp61 (amino acid94–342, gp61C) was cloned from wild type gp61 DNA by using the primers61CterF and 61CterR with the sequences of5′-GTATATCTTTGAACATATGAAAGAAAAAGGTAAAAG and5′-CGATTCGCTCTTCCGCAACCCTTAGCATATTTAG, respectively. These primerscontain NdeI and SapI restriction sites used for cloning the target gene intothe pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs) to make the gp61C intein-fusion proteinconstruct. The PCR product and the pTYB1 plasmid were digested separately withSapI for 4 h at 37 °C. Then NdeI was added to the PCR product digest, andboth NdeI and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were added to the pTYB1 plasmiddigest. The digestion was allowed to continue for 10 h. The resulting insertand digested plasmid were purified by 0.8% agarose gel and then ligated usingT4 DNA ligase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Theligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5α cells andthe plasmid was purified using a Qiagen miniprep kit. The presence and thesequence of the insert were verified by DNA sequencing (Pennsylvania StateUniversity Nucleic Acid Facility). The cloned gene encodes a protein with anN-terminal methionine and the 248 residues that correspond to amino acidsequence 95–342 of the WT T4 primase C-terminal portion and is presentas an intein fusion protein. The intein-fusion protein was purified using a chitin affinity column asdescribed previously (7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Theprotein concentration was determined by using a calculated extinctioncoefficient of ϵ280 nm = 48,960m–1cm–1. A typical preparationyielded ∼20 mg of purified protein at >98% purity. The Primase in Vitro Activity Complementation Assay—Standardpriming reactions were carried out in the presence of 19 μmoligo A, 2 μm gp41, and various amounts of gp61(E234Q)(0–3.9 μm) and gp61C-terminal domain protein (0 to 4.8μm). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 min and werequenched in pH 8.0, 500 mm EDTA solution. The priming products wereanalyzed by 20% denaturing acrylamide sequencing gel electrophoresis asdescribed above. Cross-linking of Gp61 and Gp61(E234Q)—WT gp61 and thegp61(E234Q) mutant were dialyzed against a labeling buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and each separatelylabeled with a 5-fold excess of biotinamidocaproateN-hydroxysuccinimide for 4 h at 4 °C. The labeled protein wasthen dialyzed against the cross-linking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.3, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) to remove the excess biotin,frozen in aliquots, and stored at –70 °C. The labeling processeswere performed in less than 30 h and the labeled wild type primase retainedactivity comparable with unlabeled primase in the priming assay. A typical cross-linking experiment was initiated by adding 1 μlof20μm bis-maleimidylhexane (Pierce) inN,N-dimethylformamide to a mixture of WT gp61 and gp61(E234Q) and 0.1μm oligo B in the cross-linking buffer (final volume 40 μl).The total concentration of WT and mutant gp61 was kept at 0.6μm, whereas ratios between the two were varied as required. Onlyone protein in the mixture carried a biotin tag, for instance, thebiotinylated WT gp61 was mixed with the unlabeled mutant gp61 or vice versa.The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 min and thenquenched by the addition of 5 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (60mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol, and108 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were separated andanalyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulosemembrane (Micron), which was blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 3%bovine serum albumin in pH 7.6, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing140 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). The membrane was incubatedwith 1:8000 dilution of neutravidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce)in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST at room temperature for 1 h after theblocking step, then washed with TBST (4 × 10 min each) and developedwith a luminol/hydrogen peroxide mixture (Pierce). Chemiluminescence wasdetected by BioMax film (Kodak) with typical exposure times of 20–60s. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements of the Gp61/DNAInteraction—Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were carried out toinvestigate the possible oligomerization state of the primase and to measurethe binding affinity of the primase/ssDNA interaction. The 5′-OG-labeledoligo B with one priming site in the middle of the sequence served assubstrate. The same DNA substrate lacking a fluorescent label is active in thepriming assay (data not shown). Changes in fluorescence anisotropy of thelabeled 20-mer oligo B were measured and plotted as a function of gp61concentration. The resulting data were fit to a binding isotherm(Fig. 1) that required a 6± 1 stoichiometry for gp61 to DNA assuming that each primase subunitacts independently. The Kd value calculated for thegp61·DNA complex is 66 nm, in agreement with theKd of 50–100 nm measured in a previousstudy (7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J.

The observed stoichiometry most likely reflects binding of the primasemonomer to its priming site and concomitant formation of a hexameric ringstructure, rather than simply coating the DNA in a “side by side”filament-like fashion. The helicase gp41 (54 kDa) and the helicase loader gp59(26 kDa) have been shown to form oligomeric structures when bound to DNA witha binding footprint of 12–20 nucleotides for gp41(23Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and 8–10nucleotides for gp59 (24Lefebvre S.D. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Based on a recent EM study, the depth of the gp61 ring structure is close to3/4 of that of gp41 (10Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Spiering M.M. Ishmael F.T. Trakselis M.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3623-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Therefore, a binding site with an estimated size of 9–15 nucleotides wasexpected for gp61. A 20-mer ssDNA substrate with a priming site at the middleof the sequence should eliminate the possibility of binding of two gp61molecules in a side by side fashion on the DNA substrate. Furthermore, in aprevious ITC experiment, 3–4 primase molecules were found to bind ssDNAoligos of two different sizes (24-mer and 45-mer) that contained only onepriming site in the middle of the sequences(7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), consistent with gp61clustering around the priming site. The observed 6:1 stoichiometry, however,is different from the 3–4 primases bound per ssDNA oligo obtainedearlier. We attribute this in part to the different sensitivities of theexperimental approaches with the ITC protocol that requires higher levels ofproteins, possibly compromised by aggregation(7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This DNA binding stoichiometry was generated in the absence of thehelicase. Therefore, unlike the T7 primase, gp61 is capable of formingoligomers even in the absence of its helicase. Given the strong stimulatoryeffect of the helicase on gp61 priming activity, we would expect that oligomerformation by the primase will be facilitated by gp41. Priming at Various Primase Concentrations—We next carriedout kinetic experiments to determine whether the multimeric form of theprimase is the functional form. Oligo A was used in all priming kineticassays. We first measured the priming activity at different gp61concentrations in the presence of saturating amounts of DNA and gp41. In allreactions, the concentrations of DNA (2 μm) and gp41 (3.4μm) were much higher than their Kd valuesfor primase binding (∼100 nm, Ref.7Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and were in large excessover those of the primase (30–480 nm). Thekcat values thus can be measured directly from theobserved rate of priming. If the primase acts only as monomer, the rate ofpriming should be proportional to the primase concentrations and no change inkcat (Vpriming/[primase]) should beobserved at below saturation primase concentrations. However, if there is amonomer/oligomer equilibrium where the turnover numbers for the two speciesare different, varying the primase concentration would induce a shift in thisequilibrium and hence a change in the apparent kcat value.Specifically, if the multimeric form is more active, an increase inkcat will be observed with increasing gp61 concentrations.Likewise, a decrease in kcat would indicate that themonomeric form is the more active form(25Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J.Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,26Kurganov B.I. Yakovlev V.A. AllostericEnzymes: Kinetic Behaviour. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester,UK1982: 151-248Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, theapparent kcat for priming increases approximately 400-foldfrom 0.0036 to 1.375 min–1 upon raising the primaseconcentration from 30 to 480 nm. This increase inkcat not only reflects the oligomerization of gp61, butalso indicates that the oligomeric form of the primase is the major functionalform. Priming at Constant [WT Primase] and Increasing [E234Q Primase]Levels—Mutant enzymes have been used in a number of cases to detectpossible protein oligomerization involving transient protein/proteininteractions (25Levin M.K.

Sequence analysis suggests that residueGlu-234 of gp61 aligns with residue Glu-265 of the E. coli primase,which is involved in metal ion binding that is crucial for catalysis(30Keck J.L. Roche D.D. Lynch A.S. Berger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 2482-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This mutant enzyme hasbeen shown previously to lose the nucleotidyl transfer activity but retainnormal binding activity toward DNA(16Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Yang J. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49839-49849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both E234Qgp61 and WT gp61 have similar effects on the ATPase and unwinding activity ofgp41 helicase (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between gp41and the mutant gp61 is not altered significantly. Priming reactions were carried out as described under “Materials andMethods” to measure the inhibitory effect of gp61(E234Q) on the primingactivity of WT gp61 (200 nm). A large excess of oligo A (2μm) was present in all experiments to exclude the possibilitythat the mutant primase may inhibit the WT gp61 activity by competing for alimited number of priming sites. For the same reason, the gp41 helicase (3.4μm), when present, was also in large excess over the primases.The amount of E234Q primase was chosen so as not to affect the limitingprimase condition.

https://openalex.org/W1971510012,"The Notch receptor is a key component of a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates cell fate determination during development. In Drosophila, where Notch signaling was first identified and studied, there is only one Notch receptor. In contrast, mammals have four Notch receptor genes, Notch1-4. Notch1 and Notch2 are both required for embryo viability, are widely expressed in mammals, and are structurally conserved. It is presently unknown if these two receptors are functionally redundant or if they have unique capabilities related to differences in their amino acid sequences. In contrast to the rest of the molecule, the amino acid sequences of a large region of the Notch intracellular domain are not highly conserved and thus may be able to interact with distinct transcription factors and mediate the expression of different sets of genes. To determine if the function of this region is conserved, the last 426 amino acids of the Notch2 receptor have been replaced with the corresponding region of Notch1 in mice by using gene targeting. We have determined that even though the amino acid sequences of this region are only 37% identical (137/426), the C-terminal region of the Notch1 intracellular domain can functionally replace that of Notch2 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1983135138,"Rate-limiting processes of catalysis by eukaryotic molybdenum-containing nitrate reductase (NaR, EC 1.7.1.1–3) were investigated using two viscosogens (glycerol and sucrose) and observing their impact on NAD(P)H:NaR activity of corn leaf NaR and recombinant Arabidopsis and yeast NaR. Holo-NaR has two “hinge” sequences between stably folded regions housing its internal electron carriers: 1) Hinge 1 between the molybdenum-containing nitrate reducing module and cytochrome b domain containing heme and 2) Hinge 2 between cytochrome b and cytochrome b reductase (CbR) module containing FAD. Solution viscosity negatively impacted the activity of these holo-NaR forms, which suggests that the rate-limiting events in catalysis were likely to involve large conformational changes that restrict or “gate” internal electron-proton transfers (IET). Little effect of viscosity was observed on recombinant CbR module and methyl viologen nitrate reduction by holo-NaR, suggesting that these activities involved no large conformational changes. To determine whether Hinge 2 is involved in gating the first step in IET, the effects of viscosogen on cytochrome c and ferricyanide reductase activities of holo-NaR and ferricyanide reductase activity of the recombinant molybdenum reductase module (CbR, Hinge 2, and cytochrome b) were analyzed. Solution viscosity negatively impacted these partial activities, as if Hinge 2 were involved in gating IET in both enzyme forms. We concluded that both Hinges 1 and 2 appear to be involved in gating IET steps by restricting the movement of the cytochrome b domain relative to the larger nitrate-reducing and electron-donating modules of NaR. Rate-limiting processes of catalysis by eukaryotic molybdenum-containing nitrate reductase (NaR, EC 1.7.1.1–3) were investigated using two viscosogens (glycerol and sucrose) and observing their impact on NAD(P)H:NaR activity of corn leaf NaR and recombinant Arabidopsis and yeast NaR.

We concluded that both Hinges 1 and 2 appear to be involved in gating IET steps by restricting the movement of the cytochrome b domain relative to the larger nitrate-reducing and electron-donating modules of NaR.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 2Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mixing crude extracts of different homozygous Nicotiana nia mutants with no NaR activity restored enzyme activity, making the case for intragenic complementation and modular structure of the enzyme (3Mendel R.R. Muller A.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 177: 145-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Pelsy F. Gonneau M. Genetics. 1991; 127: 199-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, detailed biochemical analysis demonstrated that NaR indeed has a modular structure with independently folded regions of the large polypeptide (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Nitrate to nitrite reduction is catalyzed by NaR with NAD(P)H as the reductant and is accompanied by a very large free energy release. During catalysis, electrons and protons are transferred from NAD(P)H to nitrate via electroactive redox cofactors, which act like an internal electron/proton transfer (IET) system (Fig. 1). NaR is a member of the sulfite oxidase (SOX) structure family of Mo-MPT-containing enzymes with which it shares high sequence similarity for the Mo-containing module (5Hille R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 804-809Crossref Google Scholar). The Cyt b reductase fragment (CbR) of NaR for which the structure has been determined (6Lu G. Campbell W.H. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1994; 2: 809-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Lu G. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Diwedi U.N. Campbell W.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 931-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) is related to the ferredoxin NADP+ reductase structural family (8Correl C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Cyt b of NaR is related to mammalian Cyt b5 and SOX Cyt b with which it shares a high sequence homology (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 9Kisker C. Shindelin H. Pacheco A. Webhi W.A. Garret R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Flexible hinge regions of NaR join the major functional modules: 1) Hinge 1 between the Mo-containing/nitrate-reducing module and the Cyt b domain and 2) Hinge 2 between the Cyt b domain and the electron-donating CbR module (Fig. 1). Hinge 1 contains the regulatory Ser phosphorylation and 14-3-3-binding sites in plant NaR (10MacKintosh C. Meek S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This important functionality clearly played a role in the evolution of this region of plant NaR but not in fungal and yeast NaR forms that lack the key Ser and 14-3-3-binding residues. Hinge 2 has no defined physiological or regulatory role (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). However, NaR loses activity if the hinges are cleaved by proteases and depends on the integrity of these regions for full functionality. In previous kinetic studies of NaR, each subunit was shown to operate independently in catalysis with a kcat of ∼200 s–1 for reaction of NADH with nitrate (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 2Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lu G.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). NADH transfers two electrons and a proton to FAD with a rate constant ranging from 250 to 400 s–1 (11Skipper L. Campbell W.H. Mertens J.A. Lowe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26995-27002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reduced FAD transfers electrons one by one to the Cyt b domain and a proton to solution. The average rate constant of these reactions is 300 s–1. Cyt b transfers one electron at a time to convert the MoVI of the Mo-MPT cofactor in two 1-electron steps to MoIV with an average rate constant of 260 s–1. A proton is also transferred to an oxy-ligand of the Mo in this process, and it is probably donated by a side chain of a nearby residue but ultimately comes from solution. When the Mo center is fully reduced and nitrate is bound in the active site, two electrons are transferred to reduce nitrate to nitrite and hydroxide. The rate constant of nitrate reduction to nitrite by the Mo-MPT cofactor is ∼400 s–1 (11Skipper L. Campbell W.H. Mertens J.A. Lowe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26995-27002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, according to this study, Cyt b might be involved in rate-limiting events of catalysis but no individual step in catalysis was greatly slower than the others (11Skipper L. Campbell W.H. Mertens J.A. Lowe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26995-27002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NAD(P)H-dependent ferricyanide reduction is catalyzed by NaR with a kcat of ∼1000 s–1 and reduced methyl viologen (MV) nitrate reduction is catalyzed by NaR with a kcat ∼800 s–1 (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 11Skipper L. Campbell W.H. Mertens J.A. Lowe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26995-27002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, IET is likely the rate-limiting event in NaR catalysis but no study has been able to directly demonstrate this possibility. Recent studies of mammalian SOX kinetics showed that the IET rate was impacted by solution viscosity (13Pacheco A. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Feng C. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5816-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), confirming the hypothesis that the Cyt b domain was undergoing a large conformational change during catalysis relative to the Mo-MPT-containing sulfite-oxidizing module (9Kisker C. Shindelin H. Pacheco A. Webhi W.A. Garret R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). NaR has a similar structure to SOX in that the Cyt b domain is tethered to the Mo-MPT-containing nitrate-reducing module via a flexible “hinge” sequence. However, NaR is more complex than SOX because the Cyt b domain is also tethered to the FAD-containing CbR. Thus, by analogy, if IET is the rate-limiting event in NaR catalysis and involves large conformational movement of Cyt b domain relative to the other larger modules of the enzyme to which it is tethered via Hinges 1 and 2 (Fig. 1), solution viscosity may have a significant impact on NaR-catalytic rates and help to demonstrate the rate-limiting nature of IET in NaR catalysis. Monomeric polyhydroxylated molecules such as glycerol and sucrose, also called microviscosogens (15Sampson N.S. Knowles J.R.

The kcat observed in the viscosity studies was shown to follow a linear dependence on the negative power of the viscosity and was described by Kramers equation (Equation 1) (14Feng C. Kedia R.V.

To further investigate the predicted rate-limiting processes in NaR catalysis, we have studied the effects of two viscosogens (glycerol and sucrose) on NAD(P)H:NaR activity of three forms of holoenzyme (recombinant yeast NaR, recombinant Arabidopsis NaR2, and natural corn leaf NaR) and NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity of the holo-NaR forms and the recombinant NaR fragments known as CbR and molybdenum reductase (MoR) (Fig. 1). We also assayed the MV:NaR activity of one form of holo-NaR. We observed a slight impact of the viscosity on the NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity of CbR and MV:NaR activity of the holoenzyme, confirming that during catalysis no large conformational change occurred in the FAD- and Mo-containing fragments. A large negative impact of viscosity was observed in the other assays performed, leading to the conclusion that a large conformational change involving the gating of Cyt b is most likely to be the limiting step in catalysis by NaR. Enzymes and NaR Fragments—Zea mays NaR (ZmNaR) and Arabidopsis thaliana NaR (AtNR2) were prepared as described previously (11Skipper L. Campbell W.H. Mertens J.A. Lowe D.J. J. Biol.

Viscosity of Assay Buffers—Viscosogen buffers were prepared as weight percent solutions of 0 (buffer only), 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and of MoBio grade glycerol and sucrose. The viscosity (η) of buffer and each viscosogen solution was determined with glass viscometers at 22 °C compared with deionized water, which was shown to have virtually the same viscosity as the buffer with no added viscosogen. Each viscosity was determined five times, and the results were averaged. The viscosities of the 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% glycerol solutions were, respectively, 1.046, 1.329, 1.672, 2.265, 3.283, and 5.544 centiPoise. The viscosities of the 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% sucrose solutions were, respectively, 1.058, 1.373, 1.879, 2.847, 5.396, and 13.268 centiPoise. The impact of substrates and enzymes were ignored, because these have only a very small effect on viscosity. The viscosity of the assay buffers for the nitrate reductase assays of holo-NaR was slightly different from that shown above. Properties of Enzyme Forms—Characteristics of the holo-NaR forms and recombinant NaR fragments studied are summarized in Table I. Although CbR has two domains, one for binding NADH and one for binding FAD, the linker joining them is tightly associated with the NADH domain and is not considered a flexible hinge (1Campbell W.H.

CbR and MoR are monomeric enzyme fragments. Holo-NaR is a homodimer, and its monomeric unit is most complex with five domains and two flexible hinge regions (Fig. 1 and Table I). The Mo-MPT and dimer interface domains of the nitrate-reducing module have recently been shown (29Fischer K. Barbier G.G. Hecht H.J. Mendel R.R. Campbell W.H. Schwarz G. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to be closely associated as in mammalian and plant SOX (9Kisker C. Shindelin H. Pacheco A. Webhi W.A. Garret R.M.

The kcat values were calculated based on the Mo-MPT content when available or normalized to known values (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

No Km determinations were done, because it has been shown that this parameter was independent of the viscosity for some enzymes (14Feng C. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5816-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Blacklow S.C. Raines R.T. Lim A.W. Zamores P.D. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 27: 1158-1167Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and it was assumed that all of the forms would be impacted to the same degree. Effect of Viscosity on Nitrate Reductase Activity—When MV: NaR activity of YNaR1 was assayed at 0 and 50% glycerol, ∼93% activity was retained in presence of viscosogen. For comparison, only ∼32% NADPH:NaR activity of YNaR1 was retained in 50% glycerol. Thus, it appeared that the nitrate-reducing step in NaR catalysis, represented by MV:NaR activity, was not greatly impacted by increased solution viscosity. In contrast, when nitrate reduction involved IET, represented by NADPH:NaR activity, solution viscosity had a major impact. NAD(P)H:NaR activity of ZmNaR1, AtNR2, and YNaR1 were all strongly negatively impacted by increases in solution viscosity (Fig. 2 and Table II). Glycerol and sucrose had approximately the same effect. The loss of activity due to increased solution viscosity is approximately the same for all of the NaR forms despite significant differences in overall size of the subunit (Table I) and length of the hinge regions (Table II).Table IIImpact of solution viscosity on NAD(P)H:NaR activity of eukaryotic NaR formsEnzyme form and substrateaAll of the enzyme forms were assayed with NADH, except as noted.Hinge 1 lengthHinge 2 lengthNAD(P)H:NaR activitySlope from Fig. 3GlycerolSucroseResidueskcat in s-1 for 2 e-log s-1/log cPZmNaR12033200-0.83-0.72AtNR21938210-0.69-0.74YNaR1 (NADH)3619140-0.72-0.83YNaR1 (NADPH)3619215-0.72-0.81a All of the enzyme forms were assayed with NADH, except as noted. Open table in a new tab For holo-NaR with two flexible hinge regions (Fig. 1 and Table I), the interpretation of the results is clearly more difficult than for enzymes with a single flexible hinge region such as mammalian SOX and yeast flavocytochrome b2 (13Pacheco A.

However, it is clear that IET in NaR is gated by large conformational changes of the Cyt b domain relative to the electron-donating and nitrate-reducing modules of the enzyme, which is illustrated in Scheme 1, where the gating effects of the two hinges are grouped together. Several approaches could be taken to evaluate the relative effects of Hinge 1 versus Hinge 2. As is described below, we have taken advantage of the collection of recombinant NaR fragments already available to characterize Hinge 2 effects in relation to viscosity. Laser flash photolysis has been used to directly study IET in mammalian SOX where the Cyt b heme-Fe was rapidly reduced and the effect of viscosity on the equilibration of the electron with the Mo-MPT center was observed (14Feng C. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5816-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although laser flash photolysis would be useful to show a direct effect of viscosity on NaR IET, there would be complexity to the results because NaR has more redox centers than SOX. Thus, recombinant fragments of NaR with two redox centers such as MoR (12Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the recently constructed S-NaR2, which is the N-terminal fragment of YNaR1 including the Cyt b domain, Hinge 1, and S-NaR1 2G. G. Barbier and W. H. Campbell, unpublished results. will be useful in these future studies. Effect of Viscosity on Reductase Activities of NaR—The reductase portion of NaR comprised of CbR, Hinge 2, and Cyt b domain, which we call MoR (Table I), catalyzes NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of mammalian Cyt c, ferricyanide, and a number of other electron acceptors (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 12Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cyt c reductase activity of YNaR1 assayed in 50% glycerol was inhibited by 79%, whereas ferricyanide reductase activity was inhibited by 74%. Because both activities were impacted to a significant extent by increased solution viscosity, we used the ferricyanide reductase activity in the current study. Corn NaR (ZmNaR1) and its fragments (ZmCbR and ZmMoR) were used as models to study the impact of solution viscosity on ferricyanide reductase activity. Solution viscosity had little impact on ferricyanide reductase activity of ZmCbR, which had a very low slope close to 0 up to 30% solutions (Fig. 3 and Table III). The results (Fig. 3 and Table III) showed that there was a substantial impact of solution viscosity on the ferricyanide reductase activity of ZmNaR1 and ZmMoR and that, basically, sucrose and glycerol acted the same. Similar results were found for all of the NaR forms studied that contain Hinge 2 (Table III). Hinge 2 joins the CbR fragment to the Cyt b domain in all of these NaR forms with the exception of CbR, which has no hinge (Fig. 1 and Table I). Because the ferricyanide reductase activity of ZmCbR, which lacks the heme-Fe Cyt b domain (Table I), was only slightly impacted by solution viscosity (Table III and Fig. 3), ferricyanide reductase activity involves the heme-Fe when it is present in holo-NaR and MoR. Thus, NAD(P)H reduction of ferricyanide catalyzed by the whole enzyme and its larger reductase fragment appears to involve gating of IET, as indicated by the large impact solution viscosity on the activity. Therefore, the effect observed on ZmCbR probably represents the effect of viscosity on diffusion of substrates since this reaction was known to be near the diffusion limit (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 12Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the diffusion effect of viscogens on the substrates was negligible.Table IIIImpact of Solution Viscosity on Ferricyanide Reductase ActivityEnzyme form and substrateaAll of the enzyme forms were assayed with NADH, except as noted.Hinge 2 lengthNAD(P)H:ferricyanide reductase activitySlope from Fig. 3GlycerolSucroseResidueskcat in s-1 for 2 e-log s-1/log cPZmCbR01349-0.08-0.09ZmMoR331176-0.22-0.25ZmNaR133897-0.32-0.42SoMoR391350-0.48-0.52AtNR238835-0.53-0.49YNaR1 (NADH)19322-1.10-1.03YNaR1 (NADPH)19618-0.83-1.27a All of the enzyme forms were assayed with NADH, except as noted. Open table in a new tab Because the negative impact of solution viscosity on the kcat and therefore the IET process is large, it can be suggested to involve large conformational change of the position of the Cyt b domain relative to the FAD domain of CbR during IET. Furthermore, it is clear from the impact of solution viscosity on ferricyanide reductase activity that IET is the rate-limiting process in this very rapid catalytic activity of NaR. These results are similar to those found for other redox enzymes with IET from or to a Cyt b domain, such as flavocytochrome b2 and SOX (13Pacheco A. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Feng C. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5816-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Sharp R. White P. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5115-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the movement of Cyt b domain relative to CbR is gating the electron and proton transfer processes in MoR and holo-NaR (Scheme 2). In this simplified kinetic model for the reductase activity of NaR, “Hinge 2 gating” represents the state of the enzyme where Cyt b has moved from its resting position and optimized its position for one electron reduction by reduced flavin in the FAD domain. This step must occur twice to fully oxidize NAD(P)H. Because the actual transfer of the electron is extremely rapid (5Hille R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 804-809Crossref Google Scholar), the time required for the conformational change is the slow step in catalysis of ferricyanide reduction by MoR and holo-NaR. Ferricyanide reductase activity of ZmNaR1 was lower, and solution viscosity had a greater negative impact on it than ZmMoR. Similar results were found when comparing SoMoR and AtNR2 (Fig. 3 and Table III). Concentrating on corn NaR forms to avoid species differences, the greater structural complexity of holo-NaR must account for the slower conformational change of Cyt b in holo-NaR compared with MoR. MoR is a monomer and clearly less encumbered than the homodimeric holo-NaR with the nitrate-reducing module attached to Cyt b via Hinge 1 (Fig. 1 and Table I). Thus, it is expected that greater drag of the extra mass (Hinge 1 plus the nitrate-reducing module) will retard the movement of Cyt b relative to the FAD domain of CbR and account for both the lower kcat and greater viscosity effect on holo-NaR. There probably is also an effect of the second subunit of holo-NaR, but it is more difficult to discern its impact and we have generally treated NaR subunits as independent to simplify analysis (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 11Skipper L. Campbell W.H. Mertens J.A. Lowe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26995-27002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a contradictory result was observed when matching the ferricyanide reductase activity of YNaR1 with the NaR activity. The ferricyanide reductase activity appeared to be more impacted by the viscosity than the NaR activity (Tables II and III). This means that the drag forces applied on Cyt b during IET were greater in the case of ferricyanide reductase activity. This observation is probably due to the shorter length of Hinge 2 in YNaR1, which might make IET from reduced flavin to Cyt b more efficient when electrons are transferred to Mo center than to an artificial electron acceptor in solution-like ferricyanide. However, more detailed kinetic studies, especially with transient time analysis of early events in catalysis, are needed to completely understand the differences among the eukaryotic families of NaR. Evaluation of Hinge Length and Sequence in Relation to Viscosity Effects—For flavocytochrome b2, it was shown that the heme domain was involved in a large conformational change occurring during catalysis, and when the hinge linking the two distinct domains of flavocytochrome b2 was shortened, a 5-fold decrease of heme reduction rate was observed (31Sharp R. White P. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5115-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hinges 1 and 2 have natural differences among the NaRs we studied, and because varying hinge length by design has not yet been done, we made an initial analysis of the impact of hinge length on the effect of viscosity on NaR activities. Fungal and yeast NaR forms have the longest Hinge 1 and shortest Hinge 2 sequences of all of the NaR sequences in GenBank™. Plant NaR forms have significantly longer Hinge 2 sequences with those from dicots (AtNR2 and SoMoR) longer than those from monocots (ZmNaR1) (Tables II and Table III). In Fig. 4A, the four NaR forms studied here were compared for Hinge 2 sequence with its extent defined by the secondary structure of the bounding domains (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 6Lu G. Campbell W.H. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1994; 2: 809-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Lu G. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Diwedi U.N. Campbell W.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 931-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In plant NaR forms, Hinge 2 sequences appear to have conserved residues, which suggests that secondary and/or tertiary structure may play a role in optimizing the longer Hinge 2 as compared with yeast and fungal NaR forms where few conserved residues were found. NAD(P)H:ferricyanide reductase activities of holo-NaR show that a longer Hinge 2, similarly found in plant NaR, seems to be more optimal for IET between the FAD domain of CbR and the Cyt b domain. For YNaR1 with the shortest Hinge 2, the kcat for ferricyanide reductase activity is lower and the negative impact slope for viscosity shown in Table III is greater than either the monocot or dicot plant NaR forms. Thus, a trend for NaR similar to that found for flavocytochrome b2 was observed, which leads to the hypothesis that shortening the length of Hinge 2 involved in gating the first step of IET might result in lower activity. In contrast, Hinge 1 of yeast and fungal NaR forms is longer than the corresponding region in plant NaR forms (Table II and Fig. 4B). The important regulatory Ser residue and 14-3-3-binding site in Hinge 1 of plant NaR forms (10MacKintosh C. Meek S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is clearly a highly conserved feature of most plant NaR forms and absent from yeast and fungal NaR forms (Fig. 4B). NAD(P)H:NaR activities of holo-NaR show that plant and yeast NaR forms have approximately the same kcat, and solution viscosity has approximately the same negative impact on NaR activity (Fig. 2 and Table II). Thus, in evolving with the different driving forces impacting Hinge 1, all of the NaR forms have arrived in the present with similar high efficiency for catalyzing nitrate reduction. NaR activity is obviously not dependent only on Hinge 1 features and so the overall catalytic efficiency of the enzyme probably reflects optimization of both hinges over evolutionary time. More experimental study such as substitution of Hinge 2 from YNaR1 for Hinge 2 in a plant NaR form would be needed to delve more deeply into the relative importance of Hinge 1 versus Hinge 2 in determining NaR activity. NaR catalyzes several partial activities in addition to the complete NAD(P)H:NaR activity, which is clearly linked to the internal electron transport chain of the enzyme (Fig. 1). Employing the partial activities as “probes” permitted us to isolate the impact of solution viscosity on catalytic activities that involved IET. First, it was shown that MV:NaR activity was only slightly effected by solution viscosity, implying that no large conformational changes occurred during the catalysis of nitrate reduction by the Mo-MPT. NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity of CbR showed a similar result, leading to the conclusion that no large conformational change occurred when the flavin of the enzyme was reduced and transferred electrons directly to an acceptor in solution. Neither of these catalytic reactions involves IET, and the absence of a viscosity effect is consistent with the concept established in studies of the impact of viscosity on IET in SOX (13Pacheco A. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Feng C. Kedia R.V. Hazzard J.T. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5816-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NaR, similar to SOX, utilizes IET in catalysis of the NAD(P)H:NaR reaction and partial reactions such as Cyt c reduction. For both of these reactions, solution viscosity had a major negative impact on activity. Because Cyt c reduction and apparently ferricyanide reduction (Table III and Fig. 3) involve only the first IET step, it can be suggested that this electron transfer involves large conformation changes that limit the reaction as illustrated in Scheme 2. NAD(P)H: NaR activities require both IET steps in catalysis, and the large impact of solution viscosity (Table II and Fig. 2) was taken to mean that large conformational changes of the Cyt b domain of NaR were involved in IET. Applying the mass center rule to the three functional modules of holo-NaR, only Cyt b is predicted to move because it is much smaller than the two other modules (nitrate-reducing module at the N terminus with ∼500 residues and CbR module at the C terminus with ∼270 residues). Consequently, the NaR kcat is proportional to the reciprocal of solution viscosity due to the drag force of the solution retarding the movement of Cyt b relative to its C-terminal electron-donating module (CbR) and the N-terminal nitrate-reducing module. The magnitude of the Cyt b motion must increase the drag force in the NaR activities, because Cyt b has to go from FAD to Mo-MPT to transfer an electron, increasing the viscosity impact. More detailed studies will be required to determine the relative impact of Hinge 1 versus Hinge 2 on IET steps in NaR catalysis. However, it is clear that IET in NaR requires large conformational changes that can be studied using solution viscosity as a tool."

Nature. 1985; 316: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Since then, its characteristic 300-amino-acid sequence has been identified in over 60 mammalian proteins, making this one of the largest families of oncoproteins (6Schmidt A. Hall A.

This 300-amino-acid stretch is subdivided into a Dbl homology (DH) domain followed invariably by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Beyond the DHPH domains, Dbl family members share little sequence similarity with each other (6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 7Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The DH domain consists of ∼200 amino acids and is the catalytic domain (10Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Within the DH domain are three highly conserved regions referred to as conserved regions 1, 2, and 3 (CR1, CR2, and CR3) (7Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The structure of several Dbl family members shows that the DH domain consists of an elongated helical bundle, with the CR1, CR2, and CR3 forming long helices that pack together to form the core of the module (11Aghazadeh B.

PH domains are lipid-binding domains that are found in a wide variety of signaling molecules (14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Abrams C.S.

The invariant association of the PH domain with the DH domain in all Dbl family members suggests a functional interdependence between these modules. These PH domains have been shown to mediate membrane association and to modulate the activity of the DH domain (17Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol.

GEFs like Tiam1 and Trio catalyze exchange only on Rac1 (22Mertens A.E. Roovers R.C. Collard J.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Dbs and Dbl are able to activate both Cdc42 and RhoA (23Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vav1 and Vav2 catalyze exchange on RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (24Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). The structural basis for this recognition process is only beginning to be understood (25Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the Rac1-Tiam1, Cdc42-Dbs, Dbs-RhoA, and Cdc42-Intersectin complexes show that the CR1 and CR3 regions of the DH domain of the GEF make extensive contact with the β2β3 strands of the GTPases (25Snyder J.T.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These regions were therefore predicted to determine the specificity of these interactions. Based on these crystal structure complexes, Trp56 of Rac1 was identified as one of the critical residues for recognition by Rac-specific GEFs (27Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to Phe, the corresponding residue in Cdc42, was sufficient to abolish binding by Tiam1. Moreover, this mutant Rac1 could now be recognized by Intersectin, a Cdc42-specific GEF. Although this region clearly determines the specificity of some of these interactions, it cannot explain the specificity of all GEF-GTPase interactions (25Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, the contribution of the PH domain in these interactions has remained unexplored. P-Rex1 was isolated from neutrophils based on its activity as a Rac-specific GEF (29Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Its activity was conditional on the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate or Gβγ subunits. P-Rex1 plays a crucial role in stimulating the neutrophil-oxidative burst (29Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Our biochemical characterization of P-Rex2, a homologue of P-Rex1, shows that it also is a Rac-specific GEF. 2R. E. Joseph and F. A. Norris, manuscript submitted for publication. 2R. E. Joseph and F. A. Norris, manuscript submitted for publication. In this report, P-Rex2 is shown to recognize Rac1 in an unusual way. The specificity of this interaction is conferred by the PH domain of P-Rex2 and not by the DH domain. Specificity of substrate interaction has never before been attributed to the PH domain of a Dbl family GEF. This report demonstrates that, within the PH domain, the β3β4 loop is necessary and sufficient to confer this specificity. In addition, the PH domain of P-Rex2 appears to make contact with the switch loop and helix 3 of Rac1. However, although helix 3 of Rac1 is sufficient to confer binding to a chimeric GTPase, the helix by itself is not sufficient to allow P-Rex2 to catalyze nucleotide exchange. This suggests that substrate recognition and catalysis by the P-Rex2 GEF have distinct requirements. Materials—The wild-type bacterial expression construct for RhoA was created by PCR amplification and cloned into the SmaI/NotI sites of pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterial expression constructs for Rac1 and Cdc42 were kind gifts from Prof. Gary Bokoch (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The DHPH domains of Dbl and the PH domain of Dbs were PCR-amplified from the human mammary cDNA library (Clontech) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1D V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The DH domain (residues 22–231), the PH domain (residues 241–370), and the DHPH domains of P-Rex2 (residues 22–370) were cloned into pcDNA3.1D V5-His-TOPO vector by PCR. The β3β4 loop deletion (amino acid residues 277–296), mutant of the PH domain of P-Rex2, and the Rac1W56F mutant were created using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Dbs/P-Rex2 β3β4 loop chimeric PH domain was created by PCR as follows. The 5′ end of the chimera was created by PCR using oligos 5′-CACCATGCTGCTGATGCAGGGCTCATTCAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATCTGTAGATGCCTTGCTGTTCTTCAACCGTCTGTGTTTTCTCTCCCTCTTCTTGCAGAAGAG-3′ (antisense). The 3′ end of the chimeric gene was amplified using oligos 5′-GAACAGCAAGGCATCTACAGATGGACATCGGTACCTTTTTTCCTACAGCTACAAGCAGTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGCTCTGTGACTGCTCCAG-3′ (antisense). The 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene obtained by PCR were purified and were merged together by PCR using oligos 5′-CACCATGCTGCTGATGCAGGGCTCATTCAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGCTCTGTGACTGCTCCAGCGC-3′ (antisense). The full-length PCR product was subsequently purified and cloned into the pcDNA3.1D V5-His-TOPO vector by TOPO cloning. The bacterial expression construct for the Cdc42Rac1helix3 chimera was created by PCR as follows. The 5′ end of the chimera was created by PCR using oligos 5′-GATCTGGTTCCGCGTGGATCCAAAATTATTTCAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCACTTTTCTTTCACGTTTTCAAATGAAGATGGACTCACAAGGG-3′ (antisense). The 3′ end of the chimera was created by PCR using oligos 5′-GTGAAAGAAAAGTGGGTGCCTGAGATAACTCACCACTGTCCCAAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAGTCAGTCACGATGAATTCATCTGTCGACTG-3′ (antisense). The 5′ and 3′ end PCR products were purified, mixed together, and the full-length chimera was created by PCR using oligos 5′-GATCTGGTTCCGCGTGGATCCAAAATTATTTCAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAGTCAGTCACGATGAATTCATCTGTCGACTG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and was ligated into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) cut with the same enzymes. Purification of Proteins—GST and GST-tagged Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (30Rossman K.L. Campbell S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex Formation Assay—The complex formation assay was performed essentially as described previously (31Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The DHPH domains of P-Rex2, Dbl, or Dbs were labeled with [35S]Met using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription translation system (Promega) for 90 min at 30 °C in a total reaction volume of 10 μl, according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μl of this reaction was then incubated with 5 μg of purified GST, GST-Rac1, GST-RhoA, or GST-Cdc42 in 500 μl of complex formation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed five times with the same buffer. The beads were then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by autoradiography. All experiments were repeated at least three times to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments. The data shown are representative of each of these data sets. Rac1 was loaded with GDP or GTPγS, as described earlier (31Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12.5 μm purified GST-Rac1 was incubated with 20 μm GDP or GTPγS in loading buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm EDTA) at 23 °C for 25 min. The complexes were stabilized using 20 mm MgCl2. 5 μg of the loaded protein was then used for the complex formation assay in a modified complex formation assay buffer with 20 mm MgCl2 instead of 2.0 mm EDTA. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assay—The in vitro GEF assay was performed on a Mithras LB 940 (Berthold Technologies) fluorescence spectrophotometer by modifying a basic protocol described elsewhere (32Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 2 μm purified GST-tagged Rho family G protein was incubated with 100 nm purified GST-tagged P-Rex2 and 400 nmN-methylanthranioyl-GDP (Molecular Probes) in 50 μl of exchange buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 355 nm and 460 nm, respectively. The Rac1W56F Mutation Does Not Affect P-Rex2 Binding— Comparison of the crystal structure complexes of Tiam1 and Rac1 with other Rho GTPase-GEF complexes has identified the Trp56 residue of Rac1 as a key determinant of specificity for Rac-specific GEFs (27Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This residue of Rac1 was shown to interact with a conserved Ile in the DH domain of Rac-specific GEFs. However, sequence alignment of the DH domain of P-Rex2 with that of other GEFs shows that this conserved Ile is not present in the DH domain of P-Rex2 or P-Rex1 (Fig. 1A). Because mutation of the Trp56 residue of Rac1 to Phe is sufficient to abolish binding by the DHPH domain of the Rac1-specific GEF Tiam1, we decided to test whether this mutation had any effect on the binding ability of P-Rex2 (27Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The DHPH of P-Rex2 was expressed and labeled with [35S]Met using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and tested for its ability to bind a GST-Rac1W56F mutant in a pull-down assay. Unexpectedly, the Rac1W56F mutation did not decrease the binding of Rac1 to the DHPH domain of P-Rex2 (Fig. 1B). This suggested that the mode of interaction of P-Rex2 with Rac1 was different from that of other Rac-specific GEFs. Substrate Recognition Occurs via the PH Domain of P-Rex2— Substrate recognition by the Dbl family of GEFs has been thought to be mediated exclusively by the DH domain (25Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The above result indicates that P-Rex2 might be an exception. To determine the domain of P-Rex2 that recognizes its Rac1 substrate, the DH, PH, and DHPH domains of P-Rex2 were expressed and labeled with [35S]Met using a reticulocyte lysate and tested for their ability to interact with GST-Rac1 in a pull-down assay. The DHPH domain of Dbl, which interacts with Rac1 as well as RhoA and Cdc42, was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 2A, surprisingly, the PH domain alone of P-Rex2 was able to interact with Rac1, whereas the DH domain alone of P-Rex2 was unable to do so. Moreover, The PH domain of P-Rex2 was able to discriminate between Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 and bind specifically to Rac1. Increasing amounts of GST-tagged Rac1 were able to associate with increasing amounts of the PH domain, indicating that the levels of GTPase being used in the pull-downs were not saturating (Fig. 2B). This is the first demonstration of the ability of a PH domain of a Dbl family GEF to recognize its G protein substrate. The β3β4 Loop Region of the PH Domain of P-Rex2 Is Required for Rac1 Interaction—The crystal structure of the Dbl family GEF Dbs in complex with its substrate Cdc42 shows that, in addition to interaction of the DH domain with Cdc42, the PH domain of Dbs has an extended β3β4 loop, which makes contact with the switch loop 2 and helix 3b of Cdc42 (28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Alignment of the PH domain of P-Rex2 with other PH domains shows that the P-Rex2 PH domain also has an extended β3β4 loop (Fig. 3A). To determine whether this loop of P-Rex2 makes contact with Rac1, a β3β4 loop deletion mutant of P-Rex2 PH domain was tested for its ability to bind Rac1. As shown in Fig. 3B, the β3β4 loop deletion caused a >80% reduction in the ability of the P-Rex2 PH domain to bind Rac1. This suggests that the β3β4 loop of the PH domain of P-Rex2 is required for the interaction with Rac1. The β3β4 Loop Region of the PH Domain of P-Rex2 Is the Determinant of Rac Interaction—Although deletion of the β3β4 loop of the PH domain of P-Rex2 caused a dramatic decrease in Rac1 binding, it was possible that this mutation affected the overall structure of the PH domain. The Dbl family GEF Dbs catalyzes exchange specifically on RhoA and Cdc42 and not on Rac1. Binding studies with the PH domain alone of Dbs showed that it did not interact with RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 (Fig. 4). To determine whether the β3β4 loop of the PH domain of P-Rex2 would be sufficient to confer Rac1 recognition, we created a chimeric PH domain in which the β3β4 loop region of the Dbs PH domain was replaced with that of P-Rex2. As shown in Fig. 4, this chimeric PH domain acquired the ability to specifically interact with Rac1 and not RhoA and Cdc42. This demonstrated that the β3β4 loop of the PH domain of P-Rex2 is sufficient to produce Rac1 interaction. Nucleotide Binding of Rac Influences Interaction with the PH Domain of P-Rex2—The crystal structure of Dbs in complex with Cdc42 shows that, in addition to contacts between the DH domain and Cdc42, the PH domain makes contact with the GTP-sensitive switch loop2 of Cdc42 (28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To test whether the PH domain of P-Rex2 can also sense the nucleotide status of Rac1, purified GST-tagged Rac1 was loaded with GDP or GTPγS and tested along with nucleotide-free Rac1 for the ability to bind to the PH domain. As shown in Fig. 5, the nucleotide-bound forms of Rac1 showed a dramatic reduction in the ability to bind the PH domain. This suggests that the PH domain of P-Rex2 makes nucleotide-sensitive contacts with Rac1, possibly in the switch 2 loop region, by analogy to what was seen in the Dbs/Cdc42 crystal structure contacts. Helix 3 of Rac Is the Region That Determines the Rac1 Specificity of Binding of the PH Domain of P-Rex2—The crystal structure of Cdc42 with Dbs shows that the Dbs PH domain also makes contact with helix 3b of Cdc42 (28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This region is adjacent to the switch loop 2 of Cdc42. Importantly, the primary sequence of helix 3 differs between Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 6A). To determine whether this helix in Rac1 plays a role in the Rac-specific interactions with the PH domain of P-Rex2, helix 3 of Cdc42 was replaced with that of Rac1, and this chimeric Cdc42 was tested for its ability to interact with the P-Rex2 PH domain. As shown in Fig. 6B, the PH domain of P-Rex2 was now able to recognize the chimeric Cdc42 with helix 3 of Rac1. This demonstrated that the determinant for Rac1 recognition by the PH domain of P-Rex2 lies in helix 3. P-Rex2 Does Not Catalyze Exchange on Chimeric Cdc42 with Helix 3—The previous binding experiments demonstrated that the P-Rex2 PH domain by itself can interact with a chimeric Cdc42 with a helix 3 from Rac1. To determine whether binding is sufficient for catalysis, we tested the ability of P-Rex2 to catalyze exchange on this chimeric Cdc42 in an in vitro exchange assay. As shown in Fig. 7, P-Rex2 is unable to catalyze exchange on the chimeric Cdc42. This chimera did not differ from wild-type Cdc42 in its ability to load N-methylantranioyl-GDP (data not shown). This suggests that binding ability does not necessarily predict catalytic ability, as the two events seem to be distinct from each other. Activation of Dbl family GEFs in vivo lead to the activation of specific G protein signaling pathways (6Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). This specificity hinges on the ability of the GEFs to discriminate among the different G proteins present within the cell. Determination of the determinants of specificity of interaction between Dbl family GEFs and their cognate Rho GTPases is therefore necessary to understand signaling specificity. The crystal structures of Tiam1, Dbs, and Intersectin with Rac1, Cdc42/RhoA, or Cdc42, respectively, have provided a major breakthrough for identifying critical residues that determine the specificity of these interactions (25Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 27Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Attention has been focused on the catalytic DH domain in particular, as it was found to make major contact with the GTPase. Alignment of the primary sequence of the DH domain of Rac1-specific GEFs has isolated a conserved Ile residue that makes contact with Trp56 of Rac1. Discrimination between Cdc42 and Rac1 was thought to be mediated through this Trp residue, as the corresponding residue in Cdc42 is a Phe. However, the Rac1W56F mutation had no effect on the binding ability of the DHPH domain of P-Rex2. Furthermore, the DH domain alone was incapable of binding Rac1. Because the DH domain is the catalytic domain and P-Rex2 is a Rac1-specific GEF, this result suggests that the DH domain may have to undergo novel conformational rearrangements in order for it to catalyze exchange on Rac1. Although Dbl family GEFs are characterized by the presence of a DHPH domain, it is becoming increasingly clear that the PH domains of these GEFs are quite unlike PH domains found in other signaling proteins. In addition to the canonical membrane-targeting function of many PH domains, the PH domains of Dbl family GEFs have been shown to have several unique properties (28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of the DH domain of Trio is increased 100-fold by the presence of the PH domain (12Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A. Harlan J.E. Harris E.A. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Lipid binding by the PH domains of Vav, Sos, and Tiam1 have been shown to modulate the activity of the DH domain both in vitro and in vivo (33Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 34Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutations in the PH domain that affect lipid binding has a big impact on the activity of the GEF in vivo in a manner that cannot be explained solely by differences in localization of the protein (35Fuentes E.J. Karnoub A.E. Booden M.A. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21188-21196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The PH domain of Dbs makes contact with the switch loop 2 and helix 3b of Cdc42. Disruption of these interactions by the PH domain has a significant impact on the ability of Dbs to catalyze exchange on Cdc42 (28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The PH domain of Dbs was also recently shown to be an effector for Rac1, as it could bind to the GTP-bound form of Rac1 (36Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Kostenko E.V. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12786-12793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our own binding studies with the PH domain of P-Rex2 add new duties to the function of PH domains. The PH domain of P-Rex2 is responsible for substrate selectivity and recognition. This is the first instance where this function has been attributed to the PH domain of a Dbl family GEF. The β3β4 loop region of the PH domain of Dbs makes contact with Cdc42 in the Dbs-Cdc42 complex. Interestingly, the same loop of the PH domain of P-Rex2 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Rac1. Although the PH domain of Dbs does not independently bind to its cognate GTPases, additional experiments will be required to test the PH domains of other Dbl family GEFs. P-Rex2 could select for Rac1 via its PH domain. The PH domain recognizes Rac1 by interacting with the switch loop and helix 3. Substitution of helix 3 of Cdc42 with that of Rac1 enabled the PH domain to interact with this chimeric protein. Moreover, it is likely that the PH domain of P-Rex2 interacts with switch loop 2 of Rac1 rather than switch loop1 because of its proximity with helix 3b. Even though P-Rex2 could interact with the Cdc42 chimera, it was unable to catalyze exchange on it. This suggests that substrate recognition and catalysis are two distinct events. Although the PH domain may recognize the substrate, it is the contacts being made by the catalytic DH domain that determine enzymatic activity. Other Dbl family GEFs have been previously shown to interact with many GTPases; however, they could catalyze exchange on a limited subset of these GTPases. Dbl, for example, can bind to RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 but will catalyze exchange on only RhoA and Cdc42 (28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 37Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to delineate the contacts that are being made in these two distinct processes. The structure of the DHPH domain of Dbl family GEFs shows that the orientation of the PH domain with respect to the DH domain can vary widely (28Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The region in between the DH and PH domains vary greatly between different GEFs. However, it is this intervening region that determines the placement of the PH domain relative to the DH domain. Moreover, the NMR structure of Sos shows that this linker region is extremely flexible (13Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This suggests that the orientation of the PH domain with the DH domain may be more flexible, and contacts with the cognate GTPase may be a more common occurrence than currently appreciated. This feature may not be easily discerned from the rigid crystal structure complexes. Given that the structure of Rho family GTPases are so conserved, Dbl family GEFs need multiple ways to specifically pair with the correct substrate. Future experiments will explore the details of these interactions. We thank Gary Bokoch for providing us the bacterial expression constructs for Rac1 and Cdc42. We also acknowledge C. J. Thomas for Gβγ subunits, Michelle Booden for technical support and fruitful discussions, and Janice Buss for critically reviewing this manuscript."

In tumors carrying K-ras mutation, the presence of oncogenic K-Ras is necessary for maintenance of the transformed phenotype. ESXR1 is a human paired-like homeodomain-containing protein expressed primarily in the testis. In cells, the 65-kDa full-length ESXR1 protein is proteolytically processed into an N-terminal 45-kDa fragment containing the homeodomain, which localizes exclusively within the nucleus, and a C-terminal 20-kDa fragment consisting of a proline-rich repeat region, which is located in the cytoplasm. In this work, we demonstrated that the N-terminal ESXR1 fragment specifically recognizes the TAATNNNATTA P3 consensus sequence for the paired-like homeodomain and functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. We also showed that the N-terminal ESXR1 fragment binds to the TAATGTTATTA sequence present within the first intron of the human K-ras gene and inhibits its expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Ectopic expression of the N-terminal ESXR1 fragment in human carcinoma cells that carry mutated K-ras reduces the level of K-Ras and thereby inhibits the tumor cell proliferation. Identification of ESXR1 as a transcriptional repressor of K-ras has an important implication for the development of cancer therapy that inhibits oncogenic K-Ras expression."
