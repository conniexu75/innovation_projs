https://openalex.org/W2047684202,"Alpha factor mating pheromone is a peptide of 13 amino acids secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha cells. Nonmating (""sterile,"" or ste) alpha-cell mutants bearing defects in the STE13 gene do not produce normal alpha factor, but release a collection of incompletely processed forms (alpha factor) that have a markedly reduced specific biological activity. The major alpha-factor peptides have the structures H2N-GluAlaGluAla-alpha factor and H2N-AspAlaGluAla-alpha factor. The ste13 mutants lack a membrane-bound heat-stable dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPAPase A) that specifically cleaves on the carboxyl side of repeating -X-Ala- sequences. Absence of DPAPase A and the other phenotypes of a ste13 lesion cosegregate in genetic crosses. The cloned STE13 gene on a plasmid causes yeast cells to overproduce DPAPase A severalfold. A different cloned DNA segment, which weakly suppresses the ste13 defects, causes overproduction of a heat-labile activity (DPAPase B) by about tenfold. Other experiments indicate that DPAPase A action may be rate-limiting for alpha-factor maturation in normal alpha cells."

Central injection of insulin and bovine serum albumin had no such effects. These findings suggest that insulin-like growth factors play a role in growth hormone negative feedback and body weight regulation at the level of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W71897710,"Primary cultures of hepatocytes of rats and hamsters were established and examined for the synthesis and secretion of fibronectin. Hepatocytes of both species secreted fibronectin as a soluble dimeric protein which could be purified by its affinity for gelatin and using specific antisera. Plasma and cellular fibronectins could be clearly resolved on two-dimensional gels. In both species, the majority of the fibronectin secreted by hepatocytes was of the plasma type, as shown by analyses on one- and two-dimensional gels. The secretion of plasma fibronectin increased with time in culture, both in absolute terms and relative to the secretion of albumin. Even during the first day of culture, the secretion of fibronectin relative to that of albumin appeared to be sufficient to account for the relative levels of these two proteins in plasma. Hepatocytes of both species secreted preferentially the chain of plasma fibronectin with higher apparent molecular weight, although the faster migrating chain was also secreted. In addition, hamster hepatocytes cultured for 2 or more days appeared to secrete a cellular form of fibronectin. Possible origins for the different chain types of cellular and plasma fibronectins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1605866475,"Neurofilaments were treated with chymotrypsin or with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (V8 protease) and the proteolytic fragments in soluble and particulate centrifugal fractions were identified by immune blotting, using antibodies raised against the Mr = 68,000 (P68), 145,000 (P145), and 200,000 (P200) subunits. The data provide further evidence that each of the three subunits has a different disposition within the filament. A Mr = 160,000 fragment of P200, which may correspond to the side arm projections on neurofilaments, was released into solution by chymotrypsin. In contrast, the proteolytic fragments of P68 and P145 were recovered mainly in the particulate centrifugal fraction, indicating that the two subunits are more closely associated with the filament backbone. Proteolytic cleavage studies on neurofilaments that were 32P-labeled in vivo indicated that the phosphorylated domains in P200 and P145 are localized in a restricted segment of each subunit, which occurs between the chymotryptic and V8 protease cleavage sites. No 32P was associated with the bulk of chymotryptic fragments, which are found in the particulate fraction, are about 40,000 daltons in size, and derive from all three neurofilament subunits. Most of the phosphorylation sites in neurofilaments are peripherally located in the projection domain of P200, suggesting that phosphorylation may modulate interactions between neurofilaments and other neuronal components."

https://openalex.org/W2073293051,"A temperature-sensitive E. coli mutant with a mutation in the spc ribosomal protein operon was found to have a conditional defect in the processing of precursor proteins destined for the periplasmic space or the outer membrane. At high temperatures, significant amounts of precursor proteins having unprocessed signal sequences are detected in the mutant cell by pulse-labeling. The precursors are processed at very slow rates during a subsequent chase. Genetic analysis indicates that the mutation impairs the function of a gene, termed secY, located at the promoter-distal part of the spc operon. The secY gene is distinct from those genes previously known to specify ribosomal proteins, yet it is within the spc operon. It is suggested that the product of the secY gene is a component of the cellular apparatus that is essential for protein secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane. The gene secY is probably identical with prlA, previously identified as a suppressor of signal sequence mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2032746954,"The human pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi (Y strain) contains a neuraminidase activity that varies widely in the different developmental stages of the parasite. The specific neuraminidase activity of infective trypomastigotes obtained from tissue culture and from the bloodstream of infected mice is 7 to 15 times higher than that of the acellular culture forms. Amastigotes were devoid of enzyme activity. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.0 to 6.5. Live trypanosomes released sialic acid from human erythrocytes and plasma glycoproteins. Several sialyl compounds were hydrolyzed by the parasite, but the best substrate was the protein orosomucoid. Erythrocytes from infected mice with T. cruzi parasitemia were agglutinated by peanut lectin and the hemagglutination titer was correlated with the degree of parasitemia."

https://openalex.org/W2073109680,"A 1.45 kb circular plasmid derived from yeast chromosome IV contains the autonomous replication element called ARS1. Isotope density transfer experiments show that each plasmid molecule replicates once each S phase, with initiation depending on two genetically defined steps required for nuclear DNA replication. A density transfer experiment with synchronized cells demonstrates that the ARS1 plasmid population replicates early in the S phase. The sequences adjacent to ARS1 on chromosome IV also initiate replication early, suggesting that the ARS1 plasmid contains information which determines its time of replication. The times of replication for two other yeast chromosome sequences, ARS2 and a sequence referred to as 1OZ, indicate that the temporal order of replication is ARS1 leads to ARS2 leads to 1OZ. These experiments show directly that specific chromosome regions replicate at specific times during the yeast S phase. If ARS elements are origins of chromosome replication, then the experiment reveals times of activation for two origins."
https://openalex.org/W2055141312,The involvement of plasma fibronectin in phagocytosis of bacteria was investigated by testing the binding of fibronectin to several species of bacteria and by evaluating the ability of fibronectin to promote binding and endocytosis of two species of these bacteria by phagocytic cells. Fibronectin binds non-covalently to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and to yeast but did not appear to be necessary or sufficient for uptake of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium by several different phagocytic cell types.
https://openalex.org/W2017926031,"The effect of Lys-bradykinin on net Na+ influx in serum-deprived cultured human fibroblasts (HSWP cells) was measured. It was found that Lys-bradykinin stimulates net Na+ influx with a K1/2 of 1 nM. When Lys-bradykinin was combined with epidermal growth factor, vasopressin and insulin, the net Na+ influx stimulated was comparable with that measured in response to 10% serum. The above combination of growth factors also was found to stimulate DNA synthesis to 92% of the serum-stimulated levels in HSWP cells and to support cell growth over a period of 6 days. In addition, it was observed that the Na+ influx stimulated by Lys-bradykinin or by the combination of four growth factors was completely inhibited by the amiloride analog benzamil. Thus Lys-bradykinin presumably stimulates the same Na+ transport system as is stimulated by serum. Finally, the present results suggest that an increase in Na+ influx always accompanies DNA synthesis in HSWP cells. On the basis of these observations, it can be hypothesized that Na+ influx is a necessary event to stimulate DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1542131720,"A chymotrypsin-like proteinase was purified 2400-fold from human skin. The procedure involves extraction of the proteinase from skin in 2 M KCl, precipitation with protamine chloride, fractionation by gel filtration chromatography, and fractionation by chromatography using a CH-Sepharose-D-tryptophan methyl ester affinity column. The properties of this proteinase were compared to the rat mast cell proteinase I and human cathepsin G. Differences were observed in the rates at which the proteinases were inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, the sensitivity of the proteinases to protein proteolytic inhibitors, the relative hydrolytic rates of the proteinases for a series of substrates, and the kinetic constants of the proteinases for synthetic substrates. The human skin proteinase did not react with antiserum to the rat skin proteinase and did not elute in the same position as the rat skin proteinase on gel filtration columns. These data demonstrate that the human skin proteinase is distinct from the other proteinases. Extracts of involved skin from patients with cutaneous mastocytosis had 15-fold higher levels of chymotryptic activity than extracts of uninvolved skin or skin from normal controls. The enzymatic properties of the material extracted from the biopsied skin were similar to those of the proteinase from normal skin, suggesting that the human skin chymotrypsin-like proteinase is a mast cell constituent."

https://openalex.org/W1599134096,"OmpA is a major protein of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. It is made as a larger precursor, pro-OmpA, which requires a membrane potential for processing. We now show that pro-OmpA accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncouple which lowers the membrane potential. Upon restoration of the potential, this pro-OmpA is secreted, processed, and assembled into the outer membrane. Pro-OmpA made in vitro is also recovered with the postribosomal supernatant. It is efficiently processed to OmpA by liposomes which have bacterial leader peptidase that is exclusively internally oriented. These experiments show that: (i) the insertion of pro-OmpA into the plasma membrane is not coupled to its synthesis; (ii) insertion is promoted by the transmembrane electrochemical potential; (iii) pro-OmpA can cross a bilayer spontaneously; and (iv) pro-OmpA is processed by the same leader peptidase which converts M13 procoat to coat."
https://openalex.org/W1563468295,"The yeast mitochondrial outer membrane contains a major 29-kilodalton protein which is encoded in the nucleus. When this polypeptide is synthesized in vitro and then incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria, it binds to the organelles and becomes resistant to externally added trypsin. Post-translational insertion of the 29-kilodalton protein in vitro is not accompanied by NH2-terminal processing, appears to require neither ATP nor a transmembrane electrochemical potential, and is also observed with purified outer membranes, but not with yeast microsomes. In vitro insertion of the 29-kilodalton polypeptide is thus in several respects different from that of polypeptides destined for the internal compartments of the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1530955316,"In solubilized, (wheat germ) lectin-purified preparations of rat liver membranes, insulin stimulated the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into tyrosine residues of insulin receptor, casein, and histones. Despite the presence of both protein kinase and phosphatase activities in these preparations, no decrease in the 32P content of receptors (preincubated with or without insulin (0.5-100 nM)) was detected whether 32P incorporation was terminated by excess ATP, ATP + Mn2+, EDTA, or phosphatase inhibitors. Similarly, there was no decrease in the 32P content of phosphoreceptors incubated for up to 60 min with fresh receptor preparations in the presence or absence of insulin. Dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor to 20% of original 32P content only occurred when alkaline phosphatase was added to the preparations. It is concluded that endogenous receptor phosphatase(s) are either missing or inactive in these preparations, and consequently, insulin stimulates phosphorylation of its own receptor by activating a protein kinase. The kinase activity is tightly associated with the receptor itself; insulin also stimulated the phosphorylation of both receptor subunits in purified insulin-receptor complexes that had been immunoprecipitated by anti-insulin antibodies. However, the phosphorylating machinery is much more sensitive to heat inactivation than the binding function (90% less 32P incorporation versus 15% less binding during 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C), suggesting that the kinase is not associated exclusively with the insulin-binding domain."

https://openalex.org/W1526538558,"Several misacylated P-site tRNAs have been prepared by the T4 RNA ligase-mediated coupling of Escherichia coli tRNAPhe missing the 3'-terminal cytidine and adenosine moieties and N-acetylaminoacyl-pCpA derivatives. The reaction proceeded in reasonable yield in each case and the tRNA products were purified conveniently by successive chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose and benzoylated DEAE-cellulose. The misacylated tRNAPhes were assayed for participation in the peptidyltransferase reaction, using E. coli ribosomes and poly(U) as message. When phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe was employed as the A-site tRNA, chemically aminoacylated N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe produced dipeptide to virtually the same extent as authentic N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe, which was prepared by enzymatic activation of tRNAPhe followed by chemical acetylation. Significant dipeptide formation was also obtained with N-acetyl-L-tyrosyl-tRNAPhe, but much less dipeptide was obtained when the D-isomers of these two N-acetylaminoacyl-tRNAs were employed in the same assay system. Interestingly, N-acetyl-beta-phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe formed dipeptide at least to the same extent as authentic N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe."
https://openalex.org/W1578753788,"When sterol biosynthesis in oxygen-deprived wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae was prevented by the presence of 2,3-iminosqualene, an inhibitor of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase, an absolute requirement for a sterol with a 24 beta-methyl group was found. Neither the configuration nor the size of the alkyl group at C-24 could be altered. For instance, while 24 beta-methylcholesterol (22-dihydrobrassicasterol) permitted good growth, contrary to earlier work without the inhibitor no growth at all resulted from the presence of cholesterol or its 24 alpha-methyl-, 24 alpha-ethyl-, or 24 beta-ethyl derivatives (campesterol, sitosterol, and clionasterol, respectively). The only sterol lacking a 24 beta-methyl group which allowed growth was desmosterol (24-dehydro-cholesterol), but desmosterol was metabolized to 24 beta-methylcholesterol by C1-transfer and reduction. When cholesterol supported growth in the absence of the inhibitor, small amounts of endogenously synthesized 24 beta-methylsterols (ergosterol and 22-dihydroergosterol) were identified. This previously unrecognized absolute specificity for both chirality and bulk at C-24 suggests the involvement of protein binding in at least one of the roles which sterol plays in this single-celled eukaryote."

https://openalex.org/W129379979,"When the plasminogen activator urokinase was radioiodinated and incubated at 40 ng/ml in medium conditioned by human foreskin (HF) cells, within 30 min over 80% of the added plasminogen activator was complexed to cell-released protease nexin (PN). The urokinase complexed to PN had little if any activity. Incubation of purified PN with urokinase confirmed that PN is an inhibitor of this plasminogen activator. However, a widely used plasminogen-dependent fibrinolysis assay for plasminogen activator indicated that abundant endogenous plasminogen activator activity co-existed with PN in HF cell-conditioned medium. The source of this activity was electrophoretically and immunologically indistinguishable from urokinase. Furthermore, gel exclusion chromatography showed that about 90% of the urokinase antigen detected in conditioned medium had a molecular weight similar to that of free active urokinase. These paradoxical findings are resolved by evidence that this PN-resistant urokinase-like plasminogen activator is actually urokinase proenzyme that is activated by plasmin or conditions in the fibrinolysis assay for plasminogen activator. It is shown that the activated form of HF cell plasminogen activator is sensitive to inhibition by PN. PN may thus be an important component in the cellular regulation of endogenous plasminogen activator activity."

https://openalex.org/W1973923262,"A key intermediate in general genetic recombination is a structure in which two double-stranded DNA molecules are covalently linked by a single-strand crossover characteristic of a Holliday junction. When the DNA molecules are circular, the recombinant structures take the form of a figure eight. We have used purified E. coli enzymes to construct biparental figure-eight DNA molecules in vitro from the DNA of two partially homologous plasmids. When purified figure-eight structures are transfected into recA- E. coli cells, they are resolved to produce monomeric or dimeric plasmid progeny, apparently by the cutting and joining of the Holliday crossover. The maturation of figure-eight molecules in bacteria is characterized by the formation and recovery of both parental and recombinant types, cross-over at a frequency of up to 50% and the capability for mismatch repair at regions of hybrid DNA. In these three regards, the products of figure-eight maturation resemble recombinant chromosomes formed at meiosis. These observations show that biparental figure eights behave as recombination intermediates that can be resolved into mature recombinants without need for a functional recA+ gene product."

https://openalex.org/W1606557034,"Diphthamide, the post-translational amino acid derivative in the diphtheria toxin-modification site of protein synthesis elongation factor 2 (EF-2), has the proposed structure 2-[3-carboxyamido-3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]histidine (Van Ness, B. G., Howard, J. B., and Bodley, J. W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10710-10716). The identification of the biosynthetic precursors of diphthamide would provide a means of evaluating its proposed structure and determining if the amino acid occurs in proteins other than EF-2. Toward this end, yeast were grown on potential radiolabeled precursors and the resulting radiolabeled protein was hydrolyzed in acid. The acid hydrolysates were subjected to amino acid analysis with a program optimized to resolve diphthine, the acid hydrolysis product of diphthamide, from the common amino acids. Radiolabel from [beta-3H]histidine, [alpha-3H]methionine, and [Me-3H] methionine was found to be incorporated into diphthine in a molar ratio of 1:1:3 while that of [35S]methionine was not incorporated. These results are in accord with the proposed structure of diphthamide and suggest that in its biosynthesis the backbone and 3 methyl groups of methionine are added to a histidine residue in the peptide chain of EF-2. These labeling experiments show that diphthine (diphthamide) constitutes approximately 6 X 10(-6) mol fraction of the total amino acids in yeast protein hydrolysates. Estimates of the amount of diphthamide present in the diphtheria toxin-modification site of EF-2 indicate that it constitutes from 4.5 to 9 X 10(-6) mol fraction of the total amino acids in yeast protein. The present evidence suggests that diphthamide occurs only in EF-2."
https://openalex.org/W1496763998,"The cell surface molecules responsible for sexual agglutination between haploid cells of opposite mating type from Saccharomyces kluyveri have been purified and characterized. The 17-factor, released from 17-cells by beta-glucanase digestion (Zymolyase), is a glycoprotein of 6 X 10(4) Da. Its binding activity is heat- and protease-labile, but it is stable to reducing agents and exo-alpha-mannosidase digestion. The 16-factor, released from 16-cells by Zymolyase digestion, has a molecular weight of 5 X 10(5) and is over 95% carbohydrate. An active binding fragment can be released from 16-factor, from the factor purified from a mutant of 16-cells (16(mnn1)-factor), and from the surfaces of the cells themselves by dithiothreitol treatment. The 16(mnn1)-binding fragment has a molecular weight of 2 X 10(4) and is 30% carbohydrate. Its binding activity is stable to heat and some proteases, but it is labile to pronase, carboxypeptidases A and Y, alpha-mannosidases, and mild periodate treatment. 125I-16(mnn1)-binding fragment adheres specifically to 17-cells but does not bind to 16-cells or cells of other yeast strains. The binding of the labeled fragment to 17-cells is characterized by a KA of 10(8) M-1, and 5 X 10(5) binding sites are present per cell. The purified intact factors are monovalent and appear to interact in a lock and key fashion to cause the specific agglutination of S. kluyveri 16- and 17-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515757220,"A photoactive insulin analogue (N epsilon-B29-(2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl)insulin) which specifically and covalently labels the 138-kDa insulin receptor subunit, is used here to examine the effect of insulin on the subcellular distribution of insulin receptors in the isolated rat adipose cell. The photolabeled 138-kDa receptor subunit in the plasma and Golgi-enriched membrane fractions was quantitated by Na dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. When intact cells are photolabeled, subsequent incubation for 30 min at 37 degrees C with saturating native insulin induces a 30% loss of the labeled receptor subunit from the plasma membrane fraction. Greater than 50% of the lost receptor subunits can be specifically recovered in the Golgi-enriched membrane fraction. Qualitatively and quantitatively similar results are obtained when the 138-kDa receptor subunit is labeled in the membrane fractions following their preparation. However, the 138-kDa receptor subunit in the Golgi-enriched membrane fraction can only be labeled when the vesicles in this fraction are made permeable to the insulin analogue by the presence of 0.01% digitonin. The appearance of the 138-kDa receptor subunit in the Golgi-enriched membrane fraction is rapid, with a half-time of 2 min, and achieves a steady state within 10 min. This effect is also insulin concentration-dependent, with half-maximal and maximal effects at 6 and 30 nM, respectively, and is markedly, but not completely, inhibited at 16 degrees C. These results suggest that insulin induces a rapid and insulin concentration- and temperature-dependent translocation of its own receptor from the plasma membrane to an intracellular membrane fraction in the isolated rat adipose cell, and that this translocation represents internalization of the insulin receptor through an endocytic like process."
https://openalex.org/W1560213888,"DNA sequences that control transcriptional termination by prokaryotic RNA polymerases normally contain an inverted repeat, or self-complementary sequence, about 10 base pairs upstream from the site of RNA chain termination. Point mutations that interrupt this self-complementarity can reduce or eliminate RNA chain termination. We have constructed heteroduplex DNA templates using wild type and mutant attenuators for the Escherichia coli trp operon to probe the relative contributions of the two DNA strands in the termination process. Transcription analyses show that only the sequences in the transcribed DNA strand determine whether or not a heteroduplex terminator can function. This result strongly supports a model in which the formation of a stem and loop structure in the nascent RNA transcript is the signal for transcriptional termination."

https://openalex.org/W2002765675,"Kidneys from BALB/c mice contain a potent metalloendoproteinase, termed meprin, that is active against large proteins as well as small peptides.

Three related inbred strains, CBA/J, CBA/CaJ, and C3H/He, are markedly deficient in this enzymatic activity. This is the first report of a heritable deficiency of an intracellular proteinase in mammalian tissues. Meprin deficiency appears to have arisen as an early event in the development of the C stock. Furthermore, meprin is present in the progeny of a cross between a meprin-sufficient female (C57BL/6) and a meprin-deficient male (C3H/HeN), an indication that the trait for the deficiency is recessive."
https://openalex.org/W1507404475,"The relative contributions of transport and intracellular metabolism of glucose to the control of overall glucose utilization were evaluated in rat adipocytes. Transport of 3-O-methylglucose and hexokinase activity in crude homogenates were measured and the derived kinetic parameters incorporated into network thermodynamic computer simulations. Hexokinase was found to be inhibited in a fully noncompetitive pattern by glucose 6-phosphate (Ki = 0.46 mM). When this feature was incorporated into the computer simulations, they reflected measured rates of overall glucose utilization as well as intracellular glucose 6-phosphate concentrations, both in the presence and absence of insulin. The effect of the hormone was represented in the simulations solely by an increase in the number of hexose carriers. A predominant stimulation of transport rather than metabolism was also suggested by the finding that intracellular glucose concentrations assessed by glucose-induced 3-O-methylglucose counter-transport were higher in the presence than in the absence of insulin over a wide range of extracellular glucose concentrations. Nevertheless, it was also found that insulin induced a significant countertransport gradient while the oxidant H2O2 did not, which suggests that insulin-stimulated metabolism does increase overall glucose utilization independently of effects on transport. These studies show that the kinetic patterns of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in adipocytes may be generated simply by coupling transport and phosphorylation steps and providing for inhibition of the latter by accumulated glucose 6-phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1566289441,"The tertiary structure of the eukaryotic ribosomal 5 S RNA was examined using ethylnitrosourea reactivity as a probe for phosphodiester bonds. In three different 5 S RNAs of diverse origin the reactivity was restricted to the same three regions of the sequence, corresponding to residues G 99-A 101, A 88-G 89, and G 75 in the rat 5 S RNA molecule. All of these restricted residues are in highly conserved sequences; five of the residues (G 75, G 89, G 99, A 100, and A 101 in the rat) are present in all 5 S RNAs. The results indicate that, as has been suggested for the secondary structure, the tertiary structure of the 5 S RNA is also highly conserved. Based on these data, a working model for the tertiary structure is suggested which is consistent with previous studies on the structure of the free RNA and 5 S RNA-protein complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1565395667,"Pyruvate oxidase is a tetrameric enzyme consisting of four identical subunits. The specific activity of the enzyme may be increased more than 20-fold by limited proteolytic digestion by alpha-chymotrypsin in the presence of pyruvate and thiamin pyrophosphate. This phenomenon is due to the specific cleavage of an Mr = approximately 2000 from each subunit. The Mr = 2000 activation peptide (alpha) may be readily separated from the activated enzyme by high performance liquid chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. The alpha is not required to maintain the modified tetramer in the activated state. Cleavage of the alpha from each monomer is directly correlated with a substantial change in the visible spectrum of the flavin, characteristic of a shift from a hydrophobic to a more hydrophilic environment. Proteolytic cleavage by alpha-chymotrypsin in the absence of thiamin pyrophosphate irreversibly inactivates the enzyme by cleavage at a different site, producing an Mr = approximately 9000 inactivation peptide (beta). The beta remains noncovalently associated with the inactivated tetramer. Cleavage of the beta does not alter the spectrum of the flavin, even though the beta contains the alpha sequence. These results suggest that cleavage and release of the alpha opens up the flavin active site and may be directly responsible for the observed stimulation of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2145335652,"The D-mannitol-specific Enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein responsible for concomitant transport and phosphorylation of this hexitol. We have investigated the intramembrane topography of this enzyme/permease using proteases, membrane-impermeable reagents, and antibodies against the purified protein. The results of these experiments suggest that this protein spans the membrane in a single orientation with a sizeable proportion of its mass extending into the cytoplasm, but with little of the polypeptide exposed at the outside surface of the membrane. Such an orientation is consistent with the reception and transport roles of the mannitol Enzyme II in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1568788836,"In mammary gland organ culture from midpregnant mice, synergistic actions of insulin, cortisol, and prolactin stimulate differentiation of mammary epithelium and induce the synthesis of the milk proteins casein and alpha-lactalbumin. In the present study we examined the production of collagen and its function in the hormone-dependent development of mammary gland in vitro. The measurement of collagen production by the hydroxyproline assay and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the accumulation of collagen type I and type III in cultured mammary explants increased with the addition of insulin, cortisol, and prolactin to a chemically defined medium. When an analog of proline, L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (LACA), was added at a concentration of 80 microgram/ml with insulin, cortisol, and prolactin at the beginning of culture, collagen production in cultured tissue was inhibited by 75% during a 3-day incubation period. This agent also inhibited the synthesis of casein and alpha-lactalbumin by about 77 and 70%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of LACA could be prevented by L-proline; concomitant addition of L-proline (80 microgram/ml) with LACA (80 microgram/ml) resulted in complete restoration of milk protein synthesis to normal levels. Measurement of the amount of milk protein mRNAs in mammary explants by a cell-free translation assay demonstrated that LACA reduced the hormone-stimulated accumulation of casein mRNA and alpha-lactalbumin mRNA by 79 and 76%, respectively. LACA, however, produced little inhibition of DNA synthesis in cultured tissue. These results suggest that collagen production may be involved in the phenotypic expression of milk protein genes during hormonal induction of mammary epithelial differentiation in vitro."

In comparative growth rate experiments, the APHID-D2 cell line is less sensitive than the parental cell line to growth inhibition by deoxyadenosine in the presence of 10 microM erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. The APHID-D2 cell line has elevated levels of all four dNTPs. The resistance of the APHID-D2 cell line to growth inhibition by deoxyadenosine and the abnormal dNTP levels can be explained by the fact that the APHID-D2 ribonucleotide reductase, unlike the parental ribonucleotide reductase, is not normally sensitive to inhibition by dATP. These results suggest that the allosteric site of ribonucleotide reductase which binds both dATP and ATP is altered in the APHID-D2 line. The isolation of a mutant clone of human T-cells which contains a ribonucleotide reductase that has lost its normal sensitivity to dATP and which is resistant to deoxyadenosine-mediated growth inhibition suggests that a primary pathogenic target of accumulated dATP in lymphocytes from patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency may be the cellular ribonucleotide reductase."
https://openalex.org/W36982733,"An in vitro system for bacteriophage Mu DNA replication using lysates on cellophane discs is described. Mu replication was monitored by DNA hybridization. Using a thermoinducible Mu lysogen, 30-50% of all DNA synthesis in vitro was Mu-specific. Mu DNA synthesis is semidiscontinuous. In the presence of the DNA ligase inhibitor NMN, about one-half of the DNA was in Okazaki pieces and one-half in large DNA. The Mu Okazaki pieces hybridized mainly to the Mu light strand; the large DNA hybridized mainly to the Mu heavy strand. Okazaki pieces isolated from uninfected cells also hybridized to 2000-3000 bases of host DNA present in Mu-separated strands. However, the host Okazaki pieces hybridize to both Mu strands symmetrically. Most, if not all, host sequences were represented in mature Mu viral DNA. The in vitro data are most consistent with models in which Mu sequences, oriented randomly in both directions in the host chromosome, have recruited a bacterial replisome which traverses the Mu genome from left to right."
https://openalex.org/W1596637018,"Bovine enterokinase was incorporated into vesicles reconstituted from a soybean phospholipid mixture. A thin film hydration procedure (MacDonald, R. I., and MacDonald, R. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 9206-9214) produced vesicles with 40% of the enterokinase activity bound in the membrane. The highest incorporation was observed when cholesterol or dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine was added to the soybean phospholipids. Crude and highly purified enterokinase preparations were incorporated to the same extent suggesting that other membrane components were not required for a successful reconstitution. The properties of enterokinase in phospholipid vesicles were compared with those of alkaline phosphatase, which was also added to the reconstitution system, and with the enzyme activities present in vesicles prepared from brush-border membranes. The enzyme activities were not released by solutions of high ionic strength and remained associated with the phospholipid vesicles on gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and sucrose density centrifugation. Enterokinase and alkaline phosphatase had their active sites exposed to substrate in the brush-border membrane vesicles. In soybean phospholipid vesicles half of the active sites of both enzymes were on the outside, since release of the enzyme with Triton X-100 almost doubled the units of enzyme present. Incubation of the soybean phospholipid and brush-border membrane vesicles with papain released the exposed molecules of enterokinase. The released enzyme molecules were fully active but could not be reincorporated into phospholipid vesicles. This suggests that the structure imbedded in the lipid bilayer was essential for a successful reconstitution. We conclude that the reconstituted soybean phospholipid vesicles are a suitable membrane system for the further study of membrane-bound enterokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1598911416,"Ribonucleotide reductase reduces all four ribonucleoside diphosphates to the deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis. The enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits, M1 and M2. The 89-kilodalton M1 subunit contains at least two allosteric sites which, by binding nucleotide effectors, regulate the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of the enzyme. We now show that in addition, protein M1 contains a substrate-binding (catalytic) site which is specifically photolabeled after UV irradiation in the presence of the natural substrate, [32P]CDP. The photolabeling of protein M1 by [32P]CDP required the presence of the second subunit, protein M2, and ATP, the positive allosteric effector for CDP reduction. The negative effectors, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, inhibited the photolabeling of wild type protein M1. Deoxy-ATP did not inhibit the labeling of a mutant protein M1 that is resistant to feedback inhibition by dATP. In addition, hydroxyurea and 4-methyl-5-aminoisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone, two inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase which affect protein M2, also inhibited the [32P]CDP labeling of protein M1. These data provide new insights into the role and interaction of the two ribonucleotide reductase subunits, proteins M1 and M2, and the mechanism of action of the allosteric effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2274485677,"The pyrophosphorolysis of tRNA by yeast CTP-(ATP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase has been studied in an effort to define the behavior of the enzyme and the experimental parameters that lead to net loss of the 3'-terminal nucleotide or to nucleotide exchange. It was found that removal of AMP from the terminus of tRNA proceeded optimally at 1.0 mM PPi; incorporation of 2'- or 3'-dAMP was also studied and shown to proceed optimally at a 6.0 mM concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphate. CTP was shown to inhibit the pyrophosphorolysis and nucleotide exchange observed when starting from intact tRNA, but apparently not by inhibiting removal of CMP from tRNA missing the 3'-terminal adenosine moiety. The optimized conditions for nucleotide exchange were used for the preparative conversion of tRNAs to species terminating in 2'- and 3'-deoxyadenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1921786358,"The effects of intercalating agents on the fidelity of DNA synthesis in vitro have been investigated. The accuracy of DNA synthesis with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I with both the poly[d(A-T)] and poly[d(G-C)] templates is decreased in the presence of the intercalating agents proflavin, ethidium bromide, acridine orange, ICR-170, and ICR-191. Nearest neighbor analyses of the product of the reaction indicate that two different types of misincorporations occur in the presence of intercalating agents, frameshifts, and single-base substitutions. With alternating polynucleotide templates, frameshifts involving pyrimidines are the most frequent change in sequence observed. Overall, frameshift misincorporations occur with frequencies of one complementary pyrimidine for each intercalated site and one noncomplementary pyrimidine for each 150 sites. From analysis of nearest neighbor frequencies in the product, it is inferred that the intercalating agents interact specifically with pyrimidine (3' leads to 5') purine sequences. An analysis of ratios of correct nucleotide incorporations as a function of intercalator concentration indicates that frameshifts are predominantly additions; however, one cannot rule out infrequent deletions. Base substitutions in the presence of intercalators occur less frequently than frameshifts. From the results of reaction kinetics and nearest neighbor frequencies, it is concluded that the noncomplementary nucleotides are incorporated in phosphodiester linkage and are present as single-base substitutions. Taken together, the results of these studies suggest at least two different modes of action for intercalating agents on the accuracy of DNA synthesis: one leading to frameshift misincorporations and the other leading to single-base substitutions."
https://openalex.org/W1485387510,"Abstract The pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme tryptophanase has been investigated using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance at 72.86 MHz. In the native enzyme, the pyridoxal-P 31P chemical shift was found to be 3.55 ppm and independent of pH, indicating that the dianionic phosphate group of the cofactor is not accessible to solvent. Binding of the competitive inhibitor, beta-phenyl-DL-serine, results in the formation of the transaldimination complex. This complex is fixed to the enzyme via the dianionic phosphate group of the cofactor: again the observed shift is independent of pH. In both cases, restricted rotational freedom of the phosphate group around the C-O bond linking the phosphate ester to the pyridine moiety of the cofactor could be asserted from line width data. Addition of the competitive inhibitor, L-alanine, to tryptophanase produces the quinonoid intermediate. The phosphate group of this complex has lost its specific interaction (probably a salt bridge) with the protein, as indicated by the pH dependence of the chemical shift."
https://openalex.org/W1838951926,"To facilitate labeling cell surface insulin receptors and analyzing their metabolism by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a characterization of both the interaction of photosensitive insulin analogs with 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the conditions for photocross-linking these derivatives to the insulin receptor are described. The synthesis and purification of two photoaffinity analogs of insulin are presented. Both B29-lysine- and A1-glycine-substituted N-(2-nitro-4-azidophenyl)glycyl insulin compete with 125I-insulin for binding to 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the B29-derivative retains a biological activity similar to that for native insulin. An apparatus developed for these studies permits photolysis of cells in monolayer culture using the visible region of the lamp emission spectrum. Activation of the photoderivative by this apparatus occurs with a half-life of approximately 15 s and permits rapid photolabeling of a single species of receptor of 300,000 Da. The conditions for photolabeling permit a measurement of the turnover of covalent receptor-insulin complexes by 3T3-L1 adipocytes in monolayer culture. Degradation of this complex occurs as an apparent first order process with a half-life of 7 h. A comparison with previous studies (Reed, B. C., Ronnett, G. V., Clements, P. R., and Lane, M. D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem 256, 3917-3925; Ronnett, G. V., Knutson, V. P., and Lane, M. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4285-4291) indicates that in a down-regulated state, 3T3-L1 adipocytes degrade covalent receptor-hormone complexes with kinetics similar to those for the degradation of dissociable receptor-hormone complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1501081690,"Two distinct mechanisms of action for intercalating agents have been delineated: one leading to the production of frameshift misincorporations and the other leading to the production of single-base substitutions. Addition misincorporations are competitive with respect to DNA template (a measure of classical intercalation) but are not competitive with respect to deoxynucleotide substrates. Single-base substitutions are not competitive with template, polymerase, or deoxynucleotide as tested individually, but are proportional to the absolute drug concentration, indicating a ternary complex involving intercalator, polymerase, and template. Increased frequencies of single-base substitutions have not been considered as a general property of intercalators. Using a mutant phi X174 DNA, we demonstrate that intercalators also induce single-base substitutions with natural DNA templates. Reversion of am3 phi X174 DNA occurs only by single-base substitutions at position 587; this is increased 8-fold when the DNA is copied in vitro in the presence of intercalators."
