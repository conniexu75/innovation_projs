https://openalex.org/W2040283218,"125I-Mannose--BSA is taken up by alveolar macrophages by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Uptake is macrophage-specific and does not occur in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Binding (4 degrees C) and uptake (37 degrees C) of 125I--Man--BSA are time- and ligand concentration-dependent [Kuptake = 40 nM; Kd (4 degrees C) = 10 nM]. When adjusted for ligand degradation, ligand uptake is linear with time. Binding saturates at 60 min and requires Ca++. Following binding, ligand remains on the cell surface where it can be released by EGTA and trypsin. Internalization of prebound ligand occurs very rapidly (t 1/2 less than 5 min) when cells are warmed to 37 degrees C. Following internalization of prebound ligand, binding activity is rapidly recovered (t 1/2 less than 5 min). Trypsin treatment (4 degrees C) substantially reduces binding activity (greater than 70% per 30 min). However, binding activity is rapidly recovered in cells treated with trypsin at 4 degrees C by warming to 37 degrees C in the absence of added ligand. Trypsin treatment at 37 degrees C rapidly destroys binding and uptake. On the contrary, 4 degrees C trypsin treatment produces only a modest reduction in subsequent ligand uptake. These results, taken together with the observation that cycloheximide has no effect on ligand uptake, suggest that receptors must be spared from degradation and that reutilization of receptors probably occurs."

https://openalex.org/W2041122938,"In rhesus monkeys with hypothalamic lesions (which appear to abolish the endogenous production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone), normal ovulatory mestrual cycles were reestablished by an unvarying, long-term replacement regimen consisting of one intravenous pulse of synthetic gonadotropic-releasing hormone per hour. This finding is in accord with the hypothesis that the pattern of pituitary gonadotropin secretion throughout the menstrual cycle (basal secretion interrupted, once every 28 days on the average, by a preovulatory surge) is not directed by alterations in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion but by the ebb and flow of ovarian estrogens acting directly on the pituitary gland."

https://openalex.org/W2072938666,"When microbial strains compete for the same limiting nutrient in continuous culture, resource-based competition theory predicts that only one strain will survive and all others will die out. The surviving strain expected from theory will be the one with the smallest subsistence or ""break-even"" concentration of the limiting resource, a concentration defined by the J parameter. This prediction has been confirmed in the case of auxotrophic bacterial strains competing for limiting tryptophan. Because the value of J can be measured on the strains grown alone, the theory can predict the qualitative outcomes of mixed-growth competition in advance of actual competition."

https://openalex.org/W2016404873,"Cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase systems, which metabolize endogenous as well as foriegn compounds, are found in hepatic and several extrahepatic tissues of mammals, including humans. A form of cytochrome P-450 is localized in the nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells (Clara cells) of the small airways of rabbit lung. The apparent high concentration of the cytochrome in this pulmonary cell type compared to liver may be an important determinant in the susceptibility of the lung to a number of toxic chemicals that undergo metabolic activation."
https://openalex.org/W183461028,"The effects of glucagon, epinephrine, and vasopressin on phospholipid synthesis and glycogen phosphorylase a activity were investigated in rat hepatocytes. There was a stimulation of [32P]Pi ncorporation into phosphatidylinositol by vasopressin and epinephrine but not by glucagon. A mild degree of calcium depletion abolished the activation of glycogen phosphorylase by vasopressin but the increase in [32P]Pi ncorporation into phosphatidylinositol was still present. However, the activation of glycogen phosphorylase by epinephrine was not abolished by any degree of calcium depletion. The increase in [32P]Pi ncorporation into phosphatidylinositol due to epinephrine was mediated through an amechanism which was very sensitive to inhibition by prazosin, inhibited by phentolamine and yohimbine at fairly high concentrations, and unaffected by propranolol. The uptake of [2-3H]inositol into phosphatidylinositol was accelerated by hormones and correlated poorly with 32P uptake into this phospholipid. Depletion of calcium from or the addition of manganese to the incubation medium markedly enhanced the uptake of labeled inositol into phosphatidylinositol. However, these increases in [2-3H]inositol incorporation did not parallel any changes in basal or hormone stimulated 32P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol. The use of labeled inositol to measure phosphatidylinositol synthesis is unreliable since it appears to reflect the activity of the freely reversible Mn2+-dependent enzyme which catalyzes the reaction of CDP-diacylglycerol with inositol to give cytidine monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol. These data support the hypothesis that vasopressin and catecholamine activation of phosphatidylinositol turnover in hepatocytes is linked in an unknown fashion to the release of bound intracellular calcium and the entry of extracellular calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1519659414,"A lectin was purified from the hemolymph of Sarcophaga peregrina larvae, obtained after injury of their body wall. This lectin agglutinated sheep red blood cells markedly and the hemagglutinating activity was inhibited by galactose and lactose. The active lectin was found to have a molecular weight of 190,000 and to consist of four alpha subunits and two beta subunits, with molecular weights of 32,000 and 30,000, respectively. During the early pupal stage, similar hemagglutinating activity in the hemolymph increased to several times than in larval hemolymph. This activity was completely inhibited by the antibody prepared against the lectin purified from the hemolymph of injured larvae. Thus, the same protein having lectin activity is apparently induced under two different physiological conditions: injury of the body wall of larvae and during pupation. The biological significance of this lectin is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2115713211,"The immunoglobulins produced by the earliest recognizable B cell precursors (pre-B cells) were characterized in the mouse and human. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed no evidence of surface IgM components, and only mu heavy chains could be detected intracytoplasmically in pre-B cells. Surface IgM components could not be isolated from intact fetal liver cells that lacked sIgM+ B lymphocytes but possessed pre-B cells. Pre-B cells were shown to synthesize and secrete mu heavy chains but not light chains by immunochemical analysis. These mu chains constituted less than 0.01% of TCA precipitable protein synthesized and secreted by fetal liver cells during an 8 hr labelling period. Migration of both intracellular and secreted mu chains on SDS-PAGE suggested that they were smaller than mu chains secreted by mouse and human plasmacytomas. These data indicate that mu chain synthesis precedes light chain expression during B cell ontogeny and suggest a new role for pre-B cells in the generation and expression of a diverse immunoglobulin repertoire."

https://openalex.org/W2014435813,"The organization of mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain genes has been investigated by hybridization with cloned mu and alpha cDNA probes. Restriction endonuclease fragments bearing mu and alpha constant region genes and two types of variable region (VH) genes were compared in BALB/c embryos, liver and nine plasmacytomas synthesizing IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3. Embryo DNA was found to contain a single copy of the C mu gene per haploid genome. In contrast, one VH probe (HPC 76) detected at least six related VH genes, while the other (S107) detected a separate set of at least four genes, indicating that the germline contains distinct sets of multiple related VH genes. Most VH genes within the two subsets remained in germline context in different plasmacytomas, providing no evidence for somatic reassortment of VH genes. One plasmacytoma was devoid of specific VH genes, including some related to the expressed VH sequence. This may mean that the translocation event creating an active heavy chain gene involves deletion of the DNA between the expressed VH and CH sequences. The context of C mu sequences in DNA from a plasmacytoma secreting IgM differed from that in embryo DNA, as did C alpha sequences in two IgA- and several IgG-secreting plasmacytomas. Unlike heavy chain expression, rearrangement was not confined to one allele and often took different forms within a single cell line, presumably varying on different homologous chromosomes. Each rearrangement, whether resulting in an active C gene or not, appeared to change sequences upstream but not downstream from the CH gene. Significantly, the eight IgG and IgA plasmacytomas examined had undergone deletions of at least half and often all C mu sequences while retaining the embryo level of C alpha sequences. Hence a deletion mechanism may be responsible for the switch in expression from one CH gene to another which occurs during differentiation of a lymphocyte clone."
https://openalex.org/W1655726283,"We have determined the entire sequence of two immunoglobulin kappa variable region genes derived separately from embryonic and plasmacytoma cells. Both genes are in the germline configuration; both are organized into hydrophobic leader and mature V-region coding sequences separated by a short intervening sequence. Both are identical with one another throughout the 1360 bases determined. In addition, there is a simple repeat sequence of 31 CA doublets that occurs about 300 bases from the 3' side of the coding sequence in each gene."

Components A and C were found to be large heat-labile proteins with A being in excess of 500,000 daltons, and C being 130,000 daltons. Component A exhibited hydrogenase activity for reduction of viologen dyes, coenzyme F420, or flavins but not for NAD+ or NADP+. An apparent Km of 25 microM was determined for F420 and a Km of 1.5 mM for methyl viologen. After centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h, 80% of Component A was found in the supernatant solution. Component B was found to be an oxygen-labile, heat-resistant, dialyzable cofactor with a size of about 1,000 daltons and with no apparent absorption in the visible range. Known cofactors failed to substitute for the new coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2001997700,A nonspecific carboxylesterase (esterase 6) of Drosophila melanogaster shows greater activity in adult males than in females and is highly concentrated in the anterior ejaculatory duct of the reproductive tract of the male. Esterase 6 is depleted in males by copulation and is transferred to females early during copulation as a component of the seminal fluid. That esterase 6 may be involved in a system controlling the timing of remating is suggested by differences in the activity of this enzyme in a strain of Drosophila selected for a decrease in time to remating and by differences in the timing of remating in females initially inseminated by males lacking or having active esterase 6.

https://openalex.org/W1516191771,"The enzyme uracil DNA-glycosylase has been purified from blast cells of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia. A 1000-fold purification has been achieved and the enzyme appears highly enriched for the uracil glycosylase activity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme is 30,000. Uracil DNA-glycosylase exhibits activity in the absence of any added metal and the addition of MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, NaCl, or KCl causes inhibition. EDTA as well as EGTA can inhibit enzyme activity. An interesting finding is the biphasic effect of spermine. At a concentration of 25 microM, spermine will cause a 2.5-fold activation of enzyme activity, whereas at concentrations of 100 microM and higher, spermine will inhibit enzyme activity. An Arrhenius plot of glycosylase activity in the presence of 25 microM spermine shows a biphasic curve with the transition temperature being 36 degrees C. Initial velocity studies in the presence of varying concentrations of spermine indicate a change in both the apparent Km and Vmax of the enzyme. Various uracil analogs were tested to establish a structure-activity relationship for this enzyme. It appears from this data that uracil DNA-glycosylase is very specific for uracil moieties. Uracil, acting as a product inhibitor, gives a Ki value of 220 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1616867984,Chloroquine was found to prevent the cytotoxic action of diphtheria toxin on cultured monkey kidney cells. Analysis of the cellular processing of 125I-labeled diphtheria toxin showed that chloroquine does not affect the rate or extent of toxin uptake but substantially blocks degradation. These studies provide strong evidence that diphtheria toxin enters monkey kidney cells primarily by adsorptive endocytosis and suggest that lysosomal processing is involved in intracellular activation of the proenzyme form of the toxin.

A 480,000-fold purification was achieved to yield renin with a specific activity of 950 Goldblatt units/mg. This preparation satisfied multiple criteria of purity as tested by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, specific activity, analytical ultracentrifugation, and immunodouble diffusion. The molecular weight of the pure enzyme determined by sedimentation equilibrium is 40,000. The apparent molecular weight estimated by gel filtration is 41,000. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of pH 5.7. Human renin shows an affinity for concanavalin A, suggesting the presence of carbohydrates. These properties and the amino acid composition of human renin are different from those of renin obtained from other mammalian species. Human renin antibodies prepared with the pure enzyme preparation showed negligible cross-reactivity with renin from other mammalian species. The activity with homologous human renin substrate has a pH optimum of 6, whereas with substrates from other mammalian species the optima were in higher or lower pH ranges."

TRH, as well as high K+ (50 mM), was shown to increase 45Ca2+ efflux from these cells. The effects of TRH and high K+ on membrane polarization was determined indirectly using the lipophilic cation, triphenylmethyl phosphonium ion (TPMP+). The resting membrane potential of GH3 cells was -50 +/- 1.7 mV. TRH, which induced a marked increase in 45Ca2+ efflux and stimulated prolactin release, had no effect on membrane polarization measured simultaneously. High K+, which also increased 45Ca2+ efflux and prolactin release, depolarized the GH3 cell as evidenced by a marked increase in [3H]TPMP+ efflux. These results suggest that TRH and high K+ may act via different mechanisms to increase intracellular Ca2+ and stimulate prolactin release."

https://openalex.org/W1493834346,"Abstract Accumulation of Ca2+ (+ phosphate) by respiring mitochondria from Ehrlich ascites or AS30-D hepatoma tumor cells inhibits subsequent phosphorylating respiration in response to ADP. The respiratory chain is still functional since a proton-conducting uncoupler produces a normal stimulation of electron transport. The inhibition of phosphorylating respiration is caused by intramitochondrial Ca2+ (+ phosphate). ATP + Mg2+ together, but not singly, prevents the inhibitory action of Ca2+. Neither AMP, GTP, GDP, nor any other nucleoside 5'-triphosphate or 5'-diphosphate could replace ATP in this effect. Phosphorylating respiration on NAD(NADP)-linked substrates was much more susceptible to the inhibitory effect of intramitochondrial Ca2+ than succinate-linked respiration. Significant inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation is given by the endogenous Ca2+ present in freshly isolated tumor mitochondria. The phosphorylating respiration of permeabilized Ehrlich ascites tumor cells is also inhibited by Ca2+ accumulated by the mitochondria in situ. Possible causes of the Ca2+-induced inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1512969430,"The flavin prosthetic group (FAD) of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) was replaced by 1-deaza-FAD (carbon substituted for nitrogen at position 1). An improved method for production of apoenzyme by precipitation with acidic ammonium sulfate was developed. The modified enzyme, in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoate, catalyzed the oxidation of NADPH by oxygen, yielding NADP+ and H2O2, but the ability to hydroxylate p-hydroxybenzoate and other substrates was lost. An analysis of the mechanism of NADPH-oxidase catalysis showed a close analogy between the reaction pathways for native and modified enzymes. In the presence of p-hydroxybenzoate, the rate of NADPH consumption catalyzed by the 1-deaza-FAD form was about 11% that of the native enzyme. Both formed a stabilized flavin-C (4a)-OOH intermediate upon reaction of reduced enzyme with oxygen, but the 1-deaza-FAD enzyme could not utilize this peroxide to hydroxylate substrates, and the peroxide decomposed to oxidized enzyme and H2O2."

https://openalex.org/W1545812073,"The region of bovine a-lactalbumin which interacts with bovine colostrum galactosyltransferase in the lactose synthase complex has been examined by differential labeling of the amino groups with acetic anhydride. a-Lactalbumin was acetylated in the free state and in a 1:l complex with galactosyltransferase in the presence of Mn2+, UDP-glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine with trace amounts of high specific activity [3H]acetic anhydride and was separated from each solution by gel filtration. The sample modified in the presence of galactosyltransferase contained 74% as much 3H label as that modified in the free state; both samples contained less than 0.2 acetyl groups/protein molecule. A portion of each sample was mixed with an aliquot of a-lactalbumin that had been acetylated with excess [‘4C]acetic anhydride under denaturing conditions to facilitate the determination of the relative reactivities of individual amino groups through 3H/’4C ratios. The protein samples were completely acetylated with unlabeled acetic anhydride, reduced, carboxymethylated, cleaved with cyanogen bromide to give the two cyanogen bromide fragments (CN1 and CN2), which were further subcleaved enzymically. Radioactive peptides each containing each of the 12 lysines and the a-amino group were purified by column chromatography and located in the sequence by amino acid analysis. Examination of the 3H/14C ratios from the a-lactalbumin modified in free solution revealed a range of reactivities of the amino groups, which are related to their environments in previously proposed models for the structure of the protein. By comparison with this control sample, the protein modified in the complex showed major perturbations in reactivity in only two groups, lysine 5, which was reduced in reactivity by a factor of 3, and lysine 114, which was increased in reactivity by a factor of 2. The amino groups of these residues are proximally situated in an area of the a-lactalbumin molecule neighboring the region corresponding to one end of the active site cleft region in the homologous lysozymes. The origin of the differential reactivities and their relevance to the structure, function, and evolution of a-lactalbumin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1975806049,"Mouse leukemia viruses (MuLV) have been reported to induce tumors involving cells within the T lymphocyte lineage. In the present study, striking differences were demonstrated in the target cells for in vivo transformation by two clonal replication-competent type C viruses, Moloney- and Rauscher-MuLV. Moloney-MuLV-induced tumors and lymphoma cell lines exhibited Thy.1 antigen in the absence of detectable Fc or C3 receptors, indicating their T cell origin. Rauscher-MuLV primary tumors and lymphoma cell lines of the same mouse strain, however, invariably exhibited Fc receptors in the absence of Thy.1 antigen, suggesting that these tumors were of the B lymphoid lineage. The pattern of immunoglobulin synthesis by individual Rauscher-MuLV tumor cell lines was determined by both biosynthetic and radioimmunologic techniques. Rauscher-MuLV lymphoma lines invariably expressed immunoglobulin heavy (mu) chain in the absence of detectable light (kappa or lambda) chains. These findings establish that the target of neoplastic transformation in response to Rauscher-MuLV is an immature cell within the B lymphoid lineage. The demonstration of different target cells for transformation by well characterized clonal strains of mouse leukemia virus should aid in elucidating the mechanisms by which these viruses induce malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W1971608836,"Vasomotor activity in cutaneous tail veins was indexed by changes in local skin temperature during exposure of the whole body to 12.3-centimeter continuous microwaves. At an ambient temperature (26 degrees C) just below that at which tail vessels normally vasodilate, criterion dilation was initiated by 5-minute exposures to a microwave power density of 8 milliwatts per square centimeter. This intensity deposits energy equivalent to approximately 20 percent of the monkey's resting metabolic rate but produces no observable change in deep body temperature. Intensity increments of 3 to 4 milliwatts per square centimeter for 1 degree C reductions in ambient temperature below 26 degrees C produced identical responses. That no vasodilation occurred during infrared exposures of equivalent power density suggests that noncutaneous thermosensitive structures may mediate microwave activation of thermoregulatory responses in the peripheral vasomotor system."

Ring-X and ringless mitoses were recorded in the major part of the blastoderm in 18 eggs. Limits between females and male areas were very irregular and some embryos had several isolated areas of one type or the other. The proportion of male nuclei varied from 80.8 to 0.4%, indicating that there must have been more than one loss of the ring-X in most of the eggs and that losses occurred as late as the ninth division. When the percentages of male nuclei were compared with theoretical values, all the observed percentages could be accounted for by two losses. In early cleavages the lost ring could be found halfway between ringless mitoses. Examination of chromosomes in the three polar nuclei showed that the ring often remained undivided in meiosis. If the resulting ringless haploid group became a female pronucleus, an XO or YO embryo was produced after fertilization. We propose a hypothesis to explain the two losses."

Antisera raised against purified PGK-1 and PGK-2A were tested for specificity and cross-reactivity by application of double immunodiffusion and enzyme immunoinactivation methods. By double immunodiffusion, no precipitin lines were observed between anti-PGK-2A and PGK-1, but a weak cross-reactivity between anti-PGK-1 and PGK-2A was detected. In addition to specific inhibition of PGK-1 and PGK-2A by their respective antisera, anti-PGK-1 was shown to inhibit PGK-2 activity at high antiserum concentrations, whereas no inhibition of PGK-1 activity by anti-PGK-2A was observed. The amino acid compositions of PGK-1 and PGK-2 revealed a certain degree of homology. However, tryptic peptide maps showed no obvious similarity in the peptide spots between these two 3-phosphoglycerate kinase isozymes.

https://openalex.org/W1528578414,"The single disulfide bond in potato Inhibitor I protomers (Mr = 8,000) was reduced and alkylated in the absence of denaturants to the carboxamidomethyl cysteine derivative. Two half-cystines per mol of inhibitor protomer were modified as determined by (a) loss of two sulfhydryl groups per reduced protomer, (b) incorporation of 2 mol of [14C]iodoacetamide per protomer, and (c) amino acid analyses. The alkylated Inhibitor I retained its oligomeric structure (Mr = 40,000) and fully retained its immunological cross reactivity with anti-Inhibitor I serum. Furthermore, the inhibitory properties of modified and unmodified Inhibitor I toward chymotrypsin were identical. The stoichiometric complex between modified Inhibitor I and chymotrypsin was stable at pH 8.0 for over 72 h. The modification of the disulfide bond introduced a lability to both heat and proteolytic enzymes. Ultraviolet difference spectra and near ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra at pH 8.0, between modified and unmodified Inhibitor I, revealed only minor absorption changes due to modification. However, in circular dichroism spectra at pH 2.0, the modified inhibitor exhibited a significant loss of absorption in the region between 270 and 280 nm that was present in the unmodified inhibitor. The cumulative results of this study indicate that the single disulfide bond in Inhibitor I, which forms a rather large disulfide loop between residues 5 and 51, is not important at neutral pH for maintaining major structural conformations which affect immunological or inhibitory activities, but the disulfide bond does impose restraints on the protein which stabilize it toward thermal denaturation and proteolysis. The susceptibility of the reduced inhibitor to plant sulfhydryl enzymes may have some importance in in vivo degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1593649264,"Previous work has shown that the degradation of 20% of total protein which occurs early in germination of Bacillus megaterium spores is initiated by an endoprotease. This enzyme is found only in the spore and is active only on the spore proteins degraded during germination. Action of the spore protease in vitro on the three major proteins (Proteins A, B, and C) which are degraded in vivo during germination results in cleavage of one (A and C protein) or two (B protein) peptide bonds. The sequences surrounding the cleavage sites are -Tyr-Glu- Ile-Ala-Ser-Glu-Phe- in the A protein, -Phe-Glu- Ile-Ala-Ser-Glu-Phe- in the C protein, and -Thr-Glu- Phe-Gly-Ser-Glu-Thr-, and -Thr-Glu- Phe-Ala-Ser-Glu-Thr- in the B protein, with cleavage taking place at the glutamyl bond noted by the arrow. The similarity of these four sequences suggests the possibility that the specificity of the spore protease may be due to its requirement for a specific pentapeptide sequence of the type -R-Glu-(Phe or Ile)-(Gly or Ala)-Ser-Glu-R- for recognition and cleavage. However, it is also possible that it is the conformation of the A, B, and C proteins which determines their site of cleavage by the spore protease."
