https://openalex.org/W2159999899,"Human mesenchymal stem cells are thought to be multipotent cells, which are present in adult marrow, that can replicate as undifferentiated cells and that have the potential to differentiate to lineages of mesenchymal tissues, including bone, cartilage, fat, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma. Cells that have the characteristics of human mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from marrow aspirates of volunteer donors. These cells displayed a stable phenotype and remained as a monolayer in vitro. These adult stem cells could be induced to differentiate exclusively into the adipocytic, chondrocytic, or osteocytic lineages. Individual stem cells were identified that, when expanded to colonies, retained their multilineage potential."
https://openalex.org/W2137035181,"Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/ threonine kinase Akt, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery, including BAD and Caspase 9. In this study, we demonstrate that Akt also regulates the activity of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors. In the presence of survival factors, Akt phosphorylates FKHRL1, leading to FKHRL1's association with 14-3-3 proteins and FKHRL1's retention in the cytoplasm. Survival factor withdrawal leads to FKHRL1 dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and target gene activation. Within the nucleus, FKHRL1 triggers apoptosis most likely by inducing the expression of genes that are critical for cell death, such as the Fas ligand gene."

The observed oscillations of the tunnel splittings as a function of the magnetic field applied along the hard anisotropy axis are due to topological quantum interference of two tunnel paths of opposite windings. Transitions between quantum numbers M = − S and ( S − n ), with n even or odd, revealed a parity effect that is analogous to the suppression of tunneling predicted for half-integer spins. This observation is direct evidence of the topological part of the quantum spin phase (Berry phase) in a magnetic system."
https://openalex.org/W1976061944,"A coral reef represents the net accumulation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) produced by corals and other calcifying organisms. If calcification declines, then reef-building capacity also declines. Coral reef calcification depends on the saturation state of the carbonate mineral aragonite of surface waters. By the middle of the next century, an increased concentration of carbon dioxide will decrease the aragonite saturation state in the tropics by 30 percent and biogenic aragonite precipitation by 14 to 30 percent. Coral reefs are particularly threatened, because reef-building organisms secrete metastable forms of CaCO3, but the biogeochemical consequences on other calcifying marine ecosystems may be equally severe."
https://openalex.org/W1967450020,"Extending axons in the developing nervous system are guided in part by repulsive cues. Genetic analysis in Drosophila, reported in a companion to this paper, identifies the Slit protein as a candidate ligand for the repulsive guidance receptor Roundabout (Robo). Here we describe the characterization of three mammalian Slit homologs and show that the Drosophila Slit protein and at least one of the mammalian Slit proteins, Slit2, are proteolytically processed and show specific, high-affinity binding to Robo proteins. Furthermore, recombinant Slit2 can repel embryonic spinal motor axons in cell culture. These results support the hypothesis that Slit proteins have an evolutionarily conserved role in axon guidance as repulsive ligands for Robo receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2168344733,"Previous studies suggested that Roundabout (Robo) is a repulsive guidance receptor on growth cones that binds to an unknown midline ligand. Here we present genetic evidence that Slit is the midline Robo ligand; a companion paper presents biochemical evidence that Slit binds Robo. Slit is a large extracellular matrix protein expressed by midline glia. In slit mutants, growth cones enter the midline but never leave it; they abnormally continue to express high levels of Robo while at the midline. slit and robo display dosage-sensitive genetic interactions, indicating that they function in the same pathway. slit is also required for migration of muscle precursors away from the midline. Slit appears to function as a short-range repellent controlling axon crossing of the midline and as a long-range chemorepellent controlling mesoderm migration away from the midline."
https://openalex.org/W2136990296,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze aminoacylation of transfer RNAs (tRNAs). It is shown that human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase can be split into two fragments with distinct cytokine activities. The endothelial monocyte–activating polypeptide II–like carboxy-terminal domain has potent leukocyte and monocyte chemotaxis activity and stimulates production of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and tissue factor. The catalytic amino-terminal domain binds to the interleukin-8 type A receptor and functions as an interleukin-8–like cytokine. Under apoptotic conditions in cell culture, the full-length enzyme is secreted, and the two cytokine activities can be generated by leukocyte elastase, an extracellular protease. Secretion of this tRNA synthetase may contribute to apoptosis both by arresting translation and producing needed cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2079128745,"Many neurons in both vertebrates and invertebrates innervate multiple targets by sprouting secondary axon collaterals (or branches) from a primary axon shaft. To begin to identify molecular regulators of axon branch initiation or extension, we studied the growth of single sensory axons in an in vitro collagen assay system and identified an activity in extracts of embryonic spinal cord and of postnatal and adult brain that promotes the elongation and formation of extensive branches by these axons. Biochemical purification of the activity from calf brain extracts led to the identification of an amino-terminal fragment of Slit2 as the main active component and to the discovery of a distinct activity that potentiates its effects. These results indicate that Slit proteins may function as positive regulators of axon collateral formation during the establishment or remodeling of neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2061172411,"The olfactory bulb plays a central role in olfactory information processing through its connections with both peripheral and cortical structures. Axons projecting from the olfactory bulb to the telencephalon are guided by a repulsive activity in the septum. The molecular nature of the repellent is not known. We report here the isolation of vertebrate homologs of the Drosophila slit gene and show that Slit protein binds to the transmembrane protein Roundabout (Robo). Slit is expressed in the septum whereas Robo is expressed in the olfactory bulb. Functionally, Slit acts as a chemorepellent for olfactory bulb axons. These results establish a ligand–receptor relationship between two molecules important for neural development, suggest a role for Slit in olfactory bulb axon guidance, and reveal the existence of a new family of axon guidance molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2122971325,Sediments from Lunkaransar dry lake in northwestern India reveal regional water table and lake level fluctuations over decades to centuries during the Holocene that are attributed to changes in the southwestern Indian monsoon rains. The lake levels were very shallow and fluctuated often in the early Holocene and then rose abruptly around 6300 carbon-14 years before the present (14C yr B.P.). The lake completely desiccated around 4800 (14)C yr B.P. The end of this 1500-year wet period coincided with a period of intense dune destabilization. The major Harrapan-Indus civilization began and flourished in this region 1000 years after desiccation of the lake during arid climate and was not synchronous with the lacustral phase.
https://openalex.org/W2017826121,"Hedgehog (Hh) proteins play diverse organizing roles in development by regulating gene expression in responding cells. The Gli homolog Cubitus interruptus (Ci) is involved in controlling the transcription of Hh target genes. A repressor form of Ci arises in the absence of Hh signaling by proteolytic cleavage of intact Ci. We show that this cleavage is essential for limb patterning and is regulated by Hh in vivo. We provide evidence for the existence of a distinct activator form of Ci, which does not arise by mere prevention of Ci proteolysis, but rather depends on a separate regulatory step subject to Hh control. These different activities of Ci regulate overlapping but distinct subsets of Hh target genes. Thus, limb development is organized by the integration of different transcriptional outputs of Hh signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2030648310,"The crystal structure of the complex of ARF1 GTPase bound to GDP and the catalytic domain of ARF GTPase–activating protein (ARFGAP) has been determined at 1.95 Å resolution. The ARFGAP molecule binds to switch 2 and helix α3 to orient ARF1 residues for catalysis, but it supplies neither arginine nor other amino acid side chains to the GTPase active site. In the complex, the effector-binding region appears to be unobstructed, suggesting that ARFGAP could stimulate GTP hydrolysis while ARF1 maintains an interaction with its effector, the coatomer complex of COPI-coated vesicles. Biochemical experiments show that coatomer directly participates in the GTPase reaction, accelerating GTP hydrolysis a further 1000-fold in an ARFGAP-dependent manner. Thus, a tripartite complex controls the GTP hydrolysis reaction triggering disassembly of COPI vesicle coats."

Existing approaches to modeling natural landform patterns, reductionism and universality, are incompatible with the nonlinear, open nature of natural systems. An alternative modeling methodology based on the tendency of natural systems to self-organize in temporal hierarchies is described."
https://openalex.org/W2077159019,"Polarization of epithelial cells depends on a hierarchical process whereby specific membrane-associated proteins become targeted to specialized membrane domains. Here, we describe a novel Drosophila protein, Discs Lost (DLT), that plays a crucial role in the polarization of embryonic epithelia during cellular blastoderm formation. At subsequent stages of development, DLT interacts with the apical determinant Crumbs (CRB) and the laterally localized protein Neurexin IV (NRX IV). Mutations in dlt or double-stranded RNA interference lead to aberrant localization of CRB and NRX IV and cause a concomitant loss of epithelial cell polarity. Hence, DLT is required to establish and maintain cell polarity and participates in different molecular complexes that define apical and lateral membrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W1550545417,"Beta2-Adrenergic and chemokine receptor antagonists delay the onset and reduce the severity of joint injury in rheumatoid arthritis. beta2-Adrenergic and chemokine receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor family whose responsiveness is turned off by the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase family (GRK-1 to 6). GRKs phosphorylate receptors in an agonist-dependent manner resulting in receptor/G-protein uncoupling via subsequent binding of arrestin proteins. We assessed the activity of GRKs in lymphocytes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients by rhodopsin phosphorylation. We found a significant decrease in GRK activity in RA subjects that is mirrored by a decrease in GRK-2 protein expression. Moreover, GRK-6 protein expression is reduced in RA patients whereas GRK-5 protein levels were unchanged. In search of an underlying mechanism, we demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines induce a decrease in GRK-2 protein levels in leukocytes from healthy donors. Since proinflammatory cytokines are abundantly expressed in RA, it may provide an explanation for the decrease in GRK-2 expression and activity in patients. No changes in beta2-adrenergic receptor number and Kd were detected. However, RA patients showed a significantly increased cAMP production and inhibition of TNF-alpha production by beta2-adrenergic stimulation, suggesting that reduced GRK activity is associated with increased sensitivity to beta2-adrenergic activation."
https://openalex.org/W2134517562,"We have identified the Drosophila transmembrane molecule kekkon 1 (kek1) as an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and demonstrate that it acts in a negative feedback loop to modulate the activity of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. During oogenesis, kek1 is expressed in response to the Gurken/EGFR signaling pathway, and loss of kek1 activity is associated with an increase in EGFR signaling. Consistent with our loss-of-function studies, we demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of kek1 mimics a loss of EGFR activity. We show that the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Kek1 can inhibit and physically associate with the EGFR, suggesting potential models for this inhibitory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2029162694,"A redacted prion protein (PrP) of 106 amino acids with two large deletions was expressed in transgenic (Tg) mice deficient for wild-type (wt) PrP (Prnp0/0) and supported prion propagation. RML prions containing full-length PrP(Sc)produced disease in Tg(PrP106)Prnp0/0 mice after approximately 300 days, while transmission of RML106 prions containing PrP(Sc)106 created disease in Tg(PrP106) Prnp0/0 mice after only approximately 66 days on repeated passage. This artificial transmission barrier for the passage of RML prions was diminished by the coexpression of wt MoPrPc in Tg(PrP106)Prnp+/0 mice that developed scrapie in approximately 165 days, suggesting that wt MoPrP acts in trans to accelerate replication of RML106 prions. Purified PrP(Sc)106 was protease resistant, formed filaments, and was insoluble in nondenaturing detergents. The unique features of RML106 prions offer insights into the mechanism of prion replication, and the small size of PrP(Sc)106 should facilitate structural analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1987036024,"Protonated methane, CH5+, has unusual vibrational and rotational behavior because its three nonequivalent equilibrium structures have nearly identical energies and its five protons scramble freely. Although many theoretical papers have been published on the quantum mechanics of the system, a better understanding requires spectral data. A complex, high-resolution infrared spectrum of CH5+ corresponding to the C-H stretching band in the 3.4-micrometer region is reported. Although no detailed assignment of the individual lines was made, comparison with other carbocation spectra strongly suggests that the transitions are due to CH5+."

In forecasting prospective climate changes for the next century, the focus has been on the ordered system's responses to anthropogenic forcing. The chaotic component may be much harder to predict, but at this point it is not known how important it will be."
https://openalex.org/W2146492421,"We have previously reported the identification of four autophosphorylation sites on the KDR VEGF receptor. Two of these sites (tyrosines 951 and 996) are located in the receptor's kinase insert domain, and two (tyrosines 1054 and 1059) are located in the catalytic domain. In order to clarify the functional significance of these sites, we made DNA constructs in which tyrosine codons were replaced with those for phenylalanine, and expressed the DNA constructs in 293 cells. VEGF binding to cells expressing the native receptor led to a rapid increase in receptor and PLCγ phosphorylation, and a slower increase in the phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin. VEGF binding to KDR(Y951F) and KDR(Y996F) expressing cells resulted in phosphorylation of all cellular substrates tested, although the level of PLCγ phosphorylation was decreased for KDR(Y996F). The decreased level of PLCγ phosphorylation was not because PLCγ-containing SH2 domains bind to the Y996 autophosphorylation site. We conclude that there exists receptor autophosphorylation sites not previously identified which allow for signaling via PLCγ, as well as p125FAK and paxillin. VEGF binding to cells expressing KDR mutated at both tyrosine's 1054 and 1059 activated receptor autophosphorylation but at a level which was only 10% of that seen for cells expressing native receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cell signaling proteins was not observed in KDR(Y1054,1059) expressing cells. Utilizing an in vitro assay which directly measures receptor catalytic activity allowed us to determine that the tyrosine kinase activity of the native receptor was significantly greater than that for the double mutant. We conclude from this result that VEGF-induced autophosphorylation at tyrosines 1054 and 1059 is a required step for allowing maximal KDR kinase activity. Maximal rates of receptor kinase activity is required for VEGF-induced receptor internalization, as internalization was delayed in the KDR(Y1054,1059F) expressing cells when compared to cells expressing native receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2144300692,"A photo-assisted electrochemical etching technique to fabricate macropores in single-crystalline gallium phosphide (GaP) with variable porosity has been developed. Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction experiments confirm that the material consists of three-dimensional, interconnected random networks with pore sizes of about 150 nanometers. Optical transmission measurements demonstrate that the nonabsorbing disordered structures strongly scatter light. The photonic strength is controlled by filling the pores with liquids of different refractive indices. Macroporous gallium phosphide filled with air has the highest scattering efficiency for visible light."
https://openalex.org/W2115858886,"Human telomerase is expressed in germ tissues and in the majority of primary tumors. Cell renewal tissues and some pre-cancerous tissues also have weak telomerase activity. Yet, neither the exact location and frequency of telomerase-positive cells nor the changes in telomerase expression during differentiation or carcinogenesis of individual cells are known. This paper reports on the expression of hTERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) protein in tumor and non-tumor colorectal tissues by Western blotting and tissue sections by immuno-histochemistry using antibodies raised against partial peptides of hTERT. Though telomerase activity and hTERT expression at both mRNA and protein levels were generally higher in tumor part than in non-tumor part, these two were not always correlated: expression of hTERT did not always give rise to high telomerase activity. Colonic carcinoma cell nuclei were stained with anti-hTERT antibodies but not with antigen-preabsorbed antibodies. In normal mucosa, hTERT protein was expressed, though weaker than in carcinoma, in all colonic crypt epithelial cells except those at the tip; the expressing-cell distribution was much wider than that of Ki-67 positive cells which were located at the bottom of the crypt. Isolated crypt contained a significant level of hTERT protein revealed by Western blotting, while having very weak telomerase activity. Telomerase activity was detected in epithelial cells only at the bottom half of the crypt. Specific hTERT-staining was positive in tissue lymphocytes but negative in almost all other stromal cells. It is of interest to see whether a significant level of hTERT expression with low telomerase activity is characteristic of physiologically regenerating tissues containing stem cells. In situ detection of the hTERT protein will permit further analysis of cancer diagnosis and stem cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2098105911,"Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (K(ir)), comprising four subunits each with two transmembrane domains, M1 and M2, regulate many important physiological processes. We employed a yeast genetic screen to identify functional channels from libraries of K(ir) 2.1 containing mutagenized M1 or M2 domains. Patterns in the allowed sequences indicate that M1 and M2 are helices. Protein-lipid and protein-water interaction surfaces identified by the patterns were verified by sequence minimization experiments. Second-site suppressor analyses of helix packing indicate that the M2 pore-lining inner helices are surrounded by the M1 lipid-facing outer helices, arranged such that the M1 helices participate in subunit-subunit interactions. This arrangement is distinctly different from the structure of a bacterial potassium channel with the same topology and identifies helix-packing residues as hallmark sequences common to all K(ir) superfamily members."

https://openalex.org/W2317428842,"The VHL tumor suppressor gene has previously been reported to encode a protein of 213 amino acid residues. Here we report the identification of a second major VHL gene product with an apparent molecular weight of 18 kD, pVHL18, which appears to arise from alternate translation initiation at a second AUG codon (codon 54) within the VHL open reading frame. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the internal codon in the VHL mRNA is necessary and sufficient for production of pVHL18. pVHL18 can bind to elongin B, elongin C, and Hs-CUL2. When reintroduced into renal carcinoma cells that lack a wild-type VHL allele, pVHL18 suppresses basal levels of VEGF expression, restores hypoxia-inducibility of VEGF expression, and inhibits tumor formation in nude mice. These data strongly support the existence of two distinct VHL gene products in VHL tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1559562147,"We have genetically modified filamentous bacteriophage to deliver genes to mammalian cells. In previous studies we showed that noncovalently attached fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) can target bacteriophage to COS-1 cells, resulting in receptor-mediated transduction with a reporter gene. Thus, bacteriophage, which normally lack tropism for mammalian cells, can be adapted for mammalian cell gene transfer. To determine the potential of using phage-mediated gene transfer as a novel display phage screening strategy, we transfected COS-1 cells with phage that were engineered to display FGF2 on their surface coat as a fusion to the minor coat protein, pIII. Immunoblot and ELISA analysis confirmed the presence of FGF2 on the phage coat. Significant transduction was obtained in COS-1 cells with the targeted FGF2-phage compared with the nontargeted parent phage. Specificity was demonstrated by successful inhibition of transduction in the presence of excess free FGF2. Having demonstrated mammalian cell transduction by phage displaying a known gene targeting ligand, it is now feasible to apply phage-mediated transduction as a screen for discovering novel ligands."

The simplest interpretation of the orientation, crystallography, and microstructures of the lamellae and the phase relationships in this system is that the lamellae originally exsolved as the high-pressure C-centered form of clinoenstatite.

In this approach, a metal of interest such as silver is co-deposited with a reversibly deposited mediator metal. The mediator is periodically deposited and stripped from the surface, and this serves to significantly increase the density of two-dimensional islands of silver atoms, promoting a layer-by-layer thin-film growth mode. In situ scanning tunneling microscopy was used to demonstrate the growth process for the heteroepitaxial system silver/gold (111) with either lead or copper as the mediator."
https://openalex.org/W2171577510,"The coalescence of a neutron star and a black hole in a binary system is believed to form a torus around a Kerr black hole. A similarly shaped magnetosphere then results from the remnant magnetic field of the neutron star. In the strong-field case, it contains a cavity for plasma waves located between the barrier of the gravitational potential and the surrounding torus. This cavity may be unstable to superradiance of electromagnetic waves. Superradiant amplification of such waves, initially excited by turbulence in the torus, should inflate into a bubble in a time as short as ∼0.75 (1 percent/|ε| 2 )( M /7 M ⊙ ) seconds ∼0.15 to 1.5 seconds, assuming an efficiency |ε| 2 = 0.5 to 5 percent and a mass M = 7 M ⊙ .

https://openalex.org/W1571756799,"Levamisole is commonly used to treat nematode parasite infections but therapy is limited by resistance. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of resistance to this selective nicotinic drug. Levamisole receptor channel currents in muscle patches from levamisole-sensitive and levamisole-resistant isolates of the parasitic nematode Oesophagostomum dentatum were compared. The number of channels present in patches of sensitive and resistant isolates was similar at 10 µM levamisole, but at 30 µM and 100 µM the resistant isolate contained fewer active patches, suggesting desensitization. Mean Po and open times were reduced in resistant isolates. The distribution of conductances of channels in the sensitive isolate revealed a heterogeneous receptor population and the presence of G25, G35, G40, and G45 subtypes. A G35 subtype was missing in the resistant isolate. Resistance to levamisole was produced by changes in the averaged properties of the levamisole receptor population, with some receptors from sensitive and resistant isolates having indistinguishable characteristics.—Robertson, A.

https://openalex.org/W2321494333,"We have recently isolated two novel actin filament-binding proteins, l-afadin and neurabin-II and shown that they are localized at cell – cell adherens junction (AJ) in epithelial cells. We found here that l-afadin, neurabin-II, ZO-1, and E-cadherin showed similar and different behavior during the formation and destruction of cell – cell AJ in MDCK cells. In MDCK cells, the accumulation of both l-afadin and E-cadherin, but not that of ZO-1, changed in parallel depending on Rac small G protein activity. Dissociation of MDCK cells by culturing the cells at 2 μM Ca2+ caused rapid endocytosis of E-cadherin, but not that of l-afadin or ZO-1. Addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to these dissociated cells formed a tight junction-like structure where ZO-1 and l-afadin, but not neurabin-II or E-cadherin, accumulated. We furthermore found that, in non-epithelial EL cells, which expressed E-cadherin and attached to each other, l-afadin, neurabin-II, ZO-1 and E-cadherin were all localized at AJ. In cadherin-deficient L cells, l-afadin was mainly localized at cell – cell contact sites, but ZO-1 was mainly localized at the tip area of cell processes. Neurabin-II did not accumulate at the plasma membrane area. Neither l-afadin nor neurabin-II significantly interacted with α-, β-catenin, E-cadherin, ZO-1 or occludin."
https://openalex.org/W1920702389,"Ischemia and denervation of EDL muscle of adult rat induce a large central zone of degeneration surrounded by a thin zone of peripheral surviving muscle fibers. Muscle regeneration is a complex phenomenon in which many agents interact, such as growth factors and heparan sulfate components of the extracellular matrix. We have shown that synthetic polymers, called RGTA (as regenerating agents), which imitate the heparan sulfates, are able to stimulate tissue repair when applied at the site of injury. In crushed muscles, RGTA were found to accelerate both regeneration and reinnervation. In vitro, RGTA act as protectors and potentiators of various heparin binding growth factors (HBGF). It was postulated that in vivo their tissue repair properties were due in part to an increase of bioavailability of endogenously released HBGF. In the present work, we show that ischemic and denervated EDL muscle treated by a unique injection of RGTA differs from the control after 1 wk in several aspects: 1) the epimysial postinflammatory reaction is inhibited and the area of fibrotic tissue among fibers is reduced; 2) the peripheral zone, as measured by the number of intact muscle fibers, was increased by more than twofold; and 3) In the central zone, RGTA enhances the regeneration of the muscle fibers as well as muscle revascularization. These results suggest that RGTA both protects muscle fibers from degeneration and preserves the differentiated state of the surviving fibers. For the first time it is demonstrated that a functionalized polymeric compound can prevent some of the damage resulting from muscle ischemia. RGTA may therefore open a new therapeutic approach for muscle fibrosis and other postischemic muscle pathologies.—Desgranges, P., Barbaud, C., Caruelle, J.-P., Barritaoult, D., Gautron, J.

https://openalex.org/W2323812734,"The hypothesis that p53 deficiency enhances the survival of DNA-damage bearing cells was investigated in wild-type and p53 mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells. Following UV-C irradiation, p53 is rapidly induced in wild-type cells and p53-dependent apoptosis follows within 8 h, resulting in the death of the majority of cells within 36 h. Increasing doses of UV-irradiation resulted in enhanced clonogenic survival of null cells as compared to wild-type. Amongst surviving clones, the Hprt mutation frequency was found to be dependent upon UV dose and influenced by p53 status. Treatment with ionizing radiation led to enhanced expression of p53 but resulted in little induction of apoptosis irrespective of p53 status. However, clonogenic potential was considerably reduced, particularly in wild-type cells which showed a tenfold lower survival than null cells. In contrast to the effects of UV-irradiation, the incidence of Hprt mutation did not differ significantly between wild-type and p53 null survivors. The data confirm that p53 restricts the numbers of cells bearing mutations that survive DNA damage induced by either agent, albeit by different mechanisms."

Extracts from human cardiac tissue from transplant recipients were fractionated by size exclusion-, affinity-, anion exchange- and reversed-phase chromatography. MALDI-MS analysis of two absorbing fractions revealed molecular masses of 676.2 Da and 756.0 Da. The UV spectra of both fractions were identical to that of adenosine. Postsource decay MALDI mass spectrometry indicated that the molecules with a mass of 676.2 Da and 757.0 Da contained AMP and ATP, respectively. As shown by enzymatic cleavage, both molecules consist of two adenosines interconnected by either two or three phosphates in 5′-positions of the riboses. Two substances can be identified as 5′,5‴-P1,P2-diphosphate (Ap2A) and 5′,5‴-P1,P3-triphosphate (Ap3A). Ap2A and Ap3A, together with ATP and ADP, are stored in myocardial-specific granules in biologically active concentrations. In the isolated perfused rat heart, Ap2A and Ap3A caused dose-dependent coronary vasodilations. In myocardial preparations, Ap2A and Ap3A attenuated the effect of isoproterenol, exerting a negative inotropic effect. The calcium current of guinea pig ventricular myocytes, stimulated by isoproterenol, was also attenuated by Ap2A and Ap3A.

The exogenous chromosome was stably propagated in the recipient cells based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses with a chromosome 6 painting probe. The tumorigenicity of HEY and SKOV-3 cells was completely suppressed after transfer of chromosome 6, but not after transfer of a chromosome 11q13-qter fragment used as control. Using 46 polymorphic microsatellite markers, the region bounded by D6S1649 and D6S1564 was found to be commonly deleted in HEY: chromosome 6 tumorigenic revertant clones. The boundaries of the commonly deleted region could be further narrowed down to a 2 cM (based on the Whitehead genetic map) or 0.36 megabase (based on gdb mapping data) region between D6S1637 and D6S1564 after transferring the exogenous chromosome from revertants into mouse L cells and performing allelic deletion mapping studies against this mouse background. We conclude that this region contains a tumor suppressor gene important for the control of ovarian tumor development."

https://openalex.org/W2321007082,"Loss of constitutive heterozygosity at 11q23 has been detected in various human solid tumors. Here, we described the analysis of a series of normal and tumor pairs from 110 breast carcinomas for the presence of loss of heterozygosity at 11q23 loci. The overall frequency of LOH was 48%, confirming the importance of deletions at 11q23 in breast tumorigenesis. Previously, we have identified two independent regions of LOH at 11q23, the LOH region 1 at 11q23.1 and the LOH region 2 at 11q23.3. The most telomeric region was recently refined between loci D11S1345 and D11S1316, a region of about 1 Mb. However, the LOH region 1, most centromeric, was still not finely refined: the boundaries were defined by loci D11S2000 and D11S897, separated by about 8 Mb. Here, we refined its boundaries between loci D11S1347 and D11S927, a region of about 2 Mb. We have mapped 11 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) within this region and excluded another 20. This study represents a further step toward the identification of the putative tumor suppressor gene found within the LOH region 1 at 11q23.1."

https://openalex.org/W2314474185,"The α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G13 regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis in different cell types. Expression of the constitutively activated mutant of Gα13 (Gα13QL) increases the expression of Egr-1, an immediate-early response gene that is identified to be involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here we report that Gα13QL activates the promoter of Egr-1 through specific sequence which includes the characteristic CArG boxes. We also demonstrate that the Gα13QL activation of Egr-1 promoter is mediated by the Ras-like small GTPase Rho."
