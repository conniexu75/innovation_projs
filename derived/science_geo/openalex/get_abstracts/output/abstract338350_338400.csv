https://openalex.org/W2071341586,Concerned scientists recently signed a World Scientists Warning to Humanity that advocates policies necessary to change a collision course with the natural world that human activities are engendering. The document calls for an end to population growth and poverty and it predicts conflicts over increasingly scarce resources. A second environmental science is needed that focuses on human-environment interactions by analyzing: 1) forces behind those human activities that are major contributors to environmental degradation 2) how environmental degradation affects human well-being and 3) the most effective interventions for changing environmentally destructive activities. The US releases almost 30 times as much carbon dioxide per capita as India; 1 years natural population increase in the US (1.3 million) adds about twice as much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere as 1 years natural increase in India (18 million). Basic as well as applied research is proceeding on human-environment interaction with significant progress made in understanding how people perceive environmental risks; how we manage common-property resources such as fisheries grasslands and the atmosphere; what brought about anthropogenic environmental changes in the past; public concern about the environment; and the economic forces affecting natural resource availability. The scientific study of human-environmental interactions can advance human knowledge correct misconceptions and inform vital policy decisions. The National Research Councils recommendations for global change research are appropriate for other areas of human-environmental science. Such a program could attack the intertwined problems of training careers institution and community building and the development of a basic human-environmental science and could induce universities to become actively involved.

https://openalex.org/W1985303136,Despite a decade of intense international attention to the problem of deforestation 17 million hectares of forest in Central and South America Asia and Africa are vanishing each year up from 11.4 million hectares a year in 1980 according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Over the next 30 years human population in the tropics is expected to double which will undoubtedly put the forests under even greater pressure. One approach is to set aside tracts of forest as extractive reserves from which area residents can harvest nontimber goods such as latex nuts fibers and medicines. Conservationists began extolling extractive reserves as the solution to deforestation arguing that a hectare of Amazonian rain forest was worth nearly 13 times more as an extractive reserve than as a source of timber. Carefully preplanning a logging operation can slash damage to the residual area by 50%. Preplanned logging may also help the forest regrow. The key is to leave the surrounding forest undamaged so that it can reseed the cleared area. That is the goal of another sustainable logging technique known as strip clearcutting which has succeeded in the Palcazu valley of eastern Peru. The Palcazu program has succeeded in large part because the timber concession there is run by nearby villagers. Most conservationists consider land rights to be critical to forest preservation a finding supported by a recent report of the US National Academy of Sciences Committee on Sustainable Agriculture and the Environment in the Humid Tropics. In the majority of situations where a central government controls the timber rights forests are overlogged because central governments only take a short term view of how to generate cash and jobs immediately. If the benefits of forests continue to elude the local people the worlds tropical forests are unlikely to survive the next couple of decades.

https://openalex.org/W2070706006,"David E. Bloom and David Canning's Policy Forum “The health and wealth of nations” (18 Feb., p. [1207][1]) does a commendable job of characterizing the feedback loop connecting positive public health outcomes and economic growth. The authors, however, do not include a critical component of this loop that has, all too often, been underfunded or excluded from primary healthcare clinics: reproductive health services including family planning.

More than half of Bloom and Canning's Policy Forum is devoted to aspects of productivity growth that researchers have determined to be related to declining fertility and managed birth spacing. Among these reproduction-related economic benefits are the accumulation of savings, improved maternal and child health, and the benefits of elevated ratios of working-age adults to dependent children (the “demographic dividend”). The authors appear to credit antibiotics and improved sanitation for paving the way for the East Asian economic “miracle,” although these were not unusual interventions in developing countries during the second half of the 20th century. Yet they do not mention a more distinctive and relevant intervention: the unparalleled mobilization of and the millions of dollars of investment in voluntary family planning services that occurred in these countries in the late 1960s and 1970s ([1][2], [2][3]). Much of this investment was assisted by foreign aid programs in the United States and other industrialized-country governments.

Few policymakers would object to improving sanitation, water treatment, or vaccination. Reproductive health programs, despite their importance to reducing maternal mortality and slowing both population growth and the onslaught of HIV/AIDS, still face religious and political opposition in many countries, including the United States. During every budget cycle, some members of Congress attempt to eliminate U.S. assistance to international family planning programs. Congress has cut this program's budget by 35% from 1994 levels, in the face of increasing worldwide demand for such assistance.

The population of women and men of reproductive age is growing rapidly, and higher proportions of this population seek reproductive health services. Scientific evidence of these programs' contribution to economic development is mounting, but the political will needed to maintain them is fragile and now waning. It is critical that demographers and economists give family planning and reproductive health programs the credit they deserve when discussing the connections between the health and wealth of nations.

# Response {#article-title-2}

Coen and Cincotta are right to emphasize the important role of family planning programs in the demographic transition. We are well aware of its importance and noted so in our Policy Forum (indeed, one of us was a principal author of the “Emerging Asia” report Coen and Cincotta cite in support of their argument). But we believe that general health deserves more emphasis than reproductive health and family planning, because it was the trigger mechanism that set off cumulative economic development; family planning entered the picture at a later stage of development, when desired fertility began to decrease. For example, desired and actual fertility in Africa are generally close in magnitude, so the availability of contraceptives is not at present the decisive issue. Later in the development process, however, family planning does become crucial, as it was in the East Asia “miracle” and is now in South Asia.

Such tool use is self-directed ([2][2]), as well as done socially when one individual ape performs elementary dentistry on another ([3][3]).
