https://openalex.org/W2009344005,"A NEW alkaloid has been isolated by us in the crystalline form from the leaves of Adhatoda vasica Nees (Indian Patent No. 62349 of November 21, 1957. Patent application No. 64603 of July 9, 1958). The alkaloid, which has been named vasicinone, has been found to be a much weaker base than vasicine, an alkaloid which is already known to be present in this plant. Elementary analysis gave, C = 65.33, H = 4.93, N = 13.65 per cent. The molecular weight (Rast) was found to be about 210 and the molecular formula C11H10N2O2. The alkaloid was found to be identical with 2,3-(α-hydroxytrimethylene)-4 quinazolone which had been prepared earlier by the oxidation of vasicine with 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide1,2."

A difference first at approximately 12 years of age. While females show a continuous decrease in potassium concentration, males show a rapid increase between the ages of 14 and 16. During adult life both sexes show a persistent and parallel decrease, which may be related to physiologic aging."

The method minimizes metabolic shock and provides a culture in which an easily reproducible initial state is established at a known time."

In particular, the class of compounds obtained by the condensation of rhodanine (I) or a 3-substituted congener with carbonylic compounds may be conviently used for the investigation of the interrelationships of chemical structure and fungicidal activity."

https://openalex.org/W1995273856,"IN studies with rachitic rats Harrison and Harrison1 established aminoaciduria as one of the signs of maleic acid intoxication. Angielski et al.2 produced, by intraperitoneal administration of maleic acid, aminoaciduria in rats receiving a diet containing 50 per cent skim milk. We have studied the effect of dietary lactose on the production of aminoaciduria by maleic acid. Three groups of rats received the three diets described in Table 1."

Cape and Kitchin1, and Poole2 reported that the enamel organic matrix is without intrinsic birefringence. Keil3 and Schmidt4 reported a weak positive intrinsic birefringence–the sign being described with respect to the long axis of the enamel prisms. Rushton5 stated that this positive birefringence is strong, in fact stronger than the negative intrinsic birefringence of the mineral matter present in the mature tissue."
