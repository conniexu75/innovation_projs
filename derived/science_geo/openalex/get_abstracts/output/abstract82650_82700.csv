https://openalex.org/W1553513611,"The binding and internalization of 125I-epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) was studied in cultures of BALB 3T3 cells using a novel method that involved removal of cell-surface hormone by treatment with acetic acid under conditions that did not remove internalized hormone. In control cultures, 125I-EGF initially bound to its receptor on the plasma membrane and then was rapidly internalized. After 30 min, only 15% of the cell-bound hormone remained on the surface. In contrast, cultures treated with dansylcadaverine retained 82% of the cell-bound hormone on the cell surface. We propose that dansylcadaverine inhibits EGF internalization by preventing it from clustering in clathrin-coated pits."

The sarc region (1.2 to 1.3 kb) of the 15.0-kb cell fragment is indistinguishable from the src region of two isolates of MSV as judged by heteroduplex and restriction endonuclease analyses. The cellular sequences flanking sarc show no homology to other MSV sequences. Whereas cloned subgenomic portions of MSV that contain src transformed NIH-3T3 cells in vitro, the cloned sarc fragment is inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1600119213,"The binding of cholecystokinin (CCK) to its receptors on isolated rat pancreatic acini was investigated employing high specific activity, radioiodinated CCK (125I-BH-CCK), prepared by the conjugation of 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (125I-BH) to CCK. Binding was specific, time-dependent, reversible, and linearly related to the acinar protein concentration. After incubation for 30 min at 37 degrees C, the 125I-BH-CCK both in the incubation medium and bound to acini remained intact, as judged by gel filtration and trichloroacetic acid precipitation studies. Scatchard analysis was compatible with two classes of binding sites on acini: a very high affinity site (Kd, 64 pM) and a lower affinity site (Kd, 21 nM). 125I-BH-CCK binding to acini was competitively inhibited by CCK and four of its analogues in proportion to their biological potencies but not by unrelated hormones. Stimulation of amylase secretion by CCK and inhibition of 125I-BH-CCK binding by the same analogues carried out under identical conditions revealed a correlation (r = 0.99) between binding potency and amylase secretion. Stimulation of amylase secretion by CCK closely paralleled the occupancy of the high affinity CCK binding sites. It is concluded that the high affinity CCK binding sites most likely are the receptors mediating the stimulation of amylase secretion by CCK."

Variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) purified3 from cloned variants of Trypanosoma brucei have similar molecular weights (about 60,000), but differ in amino acid composition3, N-terminal amino acid sequence4 and C-terminal structure5. We have cloned DNA complementary to the messenger RNAs for four immunologically distinct VSGs6 and hybridised these complementary DNAs (cDNAs) with restriction digests of T. brucei nuclear DNA, fractionated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose strips. Each cDNA recognises a unique set of fragments and this basic set is present unaltered in the nuclear DNAs from the four variants. In addition, each probe recognises an extra fragment only in nuclear DNA isolated from cells expressing the VSG corresponding to the cDNA probe. We infer that activation of a VSG gene involves the production of an expression-linked copy of that gene."

https://openalex.org/W2144760024,"The maturation of rat reticulocytes to erythrocytes is paralleled by a marked loss of adenylate cyclase responsiveness to catecholamines and guanine nucleotides without significant loss of basal enzyme activity. These changes in adenylate cyclase activity are accompanied by a parallel %fold decrease in both the number of p-adrenergic binding sites and the quantity of M, = 42,000 protein substrates for cholera toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation. In addition, the maturation of the rat erythrocyte is accompanied by a loss of the ability of guanine nucleotides to modulate receptoragonist interactions. Thus, whereas guanine nucleotides promote tritiated hydroxybenzylisoproterenol agonist dissociation from the P-adrenergic receptor and reduce the potency of isoproterenol in competing for dihydroalprenolol antagonist binding in rat reticulocyte membranes, these regulatory effects of guanine nucleotides are virtually absent in membranes derived from mature rat erythrocytes. Furthermore, the ability of agonist occupancy of the P-adrenergic receptor of rat reticulocyte membranes to promote an increase in receptor size, as assessed by gel exclusion chromatography of solubilized preparations, is not observed in mature erythrocyte preparations. This agonist-induced increase in apparent receptor size has been previously observed in frog erythrocyte membranes (Limbird, L. E., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1978) Proc. NatZ. Acad. Sei. U. S. A. 75,228-232) and is thought to reflect the formation of a receptor guanine nucleotide regulatory complex. Consistent with this hypothesis is the ability of guanine nucleotides to reverse the formation of this larger molecular size form of the receptor in rat reticulocyte membranes. The inability to promote this receptorguanine nucleotide regulatory protein complex in rat erythrocyte membranes suggests that one molecular concomitant of rat erythrocyte maturation is a decrease in the effectiveness of receptor-guanine nucleotide regulatory protein communication."

This finding supports the hypothesis that an important stimulus to terminal sprouting in partial denervation and presynaptic nerve blockade is a product of inactive muscle fibers.

https://openalex.org/W1550734588,"Abstract Bacteriophage T4 DNA replication proteins have been shown previously to require ribonucleoside triphosphates to initiator new DNA chains on unprimed single-stranded DNA templates in vitro. This DNA synthesis requires a protein controlled by T4 gene 61, as well as the T4 gene 41, 43 (DNA polymerase), 44, 45, and 62 proteins, and is stimulated by the gene 32 (helix-destabilizing) protein. In this paper, the nature of the RNA primers involved in DNA synthesis by the T4 proteins has been determined, using phi X174 and f1 DNA as model templates. The T4 41 and 61 proteins synthesize pentanucleotides with the sequence pppA-C(N)3 where N in positions 3 and 4 can be G, U, C, or A. The same group of sequences is found in the RNA at the 5' terminus of the phi X174 DNA product made by the seven T4 proteins. The DNA product chains begin at multiple discrete positions on the phi X174 DNA template. The characteristics of the T4 41 and 61 protein priming reaction are thus appropriate for a reaction required to initiate the synthesis of discontinuous Okazaki pieces on the lagging strand during the replication of duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1524373157,"CTP-phosphatidic acid cytidylyltransferase (CDP-diglyceride synthetase) is a key enzyme in the biogenesis of membrane phospholipids in Escherichia coli. Using a modification of a previously described autoradiographic screening procedure (Raetz, C. R. H. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 72, 2274-2278), we have isolated six mutant strains in which the specific activity of the synthetase is 1 to 10% that of the wild type, as judged by in vitro assays. The synthesis of dCDP-diglyceride, as well as CDP-diglyceride, is defective in these organisms. The mutations responsible for the enzyme defects (designated cds) all map in the same location near minute 4 on the chromosome. Although none of the mutants obtained are temperature-sensitive for growth, all of them exhibit significantly elevated levels of phosphatidic acid in vivo. The highest increase is observed in the mutant GL60, in which phosphatidic acid constitutes about 5% of the membrane lipid, in contrast to 0.2% in typical wild type strains. The accumulation of phosphatidic acid occurs primarily at the expense of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, but the total lipid-to-protein ratio of GL60 is nearly normal. In vivo labeling of GL60 with 32Pi suggests that the increased phosphatidic acid pool is the result of a partial metabolic block early in the phospholipid pathway, but that most of this expanded pool is nonetheless available for de novo synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1535458425,"Flavokinase (ATP:riboflavin 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.26) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver by affinity chromatography using flavinyl agarose beads (agarose-OCH2CONH(CH2)2NHCO(CH2)/N10-7,8-dimethylisoalloxazine). The specific activity of the pure enzyme is 9,900 units (nmol of FMN formed/h at 37 degrees C)/mg of protein, and reflects a one-step, 7000-fold purification. Flavokinase thus obtained, unlike previous preparations from mammalian sources, is free from contaminating phosphatase and FAD synthase. The purified enzyme rapidly loses activity upon storage but is stabilized by riboflavin and thiol-protecting reagents. The apparent molecular weight, estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is 28,000 +/- 1,000. Flavokinase phosphorylates and/or is inhibited by a large number of riboflavin analogs; however, the physiologically important 8 alpha-(amino acid)riboflavins are poorly accommodated. The strongly preferred phosphate donors are ATP and dATP. Both Zn2+ and Mg2+, as well as several other divalent cations, activate flavokinase, but Zn2+ yields greatest activity (1.8 times that with Mg2+). The pH optimum for activity with either Zn2+ or Mg2+ is approximately 9.3; at pH 7.0, the activity is 40% of that at the pH optimum."

https://openalex.org/W1659616754,"The mechanism of inactivation of rabbit liver phosphorylase phosphatase by glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was investigated. The catalytic subunit of phosphorylase phosphatase was inactivated by GSSG and other disulfides. Inactivation by GSSG was a concentration-dependent process and resulted in the formation of an inactive, stable enzyme species. The inactivated enzyme could be reactivated by addition of various sulfhydryl compounds, including glutathione (GSH). Homogeneous phosphorylase phosphatase contains, per mol of catalytic subunit (Mr = 33,000), two sulfhydryl groups, one of which reacted with GSSG to form inactive enzyme. Binding studies with [glycine-2-3H]GSSG revealed simultaneous incorporation of 3H radioactivity into the catalytic subunit and stoichiometric loss of catalytic activity. Treatment of the 3H-labeled enzyme with GSH was accompanied by release of 3H radioactivity from the enzyme and restoration of enzyme activity. The results suggest that inactivation of phosphorylase phosphatase by GSSG results from the formation of a mixed disulfide between GSSG and one of the two sulfhydryl groups in the catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1492452850,"A Mg2+-induced change of the (Na+ and K+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+)-ATPase) from Electrophorus electricus was investigated by kinetics and fluorescence techniques. Binding of Mg2+ to a low affinity site(s) caused inhibition of (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity, an effect which was antagonized by both Na+ and ATP. Mg2+ also caused inhibition of K+-dependent dephosphorylation of the enzyme without inhibiting either (Na+)-ATPase activity or Na+-dependent phosphorylation. Mg2+ also induced a 5 to 6% enhancement in the fluorescence intensity of enzyme labeled with the fluorescent sulfhydryl reagent, 2-(4-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonate. As in the case of Mg2+ inhibition of activity, the affinity for Mg2+ as an inducing agent for this effect was significantly reduced by both Na+ and ATP, suggesting that the same change was being monitored in both cases. The Mg2+ effect was reduced by both Na+ and ATP, suggesting that the same change was being monitored in both cases. The Mg2+ effect was reduced in magnitude by ouabain and prevented by oligomycin, specific inhibitors of the enzyme. In addition, K+ (and cations that substitute for K+ in supporting activity) induced a 3 to 4% enhancement in fluorescence intensity in the presence of Na+, Mg2+, and ATP, although the K+ and Mg2+ effects appeared to be different on the basis of their excitation spectra. The K+ effect was inhibited by ouabain and occurred with a rate greater than the rate of turnover of the enzyme, permitting its involvement in the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1507064897,"Monolayer cultures of chick embryo tibial chondrocytes incorporate 35SO42- into chondroitin SO4 which is rapidly secreted from the cells into two extracellular pools. Part of the extracellular chondroitin SO4 is recovered in a soluble form in the culture medium, and the remainder is associated with the cell matrix from which it is released by isotonic trypsinization. At 38 degrees C labeled chondroitin SO4 appears in the cell matrix fraction within 5 min after addition of 35SO42- and in the culture medium fraction 15 min after 35SO42- is added. The intracellular pool of labeled chondroitin SO4 reaches a steady state level of 150 to 200 pmol of bound SO4 per 10(6) cells in 60 min, while the cell matrix and medium fractions increase at rates of 3 and 1 nmol of bound SO4 per h per 10(6) cells, respectively. After 4 h of labeling, less than 20% of the newly synthesized cell-associated chondroitin SO4 is in the intracellular fraction. By labeling cells for 15 min at 25 degrees C 80% of the cell-associated chondroitin 35SO4 is obtained in the intracellular fraction. This material is chased without lag into both the cell matrix fraction and the medium fraction. A mixture of NaF and NaCN, both at 30 mM, lowers the cellular ATP level to 15% of normal and blocks secretion of the intracellular chondroitin SO4 into both extracellular fractions. Colchicine at 10(-6) M gives a partial inhibition of both synthesis and secretion of chondroitinSO4. Sucrose density gradient sedimentation analysis of the intracellular chondroitin SO4 and the two extracellular fractions shows that all three fractions contain both a heavy and light proteoglycan fraction. The intracellular light proteoglycan fraction is secreted preferentially into the culture medium where it represents 30% of the total culture medium pool. The ratio of 6-sulfated GalNAc to 4-sulfated GalNAc in the heavy proteochondroitin SO4 fraction is approximately twice that found for the light fraction."

https://openalex.org/W1559466729,"A heat-stable endoribonuclease isolated from chicken liver has been purified to homogeneity as evidenced by the presence of a single protein band upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme can, in limit digests of 5 S rRNA and 5.8 S rRNA, dinstinguish between cytidylic and uridylic acids bonds at a ratio of 61:1 and, therefore, may be useful in RNA sequence analysis. The means by which the enzyme hydrolyzes substrate is unusual in that kinetic data do not support a simple formation and breakdown of an enzyme . substrate complex. Rather, the existence of a second complex, consisting of 2 mol of substrate and one of enzyme, derived from the initial enzyme . substrate complex, is postulated. In common with the other endonucleases, enzyme activity is inhibited by free poly(A) or tracts of the polypurine present at the 3'-terminus of RNA. Reversal of inhibition and restoration of activity may be achieved by the addition of low concentrations of spermidine to reaction mixtures."
https://openalex.org/W1926789107,"The organization of the chicken transferrin gene and its surrounding sequences was determined by a comparison of the restriction map of the cloned structural gene (double-stranded cDNA) with the map of the transferrin gene in genomic DNA. This analysis reveals a complex arrangement of the transferrin gene in which structural sequences are interrupted by a minimum of 6 intervening sequences, and span at least 10 kilobases in genomic DNA. Furthermore, comparison of the DNA from individual chickens of the same breed indicates considerable allelic diversity in the restriction sites for Eco RI, HindIII, and Bam HI. Quantitation of the number of transferrin genes by saturation hybridization confirms that both liver and oviduct DNAs contain only 1 transferrin gene/haploid complement, and, in addition, comparison of the restriction patterns obtained with DNA from these two tissues, as well as erythrocyte DNA, does not reveal any difference in the structural organization of the gene. We conclude that the distinct tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of this gene by steroids and iron levels in the oviduct and liver cannot be explained either by a multiplicity of genes or by somatic reorganization of the gene."

https://openalex.org/W1485026963,"In primary cultures of chick 11-day embryonic tissue a number of phosphodiesterase inhibitors were found to elevate acetylcholine receptor levels. Of these agents, Ro20-1724 was the most effective, elevating surface receptor content by 2-fold after 48 h of treatment. 8-Br-cAMP and cholera toxin, a natural activator of adenylate cyclase, mimicked the effect of Ro20-1724, while 8-Br-cGMP and dibutyryl cGMP had no effect. Cholera toxin, 8-Br-cAMP, and Ro20-1724 all increased the insertion rate of new receptor into the surface membrane without altering degradation. The enhanced insertion appears related to an actual increase in synthesis since total acetylcholine receptor was elevated by exposure to cholera toxin. In contrast, no change in creatine phosphokinase activity, myosin heavy chain content, or [35S] methionine incorporation into total cellular protein was observed during cholera toxin treatment. These results suggest that cAMP plays a role in the regulation of acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2008770132,"A 200-fold inhibition in the titer of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was produced in cultures of Ly cells treated with 30 reference units of interferon per milliliter. Virus particle production, as measured by VSV particle-associated transcriptase, or nucleocapsid protein was inhibited by a maximum of tenfold. The glycoprotein and membrane protein content was reduced in VSV derived from interferon-treated cells. Thus interferon-treated cells may have produced VSV particles with low infectivity, which may be related to the reduced amount of glycoprotein incorporated into such particles. These findings resemble those reported in interferon-treated cells infected with murine leukemia viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2046784104,"Two positional isomers (9 and 11) of trans octadecenoates did not support growth on glucose of an Escherichia coli mutant that requires unsaturated fatty acids. However, the trans fatty acids provided sufficient fluidity to produce much higher cell yields when the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate was raised. The effectiveness of the trans acids rose from 0 to 1 cell per femtomole to 15 to 20 cells per femtomole as the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate was increased. The corresponding cis positional isomers supported high yields (35 to 40 cells per femtomole) independent of supplementation. The enhanced growth with adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate supplementation is not due to an increased uptake and incorporation of the trans isomers relative to the cis isomers, since the 9-trans isomer was incorporated more rapidly than the 9-cis isomer into the membrane phospholipids under all growth conditions and represented 21 +/- 2 mole percent of the acids. The finding that cells growing with trans fatty acid isomers have a higher requirement for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate may indicate that some fatty acids can alter the metabolic regulation normally exerted by the cyclic nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1523721080,"3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiate in culture into cells having the enzymatic and morphological characteristics of adipocytes. Differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in total cellular ganglioside content; the ganglioside level is 1.8 to 2.5-fold higher in undifferentiated than in differentiated cells. Gangliosides GM3 and GD1a constitute a majority of total cell gangliosides in both cell types, while ganglioside GM1, the putative choleragen receptor, constitutes less than 5%. Differentiation results in a 75 to 85% decrease in ganglioside GM1. An inverse correlation exists between the percentage of adipocytes in the cell population and: 1) total ganglioside and ganglioside GM1 content, and 2) surface ganglioside GM1 as estimated by choleragen binding or fluorescent staining of bound choleragen. Nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 control cells do not exhibit changes in total ganglioside, ganglioside GM1, or choleragen binding that are observed with 3T3-L1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514742000,"The virus-specific RNA sequences synthesized in nuclei isolated from adenovirus type 2-infected HeLa cells comprise a fraction of the total RNA similar to that observed with RNA made in vivo. By 16 h after infection, for example, some 25% of the RNA made in isolated nuclei is transcribed from adenoviral DNA. Only 10 to 15% of the adenoviral RNA sequences synthesized in nuclei isolated during the late phase of infection are transcribed by form III RNA polymerase. This RNA, whose synthesis is resistant to 0.5 microgram/ml, but sensitive to 200 microgram/ml of alpha-amanitin, sediments at about 5 S in denaturing sucrose gradients and must, therefore, represent the virus-associated RNAs. The remainder of the sequences are transcribed by form II RNA polymerase and sediment as several RNA species in denaturing sucrose gradients. The largest of these exhibits the size, 55 to 60 S, expected of a complete transcript of the major, adenoviral transcriptional unit expressed during the late phase. Hybridization of RNA 32P-labeled in nuclei isolated during the late phase of infection to restriction endonuclease fragments of adenoviral DNA immobilized on nitrocellulose filters suggests that sequences of this transcriptional unit are indeed transcribed in vitro. To make a detailed assessment of the fidelity of transcription in isolated nuclei, transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 5-mercuricytidine 5'-triphosphate and the RNA mercurated in vitro separated from endogenous RNA by chromatography on sulfhydryl-agarose columns by a stringent procedure. After demercuration, RNA made in nuclei isolated 20 h following adenovirus type 2 infection was hybridized to the separated strands of restriction endonuclease fragments of 32P-labeled adenovirus type 2 DNA. Such RNA is complementary to the r strand of adenoviral DNA from 16.6 units to a point to the right of 98.3 units. These sequences comprise the major transcriptional unit expressed during the late phase (Fig. 1). It is therefore clear that the fidelity of transcription of adenoviral DNA by form II RNA polymerase is preserved in isolated nuclei. Two 1-strand transcriptional units, those of the IVa2 and ts36 genes (see Fig. 1) are also active at 20 h after infection. The results of similar analysis of RNA made in nuclei isolated 4 and 12 h after infection are also presented and discussed in terms of the mapping of individual transcriptional units within the type 2 adenoviral genome and the temporal regulation of adenoviral gene expression during productive infection."
https://openalex.org/W1655238397,"Respiration by mitochondrial preparations from hepatopancreas tissue of the land snail Helix aspersa is stimulated by D-mannitol. The rate of mannitol-stimulated respiration is approximately one-half that given by succinate, the most effective substrate thus far tested with these preparations. Mannitol-stimulated respiration is cyanide-insensitive but is not inhibited by salicylhydroxamate. The product of the membrane-bound mannitol-oxidizing activity was shown to be D-mannose by thin layer chromatography, high voltage electrophoresis of the germanate and borate complexes, gas chromatography of the trimethylsilyl derivative, low resolution mass spectrometry of the trimethylsilyl derivative, and by an enzymatic method dependent upon phosphomannose isomerase. The reaction mannitol + O2 leads to mannose is stoichiometric; however, it is not known whether O2 is the immediate electron acceptor. The activity in Helix mitochondria is thus unique among most alditol-oxidizing enzymes in not being pyridine nucleotide linked and in acting on carbon 1 rather than carbon 2."

The glycoprotein and viral RNA remained in the aqueous phase. After dialysis and addition of Triton X100, the glycoprotein was separated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAJGagarose in the presence of a NaCl gradient with detergent. Isoelectric focusing of the glycoprotein revealed substantial charge heterogeneity, with neuraminidase treatment resulting in a shift toward higher PI values. Determination of the hydrodynamic volumes in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate or guanidine hydrochloride yielded apparent Mr values of 50,000 and 43,000, respectively, suggesting a contribution of the heterosaccharide to the conformation of the protein in different solvents. The lipophilic nature of the glycoprotein was manifested by the binding of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, 0.4 mg/mg of protein. The lack of detectable NHz-terminal group indicates a possible blocked NH2 terminal group. Cyanogen bromide cleavage yielded 5 methionine residues/mol, as determined from the number of fragments. From the amino acid composition and the number of methionine r sidues, an M, of 36,600 was assigned to the polypeptide chain. This M, satisfies the requirements of the accepted model for avian oncornavirus glycoprotein processing. The uneven distribution of carbohydrate between the different cleavage products, coupled with the lipophilic properties of the protein, indicates its possible amphipathic nature."
