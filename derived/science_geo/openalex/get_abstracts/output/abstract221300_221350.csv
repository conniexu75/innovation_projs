https://openalex.org/W2149291473,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which function as regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes, are processed from larger transcripts by sequential action of nuclear and cytoplasmic ribonuclease III–like endonucleases. We show that Exportin-5 (Exp5) mediates efficient nuclear export of short miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and that its depletion by RNA interference results in reduced miRNA levels. Exp5 binds correctly processed pre-miRNAs directly and specifically, in a Ran guanosine triphosphate–dependent manner, but interacts only weakly with extended pre-miRNAs that yield incorrect miRNAs when processed by Dicer in vitro. Thus, Exp5 is key to miRNA biogenesis and may help coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic processing steps."
https://openalex.org/W1992949513,"The cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) drives self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by activating the transcription factor STAT3. In serum-free cultures, however, LIF is insufficient to block neural differentiation and maintain pluripotency. Here, we report that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act in combination with LIF to sustain self-renewal and preserve multilineage differentiation, chimera colonization, and germline transmission properties. ES cells can be propagated from single cells and derived de novo without serum or feeders using LIF plus BMP. The critical contribution of BMP is to induce expression of Id genes via the Smad pathway. Forced expression of Id liberates ES cells from BMP or serum dependence and allows self-renewal in LIF alone. Upon LIF withdrawal, Id-expressing ES cells differentiate but do not give rise to neural lineages. We conclude that blockade of lineage-specific transcription factors by Id proteins enables the self-renewal response to LIF/STAT3."
https://openalex.org/W2023939486,"Sweet and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate) are the main attractive taste modalities in humans. T1Rs are candidate mammalian taste receptors that combine to assemble two heteromeric G-protein-coupled receptor complexes: T1R1+3, an umami sensor, and T1R2+3, a sweet receptor. We now report the behavioral and physiological characterization of T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 knockout mice. We demonstrate that sweet and umami taste are strictly dependent on T1R-receptors, and show that selective elimination of T1R-subunits differentially abolishes detection and perception of these two taste modalities. To examine the basis of sweet tastant recognition and coding, we engineered animals expressing either the human T1R2-receptor (hT1R2), or a modified opioid-receptor (RASSL) in sweet cells. Expression of hT1R2 in mice generates animals with humanized sweet taste preferences, while expression of RASSL drives strong attraction to a synthetic opiate, demonstrating that sweet cells trigger dedicated behavioral outputs, but their tastant selectivity is determined by the nature of the receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2167845627,"Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) is known to be an endogenous ligand of cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors. Its congeners (collectively referred to as N-acylethanolamines) also show a variety of biological activities. These compounds are principally formed from their corresponding N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines by a phosphodiesterase of the phospholipase D-type in animal tissues. We purified the enzyme from rat heart, and by the use of the sequences of its internal peptides cloned its complementary DNAs from mouse, rat, and human. The deduced amino acid sequences were composed of 393–396 residues, and showed that the enzyme has no homology with the known phospholipase D enzymes but is classified as a member of the zinc metallohydrolase family of the β-lactamase fold. As was overexpressed in COS-7 cells, the recombinant enzyme generated anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines from their corresponding N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines at comparable rates. In contrast, the enzyme was inactive with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Assays of the enzyme activity and the messenger RNA and protein levels revealed its wide distribution in murine organs with higher contents in the brain, kidney, and testis. These results confirm that a specific phospholipase D is responsible for the generation of N-acylethanolamines including anandamide, strongly suggesting the physiological importance of lipid molecules of this class.

Furthermore, N-stearoylethanolamine was reported recently to show pro-apoptotic activity (11Maccarrone M. Pauselli R. Di Rienzo M. Finazzi-Agro A. Biochem.

In this article, we refer to the latter enzyme as NAPE-hydrolyzing PLD (NAPE-PLD).Catalytic properties of NAPE-PLD have been reported by the use of crude preparations and partially purified enzymes (13Ueda N.

Here we report molecular cloning and expression of the mammalian NAPE-PLD. Our results confirm that the enzyme is structurally and catalytically distinguishable from all the known enzymes including PLDs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[1-14C]Palmitic acid was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), [1-14C]arachidonic acid, [1-14C]oleic acid, [1-14C]stearic acid, HiTrap SP HP, HiTrap Q, HiTrap Blue, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG, Hybond P, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) were from Amersham Biosciences.

Human megakaryoblastic leukemia cells (CMK cells) were kindly provided by Dr. Eiji Shimizu of the Third Department of Internal Medicine, Tottori University School of Medicine, with the consent of Dr. Takeyuki Sato of Chiba University. N-[14C]Acyl-PEs were prepared from their corresponding 1-14C-labeled fatty acids and 1,2-dioleoyl-PE, and N-palmitoyl-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PE was from 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PE and palmitic acid according to the method of Schmid et al. (16Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Natarajan V. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9302-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-[14C]Acyl-lyso-PEs were prepared from their corresponding N-[14C]acyl-PEs using pancreatic phospholipase A2, and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidic acid was from 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PC using Streptomyces sp. PLD. The products were purified by TLC with a mixture of chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (80:20:2, v/v).Enzyme Purification—One hundred and fifty adult Wistar ST rats (SLC, Japan) were anesthetized with diethyl ether and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Hearts were removed, cut into small pieces, and then homogenized in 5 times the volume (v/w) of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.32 m sucrose by a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 55 min, and the resultant pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). After freezing and thawing, the sample was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 55 min. The pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside and centrifuged again at 105,000 × g for 55 min. The resultant clear supernatant was frozen at –80 °C. After thawing slowly at 4 °C, the sample (50 mg of protein) was loaded on a HiTrap SP HP cation-exchange column (bed volume, 5 ml) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) CHAPS (buffer A). After washing the column with 20 ml of buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with 28 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. Active fractions (11 mg of protein) were diluted 3-fold (v/v) with buffer A and then loaded on a HiTrap Q anion-exchange column (1 ml). After washing the column with 5 ml of 50 mm NaCl and 10 ml of 200 mm NaCl, the enzyme was eluted with 4 ml of 300 mm NaCl. Active fractions were diluted 3-fold with buffer A and loaded on a HiTrap Blue affinity column (1 ml). After washing the column with 5 ml of 50 mm NaCl and 5 ml of 200 mm NaCl, the enzyme was eluted with 6 ml of 500 mm NaCl. Active fractions were finally applied onto a Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column (1 ml). After washing the column with 5 ml of buffer A and 3 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, the enzyme was eluted with 6 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. When the particulate fractions of rat heart were stored at –80 °C for 1 month, 4 °C for 1 week, 4 °C for 24 h, or 25 °C for 3 h, the enzyme activity was lost by 8, 86, 45, or 25%, respectively. By the same treatment, the enzyme activity of the octyl glucoside-solubilized proteins was lost by 9, 78, 50, or 26%, respectively.Microsequencing and Bioinformatics—To isolate internal peptides from the purified rat heart NAPE-PLD, active fractions from the hydroxyapatite column were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Band A stained with Coomassie (Fig. 1) was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion using trypsin. The digest mixture was separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a TSKgel ODS-80Ts column (2.0 × 250 mm, TOSOH) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The mobile phase used was a 0–90% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and fractions were collected every 1 min. Selected peptide peaks were subjected to microsequencing with a Procise 494 cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). By this method, the sequences of five peptides were determined. By the use of data base, the three peptide sequences (KLHDEEIQELQA, LHDEEIQELQAQ, and LLAELEQLK) were found to be contained in rat vimentin, and the other two sequences (ELPVLKPY(F/V)VSD and YGLKSEDFFILK) were found to be contained in a single cDNA clone of mouse (GenBank™ accession number, XM144214), which was assumed to be NAPE-PLD (see “Results”). The BLAST program, non-redundant data bases, and EST data bases in GenBank™ were searched for rat and human homologous sequences of the mouse cDNA (XM144214). As the result, one rat putative slug protein (XP231294), two rat EST sequences (AI013914 and CB773576), two human putative slug proteins (XP168636 and XP168592), and seven human EST sequences (AI857635, AL564333, AW293283, BG977438, BQ224588, BU507368, and BX411424) were found to be highly homologous to the mouse cDNA at the protein level.cDNA Cloning—The mouse, rat, and human cDNAs containing the putative full-length coding region of NAPE-PLD were generated by PCR using the forward primers 5′-GGATCCATGGATGAGTATGAGGACAGCCAG-3′ (mouse), 5′-GGTACCATGGATGAAAATGAGAACAGCCAG-3′ (rat), and 5′-ATGGATGAAAATGAAAGCAACCAG-3′ (human) and the reverse primers 5′-CTCGAGTCATGTTTCTTCAAAAGCTCTATC-3′ (mouse), 5′-GCGGCCGCTCATGTTTCCTCAAAGGCTTTGTC-3′ (rat), and 5′-TTAAAAGTTTTCATCATCATTATT-3′ (human). These primers were designed on the basis of the abovementioned cDNA sequences (XM144214 and its homologous sequences of rat and human). cDNAs used as templates of PCR were synthesized from total RNA (5 μg) of mouse brain, rat brain, and human megakaryoblastic leukemia cells (CMK cells) by the use of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase and the Superscript first-strand synthesis system, respectively. PCR amplification was performed at a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s followed by annealing at 58 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles). The full-length cDNA was subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector, and sequencing of the inserts was performed with the aid of an ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Expression of NAPE-PLD in COS-7 Cells—The 1.2-kb NAPE-PLD cDNAs were ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+). COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C to 70% confluency in a 100-mm dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. The cells were then treated with 8 μg of NAPE-PLD-pcDNA3.1(+) and LipofectAMINE, and cultured at 37 °C for 48 h, with one change of medium at 12 h. The harvested cells were sonicated 3 times each for 3 s in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and used as homogenates. Control COS-7 cells were prepared in the same way, except that the insert-free pcDNA3.1(+) vector was used for transfection. The homogenates were centrifuged at 105,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the obtained pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside, followed by further centrifugation at 105,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The resultant clear supernatant was referred to as the octyl glucoside-solubilized proteins.Enzyme Assay—NAPE-PLD was incubated with 100 μmN-[14C]acyl-PE or N-[14C]acyl-lyso-PE (10,000 cpm in 5 μl of ethanol) in 100 μlof50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 10 min. An activator (0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, or 10 mm CaCl2) was also contained in the reaction mixture. A mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v, 0.3 ml) was added to the reaction mixture to terminate the reaction. After centrifugation, 100 μl of the lower layer was spotted on a silica gel thin layer plate (10 cm height) and developed in chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (80:20:2, v/v) at 4 °C for 20 min. Distribution of radioactivity on the plate was quantified by a BAS1500 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan).Preparation of Anti-NAPE-PLD Antiserum—Rabbit antiserum was raised against a hexahistidine-tagged mouse NAPE-PLD protein. A mouse NAPE-PLD cDNA lacking stop codon was generated by PCR using a forward primer 5′-GGATCCGATGGATGAGTATGAGGACCAG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGTGTTTCTTCAAAAGCTCTATCATC-3′. This cDNA was ligated into a prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHis2B to generate a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged NAPE-PLD protein. The construct was confirmed by sequencing in both directions and was introduced chemically into competent E. coli TOP10 F′ cells as host. Cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.6–0.7, allowed to grow at 37 °C for 5 h, and pelleted at 2,000 × g for 30 min. After freezing and thawing, the cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl (buffer B) and were sonicated on ice 10 times each for 20 s at a high intensity with a 1-min cooling period between each burst. The cell homogenates were then treated with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min and were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was suspended in buffer B containing 0.3% SDS and centrifuged again at 105,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant clear supernatant was diluted 3-fold with buffer B and was applied onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (2 ml of bed volume). After washing the column with 20 ml of buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole and 0.05% Triton X-100, the enzyme was eluted with 9 ml of buffer B containing 100 mm imidazole and 0.05% Triton X-100. Purification of the recombinant protein with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa was monitored by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie and by Western blotting with anti-hexahistidine antibody (1:10,000 dilution).The purified NAPE-PLD (0.4–0.5 mg protein in 0.75 ml) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant, and the emulsion was injected subcutaneously at multiple sites along the back of a New Zealand White rabbit (SLC, Japan) every 2 weeks 4 times in total. The animal was bled 7 days after the final injection, and the serum fraction was prepared. The antiserum was titrated by Western blotting.Western Blotting—After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred to a hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P). The membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk (buffer C) and then incubated with anti-NAPE-PLD antiserum (1:2,000 dilution) in buffer C at room temperature for 1 h, followed by the incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution) in buffer C at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, NAPE-PLD was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed by a LAS1000plus lumino-imaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan).Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from various organs of mice (C57/BL6 Cr, Charles River, Japan) with Trizol. Primers for mouse NAPE-PLD mRNA were 5′-ATGGTGGAAATGGACGAGCTCATC-3′ and 5′-TCATGTTTCTTCAAAAGCTCTATC-3′ (nucleotides 406–429 and 1168–1191 in GenBank™ accession number AB112350), and those for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA were 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (nucleotides 5–30 and 964–987 in GenBank™ accession number NM008084). PCR conditions used are as follows: for NAPE-PLD, denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min (24, 26, or 28 cycles); for GAPDH, denaturation at 94 °C for 48 s, annealing at 70 °C for 48 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min (25 cycles).RESULTSIdentification and Cloning of NAPE-PLD cDNA—In earlier studies we solubilized the NAPE-PLD from the 105,000 × g pellet of rat heart homogenates, and partially purified it by ion-exchange column chromatographies (13Ueda N. Liu Q. Yamanaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Tonai T. Ueda N. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 115: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We further purified the rat heart enzyme by the use of a combination of four column chromatographies to a specific activity of 406 nmol/min/mg protein at 37 °C (Table I). As analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the final preparation was not completely pure, and several major protein bands were still detected (Fig. 1). However, since we noted that the intensity of Band A with a molecular mass of about 46 kDa changed in agreement with the NAPE-hydrolyzing activity through the hydroxyapatite chromatography, we presumed that Band A was the enzyme protein.Table IPurification of NAPE-PLD from rat heartStepProteinActivityaOne unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 nmol of N-palmitoyl-PE per min at 37 °C.Specific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-fold105,000 × g pellet from homogenates18611180.06Proteins solubilized with octyl glucoside497397bOnly the soluble enzyme after treatment with octyl glucoside could be activated by MgCl2 (14).0.80bOnly the soluble enzyme after treatment with octyl glucoside could be activated by MgCl2 (14).1001Active fractions from HiTrap SP HP552093.8534.8Active fractions from HiTrap Q0.7373201825Active fractions from HiTrap Blue0.1848531267Active fractions from hydroxyapatite0.033134063.4508a One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 nmol of N-palmitoyl-PE per min at 37 °C.b Only the soluble enzyme after treatment with octyl glucoside could be activated by MgCl2 (14Liu Q.

The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and were microsequenced. By this procedure, we could determine five peptide sequences. By the use of data base, the three peptide sequences (KLHDEEIQELQA, LHDEEIQELQAQ, and LLAELEQLK) were found to be contained in rat vimentin. Vimentins are class-III intermediate filaments found in various non-epithelial cells, and their molecular mass is 56 kDa (21Evans R.M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hence, this protein did not seem to be NAPE-PLD but a contaminant. The other two sequences (ELPVLKPY(F/V)VSD and YGLKSEDFFILK) were found to be contained in a single cDNA clone of mouse (GenBank™ accession number XM144214), the function of which has not been reported. However, because the data base search with RPS-BLAST suggested that this clone belongs to the zinc metallohydrolase family of the β-lactamase fold (22Aravind L.

We amplified the putative coding region of this cDNA by RT-PCR with RNA of mouse brain, and determined its nucleotide sequence. The sequence was completely identical with that of XM144214.

We prepared PCR primers based on these nucleotide sequences, and we cloned rat and human homologues from rat brain and human megakaryoblastic leukemia cells (CMK cells) by RT-PCR (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequences deduced from the cDNAs of three animal species were composed of 396 (mouse and rat) and 393 (human) residues, and their molecular weights were calculated to be 45,816 (mouse), 45,737 (rat) and 45,596 (human). Their amino acid identity was 95.5 (between mouse and rat), 89.1 (between mouse and human), and 90.4% (between rat and human).

https://openalex.org/W2023346112,"Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) synthesizes RNA with remarkable fidelity in vivo. Its low error rate may be achieved by means of a 'proofreading' mechanism comprised of two sequential events. The first event (backtracking) involves a transcriptionally upstream motion of RNAP through several base pairs, which carries the 3' end of the nascent RNA transcript away from the enzyme active site. The second event (endonucleolytic cleavage) occurs after a variable delay and results in the scission and release of the most recently incorporated ribonucleotides, freeing up the active site. Here, by combining ultrastable optical trapping apparatus with a novel two-bead assay to monitor transcriptional elongation with near-base-pair precision, we observed backtracking and recovery by single molecules of RNAP. Backtracking events ( approximately 5 bp) occurred infrequently at locations throughout the DNA template and were associated with pauses lasting 20 s to >30 min. Inosine triphosphate increased the frequency of backtracking pauses, whereas the accessory proteins GreA and GreB, which stimulate the cleavage of nascent RNA, decreased the duration of such pauses."
https://openalex.org/W2084708321,"p73, an important developmental gene, shares a high sequence homology with p53 and induces both G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms through which p73 induces apoptosis are unclear. We found that p73-induced apoptosis is mediated by PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) induction, which, in turn, causes Bax mitochondrial translocation and cytochrome c release. Overexpression of p73 isoforms promotes cell death and bax promoter transactivation in a time-dependent manner. However, the kinetics of apoptosis do not correlate with the increase of Bax protein levels. Instead, p73-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax is kinetically compatible with the induction of cell death. p73 is localized in the nucleus and remains nuclear during the induction of cell death, indicating that the effect of p73 on Bax translocation is indirect. The ability of p73 to directly transactivate PUMA and the direct effect of PUMA on Bax conformation and mitochondrial relocalization suggest a molecular link between p73 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Our data therefore indicate that PUMA-mediated Bax mitochondrial translocation, rather than its direct transactivation, correlates with cell death. Finally, human ΔNp73, an isoform lacking the amino-terminal transactivation domain, inhibits TAp73-induced as well as p53-induced apoptosis. The ΔNp73 isoforms seem therefore to act as dominant negatives, repressing the PUMA/Bax system and, thus, finely tuning p73-induced apoptosis.

Here we report a study on p73-induced apoptosis in Saos-2 cells demonstrating that the γ isoform is the most effective both in the induction of apoptosis and in bax transactivation. However, at least in this model, bax transactivation does not seem to be crucial for the induction of death. We show that, in cells undergoing p73-dependent apoptosis, p73 displays a nuclear localization pattern, whereas Bax translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria, thus causing cytochrome c release. The BH3-only protein PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) is transcriptionally induced during p73-mediated cell death and favors a conformational change and relocalization of Bax to the mitochondria.

Bax Staining—Saos-2 cells with inducible expression of p73γ and p53 were stimulated to produce the protein for the indicated times using dox (2.5 μg/ml) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized for 2 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with anti-Bax antibody followed by 30 min of incubation with anti-rabbit ALEXA 488 antibody (Molecular Probes). 10,000 events were collected by monitoring 530-nm fluorescence on a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), as indicated above. Subcellular Localization—Cells were grown overnight on a glass coverslip and, after the indicated treatments, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 15 min. Saos-2 p73γ-inducible cells were induced with dox (2.5 μg/ml) for 24 h and then treated, when indicated, with 25 μm cisplatin for 24 h. Immunofluorescence was carried out using an anti-HA or anti-Bax antibody combined with TUNEL reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red, Roche Applied Science). HeLa cells stably expressing Bax-GFP were cotransfected by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with p73γ and pDS-Red1-Mito (3:1). Confocal images were acquired by using a PCM-2000 confocal microscope (Nikon) and excited with a 488-nm argon-ion laser line or a 542-nm helium-neon laser detecting with the appropriate filter set (515/30 green filter and 595/70 red filter). Images were then processed by using PCM-2000 software (Nikon). Luciferase Assay—Saos-2 cells with dox-inducible p73 isoforms or p53 were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing luciferase cDNA under the control of the bax promoter (Bax-Pr/Luc) and a Renilla plasmid as internal standard (40:1). p73 or p53 expression was then induced by treatment with dox (2.5 μg/ml). Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding p73α or p53 with or without ΔNp73α, ΔNp73β, or ΔNp73γ, together with Bax-Pr/Luc (bax-Pr/Luc: p73/p53:ΔNp73:Renilla = 1:1:8:0.25). N1E-115 cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding p73α, p73β, p73γ, p73δ, or p53, with or without Δ84p73β together with Bax-Pr/Luc. Luciferase assays were carried out 48 h after transfection with the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was detected by using an EG&G Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer, averaging the signal for 10s. p73 Expression Induces Apoptosis in Saos-2 Cells—To study the mechanisms through which p73 induces apoptosis, we took advantage of three Saos-2-derived cell lines stably transfected with the HA-tagged, dox-inducible TAp73 isoforms α, β, or γ (25Nakano K. Bàlint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Saos-2 cells are p53-null and do not express p73 at either mRNA and protein levels, therefore forming a suitable model for evaluation of the induction of apoptosis by p73. We measured p73 expression in Saos-2 cells incubated with the tetracycline analog dox (2.5 μg/ml). Cells were collected at different time points and assayed for protein expression using the anti-HA antibody. p73 protein levels were undetectable in untreated cells, whereas the expression of all the three p73 isoforms was induced in a time-dependent manner following treatment with dox (Fig 1A). Densitometric analysis of p73 induction revealed that β and γ isoforms were the most highly induced upon dox treatment (Fig. 1B). To test whether caspases play a role during p73-induced cell death, we measured the proenzyme expression levels of caspase 6, 7, and 8 upon dox stimulation of Saos-2 p73-inducible cell lines (Fig. 1, C-E). We found a significant reduction in procaspase 6 steadystate levels (less significant for the other procaspases) 48 h after treatment of Saos-2 p73β and p73γ. (Fig. 1, D and E). Consistent with the p73β- and γ-triggered processing of procaspase 6 and, to a lesser extent, procaspase 8, both isoforms induced apoptosis (Fig. 1F) after 48 h of dox stimulation. Therefore, expression of p73, in particular the isoforms β and γ, induces cell death and caspase activation in Saos-2 cells. p73-induced bax Expression Does Not Correlate with Apoptotic Kinetics—To investigate the possible involvement of Bax in p73-induced apoptosis, we performed a transactivating assay using a reporter plasmid (bax-Pr/Luc) containing the full-length bax-promoter placed upstream of a luciferase cDNA. We transfected Saos-2 cells expressing the dox-inducible p73α, β, and γ isoforms or p53 as a positive control, and the luciferase assay was performed after 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, all three p73 isoforms transactivated the bax promoter, although to a lesser degree than p53, with the p73γ isoform being the most potent transcriptional activator. This is in keeping with previous literature. Saos-2 cells inducible for p73γ and p53 expression were also analyzed for Bax protein levels following stimulation with dox by flow cytometric analysis. Interestingly, Bax up-regulation was induced in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 96 h (Fig. 2, B and C), thus indicating that the kinetics of Bax expression did not correlate with the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1F). Although there are structural and functional similarities between p73 and p53, p73 is a less efficient transcriptional activator of the bax promoter (Fig. 2A) and a significantly slower inducer of Bax protein expression (Fig 2, B and C) than p53. Hence, at least in our cellular model, the direct transactivation of the bax promoter by p73 does not seem to be the crucial apoptotic effector mechanism driven by p73. p73 Indirectly Induces Bax Mitochondrial Relocalization— Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria is a critical step in p53-mediated apoptosis (29Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Bax contributes to apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and thus controlling mitochondrial protein export. Using confocal and subcellular fractionation studies, we investigated whether Bax re-localization could mediate p73-induced apoptosis in cells stably expressing a Bax-GFP fusion protein (Bax-GFP). Bax-GFP HeLa cells were cotransfected with p73γ along with a plasmid encoding a red protein that localizes to the mitochondria (pDsRed1-Mito). Confocal microscopy revealed that Bax-GFP was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol in the absence of p73 overexpression (Fig. 3A, green fluorescence). However, Bax-GFP moved to a completely punctate distribution, co-localizing with mitochondria 48 h after p73 up-regulation (Fig. 3B). To further confirm Bax relocalization into mitochondria in apoptotic cells, we performed a Western blot analysis on the purified mitochondrial fraction from the Saos-2 p73γ subclone 48 h after dox stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3C, induction of p73 revealed a significant increase in Bax protein levels in the mitochondrial fraction as compared with untreated cells. Identical results were obtained using the Bax-GFP HeLa cells (data not shown). Evidence for transcription-independent, p53-mediated apoptosis has been accumulating (30Sansome C. Zaika A. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Because during DNA damage- and hypoxia-stimulated apoptosis a fraction of p53 translocates to mitochondria and directly induces cytochrome c release, we sought to examine whether p73 undergoes similar distribution changes. At the same time, the experiment would elucidate if Bax translocation is directly induced by the p73 protein per se. Interestingly, p73 (Fig. 3, green fluorescence) was clearly restricted to the nuclear compartment and did not re-localize during apoptosis triggered either by p73γ induction (Fig. 3, D and E) or by cisplatin treatment of Saos-2 cells overexpressing p73γ (Fig. 3F). Transient transfection of Saos-2 cells with an expression plasmid encoding HA-p73γ gave identical results to those obtained with Saos-2 stably transfected with p73γ (data not shown). Thus, unlike p53, p73 does not translocate to mitochondria in response to death signals. Moreover, Bax translocation to the mitochondria is not caused by a direct p73-Bax interaction. Finally, we monitored cellular distribution of the endogenous Bax protein in the p73γ-inducible clones 48 h after dox stimulation. Fig. 3G shows that Bax (green fluorescence) was spread throughout the cytosol in control cells. On the contrary, Bax displayed a punctate distribution pattern in p73γ-overexpressing cells similar to that observed in Fig. 3B (Fig. 3H). Comparable results were obtained in Saos-2 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding HA-p73γ (data not shown). These data indicate that p73 and Bax do not co-localize, even at later stages of p73-induced cell death. To more directly investigate the interaction between Bax and p73, we overexpressed both proteins in Saos-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3I, we did not observe any co-localization of p73 (green fluorescence) in mitochondria (red fluorescence). These results indicate that p73 induces the mitochondrial translocation of Bax through indirect mechanisms. PUMA Is Induced by p73 and Causes a Conformational Change and Mitochondrial Translocation of Bax—To identify the mediators through which p73 indirectly induces Bax mitochondrial translocation, we examined the modulation of several BH3-only proteins (data not shown) that bind to Bcl2/Xl via their BH3 domain, thereby inactivating their protective functions (27Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar, 32Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The recently identified PUMA gene encodes two BH3 domain-containing proteins, PUMAα and PUMAβ, that are induced following p53 activation and play a role in mediating p53-induced cell death through the cytochrome c/Apaf-1-dependent pathway (27Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that p73 could directly transactivate PUMA. As shown in Fig. 4A, PUMA was transcriptionally induced by p73 within 12 h. The specific roles of the individual PUMA isoforms are not clear at the moment. We then examined whether PUMA affects Bax translocation to mitochondria during p73-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4, B-D, overexpression of both PUMA isoforms in HeLa cells stably transfected with Bax-GFP led to Bax movement from the cytosol to mitochondria 24 h after transfection. In addition, we found that PUMA caused the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria as visualized in HeLa cells stably transfected with cytochrome c-GFP (Fig. 4, E-G). Therefore, PUMA seems to mediate the effect of p73 on Bax, causing mitochondrial release of cytochrome c to activate the final steps of death in the apoptosome. To investigate how PUMA physiologically regulates Bax cellular distribution during apoptosis, we took advantage of the 6A7 anti-Bax antibody, which recognizes the activated membrane-bound form of Bax (33Hsu Y-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of PUMA in U2OS cells led to translocation of the endogenous Bax protein to mitochondria. Interestingly, the active membrane-bound conformation of Bax co-localized with PUMA (Fig. 5A). Identical results were obtained in a Tet-On, PUMA-inducible H1299-derived cell line. Induction of PUMA by dox stimulation resulted in Bax conformational modification and co-localization with PUMA on the mitochondria (Fig. 5B). The data suggest that PUMA causes a conformational modification of Bax, which then results in its accumulation on the mitochondria. PUMA-induced Apoptosis Requires Functional Bax/Bak—To formally prove that PUMA-induced cytochrome c release and cell death indeed relies on Bax during p73-mediated apoptosis, we first cotransfected bax-/- MEFs with p73γ and cytochrome c-GFP. We found that p73-induced cytochrome c release was delayed, but not abrogated, in the absence of bax (Fig. 6A, and data not shown). When cells were exposed to DNA damage (25 μm cisplatin), apoptosis was indeed slower in bax-/-, even though the same plateau was reached (Fig. 6B). In this experiment, both in bax+/+ and bax-/- cells, p73 steady-state protein levels were induced within 12 h (Fig. 6C). This suggests that, indeed, p73 is physiolog"

https://openalex.org/W2136586640,"The Mixed-Lineage Leukemia gene (MLL/HRX/ALL1) encodes a large nuclear protein homologous to Drosophila trithorax that is required for the maintenance of HOX gene expression. MLL is cleaved at two conserved sites generating N320 and C180 fragments, which heterodimerize to stabilize the complex and confer its subnuclear destination. Here, we purify and clone the protease responsible for cleaving MLL. We entitle it Taspase1 as it initiates a class of endopeptidases that utilize an N-terminal threonine as the active site nucleophile to proteolyze polypeptide substrates following aspartate. Taspase1 proenzyme is intramolecularly proteolyzed generating an active 28 kDa alpha/22 kDa beta heterodimer. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Taspase1 results in the appearance of unprocessed MLL and the loss of proper HOX gene expression. Taspase1 coevolved with MLL/trithorax as Arthropoda and Chordata emerged from Metazoa suggesting that Taspase1 originated to regulate complex segmental body plans in higher organisms."

In the Drosophila eye, the outer PRs of each ommatidium are involved in motion detection while the inner PRs mediate color vision. In addition, flies use a specialized class of inner PRs in the “dorsal rim area” of the eye (DRA) to detect the e-vector of polarized light, allowing them to exploit skylight polarization for orientation. We show that homothorax is both necessary and sufficient for inner PRs to adopt the polarization-sensitive DRA fate instead of the color-sensitive default state. Homothorax increases rhabdomere size and uncouples R7-R8 communication to allow both cells to express the same opsin rather than different ones as required for color vision. Homothorax expression is induced by the iroquois complex and the wingless (wg) pathway. However, crucial wg pathway components are not required, suggesting that additional signals are involved."

In the absence of Ca2+ where the actin-activated MgATPase activity is low, purified brain myosin V sediments in the analytical ultracentrifuge at 14 S as opposed to 11 S in the presence of Ca2+ where the activity is high. At high ionic strength it sediments at 10 S independent of Ca2+, and its regulation is poor. These data are consistent with myosin V having a compact, inactive conformation in the absence of Ca2+ and an extended conformation in the presence of Ca2+ or high ionic strength. Electron microscopy reveals that in the absence of Ca2+ the heads and tail are both folded to give a triangular shape, very different from the extended appearance of myosin V at high ionic strength. A recombinant myosin V heavy meromyosin fragment that is missing the distal portion of the tail domain is not regulated by calcium and has only a small change in sedimentation coefficient, which is in the opposite direction to that seen with intact myosin V.

The N-terminal motor domain possesses the actin and nucleotide binding sites of the molecule and is followed by a neck domain containing six IQ motifs which bind calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; HMM, heavy meromyosin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; cp, centapoise.

The proximal portion of the tail contains several segments of coiled-coil, driving the dimerization of two heavy chains, and the distal portion comprises a globular cargo binding domain.

However, recombinant myosin V heavy meromyosin-like fragments (HMM), which are missing the globular tail domain and the distal portion of the coiled-coil domain, have high actin-activated MgATPase rates in the absence of Ca2+ and are partially inhibited by Ca2+ if excess CaM is not present (10.Wang F.

Ca2+ Activates the MgATPase Activity of Myosin V—Similarly to previous results (12.Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we find that the actin-activated MgATPase activity of purified brain myosin V is strongly activated by the presence of micromolar Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). The lower activity in the absence of Ca2+ is due to an effect on the maximal ATPase activity, Vmax, rather than on the apparent affinity for actin, KATPase, (Fig. 1B). Thus, the average steady state Vmax is 12.6 ± 3.2 s–1 with a KATPase of 0.33 ± 0.2 μm in the presence of Ca2+ and 0.47 ± 0.1 s–1 with 0.41 ± 0.1 μm in the absence of Ca2+. In marked contrast to intact myosin V, recombinant myosin V HMM shows a high actin-activated MgATPase even in the absence of Ca2+, provided that 1 μm CaM is present in the assay buffer (10.Wang F.

Ca2+ also increases the MgATPase activity of myosin V in the absence of actin (Table I).Table IEffect of ionic strength on the regulation of the MgATPase activity of myosin VMgATPase activity[KCl]Myosin aloneActomyosin-Ca2++Ca2+Ca2++Ca2+s-1s-150 mm0.0290.0800.959.62500 mm0.0630.0642.201.33 Open table in a new tab Ca2+ Induces a Large Conformational Change in Myosin V— To assess whether myosin V exhibits a Ca2+-sensitive conformational change, we measured its S values in the analytical ultracentrifuge in the presence and absence of Ca2+ under ionic conditions similar to those used for ATPase measurements. In the absence of Ca2+, myosin V sediments with an S value of 13.7 S (Fig. 2A, Table II). In the presence of Ca2+ this value reduces to 10.7 S. We will refer to these values as 14 and 11 S, respectively. Masses estimated using the sedimentation coefficient and diffusion coefficient during the runs show that the molecule is monomeric under both conditions. The shift in S value is consistent with myosin V adopting a more compact structure in the absence of Ca2+, conditions where the ATPase is low, and changing to an extended structure in the presence of Ca2+, conditions where the ATPase is high.Table IIEffect of ionic strength and Ca2+ on the sedimentation coefficients of intact myosin V and myosin V HMMSedimentation coefficients (s20)[KCl]Ca2+EGTAMyosin V80 mm10.713.7MyosinV500 mm9.89.6HMM80 mm9.48.5HMM + CaM80 mm9.48.5 Open table in a new tab Under ionic conditions identical to those used for tissue purified myosin V, HMM underwent a smaller change from 8.5 S in the absence of Ca2+ to 9.4 S in its presence (Fig. 2B, Table II). Note that the direction of this change is opposite to that for intact myosin V and is consistent with HMM being more compact in the presence of Ca2+ than in its absence. Inclusion of 2 μm exogenous CaM in the buffer did not affect the sedimentation values for the HMM in either the presence or absence of Ca2+ suggesting that the effect is not merely due to dissociation of CaM in the presence of Ca2+ (Table II). A Compact Structural State for Myosin V—Myosin V was viewed in the electron microscope following negative staining. In the absence of Ca2+ (at 80 mm KCl), the majority of the molecules on the grid showed a novel, compact triangular shape (Fig. 3a). Single particle image processing reveals an enigmatic but rather consistent substructure (Fig. 3b) in which both the 32-nm heads and 57-nm tail must be folded because the lengths of the sides of the triangle (22–27 nm in the image averages) are shorter than either of these domains (compare with Fig. 3d), and the tail domains are not obvious. We cannot yet confidently assign the features of the compact structure to substructural domains of myosin V. These molecules are markedly different from ones stained at 0.5 m KCl in the absence of Ca2+, under similar conditions to those used previously to produce freeze etch, rotary shadowed images of intact myosin V (11.Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Here the molecules adopt the familiar T- or Y-shape, with two readily identifiable elongated heads coupled to the tail (Fig. 3d). Correspondingly, the sedimentation coefficient of intact myosin V at 0.5 m KCl in the absence of Ca2+ is reduced to 9.6 S (Fig. 2C), very similar to that found at low ionic strength in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). Ca2+ induces a very small change in S value (to 9.8 S) at high ionic strength (Fig. 2C, Table II). The actin-activated MgATPase activity at high ionic strength is not regulated (Table I). Therefore, purified myosin V at high ionic strength behaves much like HMM at low ionic strength. It has an extended structure in the electron microscope, like HMM (Fig. 3e), and its sedimentation coefficient undergoes a modest Ca2+-induced shift in the same direction as HMM (Fig. 2B). When purified myosin V or HMM was viewed at low ionic strength in the presence of Ca2+, few identifiable structures were observed whether or not 1 μm exogenous CaM was present (Fig. 3c). We believe this is due to either full or partial dissociation of individual CaM light chains from their IQ motif binding sites which would allow the levers to be more flexible and adopt very diverse shapes. Myosin II light chain dissociation has previously been shown to produce a more compact lever arm (24.Flicker P.F. Wallimann T. Vibert P. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 723-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 μm exogenous CaM, chelation of the Ca2+ by 5 mm EGTA reverses the instability of myosin V over a period of 30 min so that the compact appearance is restored, and on subsequent addition of salt the extended conformation is also seen. We have shown that myosin V adopts a compact folded conformation with a sedimentation coefficient of 14 S under in vitro conditions where the actin-activated MgATPase activity is turned off. The reason this structure has not been seen before is that the high ionic strength conditions used in earlier microscopy favor the extended form. Several interesting questions arise. First, how does myosin V translocate cargo in cells where the Ca2+ levels are typically less than one micromolar, and second, how is the lack of regulation seen in in vitro motility assays reconciled with the tight regulation observed in MgATPase assays? These questions may be linked. We postulate that the binding of myosin V to its docker or linker protein unlocks the folded conformation and results in an active myosin even in the absence of Ca2+. For example, myosin V in mammalian melanocytes binds via its tail domain to the C terminus of melanophilin, which, in turn, binds via its N terminus in a GTP-dependent manner to Rab27a to make an active tripartite complex (25.Wu X.S.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The tail of myosin V is alternatively spliced and the melanocyte specific isoform has an exon required for binding of melanophilin that is not present in the brain myosin V isoform we isolated in this study (25.Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We predict that addition of melanophilin to the melanocyte-specific isoform but not to the brain isoform triggers the extended active conformation even in the absence of Ca2+. It is likely that other myosin V isoforms have similar linker proteins that would act in an analogous manner. It is possible that binding of myosin V to a coverslip surface, in vitro, triggers the same conformational change in myosin V, leading to an active molecule. This would explain why myosin V is always active in assays where it is bound to a surface. An advantage of having a highly regulated myosin V is that unregulated, non-cargo-bound myosin V in cells would needlessly hydrolyze ATP and would stay associated with actin filaments due to its processivity. This behavior would be even more pronounced in elongated cells such as neurons and melanocytes where myosin V participates in the transport of vesicles to the dendritic tips for docking with the cell membrane. If the activity of the molecule were unregulated myosin V would not be available for newly formed vesicles or cargo in the cell body. If, on the other hand, myosin V could dissociate from the vesicle after docking and fold into an inactive form that could freely diffuse, it could then be effectively recycled. We propose a model whereby free myosin V in cells under conditions of low Ca2+ concentration exists in the 14 S conformation and is enzymatically and mechanically inactive (Fig. 4). The binding of cargo to the tail region occurs either directly or indirectly via linker proteins and triggers myosin V to adopt the extended, active conformation. This interaction might be regulated by phosphorylation of myosin V or any of the linker proteins or by the nucleotide status of a G-protein that is part of the linker complex. The change to the extended conformation is also triggered directly by Ca2+ binding to myosin V, but this may result in a mechanically weakened protein, since some CaM molecules dissociate from myosin V in the presence of Ca2+ (15.Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Cameron L.C. Carvalho R.N. Araujo J.R.V. Santos A.C. Tauhata S.B. Larson R.E. Sorenson M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Myosin II stripped of one of its light chains retains its actin activated MgATPase activity but performs poorly in mechanical assays such as the in vitro motility assay or step size measurements using the optical trap (29.VanBuren P.

Thus, even though myosin V adopts the 11 S extended conformation in the presence of Ca2+, it may not be a fully functional motor under these conditions. Regulation of motor protein activity by a tail-dependent conformational change plays a role in the regulation of conventional kinesin (32.Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Hackney D.D. Stock M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34.Friedman D.S. Vale R.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and has been adopted by at least two myosin family members (II and V). In addition, there is indirect evidence for a role of the tail in the regulation of a mammalian myosin I (35.Stöffler H.E. Bähler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14605-14611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the regulation of myosin V is very different from that of smooth muscle myosin II, however. The enzymatic activities of smooth and nonmuscle HMM are regulated by phosphorylation even though these molecules are missing much of their tails, whereas that of myosin V HMM is unregulated (36.Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37.Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the compact folded structure observed with smooth and nonmuscle myosins may be more important for regulation of filament assembly than for enzymatic activity. A particular asymmetric interaction between the two heads of smooth muscle HMM is seen in the off state that may be important for the enzymatic regulation (38.Liu J. Wendt T. Taylor D. Taylor K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The compact form of myosin V also has a specific structure, but it differs in having the globular tail domains incorporated within the head region. The fact that the microtubule-dependent motor, kinesin, and two myosin family proteins are now known to have evolved regulatory mechanisms involving head-tail interactions that occur via large conformational changes is very significant. It suggests that future studies testing for motor molecule regulation should examine the enzymatic properties of complete molecules, along with any associated subunits. In kinesin the portion of the globular tail domain responsible for the inhibition has been identified (33.Hackney D.D. Stock M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The next challenges with myosin V will be to identify the putative interacting portions of the head and tail and to determine how these interactions are regulated and how they are disrupted by cargo binding.

To identify genes involved in TGF-β-mediated cell migration, the transcriptional profiles of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) treated with TGF-β were compared with untreated cells by cDNA microarray analysis. One gene up-regulated by TGF-β was recently named kindlerin (Jobard, F., Bouadjar, B., Caux, F., Hadj-Rabia, S., Has, C., Matsuda, F., Weissenbach, J., Lathrop, M., Prud'homme, J. F., and Fischer, J.

TGF-β stimulation of HMEC resulted in a marked induction of kindlerin RNA, and Western blotting demonstrated a corresponding increase in protein abundance. Kindlerin displays a putative FERM (four point one ezrin radixin moesin) domain that is closely related to the sequences in talin that interact with integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains. The critical residues in the talin FERM domain that mediate integrin binding show a high degree of conservation in kindlerin. Furthermore, kindlerin is recruited into a molecular complex with the β1A and β3 integrin cytoplasmic domains. Consistent with these biochemical findings, kindlerin is present at focal adhesions, sites of integrin-rich, membrane-substratum adhesion.

The HaCaT immortalized keratinocyte cell line was a gift from D. Grossman. HMEC were obtained from BioWhittaker and cultured in complete mammary epithelial growth media. HMEC were seeded at passages 7 or 8 and harvested at no greater than 80% confluency for all experiments.cDNA Microarray Data Analysis—The construction of the microarrays, generation of the microarray probes, microarray hybridization, and scanning were performed as described previously (21Karpf A.R. Peterson P.W. Rawlins J.T. Dalley B.K. Yang Q. Albertsen H. Jones D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14007-14012Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription from the mRNA samples in the presence of Cy-3dCTP or Cy-5dCTP. The resulting labeled cDNAs were combined and simultaneously hybridized to the microarray slide displaying 4608 randomly selected and minimally redundant cDNAs from the unigene set (22Miller G.S. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the 4608 minimally redundant genes was present in duplicate on the microarray, and the comparisons were completed three separate times resulting in a total of six measurements for each gene. In each case, mRNA from TGF-β-treated cells was directly compared with mRNA from vehicle-treated cells. The GeneSpring software program (version 5.1; Silicon Genetics) was utilized for all steps in the data analysis. To normalize the microarray data, a Lowess curve was fit to the log intensity versus log ratio plot. 20.0% of the data was used to calculate the Lowess fit at each point. This curve was used to adjust the control value for each measurement. We selected TGF-β-responsive genes based on a statistical analysis using the gene expression program GeneSpring (version 5.1). We applied the inclusion criteria of 1.5-fold induction, and a p value of less than 0.05 (Student's t test) in defining TGF-β up-regulated genes. The list of genes shown in Table I was selected from the total normalized data set as having a fold induction greater than 1.5 in at least 4 of 6 data points (see the experimental description within Table I). Genes with a p value (Students t test) greater than 0.05 were not included. DNA sequencing and BLAST analysis confirmed the identity of each microarray clone corresponding to those genes listed in Table I.Table IGenes Induced by TGF-β in HMEC Human mammary epithelial cells were treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 3 h; mRNA harvested from treated and non-treated HMEC samples (3 independent replicates) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in the presence of either a green or red fluorescent tag. Competitive hybridization of the labeled cDNAs on glass slides containing 4608 cDNAs spotted in duplicate revealed the relative increase and decrease of specific mRNAs. Stringent data analysis (greater than 1.5-fold in 4 of the 6 microarray ratios; p value less than 0.05) facilitated the identification of 17 TGF-β up-regulated transcripts.Gene nameFold changep valueap values were calculated using the Student's t test from 6 independent microarray expression ratiosPlasminogen activator inhibitor, type I (PAI1)3.077.76E-07Integrin α22.554.46E-04Kindlerin2.305.36E-05Transglutaminase2.175.07E-03TGF-β induced, 68-kDa1.964.92E-03Connective tissue growth factor1.944.32E-05PMEPA11.895.56E-03Sox-41.881.66E-02Tubulin α-4 chain1.762.13E-02Tis11D/ERF-21.703.22E-04Gadd45β1.697.24E-04EST (accession no.

The vehicle control for TGF-β1 was composed of 4 mm HCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cycloheximide (Calbiochem) was used at 10 μg/ml and was added to the cells 15 min prior to the addition of TGF-β. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by poly(A) RNA selection using a Poly(AT) Tract mRNA Isolation kit (Promega). Poly(A) RNA was fractionated through formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were generated using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) supplemented with [32P]dCTP. Hybridizations with 32P-labeled probes were carried out using ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) as recommended by the manufacturer. The kindlerin probe was generated by amplification of the insert of a cDNA image clone (accession number 299593) using T7 and T3 primers.Construction of FLAG-tagged Kindlerin cDNA—In order to manufacture the longest piece of the 5′ end of kindlerin cDNA, the EcoRI/SwaI fragment of AA158566 was subcloned into the EcoRI/SwaI sites of AI147142 to make clone A. Clone A was used as a template for PCR to add an EcoRI site directly 5′ of the ATG (sense oligonucleotide 5, 5′-ACG AAT TCA ATG CTG TCA TCC ACT GAC TTT AC-3′) and ended at the native PstI site (antisense oligonucleotide 6, 5′-CGA GGA TGC TGC AGT TTT GTT CC-3′). The EcoRI/PstI insert from clone A was excised and replaced with the PCR product digested with EcoRI/PstI in order to remove the 5′-untranslated region to generate clone B. The 3′ end of kindlerin cDNA was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using RNA isolated from HMEC treated with TGF-β. The sense oligonucleotide 7 (5′-ATA GGT ACC TCA ATC CTG ACC GCC GGT CAA-3′) began at the HaeII site, and the antisense oligonucleotide 8 (5′-GAA GCG GCG CTT TCT AAT TTG GA-3′) added a KpnI site directly 3′ of the stop codon. The complete FLAG-kindlerin cDNA was assembled by three-piece ligation containing clone B digested with EcoRI and HaeII, the reverse transcriptase-PCR product digested with HaeII and KpnI, and FLAGpCMV2 digested with EcoRI and KpnI.Kindlerin Antibody Generation—A construct expressing the C-terminal third of kindlerin (amino acid residues 500 to end) with a His tag was engineered as follows: a PCR product was generated using sense oligonucleotide 11 (5′-GCT CCA TAT GAT TCT TTC CTT TCT GAA GAT GCA GCA T-3′) and antisense oligonucleotide 12 (5′-ATG CGG CCG CTC ACA CCC AAC CAC TGG TAA GTT T-3′) using the FLAG-kindlerin cDNA as template and cloned into NdeI and NotI sites of the pET28a vector (Novagen). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing and utilized to transform competent BL21 cells (Novagen). The recombinant His-tagged kindlerin fragment was purified under denaturing conditions in 6 m urea. Fractions containing purified protein were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon-30 (Millipore). Concentrated protein was loaded onto SDS-PAGE, briefly stained with BioSafe Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad), and excised from the gel. Gel pieces containing kindlerin were used to inject rabbits for polyclonal antibody production (Harlan Bioproducts for Science).Western Blotting—For the TGF-β time course, HMEC or HaCaT were treated with vehicle or TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Protein lysates were harvested from HaCaT or HMEC in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mg/ml phenanthroline. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and assayed for protein concentration using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). For antibody characterization (Fig. 3A), lysates were heated at 70 °C for 10 min in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and then separated by Tris-glycine 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Millipore). The blots were incubated with indicated kindlerin, vinculin (Sigma), or E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies, followed by incubation with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase or sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were visualized with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the time course experiments, lysates were harvested and analyzed as indicated above, with the exception that BisTris 4–12% NuPAGE using MES running buffer (Invitrogen) was utilized to separate the lysates.Phase Contrast Imaging—HMEC were allowed to adhere overnight and were subsequently treated with vehicle or TGF-β for 48 h. Cell morphology was observed using a Nikon microscope and recorded with a digital camera.Affinity Purification of Kindlerin Antibody and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Kindlerin antiserum was affinity-purified by using a method described previously (23Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, antiserum was incubated with recombinant kindlerin immobilized on nitrocellulose. After extensive washing of the membrane, the bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and immediately combined with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, sufficient to neutralize the glycine-HCl. The eluted material was then concentrated in a Centricon-10 device (Amicon). The control antibody was absorbed to nitrocellulose without kindlerin protein. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by plating HaCaT cells on glass coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). To examine kindlerin localization in the presence of TGF-β, cells were treated with vehicle or TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 48 h. Coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed for 15 min with 4% formaldehyde, 5 μm CaCl2, 0.5 μm MgCl2 in PBS, and permeabilized for 4 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at 37 °C for 120 min, washed in PBS for 10 min, and subsequently incubated with Alexa-488- or Alexa-594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted with ProLong (Molecular Probes) after washing for 10 min in PBS. Primary antibodies used in this study include affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal kindlerin antibody R-2230 (1:100), control antibody (1:100), rabbit polyclonal talin antibody B-11 (1:800), and vinculin monoclonal antibody (1:300 Sigma). Actin filaments were visualized using Alexa-488-conjugated phalloidin (1:100 Molecular Probes). Cell images were visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and recorded with a digital camera.Kindlerin and Talin Amino Acid Alignment and Modeling—The primary sequences of kindlerin and talin were aligned by blast searching (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) and refined using structure-based alignments performed by Swiss-PdbViewer (us.expasy.org/spdbv/) using the structure of talin subdomains F2 and F3 (4Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M.

Based on the sequence alignment, the putative kindlerin F3 subdomain (residues 566–655) was modeled on the talin F3 subdomain (residues 309–400 from Protein Data Bank code 1MK7). Modeling was performed using Swiss model (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar, 25Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc.

Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar).Integrin β Tail Binding Assays—Affinity chromatography was performed by using recombinant models of integrin cytoplasmic tails as described previously (29Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with FLAG-kindlerinpCMV2 were lysed as described previously (29Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), and the indicated amount of lysate was mixed with 50 μl of His-Bind resin coated with recombinant integrin tails. Beads were washed and bound proteins fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and kindlerin was detected by Western blotting with FLAG antibodies. Loading of recombinant integrin tails onto the beads was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining.siRNA Transfection—HaCaT cells were transfected using siPORT Amine (Ambion) with a 21-nucleotide irrelevant RNA (control) or with a 21-nucleotide RNA targeting the kindlerin sequence (only sense sequence is shown): 5′-GAA GUU ACU ACC AAA AGC UTT. Cells were harvested ∼44 h after adding siRNA duplexes and examined for kindlerin expression by Western blot analysis. To show equivalent loading of protein, the membrane was probed with a talin monoclonal antibody (Sigma).Cell Spreading—Approximately 44 h after addition of the siRNA duplexes, cells were trypsinized and washed 2 times in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cells were plated on fibronectin (10 μg/ml, Sigma)-coated coverslips and were allowed to spread for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence as described above using talin and vinculin antibodies. A minimum of four randomly selected fields (∼180 cells total) was recorded with a digital camera. The area of cell spreading visualized by talin immunofluorescence was measured using Openlab software.RESULTSTGF-β Treatment Increases Kindlerin Expression—TGF-β elicits its biological effects by activation of a SMAD-dependent transcriptional program (reviewed in Refs. 30Massague J.

Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4201) Google Scholar). To identify potential downstream targets of TGF-β signaling that are involved in EMT and cell migration, we used microarray analysis to compare the transcriptional profiles of HMEC treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β to those of vehicle-treated cells. Seventeen genes exhibited a greater than 1.5-fold induction and a p value of less than 0.05 (Table I). Induced genes included a number of known TGF-β-responsive genes with roles in cell motility and adhesion such as plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (34Gerwin B.I. Keski-Oja J. Seddon M. Lechner J.F. Harris C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L262-L269PubMed Google Scholar, 35Stampfer M.R. Yaswen P. Alhadeff M. Hosoda J. J. Cell.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2989-3000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thrombospondin 1 (37Claisse D. Martiny I. Chaqour B. Wegrowski Y. Petitfrere E. Schneider C. Haye B. Bellon G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1405-1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and fibronectin (35Stampfer M.R. Yaswen P. Alhadeff M. Hosoda J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We examined Table I for novel genes with predicted roles in cell adhesion and migration, and we recognized that the third ranking gene encoded kindlerin, a protein required for stable attachment of epithelial cells to the lamina densa (1Jobard F. Bouadjar B. Caux F. Hadj-Rabia S. Has C. Matsuda F. Weissenbach J. Lathrop M. Prud'homme J.F. Fischer J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Kindlerin displays similarity throughout its sequence to two other human proteins, Mig-2 (65% identity) and URP2 (57% identity), as shown in Fig. 1 and appears to be related to the C. elegans protein, UNC-112 (44% identity). UNC-112 is required for the organization of dense bodies and attachment of muscle cells to the hypodermis, and UNC-112 interacts genetically with integrins (20Rogalski T.M. Mullen G.P. Gilbert M.M. Williams B.D. Moerman D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus we focused on kindlerin as a possible mediator of TGF-β effects on integrin function.Fig. 1Comparison of the amino acid sequences of kindlerin paralogues and UNC-112. Amino acid alignment of kindlerin, Mig-2, URP2, and UNC-112. Identical amino acids are highlighted in black, and dashes indicate gaps in the alignment. The amino acid sequences were aligned using the Clustal method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to verify the induction of the kindlerin gene by TGF-β, mRNA was isolated every2hupto12h after treatment with TGF-β and examined by Northern blot analysis for kindlerin expression (Fig. 2A). A 4.6-kb kindlerin mRNA transcript was induced ∼10-fold 6 h after addition of TGF-β. The level of kindlerin transcript remained elevated after exposure to TGF-β for 96 h (data not shown). To examine the role of protein synthesis in regulation of kindlerin mRNA, we examined the effect of cycloheximide on TGF-β stimulated HMEC. Kindlerin mRNA abundance was markedly increased by the addition of TGF-β (Fig. 2B). Addition of cycloheximide significantly reduced the effect of TGF-β on kindlerin mRNA, indicating that protein synthesis is required for the TGF-β stimulation of kindlerin transcription. Thus, kindlerin is a TGF-β-inducible gene.Fig. 2TGF-"

https://openalex.org/W1987948820,"Pigmentation of the hair, skin, and eyes of mammals results from a number of melanocyte-specific proteins that are required for the biosynthesis of melanin. Those proteins comprise the structural and enzymatic components of melanosomes, the membrane-bound organelles in which melanin is synthesized and deposited. Tyrosinase (TYR) is absolutely required for melanogenesis, but other melanosomal proteins, such as TYRP1, DCT, and gp100, also play important roles in regulating mammalian pigmentation. However, pigmentation does not always correlate with the expression of TYR mRNA/protein, and thus its function is also regulated at the post-translational level. Thus, TYR does not necessarily exist in a catalytically active state, and its post-translational activation could be an important control point for regulating melanin synthesis. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary approach to examine the processing and sorting of TYR through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, coated vesicles, endosomes and early melanosomes because those organelles hold the key to understanding the trafficking of TYR to melanosomes and thus the regulation of melanogenesis. In pigmented cells, TYR is trafficked through those organelles rapidly, but in amelanotic cells, TYR is retained within the ER and is eventually degraded by proteasomes. We now show that TYR can be released from the ER in the presence of protonophore or proton pump inhibitors which increase the pH of intracellular organelles, after which TYR is transported correctly to the Golgi, and then to melanosomes via the endosomal sorting system. The expression of TYRP1, which facilitates TYR processing in the ER, is down-regulated in the amelanotic cells; this is analogous to a hypopigmentary disease known as oculocutaneous albinism type 3 and further impairs melanin production. The sum of these results shows that organellar pH, proteasome activity, and down-regulation of TYRP1 expression all contribute to the lack of pigmentation in TYR-positive amelanotic melanoma cells.

The loss of pigmentation in melanomas is very common in advanced and in metastatic lesions because of the dysfunction of those melanocyte-specific proteins.

The sum of those results suggests that in melanocytes, TYR does not necessarily exist in a catalytically active state and that its activation could be an important control point for melanin biosynthesis. TYR is a type I membrane glycoprotein with seven potential N-glycosylation sites (20Müller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schütz G.

TYR catalyzes the rate-limiting reactions in melanin synthesis, converting tyrosine to DOPA-quinone and subsequently oxidizing 5,6-dihydroxyindole to indole-5,6-quinone (23Körner A.M. Pawelek J.M. Science. 1982; 217: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 24Hearing V.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 25Tripathi R.K. Hearing V.J.

After the translation of TYR and its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it undergoes some initial glycosylation and maturation and then enters the Golgi network, where it is processed further (26Negroiu G.

Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). TYR is eventually transported from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to its target organelle, the melanosome, by a vesicular transport system (28Jimbow K. Hua C. Gomez P.F. Hirosaki K. Shinoda K.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3203-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TYRP1 and DCT, two proteins closely related to TYR, undergo similar processing and sorting, although the sorting vesicle system used to deliver them from the TGN to melanosomes is presumably unique for each of those proteins (31Huizing M.

Even gp100 is processed through the ER, but is transferred to early melanosomes directly from the ER or from the early Golgi (33Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10698-10703Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) in a manner distinct from the TYR-related proteins. The processing of TYR in the ER requires the presence of the chaperone calnexin, which increases the ER retention time for TYR necessary for its binding of copper and its conformational folding (34Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Toyofuku K. Wada I. Hirosaki K. Park J.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15735-15743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The most common mutations of TYR result in oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), which is associated with the ER retention of the protein, presumably as the result of enzyme misfolding (27Toyofuku K. Wada I. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Ferrans V.J. Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 37Berson J.F. Frank D.W. Calvo P.A. Bieler B.M. Marks M.S. J.

A. 2000; 97: 5889-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); the misfolded TYR is then degraded by proteasomes. In OCA3, normal TYR is produced, but mutations in TYRP1 result in the retention of the wild-type TYR in the ER and its proteolysis by proteasomes; TYRP1 seems to act as a chaperone for TYR in the ER (27Toyofuku K. Wada I. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Ferrans V.J. Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus the reduction in TYR function in amelanotic melanoma cells could be mediated by the quality control system of the ER, because selective retention in the ER and subsequent degradation by proteasomes occurs in several genetic diseases (39Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D.P. Michalak M. Vijayasaradhi S. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 40Huizing M.

Pigment Cell Res. 2002; 15: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The sum of these studies underscore the fact that proper folding and processing of TYR in the ER is crucial for its enzymatic activity, delivery to melanosomes, and subsequent melanin synthesis. Thus, disruption of melanin synthesis may result not only from mutations at the TYR locus but also from mutations at a number of other loci involved in TYR processing and transport. Melanosomes are known to be acidic organelles that when mature can have a pH as low as 4.0 (42Bhatnagar V. Anjaiah S. Puri N. Arudhra Darshanam B.N. Ramaiah A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Puri N. Gardner J.M. Brilliant M.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 607-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that this low melanosomal pH facilitates melanogenesis (44Borovansky J. Mommaas A.M. Smit N.P.M. Eygendaal D. Winder A.J. Vermeer B.J. Pavel S. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1997; 289: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 45Devi C.C. Tripathi R.K. Ramaiah A.

Recently, the activation of melanogenesis by selective vacuolar type proton pump inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and concanamycin A (CCM), was shown in amelanotic human melanoma cells and in mouse melanoma cells, which express TYR but do not produce pigment (47Ancans J. Thody A.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further, Baf and CCM induce melanin synthesis in pink-eyed dilution gene (p)-null melanocytes by affecting early TYR processing and trafficking rather than by simply affecting activity at the melanosomal level (48Chen K. Manga P. Orlow S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 49Manga P. Orlow S.J. Pigment Cell Res. 2001; 14: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fuller et al. (50Fuller B.B. Spaulding D.T. Smith D.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) showed that melanocytes derived from caucasian donors respond to those agents by producing melanin after activation of TYR, whereas melanocytes derived from black donors were refractory to those agents, suggesting that intracellular pH might regulate constitutive skin color. Baf and CCM, macrolide antibiotics that at low concentrations specifically inhibit vacuolar-type proton ATPases (vATPase) (51Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar), have been commonly used to neutralize acidic compartments such as endosomes, in which the low luminal pH is known to affect receptor-ligand interactions and protein sorting (49Manga P. Orlow S.J. Pigment Cell Res. 2001; 14: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 52Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Ann. Rev.

Recent studies have shown that Baf inhibits the delivery of endocytosed material from endosomes to lysosomes (54Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55van Weert A.W. Dunn K.W. Gueze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J.

Baf was shown to function by inhibiting the formation of carrier vesicles operating between early and late endosomes (54Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to block the association of a subset of coatamer subunits with early endosomal membranes (57Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 58Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the expression, processing, and trafficking mechanisms of various melanosomal proteins (TYR, TYRP1, DCT, gp100, and MART1) in amelanotic and in melanotic melanoma cells using immunological, biochemical, and molecular approaches to characterize melanosomal localization in early melanosomes, endosomes, coated vesicles, Golgi apparatus, and ER. Those organelles hold the key to the understanding of biogenesis and pigment synthesis of melanosomes and how that might be disrupted in unpigmented melanocytes that express normal levels of melanogenic proteins. We confirm that the processing of TYR is altered in amelanotic melanoma cells, and we show that its retention in the ER can be corrected in the presence of protonophore or proton pump inhibitors, which increase the pH of intracellular organelles, after which TYR is transported correctly from the ER to the Golgi, further glycosylated, and then sorted to melanosomes. The sum of these results shows that organellar pH, proteasome activity, and the down-regulation of TYRP1 expression may all contribute to the lack of pigmentation in TYR-positive amelanotic melanoma cells. Cell Cultures—SK-MEL-28 amelanotic human melanoma cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.8 μg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. MNT-1 pigmented human melanoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) as described previously (33Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J. Vieira W.D. Muller J. Appella E.

Other antibodies to melanosomal proteins used in this study included M2–9E3, a mouse mAb against human MART-1 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), HMB45, a mouse mAb against human gp100 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and T311, and a mouse mAb against human TYR (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). We used other antibodies to check for localization in subcellular organelles as follows: CD107a, a mouse mAb against human lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), and MTC02, a mouse mAb against mitochondria (both from Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ); Bip/GRP78, Vti1b, EEA1, syntaxin 8, p47A, and adaptin-γ, which are mAb reactive with the ER, Golgi apparatus (48Chen K.

Proteasome inhibitors N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132) were purchased from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide (CHX, an inhibitor of protein synthesis), the vATPase inhibitors (Baf and CCM), and the protonophore monensin (Mon) were purchased from Sigma. All inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Subcellular Fractionation—For purification of melanosomes, we used the protocol originally described in Ref. 33Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J.

Briefly, confluent monolayers of SK-MEL-28 cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) and washed once in 0.25 m sucrose by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Specimens were then homogenized on ice using 20 strokes of a Dounce glass:glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. That supernatant was recovered and further centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2.0 m sucrose and layered at the bottom of a 1.0–2.0 m sucrose step (1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 m) gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 swinging-bucket rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, and the various layers of the fraction were carefully recovered. The 1.0 m sample was then layered in the middle of a 0.8–1.4 m sucrose step (0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 m) gradient. That gradient was again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and the 0.8 and 1.0 m fractions were carefully recovered. The various layers of fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. We used a standard technique (64Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to purify endosomes and coated vesicles. Briefly, SK-MEL-28 cells were harvested and washed once in MES buffer (0.1 m sodium MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% sodium azide, and a protease inhibitor mixture) by centrifugation at 1,250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Specimens were then homogenized on ice using 20 strokes of a glass:glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 120,000 × g in a Sorvall T1270 rotor for 70 min at 4 °C. That pellet was again homogenized on ice using 10 strokes of a glass: glass homogenizer in Percoll-sucrose-MES buffer (12.5% Percoll, 12.5% sucrose, MES) and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet was recovered, resuspended in buffer, and used as the endosomerich fraction. The supernatant was recovered and was again centrifuged at 82,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C; the resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer and used as the coated vesicle fraction. For purification of ER and Golgi apparatus, we used a previously published method (65Zhang J. Herscovitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7459-7468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, SK-MEL-28 cells were harvested and washed once in 0.25 m sucrose by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Specimens were then homogenized on ice using 20 strokes of a glass:glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. That supernatant was recovered and was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g in a Sorvall T1270 rotor for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1.35 m sucrose and layered in the middle of a 0.8–2.1 m sucrose step (0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.35, and 2.1 m) gradient, which was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 swinging-bucket rotor for 6 h at 4 °C. The 0.8 and 1.0 m layers were carefully recovered and used as the Golgi-rich fraction, whereas the layers of the 1.35 and 2.1 m fractions were recovered and used as the ER-rich fraction. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was prepared from 10 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT, Invitrogen). PCR reactions consisted of 30 cycles for TYR, TYRP1, and G3PDH. PCR reactions were initiated with a “cold start” followed by denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 °C for 45 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 60s. The primer sequences used were as follows: TYR sense primer 5′-TTGGCAGATTGTCTGTAGCC-3′; TYR antisense primer 5′-AGGCATTGTGCATGCTGCTT-3′; TYRP1 sense primer 5′-GGAAAATGCCCCTATTGGAC-3′; TYRP1 antisense primer 5′-AAAGGGTCTTCCCAGCTTTG-3′; G3PDH sense primer 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; G3PDH antisense primer 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. PCR products for TYR, TYRP1, and G3PDH were 284, 500, and 452 bp, respectively, and were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide in parallel with DNA molecular weight markers. Blots were quantitated using ScionImage software (Scion, Frederick, MD). Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed as reported previously (33Kushimoto T. Basrur V. Matsunaga J.

Briefly, cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. After several washes in PBS, cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). The samples were then stored in PBS at 4 °C until they were embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined with a Zeiss EM 912 EX electron microscope. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated in 2-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL), incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in minimum essential medium supplemented with or without 10 μm Mon, 25 nm Baf, or 25 nm CCM, and stained by double indirect immunofluorescence methods as described previously (33Kushimoto T.

After three washes in PBS, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. After three further washes in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature (for Vti1b, syntaxin 8, HMB45, T311) or with 100% methanol for 15 min at 4 °C (for Bip/GRP78, EEA1) and then blocked with 5%"
https://openalex.org/W2012253608,"The fusion protein PML-RARalpha, generated by the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2) translocation associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), initiates APL when expressed in the early myeloid compartment of transgenic mice. PML-RARalpha is cleaved in several positions by a neutral serine protease in a human myeloid cell line; purification revealed that the protease is neutrophil elastase (NE). Immunofluorescence localization studies suggested that the cleavage of PML-RARalpha must occur within the cell, and perhaps, within the nucleus. The functional importance of NE for APL development was assessed in NE deficient mice. Greater than 90% of bone marrow PML-RARalpha cleaving activity was lost in the absence of NE, and NE (but not Cathepsin G) deficient animals were protected from APL development. Primary mouse and human APL cells also contain NE-dependent PML-RARalpha cleaving activity. Since NE is maximally produced in promyelocytes, this protease may play a role in APL pathogenesis by facilitating the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARalpha."
https://openalex.org/W2093485207,"In brain mitochondria, state 4 respiration supported by the NAD-linked substrates glutamate/malate in the presence of EGTA promotes a high rate of exogenous H2O2 removal. Omitting EGTA decreases the H2O2 removal rate by almost 80%. The decrease depends on the influx of contaminating Ca2+, being prevented by the Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor ruthenium red. Arsenite is also an inhibitor (maximal effect ∼40%, IC50, 12 μm). The H2O2 removal rate (EGTA present) is decreased by 20% during state 3 respiration and by 60–70% in fully uncoupled conditions. H2O2 removal in mitochondria is largely dependent on glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Both enzyme activities, as studied in disrupted mitochondria, are inhibited by Ca2+. Glutathione reductase is decreased by 70% with an IC50 of about 0.9 μm, and glutathione peroxidase is decreased by 38% with a similar IC50. The highest Ca2+ effect with glutathione reductase is observed in the presence of low concentrations of H2O2. With succinate as substrate, the removal is 50% less than with glutamate/malate. This appears to depend on succinate-supported production of H2O2 by reverse electron flow at NADH dehydrogenase competing with exogenous H2O2 for removal. Succinate-dependent H2O2 is inhibited by rotenone, decreased ΔΨ, as described previously, and by ruthenium red and glutamate/malate. These agents also increase the measured rate of exogenous H2O2 removal with succinate. Succinate-dependent H2O2 generation is also inhibited by contaminating Ca2+. Therefore, Ca2+ acts as an inhibitor of both H2O2 removal and the succinate-supported H2O2 production. It is concluded that mitochondria function as intracellular Ca2+-modulated peroxide sinks. In brain mitochondria, state 4 respiration supported by the NAD-linked substrates glutamate/malate in the presence of EGTA promotes a high rate of exogenous H2O2 removal.

Glutathione reductase is decreased by 70% with an IC50 of about 0.9 μm, and glutathione peroxidase is decreased by 38% with a similar IC50. The highest Ca2+ effect with glutathione reductase is observed in the presence of low concentrations of H2O2. With succinate as substrate, the removal is 50% less than with glutamate/malate. This appears to depend on succinate-supported production of H2O2 by reverse electron flow at NADH dehydrogenase competing with exogenous H2O2 for removal. Succinate-dependent H2O2 is inhibited by rotenone, decreased ΔΨ, as described previously, and by ruthenium red and glutamate/malate. These agents also increase the measured rate of exogenous H2O2 removal with succinate. Succinate-dependent H2O2 generation is also inhibited by contaminating Ca2+. Therefore, Ca2+ acts as an inhibitor of both H2O2 removal and the succinate-supported H2O2 production. It is concluded that mitochondria function as intracellular Ca2+-modulated peroxide sinks. It is generally believed that the mitochondrial electron transfer chain is one of the major cellular generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesHRPhorseradish peroxidaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGRglutathione reductaseGPXglutathione peroxidaseFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneRRruthenium red.1The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesHRPhorseradish peroxidaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGRglutathione reductaseGPXglutathione peroxidaseFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneRRruthenium red. which include superoxide (O2·¯), H2O2, and the hydroxyl free radical OH· (1Loschen G.

The mitochondrial production of ROS is supposed to be important in the aging process and in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (4Betarbet R. Sherer T.B.

Furthermore, evidence has been presented recently that diabetic complications may be secondary to hyperglycemia-induced generation of ROS by mitochondria (6Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (6928) Google Scholar). It was found that some electrons leak out from accumulating unstable intermediates of the respiratory chain, performing a partial reduction of molecular oxygen, generating O2·¯, which is in turn rapidly dismutated by Mn-superoxide dismutase to H2O2 (7Loschen G. Azzi A. Flohe L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 8Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). There is, however, some controversy as to whether mitochondria are an important source of ROS under physiological and pathological conditions (9Forman H.J. Azzi A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 374-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). H2O2 production has been ascribed to Complex I and Complex III of the respiratory chain, being induced in deenergized mitochondria by succinate in the presence of antimycin or by NAD-linked substrates in the presence of rotenone (11Turrens J.F.

Some studies were conducted more recently in coupled mitochondria in the absence of respiration inhibitors. In these, it was shown that H2O2 is produced during controlled (state 4) succinate oxidation (succinate feeds electrons to Complex II, which in turn reduces Complex III) and that such production is abolished by decreasing Δψ (i.e. during ADP-stimulated respiration, state 3), and oddly, also in the presence of the Complex I inhibitor rotenone (15Cino M. Del Maestro R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg.

These results are a strong evidence that succinate-supported H2O2 production in coupled mitochondria does not derive from Complex III (as with antimycin) but rather from energy-dependent reverse electron transfer to Complex I and autooxidation of some carrier therein, either iron-sulfur centers (21Herrero A.

Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) whose reduction is prevented by rotenone when the electrons originate from succinate. Some experiments were reported using NAD-dependent substrates, and it appeared that little or no H2O2 was produced in these conditions during state 4 respiration (19Starkov A.A. Polster B.M. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar).In this study, we analyze a previously undescribed aspect of H2O2 handling by mitochondria, namely their ability to remove exogenously supplied H2O2. We demonstrate that H2O2 is actively removed by respiring mitochondria and identify a physiologically significant inhibitory control exerted by Ca2+ on such removal. We also report on the properties and controls of mitochondrial production of H2O2 and figure out the balance between H2O2-removing and H2O2-producing processes in non-inhibited respiring mitochondria. The possibility that mitochondria may be engaged in active removal of H2O2 has been suggested some years ago (24Sandri G. Panfili E. Ernster L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Scopoletin (7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one), bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid free), the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, pentapotassium salt, and glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) were supplied from Sigma. Peroxidase from horseradish (HRP) (grade I, EC 1.11.1.7) was from Roche Applied Science. The Ca2+ fluorescent dye Calcium-Green-5N was from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were of analytical grade.Preparation of Rat Brain Mitochondria—The cerebral cortices of two 6–7-week-old rats were rapidly removed into 20 ml if ice-cold isolation medium (320 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm EGTA, pH 7.3) and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of isolation medium. This was layered on a discontinuous gradient consisting of 4 ml of 6% Ficoll, 1.5 ml of 9% Ficoll, and 4 ml of 12% Ficoll (all prepared in isolation medium) and centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 30 min. The myelin, synaptosomal, and free mitochondrial fractions formed respectively above the 6% layer, as a doublet within the 9% layer and as a pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.2, and centrifuged at 8500 × g for 15 min before being resuspended in this last medium to 10–20 mg of protein/ml by the Gornall protein assay. The mitochondria were well coupled as judged by the increment of the oxygen consumption rate upon the addition of ADP (respiratory control ratio), which was between 3.5 and 7.0 with glutamate/malate as substrates. Oxygen consumption was monitored with a Clark-type oxygen electrode.Standard Incubation Procedure—Mitochondria (0.4–0.6 mg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C in a medium containing 125 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 500 μg/ml defatted bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2, adjusted with KOH).Hydrogen Peroxide Measurements—Mitochondrial H2O2 removal and H2O2 release were assessed by the oxidation of scopoletin by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 (1Loschen G. Flohe L. Chance B. FEBS Lett. 1971; 18: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 25Boveris A. Nartino E. Stoppani A.O.M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Scopoletin fluorescence was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 450 nm, respectively, on a Shimadzu RL-5000 spectrofluorometer in a stirred cuvette thermostatted at 30 °C. For measurements of H2O2 consumption, H2O2 was added to respiring mitochondria generally at 3 min of incubation, and residual H2O2 was determined by the addition of scopoletin (5 μm) followed 20 s later by HRP (15 μg/ml, 3.75 units). The interval between scopoletin and HRP was necessary to allow stabilization of the fluorescence signal after scopoletin. In the absence of HRP, the scopoletin fluorescence remained unmodified for over a minute. HRP promoted an immediate fluorescence decrease, which was proportional to H2O2. After reaching equilibrium, each trace was calibrated with standard H2O2 additions. The H2O2 calibration scale is slightly non-linear, and the overall fluorescence decrease in each trace was compared with a calibration scale obtained by the addition of known amounts of H2O2 to mitochondria that were treated with HRP plus scopoletin. The addition of HRP to a scopoletin containing medium in the absence of H2O2 gave a small non-specific fluorescence variation, which was subtracted from each curve to obtain the correct measurements. The zero time H2O2 concentration was determined by adding H2O2 to mitochondria that were already treated with HRP and scopoletin. Alternatively, H2O2 was supplemented to uncoupled scopoletin-treated mitochondria in the presence of malonate, and HRP was added few s later. No fluorescence decrease was detected in the absence of HRP.For measurements of H2O2 production, mitochondria were supplemented with scopoletin and HRP at 2 min of incubation followed by the addition of substrates and inhibitors as detailed in the figures. At the end of the experiment, each trace was calibrated with standard H2O2.Measurement of Mitochondrial NAD(P)H—The mitochondrial NADP reduction was monitored by recording its relative fluorescence intensity at 348 nm (excitation) and 464 nm (emission) with a Shimadzu RL-5000 spectrofluorometer in a stirred cuvette thermostatted at 30 °C. Mitochondria were suspended at 0.4 mg/ml in sucrose-containing medium (250 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 500 μg/ml defatted bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH). Substrates were added at 90 s of incubation. Since the baseline fluorescence trace without substrates exhibited a decline with time, which was also more accentuated in the absence of EGTA, the fluorescence traces reported in Fig. 7 represent the difference fluorescence between the trace with substrate and a parallel trace (with or without EGTA) without substrateGlutathione Reductase (GR) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPX) Activities—For measurements of GR and GPX activities, mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in a small volume of H2O and subjected to 2–3 cycles of freeze-thawing. Aliquots of disrupted mitochondria (∼0.9 mg) were suspended in 1.6 ml of incubation medium (pH 7.35). NADPH was supplemented at 125 μm. To monitor the combined GR and GPX activities, NADPH oxidation, measured at 345 nm (excitation) and 450 nm (emission), was initiated by the addition of GSH (1 mm) and H2O2 (as detailed in the figures) (Scheme 1).Scheme 1GR activity was monitored as detailed in the legend for Fig. 8. GPX activity was measured by following NADPH oxidation with GSH and H2O2 and the further presence of commercial dialyzed GR (0.4 μg/1.6 ml:0.4 units/1.6 ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Other Assays—The mitochondrial glutathione was determined in mitochondrial pellets after incubation, by the method of Tietze et al. (26Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5502) Google Scholar) as modified by Xia et al. (27Xia Y. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Nutr. 1985; 115: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) as in Ref. 28Zoccarato F. Deana R. Cavallini L. Alexandre A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar. Free Ca2+ concentrations in the incubation medium were calculated using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2, pentapotassium salt (with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 340 and 505 nm, respectively; KD 320 nm) and the fluorescent dye Calcium-Green-5N (with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 505 and 535 nm, respectively; KD 14 μm). The use of the low affinity Ca2+ indicator Calcium-Green-5N and the high affinity Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (and pentapotassium salt) can give an indication of the magnitude of free Ca2+ concentration in the incubation medium. Δψ was estimated using fluorescence quenching of the cationic dye safranine O, which is accumulated and quenched inside energized mitochondria (29Akerman K.E.O. Wikstrom M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 495, and the emission wavelength was 586 nm, and the dye concentration used was 2 μm.RESULTSIn the first group of experiments, we investigated the fate of exogenous H2O2, supplied in small amounts to brain mitochondria during controlled (state 4) or ADP-stimulated (state 3) respiration. As shown in Fig. 1, exogenous H2O2 was removed slowly in the absence of respiratory substrates. In these experiments, malonate, which by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase limits the cycling of endogenous substrates, and an uncoupler to minimize NADPH generation via energy-dependent transhydrogenase, were generally also included (Fig. 1). This background removal may depend on contaminating catalase or the non-specific action of heme proteins. When controlled (state 4) respiration was activated with glutamate/malate, which feed electrons to Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain, the rate of exogenous H2O2 removal was substantially increased. In a series of experiments, the net removal rate was 6.4 ± 0.6 nmol × min–1 × mg–1, mean ± S.E., n = 7. Coupled respiration leads to extensive NADP reduction via energy-dependent transhydrogenase; in turn, NADPH promotes GSSG reduction via GR, and the GSH thus formed activates the GPX-mediated H2O2 removal. The GR/GPX system is considered to account for most of the mitochondrial peroxidase activity. These results show that respiring mitochondria are net removers, rather than producers, of H2O2 (see Scheme 2).Fig. 1Respiration-supported removal of H2O2. Mitochondria (0.85 mg/1.6 ml) were incubated in standard incubation medium containing EGTA (375 μm). H2O2 (8 nmol) was added at 2 min. Residual H2O2 was determined at selected times as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Further additions are as follows: malonate (0.3 mm) and FCCP (3 μm) (○); glutamate (2 mm) and malate (2 mm) (•); succinate (2 mm)(▵); succinate followed by rotenone (1.5 μm) added 20 s prior to H2O2 (□); succinate, glutamate, and malate (▪); succinate followed by ruthenium red (1 μm) added 20 s prior to H2O2 (▴). Data points from a single experiment are representative of at least seven independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Scheme 2Succinate (succ) oxidation (1) generates Δψ, which drives reverse electron flow from NAD to NADH at Complex I (2) and NADH-supported NADP reduction via energy dependent transhydrogenase (3). Glutamate plus malate (glut/mal) generate NADH, whose oxidation also generates Δψ and NADPH. NADPH promotes GSSG reduction via GR (4); in, turn GSH promotes H2O2 removal via GPX (5). Reactions 4 and 5 are Ca2+-inhibited. Succinate-induced reverse electron flow at Complex I is accompanied by intramitochondrial generation of O2·¯. O2·¯ production is inhibited by rotenone, Ca2+, RR, glutamate plus malate, and decreased Δψ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next studied H2O2 removal using succinate as the substrate. Succinate feeds electrons to CoQ of the inner mitochondrial membrane, via Complex II. Also, with succinate, NAD(P) is highly reduced, due to reverse electron transfer through Complex I to NAD followed by NADP reduction via energy-dependent transhydrogenase (Refs. 16Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar and 18Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar and see below). Despite the similarity of the redox state of the NADP pool with succinate and glutamate/malate, the removal of exogenous H2O2 was ∼50% slower with succinate (6.4 ± 0.6 (with glutamate/malate) versus 3.3 ± 0.4 (with succinate) nmol of H2O2 removed/mg × min, mean ± S.E., n = 5). However, if rotenone was supplied immediately prior to H2O2 during succinate oxidation, the succinate-supported H2O2 removal increased, to a level comparable with that with glutamate/malate (Fig. 1). Thus, manipulating the activity of Complex I, which lies uphill of the entry point of electrons from succinate, affects the activity of mitochondrial H2O2 removal. This result is reminiscent of the finding that succinate-supported H2O2 production is inhibited by rotenone (15Cino M. Del Maestro R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg.

The succinate-supported removal in state 3 was just about the same as in state 4. In the presence of the uncoupler FCCP, H2O2 removal was strongly decreased. Some residual activity was, however, still clearly evident with glutamate/malate (Table I).Table IH2O2 removal by respiring mitochondria in different metabolic conditionsH2O2 removalnmol/mg × minMalonate and FCCP0.3 ± 0.2Glutamate/malate and EGTA6.7 ± 0.6Glutamate/malate, EGTA, and ADP (1.5 mm)5.6 ± 0.5Glutamate/malate, EGTA, and FCCP2.6 ± 0.6Glutamate/malate1.4 ± 0.4Glutamate/malate, EGTA; ruthenium red at 45 s, CaCl2 at 1 min6.5 ± 0.5Succinate, EGTA3.2 ± 0.4Succinate, EGTA, and ADP3.5 ± 0.4Succinate, EGTA, and FCCP0.9 ± 0.4Succinate, EGTA, and rotenone5.4 ± 0.5Succinate, EGTA, and glutamate/malate4.8 ± 0.5Succinate1.2 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Ca2+and Arsenite Inhibit the Glutamate-Malate-supported H2O2 Removal—The experiments of Fig. 1 were performed in the presence of EGTA. Surprisingly, omitting EGTA from the incubation medium reduced by about 80% the glutamate/malate-supported net rate of measured exogenous H2O2 removal (Fig. 2). Such inhibition was due to Ca2+ contamination of the incubation medium (∼6 μm). In fact, a similar level of inhibition was observed also in EGTA-containing media supplied with enough Ca2+ to increase its free concentration to the low μm range, thus ruling out an effect of EGTA per se or of some other contaminating ion. Furthermore, Ca2+ influx into the mitochondria was required for inhibition to occur since the Ca2+ inhibition of exogenous H2O2 removal was prevented by ruthenium red (RR), an inhibitor of the Ca2+ uniporter, supplemented in the presence of EGTA and prior to Ca2+ addition. As will be reported below, the Ca2+ effect depends on the Ca2+ inhibition of the GR/GPX system and represents a novel unanticipated control of the mitochondrial handling of ROS.Fig. 2Ca2+ and arsenite inhibit the respiration-supported removal of H2O2. Mitochondria were incubated in standard incubation medium. Further additions are as follows: malonate and FCCP (○); glutamate and malate (•); glutamate/malate, EGTA, and CaCl2 (375 μm)(▴); glutamate/malate and EGTA followed by ruthenium red at 45 s and CaCl2 at 1 min(▵); glutamate/malate, EGTA, and arsenite (50 μm) (□); glutamate/malate, arsenite, EGTA, and CaCl2 (▪).

EGTA is present. The data ± S.E. are collected from three preparations, with at least four determinations per each arsenite concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The glutamate/malate-supported removal of exogenous H2O2 in the presence of EGTA was partially inhibited by the vicinal thiol reagent arsenite (Fig. 2). The arsenite-sensitive component represents about 40% of the overall peroxidase activity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of arsenite was ∼12 μm (Fig. 2, inset). Arsenite was without effect on the rate of glutamate/malate oxidation. The highest inhibition (over 90%) of mitochondria-associated peroxidase activity was obtained when Ca2+ and arsenite were present together (Fig. 2). An overall picture of the H2O2 removal activity and of some relevant controls is reported in Table I.Succinate-supported H2O2 Production and Its Controls—We investigated the possibility that the different rates of exogenous H2O2 removal with glutamate/malate and succinate in the presence of EGTA as described above could be related to different rates of H2O2 production by the mitochondria with different substrates and in different metabolic situations, leading to a competition between external and internal H2O2 for the mitochondrial peroxidase(s). Peroxide production in coupled mitochondria was studied in the presence of HRP and scopoletin, providing a trap system that removes H2O2 immediately upon reaching the extramitochondrial space. In the absence of a suitable trap, no H2O2 accumulation took place. This may be expected in view of the new finding that mitochondria are net removers of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 3A (trace a), coupled mitochondria respiring on succinate in the presence of EGTA released H2O2. On the contrary, H2O2 release with glutamate/malate was hardly detectable (trace d). The succinate-dependent H2O2 was removed by rotenone and during state 3 respiration, which decreases Δψ (traces f and e) as already described by others. Furthermore, H2O2 release was prevented if EGTA was omitted (or in the presence of EGTA and enough Ca2+ to reach a low μm free Ca2+ concentration) (trace c). Such Ca2+ inhibition occurred without affecting ΔΨ, as monitored following safranine fluorescence (Fig. 4), and appears to represent a direct action of Ca2+ on the site of superoxide production. Also RR inhibited H2O2 release, in the presence of EGTA, apparently via a direct interaction with the superoxide production site at Complex I (Fig. 3A, trace b). Furthermore, H2O2 release was strongly depressed by glutamate/malate, probably because they decrease reverse electron flow from succinate (trace g). The latter effect increased with decreasing succinate concentration, Fig. 3C.Fig. 3H2O2 production by respiring mitochondria. Mitochondria (0.7 mg/1.6 ml) were incubated in standard medium.

https://openalex.org/W2076613161,"The bacterial surface protein flagellin is widely distributed and well conserved among distant bacterial species. We and other investigators have reported recently that purified flagellin from Salmonella dublin or recombinant flagellin of Salmonella muenchen origin binds to the eukaryotic toll receptor TLR5 and activates the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase, resulting in the release of a host of pro-inflammatory mediators in vitro and in vivo. The amino acid sequence alignment of flagellins from various Gram-negative bacteria shows that the C and N termini are well conserved. It is possible that sequences within the N and C termini or both may regulate the pro-inflammatory activity of flagellin. Here we set out to map more precisely the regions in both termini that are required for TLR5 activation and pro-inflammatory signaling. Systematic deletion of amino acids from either terminus progressively reduced eukaryotic pro-inflammatory activation. However, deletion of amino acids 95–108 (motif N) in the N terminus and 441–449 (motif C) in the C terminus abolished pro-inflammatory activity completely. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis provided further evidence for the importance of motifs N and C. We also present evidence for the functional role of motifs N and C with the TLR5 receptor using a reporter assay system. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory activity of flagellin results from the interaction of motif N with the TLR5 receptor on the cell surface. The bacterial surface protein flagellin is widely distributed and well conserved among distant bacterial species. We and other investigators have reported recently that purified flagellin from Salmonella dublin or recombinant flagellin of Salmonella muenchen origin binds to the eukaryotic toll receptor TLR5 and activates the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase, resulting in the release of a host of pro-inflammatory mediators in vitro and in vivo. The amino acid sequence alignment of flagellins from various Gram-negative bacteria shows that the C and N termini are well conserved. It is possible that sequences within the N and C termini or both may regulate the pro-inflammatory activity of flagellin. Here we set out to map more precisely the regions in both termini that are required for TLR5 activation and pro-inflammatory signaling. Systematic deletion of amino acids from either terminus progressively reduced eukaryotic pro-inflammatory activation. However, deletion of amino acids 95–108 (motif N) in the N terminus and 441–449 (motif C) in the C terminus abolished pro-inflammatory activity completely. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis provided further evidence for the importance of motifs N and C. We also present evidence for the functional role of motifs N and C with the TLR5 receptor using a reporter assay system. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory activity of flagellin results from the interaction of motif N with the TLR5 receptor on the cell surface. The whiplike flagellum of Gram-negative bacterium is implicated in microbial pathogenicity, serving as a means of propulsion and attachment and invasion of host epithelium. Recently it has been shown that the monomeric constituent of flagella, the 55-kDa protein flagellin, is a potent activator of pro-inflammatory eukaryotic cell signaling via its interaction with membrane-bound TLR5. Flagellin-TLR5 binding induces NF-κB nuclear translocation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, resulting in the up-regulated expression of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinNOnitric oxidePAMPSpathogen-associated molecular patternsTLRToll-like receptorsDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumIFN-γinterferon-γELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysCHOChinese hamster ovaryLPSlipopolysaccharide.1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinNOnitric oxidePAMPSpathogen-associated molecular patternsTLRToll-like receptorsDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumIFN-γinterferon-γELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysCHOChinese hamster ovaryLPSlipopolysaccharide.-6, chemokines, including IL-8, and pro-inflammatory free radical synthesizing enzymes, such as the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (1Feldman M.

Because many Gram-negative pathogens express flagellin, it is conceivable that flagella contribute to the host inflammatory response to infection. Evidence in support of this role comes from experimental studies in which we have shown that administration of flagellin engenders systemic tissue injury, characterized by exudative lung inflammation, liver necrosis, and circulatory shock. Therefore, flagellin presents all the features of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and can be regarded as another PAMP. interleukin nitric oxide pathogen-associated molecular patterns Toll-like receptors Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol electrophoretic mobility shift assays Chinese hamster ovary lipopolysaccharide. interleukin nitric oxide pathogen-associated molecular patterns Toll-like receptors Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol electrophoretic mobility shift assays Chinese hamster ovary lipopolysaccharide. Therapeutic opportunities to interrupt the pathologic effects of flagellin will be based upon a precise delineation of its interaction with TLR5 that induces pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Biochemical analysis of Salmonella flagellin reveals that both conserved domains within both termini are important in inducing pro-inflammatory responses in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (6Eaves-Pyles T.D. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Pyles R.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7009-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that the hypervariable domain is not involved in pro-inflammatory activation. A recombinantly expressed flagellin mutant, in which the central hypervariable domain was deleted, was shown not to detract from its ability to induce NF-κB signaling, suggesting that the highly conserved N and C termini are sufficient for TLR5 activation (6Eaves-Pyles T.D. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Pyles R.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7009-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Further definition of the pro-inflammatory flagellin sequences has been provided by evidence that neutralization of the N-terminal “RINSA” domain (amino acid 31–52) by monoclonal antibodies blocks the proinflammatory activity of recombinant flagellins of different bacterial origin (5Eaves-Pyles T. Murthy K. Liaudet L. Virag L. Ross G. Soriano F.G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recent studies (7Mizel S.B. West A.P.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4243-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have also delineated the extramembranous region of TLR5 responsible for flagellin binding. The crystal structure of flagellin resembles an aircraft, with two wings and a central rod-shaped body. The core of the latter is derived from the α-helices of both the N and C termini, whereas the outer surface of the rod is constituted by the hypervariable domain (9Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Recently, interest has been focused on Salmonella flagellin and its role in the induction of host pro-inflammatory responses. Although recombinant flagellin or flagella from other Gram-negative organisms, such as Serratia, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Escherichia, and Yersinia, stimulate pro-inflammatory responses, recombinant flagellin or flagella from Salmonella strains are generally the most potent inducers (2McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Ciacci-Woolwine F. McDermott P.F. Mizel S.B. Infect.

A. 2001; 98: 13722-13727Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). LPS and flagellin induce similar pro-inflammatory responses, but flagellin is much more potent and induces widespread oxidative stress in most organs (11Liaudet L. Murthy K.G. Mabley J.G. Pacher P. Soriano F.G. Salzman A.L. Szabo C. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously, it was thought that pro-inflammatory activity of flagellin might be secondary to contaminating LPS, but extensive studies have confirmed the intrinsic pro-inflammatory properties of flagellin. It is now clear that Toll-like receptors (TLR) are involved in the signal transduction pathways of mammalian, insect, and plant PAMPs. TLRs are an evolutionarily conserved family of receptors that function in innate immunity. These proteins consist of an extracellular domain with a leucine-rich repeat, one or two cysteine-rich regions, and a cytoplasmic region called the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain. The mechanism of TLR signaling is quite similar to that of the IL-1 receptor family, because both receptor families possess Toll/IL-1 receptor domains. Recently, it has been shown that TLR5 mediates flagellin-dependent signaling in transfected mammalian cells (12Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB-mediated gene expression in the TLR5 signal transduction pathway involves a signaling complex that includes MyD88 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (12Hayashi F. Smith K.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22414-22420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Further studies also demonstrated that TLR5 is expressed on the basolateral surface of intestine epithelial cells, and flagellin translocates across epithelial monolayers from the luminal domain to the basolateral membrane domain (15Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P.O. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 16Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was established that TLR5 forms heterodimeric complexes with TLR4 as well as homomeric complexes and that these TLR5-TLR4 complexes are involved in the induction of nitric-oxide synthase expression by flagellin (17Mizel S.B. Honko A.N. Moors M.A. Smith P.S. West A.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6217-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present investigation was to further define the regions in the N and C termini that contribute to the eukaryotic pro-inflammatory activity of flagellin. By using deletion and site-directed mutagenic methods, we have mapped the active site to a relatively short region in the N- and C-terminal domains. Additional evidence is provided on the specific region of flagellin responsible for functional activation of TLR-5. Cell Culture and NO Production Assay—Monolayers of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 fibroblast cells (ATCC, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) grown in RPMI 1650 (Invitrogen) were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. DLD-1 cells (ATCC) grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) were supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mm glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. Cells, between passages 5 and 15, were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates and allowed to grow 72–96 h to confluence before use. Growth medium was changed the day before use. Cells were washed once with DMEM without FBS but containing antibiotics before the addition of flagellin proteins diluted in DMEM containing IFN-γ and antibiotics. After incubating cells with flagellin for 20 h, culture supernatants were collected. The combined concentration of nitrite and nitrate, the degradation products of NO in the culture medium, was determined by the Griess reaction after nitrate reduction, as described previously (18Salzman A. Denenberg A.G. Ueta I. O'Connor M. Linn S.C. Szabo C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G565-G573PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 Secretion—Human alveolar epithelial cells (A549), an adenocarcinoma cell line with the alveolar type 2 phenotype, were grown in 96-well plates in RPMI 1650 medium containing 10% FBS. Confluent cells were stimulated with recombinant flagellin for 24 h. The conditioned medium (in 96-well plates) was aspirated, centrifuged, and assayed for the production of IL-8 by commercial ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Construction of Wild-type and Mutant Flagellin Plasmid DNAs—The construction of a bacterial expression plasmid pET30-Fla containing S. muenchen flagellin-coding sequences has been described previously (5Eaves-Pyles T. Murthy K. Liaudet L. Virag L. Ross G. Soriano F.G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains an N-terminal His6 fusion under control of a T7 promoter and was used as the base for subsequent mutagenesis. To construct truncation, deletion, and chimeric mutant plasmids, appropriate oligonucleotides with restriction sites were used to PCR-amplify flagellin sequences. PCR was performed on 10 ng of template DNA in a 50-μl volume using PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) and 0.5 μm concentrations of each primer for 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, agarose gel-purified, and ligated into a pET-30C (Novagen, Madison, WI) plasmid after the plasmid had been cut with corresponding enzymes and gel-purified. To construct NC and its deletion derivatives (e.g. mNC8, mNC6, and mNC4) without the hypervariable region, two separate PCR products of N- and C-terminal domains were inserted into an expression plasmid simultaneously. Point mutations in the flagellin gene were created by site-directed mutagenesis (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The recombinant plasmids were then introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) by transformation and selected in the presence of kanamycin (50 μg/ml). All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Cloning and Expression of Human TLR5—Full-length human TLR5 cDNA was cloned from a human fetal lung library. A mammalian expression vector containing FLAG epitope sequences fused to the N-terminal end of TLR5 was generated by inserting TLR5 coding sequences into a eukaryotic expression vector pFLAG-CMV3 (Sigma). Expression levels of TLR5 protein in CHO cells were monitored by transient transfection followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (M2 monoclonal, Sigma) and anti-TLR5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. GFP Reporter Plasmid Construction—IL-8 promoter sequences were amplified by PCR using a recombinant plasmid DNA (a kind gift from Dr. Gary D. Wu, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) as the template. The following primers with restriction sites (underlined) were used: forward IL-8 (135), 5′-GCCATCGATGAAGTGTGATGACTCAGG; IL-8 (+46), 5′-CCGGAATTCGAAGCTTGTGTGCTCTGC. PCR-generated DNA was digested with ClaI plus EcoRI and subcloned into the ClaI/EcoRI sites of pGLOW-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) yielding the reporter construct WT-GFP. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—A single colony of E. coli containing the desired plasmid was grown at 37 °C in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin to an A600 of 0.5 and then induced for 3 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Following induction, bacteria were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). Cell-free lysates were prepared in 6 m guanidine chloride containing 5 mm imidazole and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (binding buffer). After removing the insoluble material by centrifugation, the lysate was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) column, washed extensively with binding buffer, and then eluted with binding buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The purified proteins were extensively dialyzed against PBS, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. The final proteins were checked by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining to assess protein purity, integrity, and concentration (Fig. 1B). Stable Transfections—CHO-K1 cells (2 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm dishes and transfected the following day with 5 μg of WT-GFP DNA. All transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 4 h of incubation, medium was removed, and cells were supplemented with fresh medium containing 10% FBS and allowed to grow for 20 h. Cells were then trypsinized, seeded at a lower density in 15-cm plates, and allowed to grow in a medium containing 400 μg/ml G418, and the medium was replaced twice a week for 3–4 weeks. G418-resistant clones were transferred individually to small plates and propagated in G418 medium before analysis. Similarly, the G418-resistant clones were retransfected with the blasticidin-resistant vector (pEF6, Invitrogen) encoding full-length TLR5, and double stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 and 2 μg/ml blasticidin. The clones were analyzed by immunoblotting for proper phenotype. Preparation of Whole Cell and Nuclear Extracts—Whole cell or nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (19Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were removed from the plate by scraping into PBS, harvested, and washed twice in PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After removing the insoluble material by centrifugation, supernatants were collected and stored at -70 °C in aliquots. To prepare nuclear extracts, cell pellets were suspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). After 10 min of incubation at 4 °C, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) was added, and the tubes were vortexed gently for 10 s. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the pellets were suspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). The tubes were vigorously vortexed and rocked at 4 °C for 15 min. Nuclear protein extracts were obtained by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), and aliquots of the supernatant were stored at -70 °C. Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts (50 μg) were mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS protein gel loading buffer, boiled, and fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoretically separated proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 16 h at 4 °C and then with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG or anti-GFP (Sigma) for 3 h. Blots were washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Standard DNA binding assays were performed using 0.5 ng of labeled probe. NF-κB oligonucleotide was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). For the EMSA analysis, 5 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and γ-32P-end-labeled probe for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in low ionic strength 5% native polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× TBE as the running buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature until the dye reached the bottom of the gel. Gels were transferred to Whatman 3M paper, dried, and exposed to photographic film at -70 °C. For supershift assays, specific antibodies (p50, p65, and Stat3 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the reaction mixture as indicated and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 10 min. To test the functional significance of the conserved regions of flagellin, mutations were introduced into both terminal domains (Fig. 1), as described under “Materials and Methods.” S. muenchen flagellin coding sequences in a plasmid were used as a template to amplify mutant sequences by PCR with appropriate primers. After digesting PCR products with appropriate restriction enzymes, DNA fragments were cloned into an expression vector with His tag sequences. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to near-homogeneity under denaturing conditions in order to minimize the contamination of other bacterial proteins and endotoxins that weakly interact with recombinant flagellin, by using affinity chromatography as shown in Fig. 1B. These proteins were tested at various concentrations for biological activity by incubating with IFN-γ-primed DLD-1 cells. After incubating for 20 h, the concentration of NO (nitrite and nitrate, stable breakdown products of NO) in culture supernatant was measured. First, we made truncated recombinantly expressed proteins with deletions in the N terminus (HC, 173–505) or C terminus (NH, 1–417) or hypervariable region (NC, 1–172 + 418–505). Full-length recombinant protein, when tested at four different concentrations, elicited a significant pro-inflammatory response in DLD-1 cells at a concentration of 0.5 ng/ml, reaching a maximum response at 12.5 ng/ml. As shown in Fig. 2A, recombinant flagellin mutants lacking either terminal region failed to induce NO production. However, the recombinant NC mutant lacking the hypervariable domain induced a significant dose-dependent accumulation of NO comparable with that of wild-type recombinant flagellin. From several independent experiments, we consistently observed that the NC mutant was ∼2-fold less active at lower concentrations in comparison to the full-length recombinant protein. There was also no increase or change in the activity of the NC mutant when maltose-binding protein sequences of similar length to that of the flagellin hypervariable region were inserted between the N and C domains (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the conserved N and C domains are functionally important for pro-inflammatory signaling in eukaryotic cells and that the hypervariable domain, in contrast, is not functionally relevant to this process. The dispensability of the hypervariable domain was expected, because this region varies profoundly in length and sequence from species to species. By having established that both terminal domains of flagellin are required to stimulate a pro-inflammatory response, we next sought to determine the specific regions within each domain that are required for pro-inflammatory activity. Expression plasmids were created lacking stretches of amino acids within the N terminus (N1, 53–505; N2, 81–505; N3, 95–505 and N4, 109–505) or C terminus (C1, 1–481; C2, 1–471; C3, 1–460, C4, 1–450; and C5, 1–440). These recombinant proteins were then tested for their ability to elicit biological activity, as measured by the level of NO production, in IFN-γ-primed DLD-1 cells. Terminal truncation of flagellin diminished proinflammatory activity, in proportion to the extent of the deletion, up to a maximum deletion of 95 amino acids in the N terminus (N1, N2, and N3) and beyond 450 amino acids in the C terminus (C1, C2, C3, and C4), (Fig. 2, A and B). Further deletions in either the N terminus (N4, 109–505) or the C terminus (C5, 1–440) abolished DLD-1 production of NO induced by flagellin. Taken together, these results suggest that both termini of flagellin contribute to its pro-inflammatory activity and that critical residues involved in this process are localized to a 14-amino acid region in the N terminus (motif N, 95–108) and a 9-amino acid region in the C terminus (motif C, 441–449). Interestingly, the most highly conserved region of flagellins across Gram-negative pathogens, the so-called RINSKA region (31–47) in the N terminus, was not essential for the full induction of NO production in DLD-1 cells. Pro-inflammatory activity of flagellin is readily assayed by measuring not only NO production but also by measuring the epithelial production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12. Previously, it has been shown that epithelial cells produce IL-8 in response to flagellin (4Steiner T.S. Nataro J.P. Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Guerrant R.L. J. Clin.

Vogel S.N. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The extent of eukaryotic pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to flagellin varies according to cell type. Human intestinal epithelial (DLD-1) cells are less responsive compared with human lung epithelial (A549) cells, which have been reported to induced IL-8 expression in response to concentrations of flagellin as low as 1 pg/ml (20Liaudet L. Szabo C. Evgenov O.V. Murthy K.G. Pacher P. Virag L. Mabley J.G. Marton A. Soriano F.G. Kirov M.Y. Bjertnaes L.J. Salzman A.L. Shock. 2003; 19: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type recombinant S. muenchen flagellins, described in Fig. 2, were incubated with A549 cells for 20 h at the indicated concentrations, and IL-8 release was quantified by ELISA (Fig. 3). The results obtained with A549 cells paralleled those obtained in DLD-1 cells (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), clearly demonstrating that the N-terminal motif (95–108) and the C-terminal motif (441–449) are both essential for proinflammatory activity. Other regions in the conserved N and C termini also contributed to cytokine expression in flagellin-stimulated A549 cells but were not essential for pro-inflammatory induction. Because the findings above raised the possibility that certain deletions within the N terminus (1–94) and C terminus (451–505) have a limited effect on the induction of pro-inflammatory signaling in eukaryotic cells, we first constructed and analyzed a recombinant mutant deleting both of these regions (mtFLA, 95–450). As shown in Fig. 4A, these double deletions resulted in a near total inhibition of pro-inflammatory activity. This finding is surprising because single deletions either in the N terminus (N3, 95–505) or C terminus (1–450) have no effect on flagellin activity. We next examined these deletions in an NC construct, in which the hypervariable region was totally removed. For this purpose we made three constructs deleting part of the N terminus (mNC2, 95–172 + 418–505), C terminus (mNC3, 1–172 + 418–450), or both (mNC1, 95"

Transgenic mice expressing non-transferable lipoprotein lipase (LpL) with a glycosylated phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor in cardiomyocytes have dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms responsible for lipid accumulation and cardiomyopathy are not clear. Hearts from 3-month-old mice expressing GPI-anchored human LpL (hLpLGPI) mice had increased fatty acid oxidation and heart failure genes and decreased glucose transporter genes. 6-month-old mice had increased mRNA expression and activation of the apoptosis marker caspase-3. Moreover, hLpLGPI hearts had significant cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol. Low density lipoprotein uptake was greater in hLpLGPI hearts, and this was associated with more intracellular apolipoprotein B (apoB). To test whether lipid accumulation in the hLpLGPI heart is reduced by cardiac expression of apoB, hLpLGPI mice were bred with transgenic human apoB (HuB)-expressing mice. Hearts of HuB/hLpLGPI mice had less triglyceride (38%) and free fatty acids (19%), secreted more apoB, and expressed less atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and more glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). The increased mortality of the mice was abrogated by the transgenic expression of apoB. Therefore, we hypothesize that cardiac apoB expression improves cardiomyopathy by increasing lipid resecretion from the heart.

Therefore, we hypothesize that cardiac apoB expression improves cardiomyopathy by increasing lipid resecretion from the heart. Lipid accumulation in tissues is associated with defective function and apoptosis. This process, termed lipotoxicity (1Listenberger L.L. Schaffer J.E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), occurs in a number of tissues and is thought to be the etiology of non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis and type 2 diabetes due to lipid-induced insulin resistance (2Norris A.W.

Breningstall G.N. Stanley C.A. Singh A. Am. Heart J. 2000; 139: S96-S106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are due to defects in lipid metabolism. Diabetic and obesity cardiomyopathy also involve some degree of lipotoxicity.Lipotoxic cardiomyopathy has been found in experimental animals. Zucker fatty rats that have a defect in leptin actions have lipid infiltration within the heart and a reduction in cardiac contractility (4Zhou Y.T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Accumulation of lipids due to alterations in intracellular pathways of lipid metabolism in mice with cardiac overexpression of fatty acyl CoA synthetase (5Chiu H.C. Kovacs A. Ford D.A. Hsu F.F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) and the transcription factor PPARα (6Finck B.N. Lehman J.J. Leone T.C. Welch M.J. Bennett M.J. Kovacs A. Han X. Gross R.W. Kozak R. Lopaschuk G.D. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) leads to cardiomyopathy. Our laboratory surprisingly discovered that transgenic expression of a cardiomyocyte-anchored form of lipoprotein lipase (hLpLGPI) also caused dilated cardiomyopathy (7Yagyu H. Chen G. Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Augustus A. Kako Y. Seo T. Hu Y. Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Bensadoun A. Homma S. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is the primary enzyme responsible for conversion of lipoprotein triglyceride (TG) into free fatty acids (FFA). Although hLpLGPI hearts assimilate more very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) lipids from the circulation, the downstream steps leading to muscle dysfunction are not clear.Hearts acquire lipids from three sources: FFA associated with albumin, lipolysis of lipoprotein TG by LpL, and internalization of whole lipoproteins. These processes supply the immense metabolic demands of cardiac muscle. However, there may also be mechanisms to prevent overaccumulation of lipids that lead to cardiac muscle dysfunction. Elimination of lipids occurs by release of FFA, lipid oxidation, or lipoprotein secretion. Lipoprotein secretion has generally been thought to be limited to liver and gut. However, Young's laboratory (8Boren J. Veniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) noted that mice expressing human apolipoprotein B (apoB) had robust apoB expression in the heart; apoB mRNA expression was 3% of that of the liver; and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, the protein required to add lipid to apoB, was also found in the heart. Hearts synthesized and secreted lipoproteins (8Boren J. Veniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cardiac apoB expression led to reduced heart lipids after induction of diabetes in mice (9Nielsen L.B. Bartels E.D. Bollano E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27014-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in the presence of long chain acyl coA dehydrogenase deficiency (10Bjorkegren J. Veniant M. Kim S.K. Withycombe S.K. Wood P.A. Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38511-38517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This supported the hypothesis that heart apoB enables the heart to secrete excess lipid in lipoproteins (8Boren J. Veniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test whether apoB would affect cardiomyopathy, we studied whether transgenic apoB expression reduces heart lipids and affects heart failure markers and premature death in hLpLGPI mice.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice and Diets—hLpLGPI transgenic mice (7Yagyu H. Chen G. Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Augustus A. Kako Y. Seo T. Hu Y. Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Bensadoun A. Homma S. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have been described. The hLpLGPI mice were crossbred with HuB mice, originally created by Callow et al. (12Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), to obtain HuB/hLpLGPI mice. Two diets were used: normal chow diet that contained 4.5% (w/w) fat with 0.02% (w/w) cholesterol and Western-type diet (WD), 21% (w/w) fat (polyunsaturated/saturated = 0.07) with 0.15% cholesterol and 19.5% casein (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) (13Siri P.

Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, Sigma; 50 mg/kg of body weight) for 5 consecutive days (14Kako Y. Masse M. Huang L.S. Tall A.R. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 872-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with blood glucose of greater than 250 mg/dl were considered diabetic. For some studies, 1-month-old mice were fed WD. All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled (25 °C) facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and given free access to food. Blood from fasted (24 h) mice was collected from the retro-orbital plexus into tubes containing EDTA. Plasma TG, total and free cholesterol, FFA, and glucose were determined enzymatically by kits (Sigma) in duplicate (15Yagyu H. Lutz E.P. Kako Y. Marks S. Hu Y. Choi S.Y. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10037-10043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Analysis of RNA Microarray Data—Total RNA was isolated from hearts of 2-month-old wild type and hLpLGPI mice. Reverse transcription used oligo(dT)24 with T7 promoter sequences attached followed by strand cDNA synthesis. cRNA was then amplified and biotinylated using T7 RNA polymerase (Enzo Diagnostics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) prior to hybridization to the Affymetrix genechip mouse U74aV2 using the Affymetrix-recommended protocol (16Napoli C. de Nigris F. Welch J.S. Calara F.B. Stuart R.O. Glass C.K. Palinski W. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For comparison between experiments, expression data were globally scaled to an average intensity of 1000 using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite™ software. Significant changes were calculated by the two-tailed Student's t test at p < 0.05.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg) was isolated from hearts using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing formamide, and transferred to nylon filters (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences). Northern blot analyses were performed using the radiolabeled cDNA probes for caspase-3, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), CPT-1, and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO). The data were normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Hearts were homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in an extract buffer, which contained 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted with an assay buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DDT, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.4)) and incubated at 37 °C with 200 mm caspase-3 substrate I (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-pNA; CalBiochem). Cleavage of the substrate was monitored at 405 nm using a microplate reader and recorded in 10-min intervals for 2 h. The specific activity was expressed in picomoles per minute per mg of protein.Western Blot Analysis—Hearts from transgenic mice and matched control littermates were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were disrupted by 60 strokes in a glass-Teflon homogenizer in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were quantified by Lowry (Sigma) and 20 μg of protein separated by 5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using a mouse antibody directed against human apoB (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome c release, homogenized supernatants were pelleted by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm and resuspended in 1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture. 20 μg of mitochondrial fraction protein and 30 μg of soluble fraction protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using a mouse antibody directed against cytochrome c (PharMingen 6598A 1: 500 dilution; PharMingen). Detection was performed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Lipoprotein Uptake—LDL were isolated from HuB mice (n = 20) by sequential ultracentrifugation at 1.025 < d < 1.063 g/ml for 16 h. Immediately after isolation, LDL were labeled with non-hydrolyzable 125I-labeled tyramine cellobiose (TC) (17Pittman R.C. Carew T.E. Glass C.K. Green S.R. Taylor Jr., C.A. Attie A.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). 125I-TC was prepared using 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α, 6α-diphenylglycouril (Iodogen), and linked to LDL by activating the iodinated TC with cyanuric chloride as described previously (18Schwenke D.C. Carew T.E. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 908-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled LDL was dialyzed extensively against saline containing 1 mg/ml EDTA, sterilized by filtration through an Acrodisc (0.45 μm), stored at 4 °C, and used within 1 week. 125 μg of 125I-TC-LDL (120 cpm/ng of protein) was injected via femoral vein. The mice remained fasting during the 20-h study. At the end of the experiment, mice were anesthetized, exsanguinated, and then perfused with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml EDTA. Isolated organs were quickly rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and weighed, and radioiodine was quantified by automatic γ counter (WALLAC, 1470 wizard, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Heart Lipid Analysis—Hearts were rapidly removed and homogenized in ice-cold 1 m NaCl buffer containing protease inhibitors to prevent TG hydrolysis. Lipids were extracted from hearts (50 mg) according to methods modified from that of Folch et al. (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, snap-frozen heart tissues were homogenized and extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) solution. The organic phase was dried under nitrogen gas and resolubilized in chloroform. An aliquot of the Folch extraction was resuspended in an aqueous solution containing 2% Triton X-100 (13Siri P. Candela N. Zhang Y.L. Ko C. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Total cholesterol, free cholesterol, TG, and FFA were determined by enzymatic kit as described (15Yagyu H. Lutz E.P. Kako Y. Marks S. Hu Y. Choi S.Y. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10037-10043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Metabolic Labeling of Hearts—ApoB secretion from the hearts of control mice and mice with human apoB transgene expression was assessed as described (8Boren J. Veniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hearts were dissected free from the thoracic cavity, opened longitudinally, and flushed with ice-cold incubation medium (methionine- and cystein-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Sigma) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, 1.6 mm glutamate, and 1.6 mm sodium pyruvate. The whole heart (∼100 mg) was minced with a razor blade. After the tissue was washed twice with 1.0 ml of incubation buffer, a total of 1.0 ml of labeling medium (incubation medium containing 1.0 mCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences)) was added to an Eppendorf tube. The tube was placed in a 37 °C heating block and mixed gently every 30 min. After a total incubation time of 3 h, the heart tissues were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 1 min), and the supernatant was collected and added to 5× NET buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) with anti-human apoB antibody and the protease inhibitor mixture. After overnight incubation, the medium was added to protein-A agarose (Sigma) for immunoprecipitation and incubated for 2 h. The [35S]methionine-labeled immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE, and then fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray films to visualize labeled apoB proteins.RESULTSEffects of hLpLGPI Transgene on the Wild Type Background—Previously, we studied hLpLGPI-expressing mice crossed onto the LpL heterozygous background (7Yagyu H. Chen G. Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Augustus A. Kako Y. Seo T. Hu Y. Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Bensadoun A. Homma S. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This allowed expression of the anchored hLpL in animals that had half-normal LpL. We then tested whether the gene changes, cardiomyopathy, and mortality were similarly altered on the wild type background. Shown in Fig. 1, A and B, are the mortality curves of breeding male and female mice. Both genders had reduced survival when the transgene was expressed; at 36 weeks, only 61.5% of male and 63.6% of female mice survived. We then compared breeding and non-breeding female mice. After 36 weeks, mortality of non-breeding females was not significantly different from wild type (data not shown). Therefore, the hLpLGPI transgene leads to increased mortality that is similar in males and breeding females.Effects of Diabetes and WD in hLpLGPI Transgene—Two interventions that had increased mortality in another model of lipotoxicity were studied (20Listenberger L.L. Han X. Lewis S.E. Cases S. Farese Jr., R.V. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3077-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), high fat diets and STZ-induced diabetes. After 36 weeks, hLpLGPI mice fed a WD had increased plasma TG (78.9 ± 14.2 on chow and 104.2 ± 10.5 mg/dl on WD) and plasma glucose (81.5 ± 17.5 mg/dl on chow and 150 ± 45.5 mg/dl on WD). STZ-treated hLpLGPI had increased plasma TG and glucose, but the levels did not differ from similarly treated wild type mice; TG was 178.0 ± 74.8 mg/dl in wild mice and 185.7 ± 95.2 mg/dl in hLpLGPI mice, and glucose was 409.3 ± 109.2 mg/dl in wild mice and 419.6 ± 125.9 mg dl in hLpLGPI STZ-treated mice. Neither WD (Fig. 1, C and D) nor STZ (Fig. 1, E and F) affected the mortality of the mice.Gene Changes in hLpLGPI Mice—Using gene arrays, we specifically evaluated four clusters of genes: lipid oxidation enzymes, glucose metabolic genes, heart failure markers, and lipoproteins (Table I). We utilized younger mice (2 months old) to assess metabolic changes that were not confounded by the presence of heart failure, which occurs at a later age. Microarrays for four mice of each genotype were produced; this allowed calculation of a standard deviation of mRNA expression and significance testing. Fatty acid oxidation genes, ACO and CPT-1, were increased as noted previously (7Yagyu H. Chen G. Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Augustus A. Kako Y. Seo T. Hu Y. Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Bensadoun A. Homma S. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Scavenger receptor type B-class I (SRBI) was increased. Two SREBP-regulated genes, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) and fatty acid synthase, were also increased; however, genes involved in cholesterol metabolism including HMG-CoA reductase, LDL receptor, and long chain fatty acyl CoA synthase were unchanged (data not shown). Genes for apoproteins (AI, AII, Cs, E, and B) and receptors (LDL and VLDL) were unchanged. GLUT1, GLUT4, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were decreased, and heart failure markers (ANF, BNP, and myosin light chain) were increased.Table IComparison of gene expression in LPLGPI and wild type mice: affymetrix U34A array analysisLipid metabolismRatiop valueAccession no.

To test whether apoptosis only was manifest in older mice, we examined heart tissue for evidence of apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the expression of caspase-3 in 2- and 5–6-month-old mice. The older transgenic mice demonstrated significant release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol (Fig. 2A) and increased expression of caspase-3 (Fig. 2B). 6-month-old hLpLGPI mice showed a 2.73-fold increase in cardiac caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2C). However, young mice showed no mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and the expression and activity of caspase-3 was not different from wild type (data not shown). Therefore, apoptosis was only manifest in older animals.Fig. 2Evidence for apoptosis in hLpLGPI mice.A, cytochrome c (cyt c). Cardiac tissues from 5–6-month-old hLpLGPI mice and nontransgenic control littermates were homogenized and separated by differential density centrifugation to yield a membrane fraction (mitochondria) and soluble fraction (cytosol). Membrane protein (20 μg) and soluble protein (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-cytochrome c antibody. B, Northern blot analysis. 10 μg of total RNA was isolated from heart and subjected to Northern blot analysis for caspase-3.

Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, hLpLGPI hearts had more apoB. Increased tissue apoB might have been an adaptive response. It is also possible that the increase in apoB represented greater amounts of lipoprotein uptake into these hearts.Fig. 3Immunoblot analysis of ApoB in hearts.A, heart apoB in control and hLpLGPI mice.

Plasma lipids were compared between wild type, hLpLGPI, HuB, and HuB/hLpLGPI double transgenic mice. HuB/hLpLGPI mice had 2.2-fold greater levels of plasma cholesterol and 2.5-fold higher plasma TG levels than hLpLGPI mice (Table II). hLpLGPI expression did not alter plasma lipids.Table IIPlasma lipids in hLpLGPI and HuB/hLpLGPI miceCholesterolTGWild69.5 ± 5.578.3 ± 21.1hLpLGPI67.2 ± 2.672.5 ± 24.0HuB152.2 ± 12.4ap < 0.05 versus wild type mice.186.9 ± 23.6bp < 0.05 versus hLpLGPI mice.HuB/hLpLGPI142.1 ± 5.0ap < 0.05 versus wild type mice.183.3 ± 30.0bp < 0.05 versus hLpLGPI mice.a p < 0.05 versus wild type mice.b p < 0.05 versus hLpLGPI mice.

Open table in a new tab We then determined whether the cardiac apoB content was altered by the HuB transgene. Both HuB and HuB/hLpLGPI had much greater amounts of intracellular apoB (Fig. 3B) than did hearts not expressing HuB. However, the greatest concentration of cardiac apoB was in the double transgenic line. This increase could have resulted from either increased uptake of plasma apoB, expected in mice expressing hLpLGPI (7Yagyu H. Chen G. Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Augustus A. Kako Y. Seo T. Hu Y. Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Bensadoun A. Homma S. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), or greater cardiac apoB synthesis. To test this, we performed lipoprotein kinetic studies using LDL obtained from HuB transgenic mice that was labeled with the trapped ligand, TC. Plasma turnover of this LDL was similar in all four genotypes (Fig. 4, A and B). However, hearts of mice expressing the hLpLGPI transgene trapped nearly twice as much label as did HuB, but the uptake did not differ from hLpLGPI hearts (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the increase in intracellular apoB was due, at least in part, to endogenous apoB synthesis.Fig. 4LDL kinetic studies in HuB and HuB/hLpLGPI mice.A, plasma clearance of 125I-TC-LDL in wild type and hLpLGPI mice. 125I-TC-LDL obtained from HuB mice was used in LDL kinetic studies. 125I-TC-LDL was injected into wild type (open circles line, n = 3) and hLpLGPI (closed circles line, n = 5).

We recently described a series of small molecules that bind to the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of HPV type 11 E2 and inhibits its interaction with E1 in vitro and in cellular assays. Here we report the crystal structures of both the HPV11 TAD and of a complex between this domain and an inhibitor, at 2.5- and 2.4-Å resolution, respectively. The HPV11 TAD structure is very similar to that of the analogous domain of HPV16. Inhibitor binding caused no significant alteration of the protein backbone, but movements of several amino acid side chains at the binding site, in particular those of Tyr-19, His-32, Leu-94, and Glu-100, resulted in the formation of a deep hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the indandione moiety of the inhibitor. Mutational analysis provides functional evidence for specific interactions between Tyr-19 and E1 and between His-32 and the inhibitor. A second inhibitor molecule is also present at the binding pocket. Although evidence is presented that this second molecule makes only weak interactions with the protein and is likely an artifact of crystallization, its presence defines additional regions of the binding pocket that could be exploited to design more potent inhibitors.

Approximately 25 HPV types replicate in mucosal tissues of the anogenital tract. HPV16, -18, and -31 are the most prevalent “high-risk” types found in pre-cancerous or malignant lesions of the cervix. HPV6 and -11 are the most common “low-risk” types, which cause benign genital warts (condyloma acuminata), a less serious condition but one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (1Shah K.V. Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2077-2109Google Scholar). Currently, no specific antivirals are available for the treatment of HPV infections. The small circular double-stranded DNA genome of papillomavirus is actively maintained as a multicopy episome in the nucleus of infected epithelial cells. This process is dependent on replication of the viral genome by the viral E1 and E2 proteins, in conjunction with the host DNA replication machinery. E2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that has a number of functions in the viral lifecycle. In addition to its role in the initiation of viral DNA replication, E2 is involved in regulating the transcription of viral genes (2Yao J.M. Breiding D.E. Androphy E.J. J.

As a replication initiation factor, E2 binds with high affinity to specific sites located within the viral origin (ori) to help recruit it to the E1 helicase (10Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R.

Formation of a ternary complex between E1, E2, and the origin relies not only on the interaction of E1 and E2 with specific DNA sequences at the origin but is also critically dependent on a direct interaction between these two proteins (14Benson J.D.

The 40-kDa E2 protein exists in solution as a dimer and consists of an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of ∼200 residues, a C-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain of ∼100 residues, and a connecting “hinge” region of ∼70 amino acids (19Giri I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2823-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The N-terminal TAD is the region of E2 that binds to E1 (14Benson J.D. Howley P.M. J.

Science. 1999; 284: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The HPV16 and -18 TADs share ∼45% sequence identity (see Fig. 1) and have a very similar L-shaped structure composed of a three-helix bundle, partly missing in the structure of the truncated HPV18 TAD, followed by an antiparallel β-sheet. We recently described a series of small molecules that antagonize the E1-E2 protein-protein interaction by binding reversibly to the E2 TAD (22Yoakim C. Ogilvie W.W. Goudreau N. Naud J. Haché B.

This class of inhibitors, termed “indandiones” because they feature an indandione system spirofused onto a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring, blocks assembly of the HPV11 E1-E2-ori ternary complex at submicromolar concentrations in vitro and abrogates viral DNA replication in a transient transfection assay. To our knowledge, these are the only small molecule inhibitors of HPV DNA replication with cellular activity. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the HPV11 TAD and that of a TAD-indandione inhibitor complex. The HPV11 TAD structure is very similar to that of the analogous domains of HPV16 and -18. Inhibitor binding does not significantly affect the protein backbone but results in the formation of a deep pocket that makes several well defined interactions with the inhibitor.

Proteins—Wild type (WT) HPV11 E2 TAD with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag (His-TAD, sequence MGHHHHHH followed by E2 amino acids 2-201) was purified from bacteria as described (23White P.W. Titolo S.

To incorporate selenomethionine, the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain B834 (28Wood W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), a methionine auxotroph, grown in DL30 medium (29LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) lacking methionine and supplemented with 2 μg/ml biotin and thiamin and 50 μg/ml seleno-d,l-methionine (Se-Met). Purification was performed as described for the WT protein, except that buffers were sparged with helium and all purification steps were completed within 1 day. Addition of a 4-lysine tail to the C terminus of His-TAD was performed by PCR using a primer encoding four lysines, followed by ligation of the PCR product into the plasmid pET15b (Novagen). The encoded His-Lys-TAD protein was purified as described for His-TAD. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to verify the molecular weights of these three proteins and to determine that they lacked the N-terminal methionine. Complete incorporation of Se-Met was also verified by amino acid analysis. Purified proteins were >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 49,060 m-1 cm-1. Site-directed mutagenesis of HPV11, HPV6, and HPV31 E2 or of His-Lys-TAD was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer. E2 proteins were synthesized in vitro by coupled transcription/translation using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Inhibitors—Inhibitors were synthesized by the same procedures as described for other compounds in the same series (22Yoakim C. Ogilvie W.W. Goudreau N. Naud J. Haché B. O'Meara J.A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. White P.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 2539-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Single enantiomers were isolated by chiral chromatography. Radiolabeled inhibitor 3 was synthesized from an enantiomerically pure Boc-protected amine precursor. The acetate moiety, tritiated at the methyl group, was incorporated using [3H]N-acetoxyphthalimide (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.). Specific activity of the product was 9.2 Ci/mmol. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using the SMART System (Pharmacia), on a Superdex-75 (PC 3.2/30) column in buffer composed of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm TCEP, 0.1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 40 μl/m. (All buffers were adjusted at room temperature to the stated pH.) Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C using an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Spinco) with an An-60 Ti rotor, in 1.2-cm charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces (double sector for velocity and six-sector for equilibrium) and quartz windows. TAD proteins were exchanged into a buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm TCEP, 0.1 mm EDTA. Velocity data were collected at 60,000 rpm at 0.005-cm intervals, with 5 replicate readings per point. Protein concentrations were ∼16 μm. Scans were spaced as closely as the absorbance optics would allow. Equilibrium data were collected successively at 26,000, 30,000, and 38,000 rpm using TAD concentrations of 2-8 μm. 5 replicate readings were taken at 0.003-cm intervals. Scans were taken every hour, and at each speed the system was judged to have reached equilibrium when no difference was observed in successive scans, as determined by subtraction using the Origin software (Microcal). Buffer density (1.01922 g/ml) and protein partial specific volumes at 20 °C (0.7292 and 0.7311 cm3/g for HPV11 His-TAD and HPV11 His-Lys-TAD, respectively) were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (30Laue T.M.

Velocity data were analyzed using the program SVEDBERG 6.38 (31Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and equilibrium data were analyzed using WinNonlin 1.06 (32Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). For equilibrium experiments, data were truncated at an absorbance of ∼1.0, which corresponds to a TAD concentration of 17 μm. Very similar molecular weight estimates were obtained if more data, up to absorbance 1.2, was retained, but variances were higher and residuals were nonrandom. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Titration of inhibitor 1 into a solution of HPV11 His-Lys-TAD was performed using a VP-isothermal titration calorimetry instrument (MicroCal Inc.) in a buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Me2SO, at 20 °C, and was analyzed as described previously (23White P.W. Titolo S. Brault K. Thauvette L. Pelletier A. Welchner E. Bourgon L. Doyon L. Ogilvie W.W. Yoakim C. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Biol.

Data from a blank run, using a solution of compound 1 injected into buffer without His-Lys-TAD, were subtracted from the inhibitor-protein run prior to fitting the data to a one-site binding model. Crystallization and Data Collection—Final crystals of apo-HPV11 His-TAD containing either Met or Se-Met were obtained at 4 °C using micro-seeding in a hanging drop vapor diffusion plate. The precipitant solution was composed of 0.1 m sodium succinate (pH 5.0), 18% PEG 5000 monomethyl ether, and 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4. Diffraction data on the Se-Met E2 TAD were collected on an ADSC Q4 CCD at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X4a (Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY). Four datasets were collected from a single crystal, cooled to 100 K, at four different wavelengths near the selenium absorption edge (0.9790, 0.9794, 0.9743, and 0.9879 Å).

Open table in a new tab The complex of His-Lys-TAD with inhibitor 1 was formed by adding 1 μl of a 60 mm solution of 1 (BILH 434) in Me2SO to 74 μl of His-Lys-TAD at 10 mg/ml in the purification buffer, and incubating the mixture on ice for 2-3 h. Crystals were then obtained by vapor diffusion, using a precipitant solution composed of 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.5) and 35% methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Diffraction data were collected on the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X25 (Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY). Data from a single crystal cooled at 100 K were recorded on a Brandeis B4 detector (Brandeis University) mounted on a κ-axis goniometer (Enraf-Nonius, The Netherlands). Data collection statistics are listed in Table I. Structure Determination and Refinement—All data were processed with the HKL software Denzo and Scalepack (Table I). Initial phasing of the Se-Met HPV11 His-TAD Multiwavelength Anomalous Dispersion data was done using the software SHARP (33de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) with selenium sites located by SHELX (34Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19251) Google Scholar). Model building into initial electron density maps was carried out using the software O (Alwyn Jones, Uppsala University, Sweden) and model refinement was done with the software CNX (Accelrys). At a later stage, model building was also helped by molecular replacement phasing (CNX) using the published HPV16 coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1DTO (20Antson A.A. Burns J.E. Moroz O.V. Scott D.J. Sanders C.M. Bronstein I.B. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Maitland N.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). 10% of the data was used as a test set for the Rfree calculation. The final model includes residues 3-121 and 128-195 (Table I), but 15 residues were modeled as alanines because of inadequate electron density for their side chains (Lys-6, Asp-9, Glu-17, Gln-48, Glu-66, Lys-107, Lys-120, Val-128, Lys-173, Ser-180, Thr-181, Asn-182, His-183, Ser-190, and Ser-195). The structure of the His-Lys-TAD·1 complex was solved by molecular replacement using the refined HPV11 His-TAD model. This final model includes residues 2-196 (all side chains were modeled as the correct residue), two molecules of inhibitor 1, 27 water molecules, one molecule of Me2SO, and one partially defined buffer molecule (statistics in Table I). The refined atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1R6K and 1R6N for the TAD and TAD:inhibitor 1 structures, respectively). Computational Studies—The atoms making up the binding pocket were identified by applying the Site Finder application within the MOE software package (Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada) to the crystal structure of the complex after both inhibitors, as well as solvent atoms, were removed. The probe radii were 1.4 and 1.8 Å. The isolated donor acceptor radius was 3.0 Å and the connection distance was 2.0 Å. Inhibitor-protein binding affinities were evaluated using the empirical scoring functions PMF (35Muegge I. Martin Y.C. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), PLP (36Gehlhaar D.K. Verkhivker G.M. Rejto P.A. Sherman C.J. Fogel D.B. Fogel L.J. Freer S.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), and LUDI (37Bohm H.J. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 1992; 6: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Each inhibitor-protein interaction was evaluated after removal of the other inhibitor as well as all solvent atoms (except one water molecule between His-29 and His-32 that appears to be hydrogen-bonded to both residues). For these calculations, hydrogen atoms were added to all residues and molecules. E1-E2-Ori Complex Formation Assay—This assay was performed using in vitro translated E2 proteins as described previously (23White P.W. Titolo S. Brault K. Thauvette L. Pelletier A. Welchner E. Bourgon L. Doyon L. Ogilvie W.W. Yoakim C. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26765-26772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions (80 μl) consisted of HPV11 E1-containing insect cell nuclear extract (titrated to give ∼70% of maximal activity with purified WT HPV11 E2), 2 μl of in vitro translated E2, and 0.4 ng of ori probe generated by PCR using [33P]dCTP. Negative controls contained E2 protein but no E1 extract. Signals were detected by capturing E1-E2-ori complexes using anti-E1-coated scintillation proximity beads. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Far UV CD spectra were acquired between 260 and 187 nm using a J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) in a 0.05-cm cell at room temperature (approximately 23 °C). Proteins were diluted to 5 μm in a buffer composed of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 50 mm Na2SO4, and 0.5 mm TCEP. A total of 5 accumulations were taken for each sample at a speed of 20 nm/m, a resolution of 0.2 nm, a response of 2 s, and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Melting temperatures of TAD proteins were determined using a VP-DSC (MicroCal Inc.). TAD proteins were exchanged into a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP, adjusted to 5 μm, filtered, and degassed. Temperature was scanned between 10 and 65 °C at 1.5° min-1. Unfolding under these conditions was irreversible for all TAD proteins, but relative denaturation temperatures were estimated, after buffer subtraction, by fitting Cp versus temperature curves to a modified two-state model (38Sturtevant J.M. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar), using the Origin software supplied with the instrument. It is acceptable to use the equations of equilibrium thermodynamics to analyze unfolding events that are in practice irreversible, because irreversibility typically results from secondary, slower events, such as aggregation (39Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Binding of Tritiated 3 to TAD Proteins—Titrations were performed in 96-well nickel chelate Flashplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 50 nm His-Lys-TAD protein and 4-500 nm tritiated inhibitor 3, in a buffer composed of 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.0025% (v/v) Tween 20, and 2% Me2SO. After a 3-h incubation to allow for equilibration of interactions between the His-Lys-TAD and both the nickel plate and inhibitor 3, signals from bound 3 were detected by scintillation counting using a TopCount NXT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blank titrations of compound 3 into wells lacking His-Lys-TAD were performed in parallel and signals from nonspecific binding of the compound was subtracted prior to data analysis. Signals ranged from 30 to 4000 cpm for negative controls and 120 to 7000 for WT TAD (prior to blank subtraction). Binding data were analyzed by non-linear regression (GraFit 3.0, Erithicus Software Ltd.) using the quadratic equation, Max*((([TAD]+[3]+Kd)-([TAD]+[3]+Kd)2-4[TAD][3])/2[TAD]) where Max denotes the counts/min observed at saturation. ATPase Assays—ATPase activity of purified recombinant E1 (40White P.W. Pelletier A. Brault K. Titolo S. Welchner E. Thauvette L. Fazekas M. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Biol.

Brault K. Titolo S. Welchner E. Thauvette L. Fazekas M. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 304: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The concentration of HPV11 E1 was 3 nm and ATP and magnesium acetate were used at 20 and 500 μm, respectively. After subtraction of background measured in reactions lacking E1, inhibition data were fit to a three-parameter logistic using SAS (release 6.12, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). TAD mutants Y19A and E39A inhibited only weakly, such that their IC50 and Imax parameters could only be estimated. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of the HPV11 E2 TAD—The HPV11 E2 TAD (amino acids 1-201, Fig. 1) was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged protein. The purified protein eluted in a sharp peak when analyzed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A) and comparison of its elution time to those of molecular mass standards gave an estimated mass of 24.7 kDa, close to that expected for the monomer based on its sequence (23.8 kDa). The HPV11 TAD also appeared to be monomeric by analytical ultracentrifugation. In an equilibrium sedimentation experiment, no significant trends in apparent mass were observed at increasing rotor speed or loading concentration (Table II). Such a trend would be observed if the protein formed a mixture of monomers and dimers under experimental conditions (42Laue T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Data from a centrifugation velocity experiment were best fit to an estimated average molecular mass of 22.5 kDa for a single species, based on individual parameters of S = 1.960 ± 0.003 Svedberg and D = 8.26 ± 0.03 Frick. Collectively, these results indicate that the HPV11 E2 TAD is fully monomeric in solution over the concentration range studied, up to ∼20 μm.Table IIAnalytical ultracentrifugation data for HPV11 His-TADSpeed[TAD]aLoading concentration, prior to run.σbReduced molecular weight (49).MrcMolecular weight calculated from σ assuming partial specific volume for His-TAD of 0.7292 cm3/g and a solution density ρ = 1.01922.sdSquare root of the variance of the fit.rpmμmcm−2DaODU26,00081.7622,5000.00826,00041.8523,6000.00326,00021.8323,5000.00430,00082.4523,6000.00830,00042.4723,8000.00530,00022.4323,3000.00338,00083.9423,6000.00738,00043.9323,6000.00938,00023.8423,0000.004a Loading concentration, prior to run.b Reduced molecular weight (49Yphantis D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2040892143,"Microtubule dynamics is essential for many vital cellular processes such as morphogenesis and motility. Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous protein kinase that is involved in diverse cellular functions. CK2 holoenzyme is composed of two catalytic α or α′ subunits and two regulatory β subunits. We show that the α subunit of CK2 binds directly to both microtubules and tubulin heterodimers. CK2 holoenzyme but neither of its individual subunits exhibited a potent effect of inducing microtubule assembly and bundling. Moreover, the polymerized microtubules were strongly stabilized by CK2 against cold-induced depolymerization. Interestingly, the kinase activity of CK2 is not required for its microtubule-assembling and stabilizing function because a kinase-inactive mutant of CK2 displayed the same microtubule-assembling activity as the wild-type protein. Knockdown of CK2α/α′ in cultured cells by RNA interference dramatically destabilized their microtubule networks, and the destabilized microtubules were readily destructed by colchicine at a very low concentration. Further, over-expression of chicken CK2α or its kinaseinactive mutant in the endogenous CK2α/α′-depleted cells fully restored the microtubule resistance to the low dose of colchicine. Taken together, CK2 is a microtubule-associated protein that confers microtubule stability in a phosphorylation-independent manner.

Taken together, CK2 is a microtubule-associated protein that confers microtubule stability in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase 2) is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved in eukaryotic cells (1Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 2Blanquet P.R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 211-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Litchfield D.W. Biochem.

It comprises two catalytic α or α′ subunits and two regulatory β subunits to form a heterotetrameric structure in which the two β subunits dimerize to link the two α or α′ subunits (5Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). As a protein serine/threonine kinase, CK2 has a very broad phosphorylation spectrum, and over 300 protein substrates of CK2 have been identified to date (6Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). A number of studies have indicated that CK2 is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction (1Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 3Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 6Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). CK2 is instrumental and necessary for promoting cell survival (3Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 7Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Disruption of genes encoding both of the catalytic subunits of CK2 is synthetic lethal in fission yeast (8Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 9Rethinaswamy A. Birnbaum M.J. Glover C.V. J. Biol.

Similarly, it is embryonic lethal when CK2β is knocked down in Caenorhabditis elegans by RNA interference or in mice by gene disruption, reminiscent of an essential role of CK2β during embryonic development and organogenesis (10Buchou T. Vernet M. Blond O. Jensen H.H. Pointu H. Olsen B.B. Cochet C. Issinger O.G. Boldyreff B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 11Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Hence, production of both the α and β subunits of CK2 appears to be mandatory for cell viability.A few lines of evidence have lead to implication that CK2 might be involved in the regulation of microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization (12Diaz-Nido J. Serrano L. Mendez E. Avila J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Serrano L. Diaz-Nido J. Wandosell F. Avila J. J.

Cell Res. 1989; 181: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CK2 was localized to microtubule structures such as the mitotic spindle of dividing cells and was found to associate with the cold-stable fraction of microtubules from the rat brain (14Serrano L. Hernandez M.A. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1992; 14: 39-53PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the α and α′ subunits were shown to bind tubulin in a far Western assay (16Faust M. Schuster N. Montenarh M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further, CK2 is able to phosphorylate a number of microtubule elements, including MAP1B and a neuron-specific β-tubulin isotype (6Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of MAP1B was proposed to facilitate the microtubule association of MAP1B and thereby microtubule assembly, whereas the physiological role of the β-tubulin isotype phosphorylation is still unclear (12Diaz-Nido J. Serrano L. Mendez E. Avila J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Diaz-Nido J. Serrano L. Lopez-Otin C. Vandekerckhove J. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13949-13954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the direct correlation of CK2 and microtubule stability has not been established.In the present study, we have investigated the physical association of CK2 with microtubules and the direct effect of CK2 on microtubule dynamics. Our results show that CK2 is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall-interfering RNAPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall-interfering RNAPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. that induces microtubule assembly and bundling in vitro. CK2-polymerized microtubules appear stable under cold treatment. In cultured cells, knockdown of CK2α/α′ has a severe effect on microtubule stability, which implies that CK2 mediates microtubule integrity in vivo. Moreover, a kinase-inactive mutant of CK2 displayed the same microtubule polymerizing and stabilizing activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the microtubule assembling and stabilizing action of CK2 is independent of its kinase function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—The coding sequences of chicken CK2α and its kinase-inactive mutant (CK2αK68A) were subcloned into pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences), pET32 (Novagen), and pDneo-Myc (18Tang B.L. Ong Y.S. Huang B. Wei S. Wong E.T. Qi R. Horstmann H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40008-40017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The full-length sequence of human CK2β was cloned by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pQE30 (Qiagen).Protein Binding Assay—Proteins tagged with GST or His6 were bacterially expressed and prepared as described previously (19Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test tubulin binding, GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) prebound with GST, GST-CK2α, or the complex of GST-CK2α/His-CK2β were incubated with purified tubulin (>99% pure and MAP-free, Cytoskeleton) for 1 h at 4 °C. After being extensively washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), the beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Antibodies against α- and β-tubulin were from Sigma. The binding of His-tagged proteins with tubulin was performed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) in binding buffer without dithiothreitol. In the microtubule binding assay, microtubules, which were pre-assembled using taxol in PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm GTP, were incubated with the indicated proteins. The samples were subsequently loaded onto a buffered cushion (50% glycerol in PEM buffer) and centrifuged to spin down the microtubules and associated proteins. The pellet and the supernatant were analyzed by immunoblotting.Microtubule Assembly—Microtubules were assembled in vitro from the purified MAP-free tubulin at 2 mg/ml in PEM buffer supplemented with 1 mm GTP at 35 °C, and the turbidity of the solutions was monitored at 340 nm (20Gaskin F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CK2 was added at various amounts as indicated to promote the assembly. To visualize assembled microtubules, tubulin and rhodamine-labeled tubulin (Cytoskeleton) at the ratio of 7:1 were used in the polymerization (21Belmont L.D. Hyman A.A. Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Microtubules were fixed with 0.5% gluteraldehyde and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.Differential Tubulin Extraction from Intact Cells—Differential extraction of tubulin heterodimers and polymers from cells was performed using a protocol described previously (22Lieuvin A. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were lysed with the microtubule-stabilizing buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and Roche protease inhibitor mixture), which was prewarmed to 35 °C, to extract cytosolic soluble tubulin heterodimers and preserve microtubules (assembled insoluble tubulin polymers). The extract was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant designated as the free tubulin fraction. After a brief washing with the microtubule-stabilizing buffer, the pellet was extracted in the microtubule-destabilizing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm CaCl2, and Roche protease inhibitor mixture). The extract was clarified by centrifugation to yield the polymerized tubulin fraction. Both fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting, and each band on the blots was quantitated using a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer and analyzed with the Multi-Analyst, version 1.0.1, program (Bio-Rad).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—COS-7, HeLa and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The siRNA sequence designed for human CK2α/α′ is 5′-CCAGCUGGUAGUCAUCUUGUU-3′, which has a few discrepancies with the corresponding sequence of chicken CK2α/α′.20 μm CK2α/α′ siRNA or a scrambled siRNA sequence was applied into the transfection using a TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus). Simultaneous transfection of siRNA and plasmid DNA was done using TransIT-TKO and LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) concurrently. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 24 h before treatment with 0.2 μm colchicine (Sigma) for 3 h. The cells were subjected to differential extraction of free and polymerized tubulin or to immunostaining. For immunofluorescence, the cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. After a blocking wash with 10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, immunostaining was performed with antibodies as indicated. CK2α- and CK2β-specific antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The secondary antibodies are Fluor594 goat anti-mouse IgG and Fluor488 donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes). The cells were then washed in PBS, mounted, and photographed on an MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad).RESULTSCK2 Forms a Direct Complex with Microtubules—The direct association of CK2 and microtubules was probed by a series of binding assays using recombinant CK2 and purified MAP-free tubulin as well as pre-assembled microtubules. The α/β heterodimer of tubulin was found to associate with the catalytic α subunit as well as the holoenzyme of CK2 (Fig. 1A). CK2β alone did not result in the pull-down of any tubulin (Fig. 1B), which is in agreement with a previous observation using far Western blotting (16Faust M. Schuster N. Montenarh M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To verify the microtubule association of CK2, taxol-assembled microtubules were incubated with CK2 holoenzyme or its individual subunit proteins. The microtubules were then spun down to test whether these proteins co-precipitated with the microtubules. Consistently, CK2α and the holoenzyme of CK2 were found to associate with the microtubule pellet, whereas CK2β and GST, as a control protein, failed to co-precipitate with the microtubules (Fig. 1C), indicating that the CK2 holoenzyme associates with microtubules at a high affinity through CK2α.Cellular localization of CK2 to microtubule networks was revealed by immunofluorescent staining of cultured COS-7 cells. Microscopic imaging of endogenous CK2α and CK2β displayed a clearly defined positioning with the microtubule network, particularly in the cell periphery (Fig. 2A). As confirmation, pools of tubulin existing as free heterodimers or polymers (microtubules) were differentially extracted from the cultured cells to examine the distribution of CK2 (22Lieuvin A. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both CK2α and CK2β appeared in the microtubule fraction as well as the fraction of free tubulin heterodimers, although there appeared to be more CK2β in the microtubule fraction (Fig. 2B). Taken together with the results from the in vitro binding assays, this provides evidence of the direct association of CK2 with cellular microtubules.Fig. 2Cellular localization of CK2α and CK2β to microtubules.A, COS-7 cells were immunostained for confocal microscopic analysis. Top row, double staining of CK2α and β-tubulin; bottom row, CK2β and β-tubulin. B, soluble tubulin heterodimers (free tubulin) and microtubules (polymerized tubulin) were differentially extracted from HeLa cells. Both fractions as well as the total cell lysate (TCL) were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies as indicated. The histogram shows the relative amounts of CK2α and CK2β in the free and polymerized tubulin fractions. These data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CK2 Induces Microtubule Polymerization—We next investigated whether CK2 has any effect on microtubule dynamics by using an in vitro assay of microtubule assembly from purified MAP-free tubulin (20Gaskin F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). During the assay, the turbidity change of the solution was measured as tubulin polymerizes or depolymerizes. In the absence of CK2, there was minimal polymerization of tubulin even after a prolonged incubation (Fig. 3, A and B). The addition of CK2 at a ratio of 1:240 to tubulin resulted in substantial polymerization of tubulin into microtubules (Fig. 3, A and B). Clearly, both the rate and extent of polymerization were dramatically enhanced by CK2. When the amount of CK2 was increased, tubulin polymerization was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). To verify the microtubule formation, rhodamine-labeled tubulin was applied into the polymerization experiments for direct visualization of the assembled microtubules by fluorescence microscopy (21Belmont L.D. Hyman A.A. Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, microtubule filaments and bundles were readily observed with the CK2-incubated tubulin, whereas the incubation of tubulin without CK2 showed no obvious microtubule formation. Therefore, we have found that CK2, in addition to showing high affinity binding to tubulin and microtubules, induces the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. Moreover, CK2 appeared to cause microtubule bundling, suggesting a strong stabilizing effect on the microtubules.Fig. 3Effect of CK2 on microtubule assembly.A, the turbidimetric assay of tubulin polymerization. Microtubule assembly from purified MAP-free tubulin was carried out in the presence of the CK2 holoenzyme at various concentrations (molar ratios to tubulin). The concentration of tubulin was constant in each assay at 2 mg/ml. B, histogram of the microtubule assembly at various amounts of CK2. The assembly assay was performed as described in A for 30 min.

Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Given that observation that CK2α of the holoenzyme interacts with microtubules, we explored whether the microtubule assembling function of CK2 is restricted to the holoenzyme by applying the α and β subunits of CK2 individually into the microtubule assembly assay. In contrast to the holoenzyme, when either the α or β subunit was tested, there was minimal polymerization of tubulin even after a prolonged incubation (Fig. 4). The CK2α- and CK2β-polymerized samples had no marked difference from the background tubulin polymerization, which was shown in the GST-incubated sample. Thus, only CK2 holoenzyme, but not each of the individual subunits, has the ability to induce microtubule assembly even though CK2α has shown microtubule binding activity.Fig. 4Microtubule assembly can be induced by the CK2 holoenzyme but not its individual subunits. GST, GST-CK2α, and His-CK2β were applied as indicated at 0.1 mg/ml in the microtubule assembly assay. As a control, the CK2 holoenzyme reconstituted from the same amount of GST-CK2α and His-CK2β as described under “Experimental Procedures” was applied. Microtubule assembly was performed at 2 mg/ml tubulin as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CK2 has been known to catalyze phosphorylation of a neural isoform of β-tubulin and some of the MAPs, raising the possibility that it may affect microtubule dynamics through a kinase reaction (12Diaz-Nido J.

Although ATP was not present in the in vitro microtubule assembly assay, CK2 is capable of utilizing either ATP or GTP as the phosphate donor in its phosphorylating reactions (23Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We designed an experiment to assess the role of CK2 kinase activity in microtubule assembly. A kinase-inactive holoenzyme of CK2, in which CK2α was replaced with the kinase-inactive mutant CK2αK68A, was tested in the microtubule assembly assay. Fig. 5 shows that the kinase-inactive CK2 conferred the same microtubule polymerizing activity as the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the microtubule assembly entity of CK2 is independent of its kinase activity and phosphorylation of any microtubule proteins.Fig. 5The kinase activity of CK2 is not required for its function to induce microtubule assembly. The wild-type CK2 enzyme (GST-CK2α/His-CK2β) and the kinase-inactive enzyme (GST-CK2αK68A/His-CK2β) were applied as indicated at 0.1 mg/ml in the microtubule assembly assay. GST-CK2αK68A and GST were also tested at the same amount.

Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1993-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been found that CK2 is enriched in the coldstable fraction of the microtubule preparation from rat brain (14Serrano L. Hernandez M.A. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This observation, together with our findings that CK2 associates with microtubules to promote microtubule assembly, prompted us to explore the possibility that CK2 may contribute to the cold stability of microtubules. To test this likelihood, CK2-polymerized microtubules were incubated on ice, and the turbidity change was monitored. As a comparison, tau-polymerized microtubules were treated under the same condition, given the fact that tau does not confer cold stability to microtubules (25Baas P.W. Pienkowski T.P. Cimbalnik K.A. Toyama K. Bakalis S. Ahmad F.J. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 135-143PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the tau-polymerized sample was depolymerized almost completely within a few minutes (Fig. 6). However, the turbidity of the CK2-polymerized sample was only marginally reduced even after a prolonged cold incubation (Fig. 6), indicating that CK2 functions to stabilize microtubules against cold-induced disassembly.Fig. 6CK2 confers cold stability to microtubules. Microtubules were polymerized with 0.05 mg/ml CK2 or 0.16 mg/ml tau protein for 30 min at 35 °C, where they attained similar turbidity measurements. The microtubule samples were then incubated on ice, and the turbidity measurement was begun. Absorbance was expressed as a percentage of the measurement when ice incubation was started.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CK2 Stabilizes Microtubules in Vivo—To evaluate the role of CK2 in microtubule dynamics in vivo, we knocked down CK2α/α′ in HeLa cells by gene silencing using a siRNA duplex derived from the human sequence of CK2α/α′ (26Sayed M. Pelech S. Wong C. Marotta A. Salh B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6994-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Ulloa L. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown by the CK2α immunoblot, the introduction of CK2α/α′ siRNA into the cells led to a dramatic decrease of the CK2α/α′ proteins to a minimal cellular level (Fig. 7A). To assess the knockdown effect on microtubules, the amount of cellular microtubules (assembled insoluble tubulin polymers) was determined using the differential extraction method and immunoblotting (22Lieuvin A. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, the integrity of the cellular microtubule network was examined by immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy. The knockdown of CK2α/α′ significantly reduced the cellular content of microtubules (Fig. 7, A and B), suggesting CK2 as one of the factors in stabilizing microtubules in vivo. We further assessed microtubule stability using colchicine, which is a microtubule-disrupting agent. When colchicine was applied at a low concentration (0.2 μm) onto the cells that were transfected with a scrambled siRNA sequence, most of the microtubule structure remained intact (Fig. 7, A and B). However, such a low dose of colchicine caused severe disruption of the microtubule structure in the CK2α/α′-depleted cells where the microtubule networks were collapsing toward the perinuclear membrane (Fig. 7B); almost negligible amount of microtubules was extracted from these cells (Fig. 7A). Apparently, the removal of CK2α had a strong effect on cellular microtubule architecture, rendering it very unstable. As a result, it was readily destructed by colchicine at a very low concentration.Fig. 7CK2 stabilizes microtubules in vivo.A, HeLa cells were introduced with siRNA of human CK2α/α′ or a scrambled sequence. Knockdown of CK2α was monitored by anti-CK2α immunoblotting. The cells were subsequently treated with 0.2 μm colchicine or its solvent. Tubulin in the form of polymers (microtubules) was extracted from the cells for β-tubulin immunoblotting. The histogram reflects the relative amounts of microtubules extracted from the cells as compared with the control, which is the sample transfected with the scrambled siRNA sequence and treated without colchicine. The data are representative of three separate experiments. B, cells in the experiments described in A were fixed and stained with the β-tubulin antibody for confocal microscopic imaging. C, expression of the wild-type or the kinase-inactive mutant of chicken CK2α restored microtubule stability against colchicine treatment in CK2α/α′-depleted cells. Prior to treatment with colchicine (0.2 μm), 293T cells were double transfected with siRNA of human CK2α/α′ and one of the following expression constructs: chicken CK2α, the kinase-inactive mutant of chicken CK2α (CK2αK68A), or the empty vector. Expression of Myc-tagged chicken CK2α and CK2αK68A was detected by anti-Myc immunoblotting of the cell lysates. Microtubules were extracted using the differential extraction method (see “Experimental Procedures”) for anti-β-tubulin immunoblotting. Representative results of three separate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further substantiate the microtubule stabilizing function of CK2, we tested whether microtubule stability could be restored by expression of chicken CK2α in endogenous CK2α/α′-depleted cells. As observed with the HeLa cells, knockdown of CK2α/α′ in cultured human 293T fibroblasts using siRNA strongly destabilized the microtubule network, resulting in almost complete disruption of the microtubules by colchicine at 0.2 μm (Fig. 7C). When chicken CK2α was expressed in the 293T cells in which endogenous CK2α/α′ was knocked down, the cellular microtubules completely retained their integrity against the colchicine-induced disruption (Fig. 7C). More interestingly, when the expression was performed using the kinase-inactive mutant CK2αK68A, it exhibited the same effect as wild-type CK2α in rescuing microtubules from colchicine treatment (Fig. 7C). These data demonstrate that CK2 is an important mediator of cellular microtubule stability and exerts its eff"

Previous measurements of ploidy level in different organs of humans and rodents, including the aorta, indicated an increase in old <i>versus</i> young. We hypothesized that aortic vascular smooth muscle polyploidy is a biomarker for aging and that the augmented DNA dosage affects selective gene-specific transcript expression. Our results demonstrate that tetraploidy increases exponentially over the life span of the animal, serving as an indicator of age. Approximately 60% of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the thoracic aorta of 36-month-old Brown Norway rats are tetraploid compared with 8% in their 3-month-old counterparts. Microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with mRNA isolated from sorted diploid (2N) and tetraploid (4N) vascular smooth muscle cells from old rats to identify differentially expressed transcripts. For the majority of detectable transcripts, an increase in DNA content led to a proportional increase in mRNA. A select group of transcripts, however, were reduced in tetraploid compared with diploid cells. These mRNAs correspond to guanine deaminase, to the matrix proteins rat glypican 3 (OCI-5) and decorin, as well as to the inflammation-associated transcripts, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 precursor, macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactoseamine-specific lectin, and complement component C4. Our study is the first to describe aortic ploidy level as a biomarker for aging and to indicate that changes associated with increased DNA content per cell may selectively suppress the expression of specific genes."

The co-mitogenic effects of inactive TS on T cells were selectively abrogated by addition of N-acetyllactosamine, suggesting the inactive form of this glycosyltransferase is a sialic acid-binding lectin with an additional binding site for lactosides. In this work, we demonstrate by using NMR spectroscopy that inactive TS possesses two sugar-binding sites, one for α2,3-sialic acid-containing molecules and a second for β-galactosides. We also show that inactive TS recognizes its ligands in a sequential ordered mode. Sialoside binding is necessary to trigger a conformational modification of the inactive TS, allowing it to interact with β-galactosides. Knowledge of binding properties of TS could clarify its role in the molecular mechanism of T. cruzi/host cell interaction. Materials—Most of the chemical products used were from Sigma or Fisher.

The eluates were applied to Mono Q and Mono S columns and eluted with NaCl gradient. The homogeneity of the protein was evaluated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and inactive TS was stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C until used. Frontal Affinity Chromatography Using Lactose-Sepharose Column—Frontal affinity chromatography was carried out using a lactose-Sepharose column (7.4 × 0.8 cm) equilibrated with PBS buffer in the absence or presence of α-2,3-sialyllacto-N-tetraose (2 mm). BSA and inactive TS were run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, lyophilized, and suspended in 200 μl, and 20 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) under reducing conditions. NMR Experiments—α2,3-Sialillactose, α2,6-sialillactose, methyl β-lactoside, methyl β-melibioside, methyl α-mannoside, or Galβ-1,3-GlcNAcβ-1,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc (lacto-N-tetraose) were dissolved in deuterated PBS, pH 7.6 (not corrected for isotope effects). Inactive TS solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl was exchanged with deuterated PBS by gel filtration on a G-25 column. Twenty μl of a stock solution containing 10 mg/ml of inactive TS was added to a solution of sialylglycoside (2 mm final concentration), and the total volume was adjusted to 500 μl. NMR spectra were obtained at a probe temperature of 20 °C on a Bruker DMX 600 equipped with a 5-mm self-shielded gradient triple resonance probe or on a Bruker DRX 600 with a 5-mm triple resonance probe. One-dimensional Saturation Transfer Difference (STD)—One-dimensional STD experiments were performed by low power presaturation of the methyl region of the protein during the 2-s relaxation delay. The pulse scheme was as follow: relaxation delay with or without presaturation of the protein resonances, 90° pulse and acquisition. Two hundred and fifty six scans of 16,000 points over a 10 ppm spectral width were collect. Data were obtained with an interspersed acquisition of on-resonance and control spectra in order to minimize the effects of temperature and magnet instability. Saturation Transfer Difference-Total Correlation Spectroscopy (STD-TOCSY)—STD-TOCSY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 66 ms, 32 scans per t1 increment. 200 t1 increments were collected in an interlaced mode with presaturation on or off for 2 s. Prior subtraction both spectra were processed and phased identically. The acquisition times for the two-dimensional experiments were typically 16 h. The spectra were multiplied with a square cosine bell function in both dimensions and zero-filled two times. All spectra were referenced relative to trimethylsilyl-2,2′,3,3′-d4-propionic acid-sodium salt (δ = 0.0 ppm). Recently, we applied STD-NMR techniques to demonstrate that enzymatically inactive T. cruzi TS is a sialic acid-binding lectin, allowing atomic resolution of the epitope involved in the interaction (12Todeschini A.R.

By using the same methodology, the interaction of inactive TS with lacto-N-tetraose, methyl-β-lactose, methyl β-melibiose, and methyl α-mannoside was studied. Fig. 1 shows the one-dimensional STD-NMR spectra of inactive TS in the presence of lacto-N-tetraose. From an inspection in the spectra, it is immediately obvious that no proton from lacto-N-tetraose or methyl β-lactoside (results not shown) receives magnetization from the protein. The STD-TOCSY acquired under the same conditions confirmed these results (Fig. 2). Neither saccharide studied makes contact with the inactive TS, because no cross-peaks were observed (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2STD-TOCSY of lacto-N-tetraose in presence of inactive TS.A, reference TOCSY spectrum of inactive TS in the presence of lacto-N-tetraose in PBS/D2O, pH 7.6, 20 °C.

If inactive TS exhibits the same binding properties, it must interact with lacto-N-tetraose or methyl β-lactoside when a sialoside is present. To test this hypothesis, we used STD experiments to probe the interaction of inactive TS with lacto-N-tetraose in the presence of α-2,3-sialyllactose. Fig. 3 shows the reference TOCSY (Fig. 3A) and the STD-TOCSY (Fig. 3, B and C) spectra of the lacto-N-tetraose incubated with inactive TS in the presence of α-2,3-sialyllactose. The STD-TOCSY spectrum indicates that the NAc and H3ax protons of Neu5Ac residue are in close contact with the inactive enzyme and that H3eq, H4, and H5 from the Neu5Ac residue and H1, H3, and H4 from the β-Galp ring receive saturation from the protein (Fig. 4). The contacts and intensities observed for α-2,3-sialyllactose interaction with inactive TS are in complete agreement with those found previously (12Todeschini A.R. Girard M.F. DosReis G.A.

In addition, Fig. 3C clearly shows additional cross-peaks at 4.47 and 3.68 ppm arising from H1 and H3 of β-Galp of the lacto-N-tetraose, respectively. Similarly, contact between the β-Galp residue and inactive enzyme was observed when methyl β-lactoside was incubated at the same conditions (results not shown).Fig. 4Relative intensities of STD-TOCSY cross-peaks.

When the inactive TS was loaded on the lactose-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in PBS buffer with α-2,3-sialyllacto-N-tetraose, the enzyme was eluted in a higher elution volume in relation to the front found when the column was equilibrated in absence of the sialoside (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that binding of α-2,3-sialyllactose to inactive TS elicits a conformational alteration in the protein framework that allows the β-galactoside to bind. The α-2,3-sialyllactose and β-galactoside simultaneously accommodate in the inactive TS-binding pocket of inactive TS, suggesting that the inactive members of the TS family interact with their ligands by a sequential ordered mechanism. Previously, we demonstrated that inactive TS binds only weakly to α-2,6-sialyllactose, because in contrast to α-2,3-sialyllactose, no contact between the protein and the β-Galp ring was detected (12Todeschini A.R.

To investigate whether the conformational switch of inactive TS depends on the correct positioning of the sialoside in the enzyme-binding site, interaction of inactive TS with α-2,6-sialyllactose and lacto-N-tetraose was studied. STD-TOCSY spectrum (Fig. 6) contains no signals arising from the lacto-N-tetraose, suggesting that a proper positioning of sialylated ligand is necessary for the β-galactoside interaction. To investigate whether inactive TS is specific for β-Galp residues, the enzyme was incubated with methyl α-mannoside (Fig. 7) or methyl β-melibiose (result not shown) in the presence of α-2,3-sialyllactose. Additional signals were not observed, demonstrating that, similar to its active analogue, inactive TS only interacts with terminal β-Galp residues. Taken together, our results show that correct positioning of the sialoside in the inactive TS-binding site is necessary for the protein to undergo the conformational change that allows the β-galactoside to bind (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Proposed events for the transfer reaction of T. cruzi TS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Host/parasite interaction mediated by carbohydrates may be influenced by lectin properties.

Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Several reports (15Burleigh B.A. Woolsey A.M. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have suggested that these molecules could be either receptors or ligands during the process of T. cruzi infection. Previously, we showed that the enzymatically inactive TS is a sialic acid-binding lectin able to bind to and costimulate T cells through CD43 engagement, and that there is evidence for an additional binding site for β-galactopyranosyl residues, because the co-mitogenic effect was selectively abrogated by addition of N-acetyllactosamine (10Todeschini A.R. Nunes M.P. Pires R.S. Lopes M.F. Previato J.O. Mendonça-Previato L. DosReis G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5192-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This possibility prompted us to investigate the interaction of inactive TS with β-galactosides. By using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that inactive T. cruzi TS has a carbohydrate recognition domain for β-Galp residue that is formed only after a conformational switch triggered by prior sialoside binding. As far as we know, this is the first report of a lectin that recognizes its ligands by a sequential ordered mechanism. The binding behavior of inactive TS may play a significant role in the process of T. cruzi adhesion, invasion, and host immunoregulation, allowing the parasitic infection to be established. Molecules of the TS family are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the membrane and can be released into the serum in fairly high amounts during acute phase Chagas disease in humans (5Frasch A.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, TS family members can act as soluble modifiers of immune responses. The bivalent nature of inactive TS demonstrated here would promote glycan cross-linking, which is believed to be essential for cellular signal transduction. Both soluble and membrane-bound inactive TS could interact with sialo- and asialo-glycoconjugates expressed by host cells leading to exacerbated and immunopathologic reactions in Chagas disease. The finding that inactive TS has two carbohydrate binding domains may explain some apparently contradictory results on the involvement of sialyl and galactosyl epitopes in T. cruzi/host cell interaction. Whereas Schenkman et al. (16Schenkman S. Jiane M.S. Hart G.W. Nussenweig V. Cell. 1991; 65: 1117-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) have shown that sialylation of Ssp-3 epitope of mammalian cell-derived trypomastigotes is required for target cell recognition, Yoshida et al. (17Yoshida N. Dorta M.L. Ferreira A.T. Oshiro M.E.M. Mortara R.A. Serrano-Acosta A. Favoreto Jr., S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that the removal of sialic acid from the surface of insect-derived metacyclic trypomastigotes enhances parasite/host interaction. The removal of sialic acid from T. cruzi glycoproteins and the concomitant exposure of cryptic β-Galp residues would favor inactive TS interaction with both host sialoglycoconjugates and terminal β-Galp-containing glycoproteins on the parasite surface, thus enhancing T. cruzi-host adhesion. This phenomenon was well characterized for CD22, a mammalian sialic acid-binding lectin (18Razi N. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7469-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19Collins B.E. Blixt O. Bovin N.V. Danzer C.P. Chui D. Marth J.D. Nitschke L. Paulson J.C.

Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). CD22 is masked on the surface of murine B cells, as evidenced by enhanced binding of specific sialyl probes after sialidase treatment of B cells (19Collins B.E. Blixt O. Bovin N.V. Danzer C.P. Chui D. Marth J.D. Nitschke L. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The removal of sialic acid and concomitant exposure of β-Galp residues from host cell glycans, which occurs as a result of the T. cruzi TS reaction, may therefore be physiologically significant by promoting parasite adherence to and penetration of host cells (7Ming M. Chuenkova M. Ortega-Barria E. Pereira M.E.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Ciavaglia M.C. De Carvalho T.U. De Souza W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The findings that inactive TS recognizes its ligands with the same specificity as its active analogue may bring insights into the mechanism of catalytic transglycosylation by T. cruzi TS. T. cruzi TS is an unusual sialidase with a predominant transglycosylase activity (21Vandekerckhove F. Schenkman S. Pontes de Carvalho L. Tomlinson S. Kiso M. Yoshida M. Hasegawa A. Nussenzweig V. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of trypanosomal sialidase (11Todeschini A.R. Mendonça-Previato L. Previato J.O. Varki A. Van Halbeek H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) seems to be similar to viral sialidase (22Burmeister W.P. Henrissat B. Bosso C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W. Structure. 1993; 1: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) which is thought to hydrolyze the sialyl glycosidic bound through an oxocarbenium ion intermediate, with formation of trace amount of 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic (Neu5Ac2en) as a by-product. The predominance of transglycosylation over hydrolysis can be explained by the presence of distinct binding sites for acceptor and donor substrates in the TS catalytic pocket. Our data support this hypothesis; we demonstrated that inactive TS binds α2,3-sialyllactose and lacto-N-tetraose or methyl-β-lactose in a sequential ordered manner to form a ternary complex. In the same way as we have shown for inactive TS, Buschiazzo et al. (23Buschiazzo A. Amaya M.F. Cremona M.L. Frasch A.C. Alzari P.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that sialic acid binding induces a conformational modification in the crystal structure of active TS, allowing the acceptor substrate (lactose) to bind. The authors, however, were unable to show the existence of two distinct binding sites when monoclinic crystals were soaked in lactose and Neu5NAc2en, indicating that the lactose-binding site is too narrow to accommodate the lactose moiety of the donor and acceptor substrates simultaneously. Our results, using inactive TS incubated with α2,6-sialyllactose in the presence of lacto-N-tetraose, show that incorrect fitting of sialoside into the binding site of inactive TS does not trigger β-Galp binding. These data suggest that Neu5NAc2en interaction with active TS (23Buschiazzo A. Amaya M.F. Cremona M.L. Frasch A.C. Alzari P.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) is not sufficient to induce the required conformational rearrangement to accommodate acceptor and donor substrates simultaneously. Consistent with our hypothesis are the surface plasmon resonance results showing that lactose binds to an inactive mutant of TS (Asp59 → Asn) in the presence of α2,3-sialyllactose (23Buschiazzo A. Amaya M.F. Cremona M.L. Frasch A.C. Alzari P.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although the exact catalytic mechanism of trans-sialylation is still obscure, data obtained in this study may provide some clues. Correct binding of sialic acid donor to TS may trigger a conformational change in the enzyme that creates the conditions for formation of a ternary complex. Acceptor binding would displace the water molecules from TS catalytic cleft before formation of the oxicarbonium ion (11Todeschini A.R. Mendonça-Previato L. Previato J.O. Varki A. Van Halbeek H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Buschiazzo A. Amaya M.F. Cremona M.L. Frasch A.C. Alzari P.M. Mol.

Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7532-7533Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) takes place, facilitating the selective transfer reaction (Fig. 8). Thus, high efficiency of transfer of Neu5Ac from α2–3-sialyllactose over 4-methylumbelliferylsialic acid to lactose by active TS could be explained by this model. Natural sialosides as α2–3-sialyllactose would fit correctly in the TS catalytic pocket, inducing the acceptor donor to bind and increasing transference rates, whereas synthetic donors, as 4-methylumbelliferyl-sialic acid and p-nitrophenyl sialic acid, would not be able to trigger a sufficient shifting in the enzyme framework to allow acceptor binding, being better substrates for hydrolysis reaction (25Harrison J. Kartha K.P.R. Turnbull B.W. Scheuer S.L. Naismith J.H. Schenkman S. Field R.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that enzymatically inactive molecules of the TS family are sialic acid- and β-Galp-binding proteins that can play an important role during the T. cruzi infection, and that inhibition of TS activity based on sialic acid analogues may transform T. cruzi TS in a β-Galp-binding lectin. Therefore, polyvalent galactosides/sialosides provide intriguing possibilities for the design and synthesis of selective TS inhibitors. We thank Dr. A. C. C.

Proteins contain all of the information in their primary structure to dictate their native conformation (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5212) Google Scholar). However, many proteins cannot reach this final state unassisted. A large and diverse group of proteins, termed chaperones, has therefore evolved to facilitate the folding of other proteins in the nonideal environment of the cell (reviewed in Refs. 2Bukau B.

Each subunit of the chaperonin contains an apical, intermediate, and equatorial domain. The apical domain binds misfolded or denatured target protein, whereas the equatorial domain contains the ATP binding pocket. The residues that form inter-ring and most of the intra-ring contacts are also found in the equatorial domain. The intermediate domain acts as a hinge between the other two, enabling allosteric changes determined by the bound nucleotide state that result in coordinated conformational changes throughout the chaperonin. Chaperonins are divided into two categories: type I and type II. Type I chaperonins are found in prokaryotes (e.g. GroEL) and prokaryotically derived organelles. Type I chaperonins are characterized by a homo-oligomeric structure and act in conjunction with a co-chaperonin (GroES in the case of GroEL) (9Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A.

Prefoldin (PFD) is a chaperone that interacts exclusively with type II chaperonins. It was originally discovered both in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae screen for genes involved in microtubule formation (where it was called GIM, for genes involved in microtubule biogenesis) (22Geissler S. Siegers K. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and through the purification of an actin folding complex formed when denatured actin is diluted into crude cytosolic extracts (23Vainberg I.E.

Eukaryotic PFD is a multisubunit complex containing six polypeptides in the molecular mass range of 14–23 kDa. In archaea, on the other hand, PFD is composed of two types of subunits, two α and four β (24Leroux M.R. Fandrich M. Klunker D. Siegers K. Lupas A.N. Brown J.R. Schiebel E. Dobson C.M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6730-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The six subunits associate to form two back-to-back up-and-down eight-stranded β barrels, from which hang six coiled coils. Each subunit contributes one (β subunits) or two (α subunits) β hairpin turns to the β barrels (25Siegert R. Leroux M.R. Scheufler C. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 103: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The coiled coils are formed by the N and C termini of an individual subunit. Overall, this unique arrangement resembles a jellyfish. The eukaryotic PFD hexamer is composed of six different subunits; however, these can be grouped into two α-like (PFD3 and -5) and four β-like (PFD1, -2, -4, and -6) subunits based on amino acid sequence similarity with their archaeal counterparts (23Vainberg I.E.

Modeling programs suggest that the subunits will adopt the same β-hairpin turns and coiled coils seen in the archaeal homologues (24Leroux M.R. Fandrich M. Klunker D. Siegers K. Lupas A.N. Brown J.R.

Cell. 2000; 103: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent electron-microscopic three-dimensional reconstructions have demonstrated that eukaryotic PFD has a six-legged structure similar to that seen in the archaeal homologue (26Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic PFD has been shown to bind both actin and tubulin co-translationally (27Hansen W.J. Cowan N.J. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The chaperone then delivers the target protein to CCT, interacting with the chaperonin through the tips of the coiled coils (26Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Unlike chaperonins, whose function is essential to life, ablation of PFD in the yeast S. cerevisiae results in viable cells. However, these are growth-compromised and have characteristic cytoskeletal phenotypes (22Geissler S. Siegers K. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). No authentic target proteins of any archaeal PFD have been identified. Because eukaryotic PFD is heterohexameric, it has been hypothesized that the individual subunits are not redundant. An important question therefore concerns the contribution of each subunit to the binding of specific target proteins and the organization of the subunits within eukaryotic PFD. Here we present data that demonstrate the ability of the subunits to spontaneously self-assemble into the functional PFD complex. We also show that the distal region of different but overlapping sets of subunits are critical for complex formation with actin versus α- and β-tubulin and suggest a model for the order of the six subunits within the heterohexamer. Full-length subunit-encoding fragments were generated by PCR using a human testis cDNA library (Clontech Inc.) as template. The PCR products were cloned into pET23b (PFD1–4, NdeI/BamHI), pET23a (PFD5, NdeI/XhoI), and pET23d (PFD6, NcoI/EcoRI) expression vectors at the sites indicated.

PFD3—Inclusion bodies containing PFD3 were twice washed by resuspension in buffer VIII and once by resuspension in buffer IX, in each case using a Dounce homogenizer. Material recovered by centrifugation (50,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) was dissolved in a minimal volume of buffer X and centrifuged at 60,0000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. Four volumes of buffer XI were added to the recovered supernatant, which was then dialyzed against buffer XII. PFD4 —The bacterial supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of buffer XIV and applied to a Q15 anion exchange column that was washed and developed with a linear gradient of the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. PFD4 eluted from the column in the range 20–28 mS/cm. PFD5—The bacterial supernatant was exchanged into buffer XIV using a column of Sephadex G25 and applied to a Q15 anion exchange column, which was washed and developed with a linear gradient similar to that used to purify PFD4. PFD5 eluted at a conductivity of 4–12 mS/cm. Fractions containing PFD5 were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer XV. PFD5 emerged as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. PFD6 —The bacterial supernatant was exchanged into buffer XVI using a column of Sephadex G25 and applied to a SP-Sepharose column equilibrated and eluted as described for PFD4. PFD6 eluted in the range of 11–20 mS/cm. Truncated subunits (designated Δ) were generated by PCR and cloned into the pET23a (PFDΔ1, -Δ2, -Δ3, -Δ5, and -Δ6) or pET23b (PFDΔ4) expression vectors at the NdeI/BamHI sites. The extent of the different truncations is shown in Table II. With the exception of PFDΔ3 (where the truncation starts at M62), the recombinant truncated subunits contained an additional methionine at their N terminus.Table IIExtent of PFD subunit truncationsWild type PFD subunitAmino acid residuesΔPFD subunitAmino acid residuesPFD11-122PFDΔ123-107PFD21-154PFDΔ233-113PFD31-196PFDΔ362-164PFD41-130PFDΔ432-108PFD51-154PFDΔ539-125PFD61-129PFDΔ620-102 Open table in a new tab Cells expressing the truncated proteins were lysed, and pellets and supernatants were prepared as described above for the corresponding wild type proteins. All proteins were moderately to well expressed, and all but PFDΔ5 were to some extent soluble. Lysis products were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Purification protocols for each subunit from either insoluble inclusion bodies (PFDΔ1, -Δ2, -Δ3, -Δ5, -Δ6) or soluble supernatants (PFDΔ4) were as follows. PFDΔ1, PFDΔ2, and PFDΔ6—Inclusion bodies were twice washed by resuspension in buffer VIII and once by resuspension in buffer IX. Material recovered by centrifugation (50,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) was dissolved in a minimal volume of buffer X and centrifuged at 60,0000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. The recovered supernatant was diluted into 10 volumes of buffer XI and dialyzed stepwise at 4 °C against buffer XII and then buffer XIII. The final dialysate was concentrated to 0.5 ml using Centricon YM3 units (Amicon) and applied to a Superdex 75 FPLC column equilibrated in buffer XIV. The recombinant proteins emerged from the column as symmetrical peaks with apparent molecular masses of ∼10 kDa. PFDΔ3—Inclusion bodies containing PFDΔ3 were treated as described above through dialysis, except that they were washed only with buffer IX. PFDΔ4—The supernatant prepared following bacterial lysis was desalted into buffer XVII using a column of Sephadex G25 and applied to a Q15 anion exchange column, which was washed and developed with a linear gradient of the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. PFDΔ4 eluted in the conductivity range 20–22 mS/cm. Appropriate fractions were pooled, concentrated, and fractionated on a Superdex 75 FPLC column equilibrated in PBS. PFDΔ4 eluted with an apparent molecular mass of ∼10 kDa. PFDΔ5—Inclusion bodies containing PFDΔ5 were treated as described above for PFDΔ1, except that the dialysis step was terminated at buffer XII. To generate wild type recombinant PFD, equimolar amounts (2–8 nmol) of all six subunits were combined in a total volume of 100–300 μl, brought to a final concentration of 1.5 m urea, and dialyzed against PBS for 1.5 h. The final dialysate was brought to 0.2 m NaCl, concentrated to 60 μl using a Centricon YM-10 membrane (Amicon), and applied to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 Smart system (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with PBS. Various PFDs containing different truncated subunits were assembled in a similar manner. The PFD2·PFD3 dimer was prepared by combining equimolar amounts (5–10 nmol) of PFD2 and PFD3 in a final volume of 200–400 μl. Reaction products were dialyzed against PBS for 1.5 h, concentrated, and fractionated in the same manner as for wild type PFD. The PFD5·PFD6 complex was generated by co-incubating equimolar amounts (5–10 nmol) of PFD5 and PFD6 in a volume of 15–30 μl for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were brought to a final volume of 60 μl with PBS and applied to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column. CCT purification from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, in vitro translation of actin, and generation of denatured, radiolabeled target protein were performed as previously described (18Gao Y. Thomas J.O.

Cross-linking reactions were done using 0.5 μm purified PFD2·PFD3 dimer in the presence of 20 mm EDC and various concentrations of AEDP (both from Pierce), in the range 0–20 mm, in PBS for 40 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to 40 mm, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking of the PFD2·PFD3 dimer with other subunit(s) was done under essentially the same conditions. The purified PFD5·PFD6 complex was covalently cross-linked at a final concentration of 0.9 μm in PBS for 20 min at room temperature using glutaraldehyde in the range 0.0015–0.5%. The reaction was quenched by the addition of Tris, pH 8.0, to 40 mm, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To generate trimers containing PFD2·PFD3·PFD1 and PFD2·PFD3· PFD4, subunits were added to the cross-linking reaction containing PFD2·PFD3 at the following concentrations: PFD1, 1.5 μm; PFD4, 3.5 μm; PFD5, 0.8 μm; PFD6, 0.7 μm; and PFD5·PFD6, 0.5 μm. Each reaction was done in PBS containing 20 mm EDC and 5 mm AEDP for 40 min at room temperature and quenched and analyzed as described above. To generate dimers of PFD1/2, subunits were incubated together in the presence of 20 mm disulfosuccinimidyl tartrate in PBS. The subunits were all used at a concentration of about 3 μm. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature and was then quenched with 80 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purification of Recombinant PFD Subunits and Their Assembly into Functional Hexamer—We cloned all six subunits of human PFD into pET vectors and expressed them separately in E. coli. All six were to some extent soluble and were purified to minimally 80% homogeneity as judged by Coomassie staining following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The purified products behaved in a manner consistent with the size expected on the basis of the predicted open reading frame, with the exception of PFD3; this appeared smaller than the expected polypeptide. Analysis by N-terminal peptide sequencing revealed that PFD3, when expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli, initiates at Val31 rather than at Met1 (data not shown). To circumvent this unwanted result, we reduced the GC content wherever possible in the region encompassing the first nine amino acids, consistent with maintaining the bona fide PFD3 amino acid sequence. This resulted in a construct that initiated at M1 in E. coli. Because PFD is an oligomer, we sought to determine whether its assembly from its constituent subunits could occur in the absence of other factors. To do this, we co-incubated approximately stoichiometrically equal amounts of each subunit and analyzed the resulting products by gel filtration. In this experiment, a major symmetrical peak emerged from the column with an apparent molecular mass of about 120 kDa (PFD runs larger than its true molecular mass due to the extended nature of the molecule) (Fig. 1B). The contents of this peak migrated as a single species when run on a nondenaturing gel and contained all six subunits upon analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the PFD hexameric complex can spontaneously assemble from its individual subunits. Individually, none of the subunits exhibited chaperone ability (data not shown). To determine whether the spontaneously assembled hexameric complex was functional in terms of its ability to transfer target protein to CCT, radiolabeled, unfolded actin was diluted into buffer containing hemoglobin (as a negative control), buffer containing purified bovine PFD (bvPFD) (as a positive control for actin-PFD binary complex formation), or buffer containing bvPFD followed by the addition of CCT (as a positive control for the transfer of radiolabeled actin from PFD to CCT). In each case, the products were analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–3). In parallel experiments using recombinant PFD, a complex formed with a mobility slightly less than that formed using the bovine homologue. We found that recombinant PFD-bound, labeled actin was as efficiently transferred to CCT as in the control experiment done using bvPFD purified from testes (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5). We conclude that recombinant PFD is functional in terms of its ability to deliver its bound target protein to CCT. Binding of Actin and Tubulin Target Proteins to PFD— Electron microscopy studies suggest a similar jellyfish-like structure for archaeal and eukaryotic PFD (26Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and algorithms also predict coiled-coil structures for the eukaryotic PFD tentacles similar to those seen in the archaeal homologue. To investigate the possibility that the tips of the eukaryotic PFD tentacles are also involved in target protein recognition, we generated truncated forms of each of the six subunits in which at least three distal turns in both the N- and C-terminal α-helixes were removed, resulting in subunits with trimmed coiledcoils. In all cases, four or more turns of each α-helix were maintained, making coiled-coil formation possible (Table II). Each construct engineered for the production of truncated subunits was expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant protein was purified. Various PFD hexamers were assembled in the same manner as the wild type molecule, each containing from one to six truncated subunits. All combinations assembled spontaneously and migrated as symmetrical peaks when assayed by gel filtration or as a single band when analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. An example of such a truncated, assembled PFD (in this case, PFD truncated in all six subunits, migrating with an apparent molecular mass of about 100 kDa) is shown in Fig. 2A; the content of this species (Fig. 2A, inset) was confirmed by spontaneous assembly and analysis of various PFD(Δ1–6) preparations in which one or more subunits had been individually radiolabled (data not shown). As expected, the PFDs containing truncated subunits all migrated with molecular masses slightly less than that of wild type PFD, in proportion to their content of truncated subunits. Actin and tubulins are known targets of PFD (22Geissler S. Siegers K. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H.

When presented with radiolabeled, denatured actin or α- or β-tubulin, bvPFD and wild type PFD formed a stable binary complex. However, PFD in which all six subunits had been truncated completely failed to form a stable complex with either actin or α- or β-tubulin (Fig. 2B). We conclude that at least some of the tentacles' tips play an essential role in the binding of target proteins to eukaryotic PFD. Archaeal PFD is assembled from only two different types of subunit, α and β (24Leroux M.R. Fandrich M. Klunker D. Siegers K. Lupas A.N. Brown J.R. Schiebel E. Dobson C.M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6730-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tips of the tentacles are largely hydrophobic, as is the cavity that they form. In contrast, eukaryotic PFD contains six different subunits, all of which have charged residues at the distal end of the coiled-coils (26Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L.

https://openalex.org/W1974887652,"DsbB is an Escherichia coli plasma membrane protein that reoxidizes the Cys30-Pro-His-Cys33 active site of DsbA, the primary dithiol oxidant in the periplasm. Here we describe a novel activity of DsbB to induce an electronic transition of the bound ubiquinone molecule. This transition was characterized by a striking emergence of an absorbance peak at 500 nm giving rise to a visible pink color. The ubiquinone red-shift was observed stably for the DsbA(C33S)-DsbB complex as well as transiently by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy during the reaction between wild-type DsbA and DsbB. Mutation and reconstitution experiments established that the unpaired Cys at position 44 of DsbB is primarily responsible for the chromogenic transition of ubiquinone, and this property correlates with the functional arrangement of amino acid residues in the neighborhood of Cys44. We propose that the Cys44-induced anomaly in ubiquinone represents its activated state, which drives the DsbB-mediated electron transfer.

Then, the two active site cysteines must be reoxidized for the continuing catalysis, and a plasma membrane protein, DsbB, is responsible for this reoxidation (8Bardwell J.C.A. Lee J.O. Jander G.

In vivo studies showed that the respiratory components of the cell are required for the maintenance of the oxidized state of DsbB, thus providing an oxidizing equivalent to the DsbA/DsbB system (11Kobayashi T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that UQ directly activates DsbB for the DsbA-oxidizing activity (13Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 14Bader M. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). E. coli DsbB has four transmembrane segments and two periplasmic regions. Each periplasmic region contains a pair of essential cysteines; Cys41 and Cys44 in the N-terminal periplasmic loop (P1) and Cys104 and Cys130 in the C-terminal periplasmic domain (P2) (15Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The reactive Cys30 residue of DsbA, having an unusually low pKa value, forms a stable mixed disulfide bond with Cys104 of DsbB in the absence of the Cys30 partner (Cys33) in DsbA. It was proposed that DsbB oxidation of DsbA proceeds via the disulfide-bonded intermediate between these proteins (16Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J.C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol.

Thus, electrons from reduced DsbA first move to the Cys104-Cys130 pair of DsbB, followed by further intramolecular electron transfer to the Cys41-Cys44 disulfide (18Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the Cys41-Val42-Leu43-Cys44 motif of DsbB is kept strongly oxidized by the respiratory components, suggesting an electron flow from Cys41-Cys44 to UQ (12Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Kobayashi T. Takahashi Y. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggest that the above-mentioned serial arrangement is too simple to account for the actual molecular mechanism of the DsbB-mediated DsbA oxidation reaction. Several questions have been asked. First, are the sequence of reactions driven simply by the intrinsic redox potential differences of the cysteine pairs involved? The experimental results of Inaba and Ito (20Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as well as those of Regeimbal and Bardwell (21Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) gave a negative answer to this question. Specifically, the redox potential of Cys104-Cys130 in DsbB (-250 mV) is much lower than that of Cys30-Cys33 in DsbA (-120 mV) such that their in vitro reactions proceed only in the “reverse” direction. The above authors also showed that redox potential of the Cys41-Cys44 pair is again lower (-210 to -270 mV) than that of DsbA. More recently, however, Grauschopf et al. (22Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reached the opposite conclusion for the Cys41-Cys44 redox potential (estimated to be -70 mV), using DsbB preparations chemically deprived of UQ. The second question is whether or not the reaction proceeds by sequential rearrangements of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds. Kadokura and Beckwith (23Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggested that the four cysteine residues of DsbB act in concert rather than sequentially. A split DsbB construct allowed identification of a DsbA-DsbB complex that was held together by two disulfide linkages, the Cys30(DsbA)-Cys104(DsbB) intermolecular bond and a Cys130-Cys41(DsbB) interdomain bond. This complex was proposed to be a real reaction intermediate in the electron transfer between DsbA and DsbB (23Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Regeimbal and Bardwell (21Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as well as Grauschopf et al. (22Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) argued against the involvement of any disulfide-linked intermediary complexes in the reaction. Finally, the controversies have extended to the essential roles of UQ and of DsbB cysteines. While Grauschopf et al. (22Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that DsbB can oxidize DsbA, at least stoichiometrically, without involving UQ, Regeimbal and Bardwell (21Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) proposed that UQ directly oxidizes the DsbA cysteines without involving the DsbB cysteines, whose role would be not in the chemistry of this system but in proper positioning of UQ. Thus, molecular details of the DsbA-DsbB-UQ system are at different levels of controversy, and their unified understanding is still awaited. In the present work, we describe a novel property of DsbB to induce an anomalous electronic transition of UQ molecule, in which its absorption spectrum is strikingly red-shifted. This property was observed stably in model DsbB proteins, in which its Cys44 residue became unpaired due to mutations or to a complex formation with the DsbA C33S mutant protein. It was lost by DsbB-inactivating amino acid changes in the vicinity of Cys44. The UQ red-shifting was observed transiently during an in vitro reaction between the DsbB-UQ conjugate and reduced DsbA. Plasmids Encoding DsbB, DsbA, and Their Derivatives—All the DsbB derivative proteins in this work contained a His6 tag attached to the C terminus, and their non-essential cysteine residues (Cys8 and Cys49) mutated to Ala and Val, respectively (13Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding DsbB-His6 was constructed by cloning the SphI-BamHI dsbB-his6 fragment of pSS51 (18Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) into the multicloning sites of pQE70 (Qiagen). This DsbB protein is simply referred to as DsbB in this study. Plasmids encoding DsbB variants with additional amino acid alterations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with appropriate sets of primers. The plasmids constructed were all verified for sequences of the open reading frames. The dsbA plasmid was constructed by cloning the EcoRI-HindIII dsbA fragment of pSS18 (10Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) into the multicloning sites of pUC119. A plasmid encoding DsbA(C33S) was constructed also by QuickChange mutagenesis. Bacterial Strains, Protein Expression, and Purification—Plasmids encoding DsbB and its derivatives were introduced into E. coli M15 strain harboring pRep4 (Qiagen), a compatible lac repressor plasmid required for the controlled expression of a gene cloned under the T5-lac composite promoter-operator of the vector pQE70. Cells were grown at 37 °C on L-medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, induced with 10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a turbidity of Klett unit 60, and harvested at 4 h after the induction. DsbB and its derivatives were purified essentially as described by Bader et al. (13Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 24Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol.

Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) indicated that the purified preparations of DsbB contained ∼0.5 mol equivalent of endogenously bound UQ. DsbA and its derivative were also overexpressed and purified as described previously (20Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The purity of DsbB and the DsbA preparations was at least 95% as judged from Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained band patterns after SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Spheroplasts—Cells overproducing wild-type DsbB were suspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)-20% sucrose, followed by addition of 0.1 volume of 1 mg/ml lysozyme dissolved in 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0) and incubation on ice for 30 min. Preparation of Ubiquinone-free DsbB—To prepare DsbB without endogenously bound quinones, it was overproduced in the ubiA-menA double mutant strain, AN384 (ubiA420 menA401; 25). Plasmid-bearing cells were grown in L medium supplemented with 90 mm sodium phosphate or HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm p-hydroxybenzoate and 0.4% glucose (11Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To deplete intracellular quinones, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with the same medium without p-hydroxybenzoate, and grown further in the p-hydroxybenzoate-free medium. The DsbB synthesis was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (5 μm) for 4 h. The DsbB protein thus expressed was purified by the standard procedures and shown to contain less than 0.05 molar equivalent of UQ. Thus, we have successfully removed UQ from DsbB. This preparation is referred to as DsbB(ΔUQ). Spectroscopic Measurements—DsbB preparations (100 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1% DDM as well as their mixtures with DsbA(C33S) (200 μm) were scanned for absorption spectra from 300 to 700 nm, using HITACHI U-3310 spectrophotometer (light path, 1 cm). To determine pH dependence of the DsbB-DsbA(C33S) red-shifting, the above scans were carried out in buffers of pH 5.0-9.0 with increment steps of 0.5. Then, absorbance values at 500 nm (A500) were plotted against pH, and the transition intensities were fitted according to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation shown in Equation 1, Aexp=Amin+(Amax-Amin)/(1+10(pKa-pH))(Eq. 1) in which Aexp indicates an experimentally determined A500 value, Amax is the maximally red-shifted absorbance and Amin is the non-shifted absorbance. To detect a transient absorption red-shifting during the reaction between reduced DsbA and a preincubated DsbB-UQ1 mixture, absorption spectra around 500 nm were monitored by a rapid scanning monochrometer (OLIS) equipped with a stopped-flow device (UNISOKU; light path length, 0.7 cm). The reaction was initiated at 0 °C by a 1:1 mixing of reduced DsbA (80 μm) and oxidized DsbB(ΔUQ) (80 μm) preincubated with 80 μm UQ1. The buffer solution was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.02% DDM, which had thoroughly been degassed and flushed with nitrogen before use. Scans from 400 to 640 nm were repeated 10 times per second. Electrophoretic Assay of the DsbA-DsbB Reaction Time Course— Redox reactions between DsbB and reduced DsbA were allowed to proceed as described above, except that UQ1 concentration was 1 mm. After mixing, samples were withdrawn and immediately mixed with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Denatured and precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), washed with cold acetone, and dissolved in modification buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, and 1 mm AMS. Reduced and oxidized forms of the proteins as well as their mixed disulfide complex were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (without any reducing agents), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Band intensities were quantified by means of Fuji LAS-1000 CCD image analysis. An Anomalous Spectroscopic Behavior of UQ Observed for a DsbB-DsbA(C33S) Complex—A disulfide-linked complex is formed stably in vivo between DsbB and a variant of DsbA (DsbA(C33S)) that retains the reactive Cys30 residue but lacks Cys33 (16Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J.C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17072-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This complex could also be formed by mixing these two proteins in vitro (electrophoretic data not shown). Surprisingly, this mixture proved to be colored pink (Fig. 1A, right). In contrast, isolated DsbB protein did not show such a remarkable pink color and was light yellow due presumably to the endogenously bound UQ molecules (Fig. 1A, left). DsbA(C33S) was colorless (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the pink color development was observed in a more physiological setting in which spheroplasts prepared from cells overproducing wild-type DsbB were mixed with the purified DsbA(C33S) preparation (Fig. 1B, right). Such outstanding color development was not observed without addition of DsbA(C33S) (Fig. 1B, left) or without overproduced DsbB (data not shown). Absorption spectrum measurement showed an absorbance peak at 500 nm for the mixture of DsbB and DsbA(C33S) (Fig. 1C, broken line). UQ molecules have a major absorption maximum at 275 nm and a weak peak at 400 nm. The DsbB preparation itself exhibited this small 400-nm peak along with a broadly distributed shoulder at 500-700 nm (Fig. 1C, continuous line). When DsbB was mixed with wild-type DsbA, steadystate pink color was not appreciably observed (see, however, the last section below for a transient spectrum change). In this case, only a broad and small peak was observed around 550 nm and even the DsbB original peak at 400 nm disappeared almost completely (Fig. 1C, dotted line). The latter observation was due to reduction of the bound UQ upon successful oxidation of DsbA. Indeed, dithiothreitol treatment of a DsbB-DsbA(C33S) mixture abolished both the yellow color and the pink color (data not shown). UQ Is Responsible for the Color Development—A possibility that some metal complex or prosthetic group is actually associated with DsbB was unlikely, since no metal atoms were detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (data not shown). Also, DsbB activity was unaffected by a chelating agent; either EDTA or ortho-phenanthroline (data not shown). To examine whether UQ was directly responsible for the unusual color development of the DsbB-DsbA(C33S) complex, we used a UQ-free DsbB preparation (DsbB(ΔUQ); see “Experimental Procedures”). DsbB(ΔUQ) exhibited no significant absorption of visible light, whether by itself or in combination with DsbA(C33S) (Fig. 1D, bottom dotted line). Addition of a commercially available ubiquinone derivative, UQ1, to the mixture of DsbB(ΔUQ) and DsbA(C33S) resulted in the development of visible pink color, whose intensities increased with increasing UQ1 concentrations (Fig. 1D). The UQ1-dependent absorbance increase at 500 nm was saturable. The maximum intensity was reached at an equimolar ratio of UQ1 and DsbB concentrations (Fig. 1D, inset). These results indicate that the absorption at 500 nm was due to the UQ molecule that binds to DsbB in a 1:1 ratio, a number that agrees with the quantitation results of Bader et al. (14Bader M. Xie T. Yu C.-A. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Is the spectroscopic behavior observed above compatible with the chemical structure of UQ? Rhodoquinone exhibited a very similar absorption spectrum (Fig. 1E). This illustrates the potentiality of quinone-related compounds to have an absorption peak at 500 nm. We conclude that the yellowish UQ1 spectrum (maximum at 400 nm) is red-shifted (500 nm) when it is in association with the DsbB-DsbA(C33S) complex. Specific Contribution of Cys44 in DsbB for the Electronic Transition of UQ—The red-shifting of the UQ spectrum may represent some perturbed electronic state that is induced in a special state of DsbB. In the DsbB-DsbA(C33S) complex, Cys104 is engaged in the mixed disulfide and Cys130 will be reduced, suggesting that this thiol is responsible for the effect on UQ. However, it is also possible that Cys130 then attacks Cys41-Cys44 to form a Cys130-Cys41 disulfide (23Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and consequently to reduce Cys44, which in turn affects UQ. Another important question is whether DsbA has any direct role in the color development. To address the questions raised above, we examined spectroscopic properties of DsbB cysteine mutants, DsbB[SCCC], [CSCC], [CCSC], and [CCCS]. These DsbB variants, having Cys41, Cys44, Cys104, or Cys130, respectively, mutated to Ser, were purified and examined for their absorption spectra from 300 to 700 nm (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, DsbB[SCCC] and Dsb-B[CCSC] preparations were pink-colored, with spectroscopic features very similar to that of the DsbA(C33S)-DsbB complex (compare Figs. 1B and 2A), although the A500 and λmax values fluctuated somewhat among these proteins. It should be noted that the UQ transition can take place without directly involving DsbA. In contrast, neither DsbB[CSCC] nor DsbB[CCCS] had absorbance peak at 500 nm (Fig. 2A). These two DsbB variants still formed a mixed disulfide complex with DsbA(C33S), but without eliciting the spectroscopic transition of bound UQ (data not shown). We also constructed DsbB[CSSC], a Cys44 mutant of [CCSC]. It did not exhibit a strong absorbance peak at 500 nm (Fig. 2B). Weak absorbance peaks were noted at ∼350 and 400 nm for DsbB[CSCC] and DsbB[CSSC] (Fig. 2, A and B). DsbB(ΔUQ) lacked both peaks (Fig. 1D) and free UQ (Fig. 1E) and the wild-type DsbB preparation (Fig. 1C) had only the latter. Thus, the 350 nm peak is UQ-related and detected only in conjunction with DsbB that lacked Cys44; the Cys41-Cys44 disulfide may prevent its formation. Presently, the significance of this 350-nm peak is obscure, although it may represent another form of perturbed UQ in association with DsbB. The most important and compelling information for the cysteine residue that was directly responsible for the UQ red-shifting was provided from another construction, DsbB[SCSS], in which all the essential cysteines other than Cys44 had been mutated. This DsbB variant, having the sole cysteine at position 44, was fully competent in the production of the red-shifted state of UQ (Fig. 2B). These results, taken together, established that unpaired Cys44 is primarily responsible for the perturbation of the UQ electronic state, giving rise to an absorption maximum at 500 nm. Cys130 is not directly involved in this transition, although it can contribute to the formation of unpaired Cys44 through its ability to form a Cys41-Cys130 disulfide (Ref. 23Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and see below). It is notable again that DsbA has no direct role in the UQ transition. As already discussed, reduction of Cys44 residue might be an ultimate outcome in the DsbB-DsbA(C33S) complex, which explains the red-shifting of the bound UQ. While Kadokura and Beckwith detected a Cys130-Cys41 linkage in the split DsbB molecule (23Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we confirmed the occurrence of the Cys130-Cys41 disulfide bond using a DsbB[CSSC] preparation (Fig. 2C). Thus, these two residues should be in a close mutual proximity in the three-dimensional structure and may be a preferred combination for the intramolecular disulfide bond formation when Cys104 is unavailable. The contention that the Cys44 thiol reacts with UQ received additional experimental support. First, iodoacetamide diminished markedly the 500-nm absorbance of either DsbB[SCSS] or DsbB-DsbA(C33S) (Fig. 2D). It should have modified the Cys44 thiol. Secondly, the absorbance was pH-dependent, disappearing below pH 5.0 (Fig. 2E). The low pH effect was reversible, and the absorbance resumed at pH 8.0 (data not shown). From the pH dependence profile of the absorbance change, a pKa value for this transition was calculated to be 6.6 ± 0.1 (Fig. 2F). It is possible that this value corresponds to the pKa for Cys44, assuming that the deprotonated thiolate group of Cys44 interacts with the bound UQ to red-shift its electronic state. UQ Red-shifting Is Correlated with the Functional Local Structure Around Cys44—Our previous insertion/deletion analyses suggested that a DsbB segment flanked by Cys44 and the membrane-integrated region is important for the respiratory chain-coupled oxidation of DsbB (19Kobayashi T. Takahashi Y. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the length of this segment may be crucial. A DsbB mutant with an alanine inserted between Tyr46 and Glu47 did not show any color development by itself or even when it was mixed with DsbA(C33S) (Fig. 2G). We also examined another non-functional DsbB mutant, having Gly-Pro in place of Val-Leu flanked by Cys41 and Cys44 (19Kobayashi T. Takahashi Y. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This DsbB mutant was also incapable of developing the pink color either in the absence or presence of DsbA(C33S) (Fig. 2G). These two inactivating mutations did not impair the complex formation with DsbA(C33S) (data not shown), indicating that they specifically affected the DsbB-UQ interaction. Furthermore, a mutant protein having both the [SCSS] substitutions and the alanine insertion failed to exhibit the color development (data not shown). Far-UV circular dichroism spectrum measurements indicated that these DsbB alterations did not cause any gross conformational changes (data not shown). These results indicate that the unusual electronic state of the bound UQ requires the proper structural/sequence organization of the neighborhood region of Cys44. UQ Is Red-shifted Transiently During Reaction Between Wild-type DsbB and DsbA—Is the anomalous electronic state of UQ generated during the reaction between wild-type DsbB and DsbA? We followed their reactions, which were slowed down at 0 °C and at pH 9.0 (24Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), by means of a rapid-scanning monochrometer equipped with a stopped-flow device. Immediately after mixing 40 μm each of reduced DsbA and oxidized DsbB that had been preincubated with externally added UQ1, a prominent absorbance appeared around 500 nm (Fig. 3A). The absorbance intensity had already reached the maximum at ∼4 s and declined thereafter to a ground state. The change of absorbance intensity at 500 nm (A500) was fitted well by a single exponential function with a rate constant of 0.05 s-1, indicative of a monophasic reaction (Fig. 3B). A shoulder at 550-600 nm appeared at an early time period and became increasingly dominating as the reaction proceeded. This shoulder seems to be a characteristic feature of the end products of these reaction components (see Fig. 1B, dotted line). We also observed a transient absorption appearance under a more physiological pH condition (pH 8.0), using the DsbB protein containing endogenously bound UQ (i.e. UQ8) prepared from wild-type cells. In this case, the reaction was accelerated ∼14-fold (k = 0.69 s-1) and the red-shifting was observed during the time window of 0.4-2.0 s after mixing (data not shown). Thus, we were able to observe a transient appearance of the red-shifted UQ during reactions involving wild-type proteins. To directly follow the redox changes of these proteins during the reaction at 0 °C and at pH 9.0, samples were withdrawn and subjected to instantaneous termination by treatment with trichloroacetic acid. The acid-denatured proteins were then solubilized in buffered SDS solution that contained 1 mm AMS, a thiol-reacting alkylating agent capable of retarding electrophoretic mobility of the modified protein. DsbA oxidation proceeded very rapidly and its reduced form disappeared within ∼15 s (Fig. 3C). A significant amount of a disulfide-linked DsbB-DsbA complex was observed at the earliest possible sampling time. The decay kinetics of this complex was significantly slower than that of reduced DsbA. Thus, complete oxidation of DsbA required about 40 s. It is noted that the appearance/decay curve of the DsbB-DsbA complex (Fig. 3D) was similar to that of the A500 value (Fig. 3B), which is describable in terms of a single exponential function with a rate constant of 0.07 s-1. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the transiently f"

The present study describes a newly isolated glycation product of lysine, which was found in the human lens. Cataractous and aged human lenses were hydrolyzed and fractionated using reverse-phase and ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). One of the nonproteinogenic amino acid components of the hydrolysates was identified as a 3-hydroxypyridinium derivative of lysine, 2-ammonio-6-(3-oxidopyridinium-1-yl)hexanoate (OP-lysine). The compound was synthesized independently from 3-hydroxypyridine and methyl 2-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-6-iodohexanoate. The spectral and chromatographic properties of the synthetic OP-lysine and the substance isolated from hydrolyzed lenses were identical. HPLC analysis showed that the amounts of OP-lysine were higher in water-insoluble compared with water-soluble proteins and was higher in a pool of cataractous lenses compared with normal aged lenses, reaching 500 pmol/mg protein. The model incubations showed that an anaerobic reaction mixture of Nα-tert-butoxycarbonyllysine, glycolaldehyde, and glyceraldehyde could produce the Nα-t-butoxycarbonyl derivative of OP-lysine. The irradiation of OP-lysine with UVA under anaerobic conditions in the presence of ascorbate led to a photochemical bleaching of this compound. Our results argue that OP-lysine is a newly identified glycation product of lysine in the lens. It is a marker of aging and pathology of the lens, and its formation could be considered as a potential cataract risk-factor based on its concentration and its photochemical properties.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Glycation is a natural process observed in living systems, consisting in post-translational modifications of the side chains of amino acids in proteins by reactive carbonyl components. Glycation is a multistage and multidirection process. Initially, so-called “early glycation products” are formed. At this stage the modifications of amino acids are reversible.

AGEs are important from a medical point of view because their concentration increases during aging (1Frye E.B. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or in different medical complications such as cataract formation (2Cheng R. Lin B. Lee K.W. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1537: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), retinopathy (3Sugimoto H. Shikata K. Wada J. Horiuchi S. Makino H. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 878-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and nephropathy (4Chibber R. Molinatti P.A. Rosatto N. Lambourne B. Kohner E.M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A natural protective mechanism against glycation and other harmful post-translational modifications is protein turnover. The vast majority of protein molecules has a limited life span and is periodically degraded and rebuilt. A remarkable exception are the proteins in lens fiber cells, especially those in the lens nucleus, being as old as the individual to whom they belong. Thus, the lens is a very appropriate tissue to study the accumulation of AGEs in vivo. The characterization and quantification of AGEs are based on chemical, spectral, and immunological techniques. Two major types of experiments are used for this purpose: either the properties of the biological sample are compared with those of in vitro glycated protein standard(s) or the tissue specimens are characterized/quantified with respect to a specific AGE with known structure. The first approach is popular probably because the preparation of in vitro glycated standards is rapid, inexpensive, and requires little labor. A serious drawback of such an approach, however, is that the conditions for preparation of in vitro glycated proteins are very different from in vivo glycated proteins. Usage of enormous amounts of glycating agent and/or elevated reaction temperatures is more the rule than the exception. There is no guarantee that the structures, and the relative amounts of products built in vitro, match those of AGEs formed in vivo. In the contrary, model glycation reaction mixtures can contain major glycation products, which do not exist in vivo (5Tessier F.J. Monnier V.M. Sayre L.M. Kornfield J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another problem is that the first approach refers to an abstract or imaginary value, “total AGEs,” whereas it is clear that at least the known AGEs belong to completely different structural classes having little in common. In contrast, the approach based on characterization and quantification of known AGEs gives specific information about the progress and extent of glycation in vivo. The only limitation of this approach is that it could be applied only to AGEs whose structure has already been identified. In this article we report for the first time that the amino acid 2-ammonio-6-(3-oxidopyridinium-1-yl)hexanoate 1 (Fig. 1) is a component of the proteins in aged and cataractous lenses. Being a 3-oxidopyridinium derivative of lysine, we suggest the trivial name OP-lysine for compound 1. We also present a possible reaction pathway for its formation as a result of post-translational modification of lysine residues on proteins. In our experiments OP-lysine appeared in RP-HPLC profiles of processed cataractous lens acid hydrolysates as one of the major peaks absorbing at 290 nm and the strongest fluorescence peak at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm. The spectral and RP-HPLC properties of this compound were very similar to those of another glycation product, HOP-lysine 2. In a previous study (6Argirov O.K. Lin B. Olesen P. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1620: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) we reported that HOP-lysine (a 4-hydroxymethyl derivative of OP-lysine) can be formed from dehydroascorbic acid, l-erythrulose, l-threose, and glycolaldehyde in vitro when reacted with lysine-containing material. The same compound, referred to as GA-pyridine, was reported as a component of proteins in human atherosclerotic lesions based on immunohistochemical staining pictures (7Nagai R. Hayashi C.M. Xia L. Takeya M. Horiuchim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48905-48912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This encouraged us to gather reliable chemical evidence about the structure of the lens protein component with absorbance at 290 nm and fluorescence at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm. As a result, the presence of OP-lysine in pooled cataractous and aged lenses was discovered.

Synthesis of OP-lysine—OP-lysine was prepared according to a modified method published by (11Adamczyk M. Johnson D.D. Reddy R.E. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 63-88Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction pathway is presented in Fig. 2. Briefly, Boc-Lys (4.92 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml of water; pH of the solution was brought to 9.5 with 4 m sodium hydroxide, and the temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 6 h. pH of the reaction mixture was corrected to 9.5 periodically during incubation. The sample was cooled and filtered through Celite 521. The filtrate was saturated with sodium chloride, pH was brought to 3.5 and the solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 40 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with 40 ml of 30% NaCl and dried overnight over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sample was concentrated under reduced pressure. The yield was 4.1 g of the crude compound 6. Part of this product (3.5 g) was stirred with 10 ml of ether, which caused partial crystallization of the compound. A solution of diazomethane in diethyl ether (see under “Materials”) was added dropwise with stirring until the appearance of a stable yellow color of diazomethane. The initial solid was dissolved completely at the end of the reaction. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 3.3 g of the crude product 7. The latter was dissolved in 150 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and triphenylphosphine (5.0 g, 19 mmol), imidazole (1.4 g, 20 mmol), and iodine (4.8 g, 19 mmol) were subsequently added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature under argon for 2 h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and 15 ml of ethyl acetate was added to the product. The solid residue was eliminated by filtration, and the filtrate was separated on a 120-g Redi-Sep column using hexanes/ethyl acetate 4:1 (v/v). Fractions of 7 ml were collected and analyzed by TLC using hexanes/ethyl acetate 4:1 (v/v). The fractions with Rf = 0.39 were combined, concentrated, and dried under reduced pressure to give 772 mg (2.1 mmol) of product 8. The total yield of the three steps for transformation of Boc-Lys to compound 8 was 10%. A mixture containing product 8 (680 mg, 1.83 mmol, 1 eq), 3-hydroxypyridine (285 mg, 3 mmol, 1.6 eq), and 10 ml of anhydrous dioxane was incubated for 24 h at 100 °C under argon. The resulting reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, dissolved in 5 ml of methanol, and treated with silver oxide (254 mg, 1.1 mmol, 1.2 eq). The precipitate was eliminated by centrifugation. The supernatant was separated using normal phase chromatography on silica gel and eluant methanol. The fractions collected (7 ml each) were analyzed by TLC using eluant methanol, and those containing a spot with Rf = 0.42 were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give product 9 (162 mg, 0.48 mmol, 26%). Part of the product (68 mg, 0.23 mmol) was dissolved in 0.680 ml of 0.5 m NaOH. The sample was left at room temperature for 4 h and then acidified to pH 4.5 with 2 m HCl. One-quarter of the sample was dried under reduced pressure and treated with 0.5 ml of trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min at 0 °C. Trifluoroacetic acid was evaporated in a stream of argon, and the residue was dried under reduced pressure. The product was purified by preparative RP-HPLC. The peak, showing UV absorption maximum at 289 nm and fluorescence at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm, was collected and dried under reduced pressure. The yield of the HFBA adduct of OP-lysine (1) was 39.7 mg. In a separate experiment compound 9 was deprotected as described above. The crude product 1 was purified according to the procedure described previously (11Adamczyk M. Johnson D.D. Reddy R.E. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 63-88Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in order to obtain trifluoroacetic acid adduct of OP-lysine, 1·2 trifluoroacetic acid. This product (10.4 mg, 23 μmol) was dissolved in 2 ml of water and was used as a stock solution for fluorescence and UV measurements, including preparation of calibration curves for quantification of OP-lysine based on the peak area in RP-HPLC. The chromatographic profiles were recorded by absorbance at 289 nm and fluorescence at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm. A sample, containing 5.0 nmol OP-lysine in 100 μl of water, was hydrolyzed in 5 ml of 6 n HCl for 22 h at 110 °C. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure; 5.0 ml of water was added and re-evaporated, and finally, the residue was dissolved in 100 μl of water. Both the starting solution and the hydrolysate were analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. The chromatogram of the hydrolysate showed a single major peak with the UV spectrum, retention time, and fluorescence spectrum corresponding to those of the original OP-lysine sample. The sample was analyzed also by ESI-MS spectrometry. The recovery of the peak following acid hydrolysis was 90 (according to a fluorescence calibration curve) and 85% (according to the A289 calibration curve) compared with the peak area of the initial OP-lysine standard. Preparation and Analysis of Lens Protein Hydrolysates—Fifty cataractous lenses (52-75 years old, average age 64 years, mostly type II-III (12Pirie A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1968; 7: 634-650Google Scholar)), 50 aged normal human lenses (60-76 years old, average age 69 years), and 10 fetal calf lenses were processed in the following way. Each type of lens was pooled, decapsulated, homogenized in 25 ml of water, and separated by centrifugation at 30,000 × g. The pellet was washed twice with 20 ml of water followed by centrifugation. The water-soluble fractions were extensively dialyzed against water for 3 days and freeze-dried. The water-insoluble fractions of cataractous lenses and aged normal human lenses were dried under reduced pressure. The slight water-insoluble fraction of calf lenses was discarded. Samples containing 100 mg of lyophilized protein were hydrolyzed with 10 ml of 6 n HCl under argon for 22 h at 110 °C in Teflon-sealed glass tubes. The samples were dried under reduced pressure; 5 ml of water was added and re-evaporated. The solid residue obtained after hydrolysis was dissolved in 1 ml of water. The samples from cataractous, normal human aged, and calf lenses (200 μl each) were passed through ODS cartridges (3 ml, 0.5 g solid phase) using 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected and analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. Chromatograms were recorded using ESI-MS/MS and PDA detectors as well as fluorescence and PDA detectors. The amounts of OP-lysine in the hydrolysates were calculated using the fluorescence peak areas at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm and the UV peak areas at 289 nm. Isolation of OP-lysine from Hydrolyzed Cataractous Lenses—Part of the hydrolyzed water-insoluble cataractous lens protein (see above), corresponding to 25 lenses or 800 mg of dry protein, was separated on a 60-ml (10 g solid phase) ODS cartridge using eluant water/methanol/trifluoroacetic acid = 100:20:1 (v/v/v) and collecting 4-ml fractions. The fractions were screened by analytical RP-HPLC for the presence of OP-lysine, and fraction 6 showed both UV and fluorescence peaks corresponding to the retention time of the synthetic OP-lysine. The fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and separated using analytical IE-HPLC (gradient A) by multiple injections. Two major broad peaks appeared on the chromatograms. The second one, with retention interval of 20-30 min, was concentrated under reduced pressure and repurified by using preparative RP-HPLC. The peak corresponding to OP-lysine was concentrated and separated using analytical IE-HPLC (gradient B) by multiple injections. Two major peaks were detected in the chromatograms at A289 and fluorescence at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm. The second peak with retention time 19.6 min was concentrated under reduced pressure. The peak was finally purified by preparative RP-HPLC. The product was analyzed by 1H NMR and co-eluted with authentic sample of OP-lysine when analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC and analytical IE-HPLC (gradient B). Detection of OP-lysine in Digested Cataractous Lenses—Enzymatic digest of water-insoluble sonicated supernatant from cataractous lenses was prepared as described previously (2Cheng R. Lin B. Lee K.W. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1537: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The final solution was concentrated 10-fold and analyzed by liquid chromatography ESI-MS/MS. Analyses of in Vitro Reaction Mixtures for the Presence of OP-lysine— Ten carbonyl compounds, DHA, d-glucose, d-fructose, l-xylose, l-erythrulose, methylglyoxal, dl-glyceraldehyde, dl-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 1,3-dihydroxyacetone, and glycolaldehyde, were reacted with Boc-Lys. Reaction mixtures containing 100 mm carbonyl compound, 50 mm Boc-Lys, 1 mm DTPA, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, were incubated at 37 °C for 7 days under argon. The mixtures were analyzed by preparative RP-HPLC. The chromatograms were monitored for UV absorbance in the range of 200-400 nm and the fluorescence at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm. None of the analyzed reaction mixtures showed a peak with spectral features and retention times close to those of the synthetic OP-lysine except the reaction mixture Boc-Lys + glyceraldehyde. The peak from this reaction system was collected, concentrated under reduced pressure, and deprotected using 200 μl of trifluoroacetic acid at 0 °C for 15 min. Trifluoroacetic acid was eliminated by a stream of argon, and the residue was analyzed by ion-exchange chromatography in both the absence and presence of the synthetic OP-lysine standard using analytical ion-exchange chromatography (gradient B). Detection and Isolation of OP-lysine from Model Systems Containing Boc-Lys and Mixtures of Carbonyl Compounds—A 10-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm glycolaldehyde, 50 mm dl-glyceraldehyde, 50 mm Boc-Lys, 1 mm DTPA, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, was incubated at 37 °C under argon for 7 days. The reaction mixture was separated on an ODS cartridge (10 g, 60 ml, Supelco) using 2% methanol in water. Fractions of 40 ml were collected and analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. The fractions containing a peak corresponding to the Boc derivative of OP-lysine were concentrated under reduced pressure. The solid residue was treated with 200 μl of trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min at 0 °C. Trifluoroacetic acid was eliminated in a stream of argon, and the deprotected product was purified again by preparative RPHPLC. Two major peaks having close retention times, strong absorbance at 289 nm, and fluorescence at excitation/emission at 290/390 nm were collected. The samples were concentrated and further separated by analytical RP-HPLC. The fractions corresponding to OP-lysine were collected, concentrated under reduced pressure, and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. A yield of 1.1 μmol (0.20%) was obtained based on the peak areas of OP-lysine in the analytical RP-HPLC separations. The product was subjected to co-elution experiments with a synthetic standard of OP-lysine both using analytical RP- and IEHPLC (gradient B). Analogous reaction mixture containing 50 mm methylglyoxal instead of 50 mm dl-glyceraldehyde was analyzed by preparative RP-HPLC. Irradiation of OP-lysine with UVA in the Presence of Ascorbate— Irradiations were performed using a 1000-watt Hg/Xe lamp (Oriel Corp. Stratford, CT) and 338 nm cut-off filter, producing 900 J h-1 cm-2 UVA. A 2-ml solution containing 0.01 mm OP-lysine, 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, 1 mm DTPA, and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, was saturated with argon for 10 min. The sample was irradiated for 60 min at 17 °C in a quartz cuvette with Teflon septum cap and 1-cm optical path length with constant stirring. The UV spectrum of the mixture was recorded every 15 min in the range of 200-400 nm. The dark control was kept in a dark chamber at room temperature, and the UV spectrum was measured as described above. Similarly, a solution containing all the components listed above but ascorbate was irradiated and analyzed under the same conditions. Mass Spectrometry Experiments—Mass spectra, MS/MS-spectra, and liquid chromatography-MS/MS profiles were recorded on a Thermo-Finnigan system (San Jose, CA) consisting of quaternary pump P4000, auto sampler AS3000, PDA detector UV6000LP, and mass spectrometer TSQ7000 with API 2 source and performance pack. The data were processed with the software pack Xcalibur 1.2. The masses of the parent and the daughter ions in the MS/MS and liquid chromatography-MS/MS experiments described below were measured within a ±0.5 Th window centered on the mass-to-charge ratio of interest. The collision energy used for MS/MS experiments was 20 eV. This study of OP-lysine involved isolation of small amounts of the compound from cataractous lenses, estimation of its structure based on UV, 1H NMR, and MS spectra, unequivocal synthesis, and characterization of larger amounts of standard OP-lysine, experiments that proved the identity between the biological material and the standard quantification of OP-lysine in acid hydrolysates of lens proteins and liquid chromatography-MS/MS experiments showing that OP-lysine exists in lens enzymatic digests. Our initial interest was provoked by the similarity of the UV and fluorescence spectral properties between this specific and unknown component of acid-hydrolyzed lenses and another known AGE, HOP-lysine. The final result of the study was that OP-lysine is one of the most abundant known UVA-absorbing AGEs in cataractous and aged lenses. Synthesis and Characterization of OP-lysine—OP-lysine was prepared using the synthetic path presented in Fig. 2. The preparation is a modified version of a synthesis published by Adamczyk et al. (11Adamczyk M. Johnson D.D. Reddy R.E. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 63-88Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The major change was the usage of methyl ester protection of the carboxyl group of Boc-Lys instead of t-butyl. The esterification of compound 6 with diazomethane was quantitative, and the only major side product was nitrogen gas, which allowed us to omit one preparative chromatographic separation. In addition, the use of methyl instead of t-butyl protection allowed for the selective deprotection of both the carboxyl and amino groups of condensation product 9 when necessary. Otherwise, the NMR spectral characteristics of compound 1 obtained by us perfectly matched the data published by Adamczyk et al. (11Adamczyk M. Johnson D.D. Reddy R.E. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 63-88Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), namely 1H NMR (CD3OD): δ 8.51 (m, 1H), 8.4 (m, 1H), 7.94 (m, 1H), 7.87 (m, 1H), 4.57 (t, 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 3.97 (t, 1H, J = 6.4 Hz), 2.07-1.94 (m, 4H), 1.60-1.50 (m, 2H) ppm.

The important intermediate 8 was also purified and its NMR spectral characteristics are as follows: 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 5.06 (d, 1H, J = 7.7), 4.31 (m, 1H), 3.75 (s, 3H), 3.18 (t, 2H, J = 6.9), 1.86-1.40 (m, 6H), 1.45 (s, 9H) ppm. 13C NMR (CDCl3): δ 173.0, 155.3, 79.9, 53.1, 52.3, 32.6, 31.6, 28.3, 26.1, 6.1 ppm.

https://openalex.org/W2087133824,"We describe here the first three-dimensional structure of the cardiac L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) purified from bovine heart. The structure was determined by electron microscopy and single particle analysis of negatively stained complexes, using the angular reconstitution method. The cardiac VGCC can be isolated as a stable dimer, as reported previously for the skeletal muscle VGCC, with a central aqueous chamber formed by the two halves of the complex. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dimeric cardiac VGCC binds the dihydropyridine [3H]azidopine with a Kd ∼310 pm. We have compared the cardiac VGCC structure with the skeletal muscle form, determined using the same reconstructive methodology, allowing us to identify common and distinct features of the complexes. By using antibody and lectin-gold labeling, we have localized the intracellular β polypeptides and the extracellular glycosylation sites of the skeletal muscle VGCC, which can be correlated to the cardiac three-dimensional structure. From the data presented here the assignment of the orientation of the VGCC complexes with respect to the lipid bilayer is now possible. A difference between the cardiac and skeletal muscle ion channels is apparent in the putative transmembrane region, which would be consistent with the absence of the γ subunit in the cardiac VGCC assembly.

In the heart, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VGCCs, voltage-gated calcium channels; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Ab, antibody; CHAPS, 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate); RyR, ryanodine receptors; FSC, Fourier shell correlation. 1The abbreviations used are: VGCCs, voltage-gated calcium channels; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Ab, antibody; CHAPS, 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate); RyR, ryanodine receptors; FSC, Fourier shell correlation. are essential for regulating the influx of Ca2+ ions across the sarcolemmal membranes, which are essential for muscle contraction. The blockade of Ca2+ entry through the cardiac VGCC represents one of the principal approaches for the treatment of ischemic heart disease. The VGCCs are often referred to as dihydropyridine receptors due to the high affinity binding of the dihydropyridine group of agonist and antagonist drugs. The calcium-conducting pathway of the VGCCs is formed by the α1 polypeptide, and 10 different tissue-specific isoforms of the α1 subunit have been identified to date (α1A-α1I, α1S, now termed Cav1.1-Cav3.3). Common to all of the α1 isoforms is a transmembrane domain composed of four homologous repeats each containing six α-helices (1Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The symmetrical arrangement of the S6 and S5 helices together with the linker polypeptide, contributed from each transmembrane segment, is believed to form the ion channel pore (2McCleskey E.W. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The α1C (Cav1.2, ∼240 kDa) is enriched in mammalian heart and vascular smooth muscle, whereas α1S (Cav1.1, ∼175 kDa) is expressed in skeletal muscle (1Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). There is a 66% sequence homology between these two α1 isoforms with conservation of the transmembrane repeats and the III-IV loop. Differences arise in the N- and C-terminal domains, which are slightly larger in the α1C polypeptide. In addition, regions assigned to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are less well conserved (3Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The α1 polypeptides of the VGCCs are stoichiometrically associated with a variable number of accessory subunits (4Leung A.T. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7943-7946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the heart, two additional proteins, α2δ and β, are believed to form the cardiac VGCC by non-covalent association with the α1C subunit (for review see Ref. 5Striessnig J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 242-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A diversity of α2δ subunits has been reported, and to date four genes have been identified with type 1 and, to a much lower extent, with α2δ-3 found in the heart (6Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A. Page K.M. Kusumi K. Perez-Reyes E. Lander E.S. Frankel W.N. Gardiner R.M. Dolphin A.C. Rees M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α2 polypeptide is entirely extracellular, heavily glycosylated, and is anchored to the membrane via disulfide bonding to the δ polypeptide (7Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R.

Four β isoforms have been identified (β1-β4), with β2 (∼66 kDa) found in high density in the heart together with β1b and, depending on species, β3 (9Hullin R. Friedrich I. Khan Y. Wirtz S. Mohacsi P. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Herzig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21623-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), with β1a (∼54 kDa) specific to skeletal muscle (10Pichler M.

An additional γ polypeptide (∼30 kDa) completes the fully assembled skeletal muscle VGCC, with topology studies indicating that it is predominantly hydrophobic with four transmembrane α-helices (11Jay S.D.

Although neuronal isoforms of this subunit have been identified (12Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence for the presence of a γ subunit forming part of the cardiac ion channel. The functions of these auxiliary subunits have not been fully established, but involvement in channel gating, stabilization of ligand binding, and the correct plasma membrane trafficking of the α1 polypeptide have been suggested (13Brickley K.

The structure was derived from negatively stained (uranyl acetate) complexes using the random conical tilt method (18Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y.H. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar) with an estimated resolution of 2.7 nm (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural data indicated that the VGCC complexes were dimeric. This dimer was roughly toroidal in shape, ∼21 nm across, and composed of two arch-shaped monomers each ∼7.5 nm thick. The two arches contact at each end creating a central void (∼8 nm in diameter) that is isolated from the external medium by two finger-like protrusions, extensions from the arches that curl around on each side. The dimensions and gross structural features of the dimeric particles are in good agreement with earlier rotary-shadowed images of freeze-dried, purified rabbit skeletal muscle VGCC complexes (20Leung A.T. Imagawa T. Block B. Franziniarmstrong C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 994-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Projection structures of negatively (uranyl acetate) stained monomeric VGCC complexes ∼20 × 10 × 9 nm in size have also been reported (21Murata K. Odahara N. Kuniyasu A. Sato Y. Nakayama H. Nagayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The monomers have the same height as the dimeric VGCC three-dimensional particles and are approximately half the base length. Serysheva et al. (22Serysheva II Ludtke S.J. Baker M.R. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10370-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) studied VGCC complexes that differed somewhat in dimensions to the monomers reported in Ref. 21Murata K. Odahara N. Kuniyasu A. Sato Y. Nakayama H. Nagayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kuniyasu A. Sato Y. Nakayama H. Nagayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Recently, Wolf et al. (23Wolf M. Eberhart A. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have presented a three-dimensional structure of a monomeric skeletal muscle VGCC using cryo-EM techniques. This structure shows some of the features reported by Murata et al. (21Murata K. Odahara N. Kuniyasu A. Sato Y. Nakayama H. Nagayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but differs with that reported in Ref. 22Serysheva II Ludtke S.J. Baker M.R. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10370-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. However, many of the features of the three-dimensional monomeric structure in Ref. 23Wolf M. Eberhart A. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar are also found in the dimeric structure presented here and earlier (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle monomers are approximately half the size of the dimer along one dimension, with the protruding “leg” density (23Wolf M. Eberhart A. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) bearing a strong resemblance to the “finger” domains that we have described.We have now extended our studies to the cardiac muscle VGCC, which represents a much more challenging target for structural studies because of its naturally low abundance in the heart. Several groups (e.g. Refs. 24Kuniyasu A. Oka K. Yamada T.I. Hatanaka Y. Abe T. Nakayama H. Kanaoka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 25Haase H. Striessnig J. Holtzhauer M. Vetter R. Glossmann H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sec. 1991; 207: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have reported purification protocols for isolating the cardiac VGCC with some success, although there has been a lack of consistency in polypeptide composition. We describe here the first three-dimensional structure for the purified cardiac VGCC using the angular reconstitution technique that is based on the common lines theorem (26Vanheel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 27Serysheva II Orlova E.V. Chiu W. Sherman M.B. Hamilton S.L. Vanheel M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and using the EMAN image processing suite (28Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of the Cardiac VGCCSarcolemmal membranes were prepared from bovine heart according to Ref. 29Jones L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. All buffers throughout the purification were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μml-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide(4-guananido)butane. Typically, 200 g of minced heart were used for one preparation. VGCCs were solubilized from the sarcolemmal membranes by incubation with 1% (w/v) digitonin (detergent:protein, 5:1) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 45 min with gentle agitation at 4 °C and at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. Unsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated on a DEAE column (10 ml, DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in solubilization buffer for 30 min. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2 containing 0.1% (w/v) digitonin. The VGCCs were eluted from the column using a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.5 m). The fractions containing the cardiac VGCC were determined by immunoblotting with antibodies against α1, β, and α2 subunits. Monoclonal antibodies for the α1 and α2 subunits were purchased from Sigma, and the β polyclonal antibody prepared as described previously (13Brickley K. Campbell V. Berrow N. Leach R. Norman R.I. Wray D. Dolphin A.C. Baldwin S.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The semi-purified VGCC fractions were pooled and incubated on a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) column, 10 ml (Sigma), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) digitonin for 30 min at 4 °C. The WGA column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibrating buffer and the cardiac VGCC eluted by the inclusion of 0.2 m N-acetylglucosamine (Sigma) in the equilibration buffer. The eluted fractions containing the cardiac VGCC (confirmed by immunoblotting) were concentrated using an Amicon concentrator (Millipore Ltd.). The concentrated fraction was then layered on top of a 5-30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) digitonin. Gradients were centrifuged for 90 min at 210,000 × g. 0.5-ml aliquots were taken from the gradient, with the presence of the cardiac VGCC complex in each fraction detected by Western blotting as described above. By using an Amicon concentrator, the buffer was exchanged (to remove the high concentrations of sucrose) with the purified cardiac VGCC material in a final buffer composed of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) digitonin (including the protease inhibitor mixture). This method typically yielded between 20 and 40 μg/ml purified cardiac VGCC (∼10-20 μg of purified protein/200 g of heart ventricles).Gel ElectrophoresisPurified cardiac VGCC preparations were examined by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots were incubated with sample buffer (60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) at 90 °C for 5 min. Non-reducing sample buffer was made as above, but the dithiothreitol was omitted from the sample buffer mix. 4-20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) were run at 200 V for 45 min. Native gels were run as described previously (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).ImmunoblottingProtein bands from gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Biometra Electrophoretic transfer cell. Ponceau S staining (0.2% (w/v) Ponceau S, 3% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, 3% (v/v) sulfosalicylic acid) of the nitrocellulose indicated that 90 min at 20 V was required for protein transfer as described previously (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against the cardiac VGCC α1 and α2 subunits were purchased from Sigma, and antisera and affinity-purified antibodies raised against anti-β peptide (Ab2491) were prepared as described previously (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Berrow N. Tedder I. Page K. Brice N. Amos B. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: P52-P53Google Scholar).Photoaffinity Labeling of the Cardiac VGCC ComplexesCovalent incorporation of [3H]azidopine with purified cardiac VGCC was carried out as described previously (31Taylor A.M. Storm J. Soceneantu L. Linton K.J. Gabriel M. Martin C. Woodhouse J. Blott E. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In brief, 40-μl aliquots (∼30 μg/ml) were incubated in the dark with [3H]azidopine with increasing concentrations ranging from 10 pm to 500 nm for 2 h on ice. The radioactive ligand was cross-linked to the cardiac VGCC samples by irradiation with a UV source (handheld Mineral light lamp, model UVSL-25) on ice for 5 min. Free azidopine was removed by running samples on gels after incubation with an equal volume of sample buffer. Gels were fixed and then soaked in Amplify™ (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak film (Biomax Light Film) for up to 28 days at -80 °C. Gels were also run in parallel, from which the region corresponding to the α1 polypeptide was excised and incubated for 3 days with scintillation fluid prior to liquid scintillation counting (Packard 2000CA liquid scintillator). Radioactive counts (counts/min) were plotted against [3H]azidopine concentration, and a double-reciprocal plot allowed an estimation of Kd.Size-exclusion ChromatographySize-exclusion chromatography was carried out by using a Bio-Rad HPLC system, equipped with a Bio-Gel TSK40 (300 × 7.5 mm) gel filtration column. Bio-Rad gel filtration standards, thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobulin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa), were used together with blue dextran (2 MDa, Sigma) and bovine serum albumin (64.43 kDa, Sigma) to calibrate the column. The column was equilibrated with 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS in the absence of asolecithin. The approximate molecular masses of eluted protein were determined from a calibration curve constructed from elution volumes of the gel filtration standards. Affinity-purified antibody raised against anti-β peptide (Ab2491) was used to detect the presence of the skeletal muscle VGCC complexes in the various HPLC fractions. 10-μl aliquots from HPLC fractions were dotted onto nitrocellulose and left to dry at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody Ab2491 (dilution 1:200). An anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) with an alkaline-phosphatase conjugate was employed for immunodetection. The spot areas were quantified using ImageQuant (version 5.1) after background subtraction.Electron MicroscopyCardiac VGCC preparations (20-40 μg/ml) were negatively stained with uranyl acetate and examined in a Philips Tecnai 10 transmission electron microscope as described previously (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded at a calibrated magnification of ×43,400 on Kodak Electron Image film SO-163. Electron micrographs were digitized (UMAX PowerLook 3000 Scanner) at a scan step of 16 μm (3.7 Å/pixel at the specimen level). Samples of skeletal muscle VGCC at 100 μg/ml protein (in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS (Sigma), 0.25% (w/v) asolecithin (l-α-phosphatidylcholine from soyabean, type II-S, Sigma), including protease inhibitors) were suspended in a thin layer of 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate and 1% (w/v) trehalose, pH 7.0, as described in Ref. 32Harris J.R. Hoeger U. Adrian M. Micron. 2001; 32: 599-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar on carbon-coated grids.Lectin and Immunolabeling of Skeletal Muscle VGCCLectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (from Triticum vulgaris), conjugated to 5 nm colloidal gold (British Biocell Ltd.) was incubated with the purified skeletal muscle VGCC samples as described previously (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); samples were then stained with ammonium molybdate/trehalose as described above. VGCC complexes were also double-labeled with both WGA-gold and affinity-purified anti-β peptide antibody (Ab2491) (30Berrow N. Tedder I. Page K. Brice N. Amos B. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: P52-P53Google Scholar). Samples were initially incubated with the WGA-gold conjugates (5 nm) followed by a second incubation with anti-β peptide antibody (Ab2491) each for 1 h at 4 °C followed by staining with ammonium molybdate/trehalose as described above.Image ProcessingThree-dimensional Reconstruction of the VGCCs—1,450 individual images were interactively selected from scanned micrographs of purified cardiac VGCC into 96 × 96 pixel boxes using the graphical interface boxer, part of the EMAN processing software (28Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). The selected particles were bandpass filtered, centered, and a set of reference-free class averages generated. In a similar manner 1,458 images of the purified skeletal muscle VGCC embedded in ammonium molybdate/trehalose were selected and treated using the same protocols for the cardiac VGCC data set. Following established procedures in the EMAN software suite, a preliminary three-dimensional model was determined from class averages that represented distinct views for each data set. The relative orientations of the characteristic views were determined using a Fourier common-lines routine and the averages combined to generate the preliminary three-dimensional model, the starting point for the main refinement loop. The class averages generated in the refinement loop are produced by a projection matching routine, whereby projections with uniformly distributed orientations of the preliminary three-dimensional model are used as references for classification of the raw data set, with the class averages from this step used to construct a new three-dimensional model. This is an iterative procedure with convergence assessed by examining the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of the three-dimensional models generated from each iteration. The final three-dimensional volumes for the cardiac and skeletal muscle VGCC data sets were determined after eight rounds of iterative refinement, from 75 and 79 class averages, respectively. As a validation of the software, raw particles forming several of the major classes were selected in SPIDER and subjected to reference-free alignment. The resulting class averages were compared with the EMAN class average that demonstrated good agreement (data not shown). The three-dimensional reconstruction for each data set was carried out with 2-fold rotational (C2) symmetry imposed in accordance with previous analyses (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and biochemical data.The untilted data set (2,405 particles) of purified skeletal muscle VGCC complexes stained in uranyl acetate (19Wang M.-C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was converted to EMAN format and a final three-dimensional model calculated as above.Back projections of the three-dimensional volumes were generated using SPIDER commands (18Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y.H. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). The resolution of each reconstruction was assessed by dividing the data set into two, calculating volumes for the two sub-sets, and estimated by the FSC coefficient with the resolution limit taken to be where the FSC value fell below 0.5 (33Bottcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A.

Complexes were selected (n = 67) using a box size of 110 × 110 pixels. Particles were initially aligned using reference-free methods, with selected class averages from this procedure used for multireference alignment of the data set.ModelingSequence alignment of the voltage-dependent potassium channel from the archaebacteria Aeropyrum pernix (KvAP) structure (34Jiang Y.X.

Mol. Graphics. 1998; 16: 285Google Scholar).RESULTSCharacterization of Purified Cardiac VGCC—A silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of cardiac VGCC purified from beef heart is shown in Fig. 1A, lane 2, illustrating that the cardiac VGCC preparation is composed of four principal polypeptides, α1 (∼230 kDa), α2 (∼120 kDa), β (∼66 kDa), and δ (∼33 kDa). Western blotting (lanes 3-5) confirmed the assignment of the α1, α2, and β subunits. The smeared band at ∼50 kDa was also found in lanes containing no protein, suggesting this was an artifact. Photolabeling of the purified cardiac VGCC with [3H]azidopine demonstrated that the radiolabeled ligand is specifically incorporated into a single band at ∼230 kDa, corresponding to the α1 polypeptide (see fluorogram profile in lane 6). Further analysis of the purified channel by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B, lane 1) revealed that the cardiac VGCC migrates as a single high molecular weight species, ∼800 kDa in molecular mass (indicated by the black arrow). The identity of the ∼800-kDa band as cardiac VGCC was established by Western blotting with an anti-α2 antibody as shown in lane 2, and by photoaffinity labeling with [3H]azidopine, see lane 3. The affinity of the cardiac VGCC (WGA eluent) for azidopine was examined by photolabeling with a range of [3H]azidopine concentrations from 10 pm to 500 nm. Bands corresponding to the ∼230-kDa α1 polypeptide from duplicate gels were excised and counted for radioactivity according to Ref. 38Ferry D.R. Rombusch M. Goll A. Glossmann H.

Sequencing analysis identified the factor as γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), which is an enzyme involved in glutathione metabolism. The addition of purified GGT protein to mouse bone marrow culture effectively induced formation of osteoclasts. An antibody against GGT inhibited osteoclast formation but not the enzymatic activity. We also demonstrated that an inactive form of GGT, the enzymatic activity of which had been blocked by chemical modification with a specific inhibitor, acivicin, supported osteoclast formation. These results indicate that GGT acts on osteoclast formation independent of its own enzymatic activity. Furthermore, both native GGT and inactive GGT stimulated the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) mRNA and protein from bone marrow stromal cells.

Tumor cells that have metastasized to bone induce osteoclastogenesis via the secretion of bone-resorbing factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, IL-11, and prostaglandin E2 (13Guise T.A. Mundy G.R. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 18-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar).Our previous study (15Ishizuka Y. Mochizuki R. Yanai K. Takatsuka M. Nonomura T. Niida S. Horiguchi H. Maeda N. Fukamizu A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the injection of BW5147 mouse T-lymphoma cells into AKR mice led to bone metastasis, accompanied by severe bone destruction. Conditioned medium from BW5147 cell cultures stimulated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+) multinucleated osteoclast (MNC) formation in the mouse bone marrow culture. Because TRAP activity is expressed specifically in osteoclasts lineage (16Minkin C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 17Cole A.A. Walters L M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 18Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the BW5147 cells produce an osteoclast-forming factor that may play a role in pathological bone resorption such as metastatic lesions.To identify and characterize the factor that promotes pathological bone resorption, we cloned a cDNA for the osteoclast-forming factor(s) from a BW5147 cell cDNA library by expression cloning using a Xenopus oocyte translation system. Consequently, we identified γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) as the bone-resorbing factor. GGT is an ectoenzyme that plays an important role in regulating glutathione metabolism (19Lieberman M.W. Barrios R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Rajagopalan S. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.Z. Wan D.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185PubMed Google Scholar) and is well known as a clinical marker for a number of diseases. In this study, we showed a possible mechanism by which GGT induces osteoclast formation using a mouse bone marrow culture system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—A mouse T-lymphoma cell line, BW5147 (CRL-1588), (20Roos E La Riviere G. Collard J.G. Stukart M.J. De Baetselier P. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 6238-6243PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Expression Cloning—Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from BW5147 cells and size-fractionated by means of sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The 2-4-kb fraction that had the greatest osteoclast-forming activity was used to construct a directional cDNA library using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) and SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Then 50 ng of poly(A)+ RNAs or cRNAs, which were synthesized in vitro from the pools of clones, were injected into Xenopus oocytes. The conditioned media were assayed for osteoclast-forming activity, which was determined using the assay described below. Each positive pool was further subdivided and analyzed until a single clone was obtained.Mouse Bone Marrow Culture—Bone marrow cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) obtained from the tibias and femurs of 5-12-week-old C3H/HeJ mice (Nippon Clea) were cultured in 96-well plates in 180 μl of α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10-8m 1,25(OH)2D3. A 20-μl aliquot was added on day 1 of the culture. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing a 20-μl aliquot at 3-day intervals. After 7 days of culture, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for TRAP activity. The TRAP staining solution containing 50 mm sodium tartrate detects osteoclasts specifically (16Minkin C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 17Cole A.A. Walters L M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The number of TRAP+ MNCs (>3 nuclei) was scored under a microscope. Bone marrow stromal ST2 cells, which support hematopoiesis, were also co-cultured with bone marrow hematopoietic cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) that were passed through a Sephadex G-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) under the same conditions.Calcitonin Binding Assay—For autoradiography using 125I-salmon calcitonin, the cells were cultured on a chamber slide and incubated with 0.2 nm125I-salmon calcitonin in α-minimal essential medium for 1 h at 37 °C after TRAP staining as described previously (18Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Pit Formation Assay—To determine the resorption activity of TRAP+ MNCs, the bone marrow cells were seeded on the dentine slices placed in 96-well plates or on calcium phosphate-coated slides (osteologic multitest slide, Millennium Biologix). The dentin slices and osteologic slides were stained for TRAP activity. After staining, the TRAP+ cells on the dentin or slides were removed with a scraper, and the number of pits was counted under a phase-contrast microscope.GGT and Antibody—GGT was purified from rat kidney as described previously (21Miester A. Tate S.S. Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 237-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). When enzymatically inactive GGT (designated as I-GGT) was prepared, the purified enzyme was allowed to react with acivicin (l-(αS,5S)-α-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid), which potently inhibits the enzyme by covalently binding to the active site (22Ikeda Y.

Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After the residual activity was decreased to less than 0.1%, unreacted reagents were removed by gel filtration using Toyopearl HW40-F (Tosoh) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. A goat IgG against rat GGT was prepared as described in the previous report (24Taniguchi N. Yososawa N. Iizuka S. Sako F. Tsukada Y. Satoh M. Dempo K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 417: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Non-immune goat IgG (Sigma) was used as a control antibody. Endotoxin was undetectable in these antibodies, as verified using an endospec kit (Seikagaku Co.).GGT Assay—The enzymatic activity of GGT was measured using a GGT 419 assay kit (Sigma).Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The purified GGT was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 11% gels according to the Laemmli procedure (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) and was visualized using silver staining (26Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The bone marrow-adherent cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% w/v SDS, 1% w/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels, and Western blotting was performed using anti-mouse RANKL (Imgenex) antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibodies. RANKL was detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Total protein extracted from mouse and rat kidneys was used as control for GGT.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from BW5147 cells and bone marrow cultures using Isogen (Nippongene). All of the RNA samples were then transcribed into first strand cDNA using a Gene Amp RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cDNAs were amplified by hot start PCR with the primers from the sequences of GGT or RANKL. The primers used were as follows: mouse GGT, 5′-ATCATCGGCCTCTGTATCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTGTTGTAGATGGTGAAGA-3′ (antisense); mouse RANKL, 5′-ACACCTGGAATGAAGAAGATAAATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCCACTACTACCACAGAGATGAAG-3′ (antisense); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel.For the quantitative real time PCR analysis of RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA levels, total RNA was extracted from bone marrow-adherent cells. The Light Cycler system (Roche Diagnostics) was used with the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBRGreen I mix, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reactions were carried out up to 43 cycles with denaturing at 95 °C exposure, annealing at 55 °C, and extension at 72 °C. The primers used for this system were as follows: mouse RANKL, 5′-TCTGCAGCATCGCTCTGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAGTGAGTGCTTTTGTCTTCTGA-3′ (antisense); mouse OPG, 5′-CTTGCCTTGATGGAGAGCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGCTCGATTTGCAGGTCT-3′ (antisense); elongation factor-1α1 (EF-1α1) as an internal standard, 5′-GGTGATTATCCTGAACCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATATCAACAATGGCAGCATC-3′ (antisense).RESULTSExpression Cloning of Osteoclast-forming Factor—The culture medium of Xenopus oocytes injected with poly(A)+ RNA from BW5147 cells induced the formation of a significant number of osteoclast-like cells in mouse bone marrow cultures, as indicated by an increased number of TRAP- and CT-receptor-positive MNCs (data not shown). After fractionation of the poly(A)+ RNA by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, to enrich the mRNA that encodes for this factor, the fraction from 2-4 kb, which contained the greatest amount of this factor, was used as a template to prepare a cDNA library. As a result, ∼630,000 individual clones were obtained, which were then divided into 63 pools, each of which contained ∼10,000 clones. These pools were grown separately, and cRNA was prepared from each pool by in vitro transcription. Following expression in the Xenopus oocytes as a result of cRNA injection, the resulting culture media were screened for osteoclast-inducing activity. One positive pool was found to contain high levels of activity, and this pool was further subdivided and screened. After several rounds of screening, several positive clones including colony stimulating factor-1, RANKL, IL-1, and IL-6 were obtained. One unknown positive clone remained, and this cDNA clone was sequenced (GenBank accession number E15738). A data base homology search indicated that the factor cloned was identical to mouse GGT (Ref. 27Shi Z.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and GenBank™ accession number U30509). We confirmed that the culture medium had 40 units/ml of ggt activity and that the BW5147 cells expressed GGT mRNA (Fig. 1A). The conditioned medium of oocytes injected with GGT mRNA induced many TRAP+ MNCs in the bone marrow culture (Fig. 1C). More than 50% of the GGT-induced TRAP+ MNCs induced by GGT expressed the CT receptor autoradiographically (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, resorption pits were observed microscopically on the dentine slices or osteologic slides after 7 days of culture (Fig. 1E).Osteoclast-forming Activity of GGT—To verify the osteoclast-forming activity of GGT, the enzyme purified from rat kidney was subjected to an in vitro osteoclast-forming assay using bone marrow cultures without other bone-resorbing factors. The GGT used in this study produced only two protein bands, which corresponded to the large and small subunits of GGT (Fig. 2A). Treatment with a range of 5-625 ng/ml of GGT (equivalent to 0.08-10 nm) for 7 days in culture induced TRAP+ MNC formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Most of these cells expressed the CT receptor, and the resorption pit-forming activity was observed microscopically after 7 days of culture (data not shown). These results indicate that GGT serves as an inducer of TRAP+ MNCs, which satisfies the major criteria for osteoclasts. No endogenous GGT activity was detected in bone marrow cultures. The same results were obtained in additional examinations using recombinant human GGT, which was produced in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells with a baculovirus system as described previously (28Ikeda Y Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (data not shown).Fig. 2Osteoclast-forming activity of the purified GGT.A, purified rat GGT was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 11% gels. The large and small GGT subunits were visualized by silver staining for protein. B, the mouse bone marrow cultures were maintained for 7 days with various concentrations of purified rat GGT. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the number of TRAP+ MNC/well.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Involvement of Expression RANKL in GGT-induced Osteoclast Formation—RANKL is the key regulator of osteoclasto-genesis, and thus we examined whether RANKL is involved in the GGT-induced osteoclast formation. The osteoclast formation by GGT was inhibited dose dependently by OPG, a decoy receptor for RANKL (Fig. 3A). It was also found that GGT stimulated RANKL mRNA expression in bone marrow cells (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the induction of osteoclastogenesis by GGT involves RANKL expression.Fig. 3Inhibition study of osteoclast formation by OPG.A, the effects of OPG (3.1-50 ng/ml) on TRAP+ MNC formation induced by GGT were examined. The cultures were maintained for 7 days in the presence of GGT (625 ng/ml), and the cells were counted. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of the number of TRAP+ MNCs/well. B, RT-PCR showed up-regulation of RANKL mRNA expression in GGT-treated bone marrow culture. A blot loaded with 20 μg of total RNA from bone marrow cells cultured for 3 days in the presence of 625 ng/ml purified GGT was probed with RANKL and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition Studies of GGT-induced Osteoclast Formation— The osteoclast-forming activity of GGT in the bone marrow cultures was further supported by an inhibition study using an anti-GGT antibody. In bone marrow cultures containing 625 ng/ml purified GGT, TRAP+ MNC formation was inhibited by the anti-GGT antibody in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, solid bars), whereas substantial numbers of TRAP+ MNCs developed with non-immune antibodies (data not shown). The antibodies per se had no adverse effects on cell viability. Interestingly, this antibody did not have a significant effect on neutralizing the enzyme activity of GGT in these examinations (Fig. 4, hatched bars), suggesting that the osteoclast-forming activity of GGT is not associated with its enzymatic activity.Fig. 4Inhibition of osteoclast formation by the anti-GGT antibody. Cultures maintained for 7 days with various concentrations of goat anti-GGT IgG in the presence of 625 ng/ml purified GGT. The antibody inhibited TRAP+ MNC formation (solid bars) but not the enzyme activity (hatched bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Osteoclast-forming Activity of Enzymatically Inactive GGT—To further confirm that the osteoclast-forming activity of GGT does not require the enzyme activity, we prepared an inactive form of GGT (I-GGT), in which the active site was blocked by covalent binding of acivicin, and tested whether I-GGT supported TRAP+ MNC formation in bone marrow cultures. TRAP+ MNC-forming activity was also tested using the murine hematopoietic cell/ST2 cell coculture system that generates osteoclasts in vitro. In both systems, I-GGT also induced TRAP+ MNC formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). These results further support the suggestion that the osteoclastogenic activity of GGT does not require its own enzymatic activity.Fig. 5TRAP+ MNC-forming activity of inactive GGT. The inactive form of GGT (I-GGT) also affected TRAP+ MNC formation in the bone marrow cultures (BMC) (A) and the cocultures of ST2 and bone marrow hematopoietic cells (B). The cultures were maintained for 7 days with various concentrations of I-GGT. The cells were then processed to count osteoclasts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of RANKL in Stromal Cells—Most of the bone-resorbing factors act on the bone marrow stromal cells and stimulate RANKL production. To assess the induction of RANKL mRNA in response to GGT and I-GGT in stromal cells, we examined the expression of RANKL and OPG in bone marrow-adherent cells. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that both types of GGT induced a 4-fold increase in RANKL mRNA expression (Fig. 6A), whereas the level of OPG mRNA was slightly decreased (Fig. 6B). The same results were obtained in examinations using ST2 cells. In addition, the immunoblot analysis showed that there was increased RANKL protein expression (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that GGT stimulates RANKL expression in bone marrow stromal cells and thereby serves as a bone-resorbing factor in osteolysis. In contrast, GGT had no effect on RANKL production from bone marrow hematopoietic cells (data not shown).Fig. 6The induction of RANKL mRNA in stromal cells by GGT.A and B, total RNA from the bone marrow-adherent cells cultured for 3 days in the presence of GGT/I-GGT (625 ng/ml) was probed with RANKL, OPG, and elongation factor-1α1. The ratio of RANKL: elongation factor-1α1 and OPG:elongation factor-1α1 amplimers was calculated from the PCR results using the Light Cycler system. C, immunoblot analysis indicated increased RANKL protein expression in bone marrow-adherent cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis study used expression cloning, based on in vitro osteoclast-forming activity in mouse bone marrow cultures, which led to the successful cloning of a novel bone-resorbing factor from a cDNA library of mouse T-lymphoma, BW5147 cells. This factor was identified as GGT. Many previous studies have focused on the enzymatic functions of GGT. These studies have revealed that GGT catalyzes the first step in the degradation of glutathione and plays an important role in glutathione metabolism (29Taniguchi N. Ikeda Y. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 239-278PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of GGT is elevated under certain conditions, such as carcinogenesis (30Hanigan M.H. Frierson Jr., H.F. Brown J.E. Lovell M.A. Taylor P.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 286-290PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hanigan M.H. Frierson Jr., H.F. Swanson P.E. De-Young B.R. Hum. Pathol. 1999; 30: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Taniguchi N. House S. Kuzumaki N. Yokosawa N. Yamagiwa S. Iizuka S. Makita A. Sekiya C. J. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5835-5839PubMed Google Scholar), and it is used as a marker enzyme for many diseases. However, other biological activities of or significance of GGT have not yet been demonstrated.We showed that the purified GGT induced osteoclast formation in bone marrow culture. This induction was inhibited by OPG, and RANKL mRNA was elevated in the bone marrow cells stimulated by GGT. Therefore, it is most likely that GGT induces osteoclasts via expression of RANKL. Because BW5147 mouse T-lymphoma cells expressed GGT mRNA, GGT appeared to contribute to osteoclast-mediated bone destruction in bone metastasis involving BW5147 cells.As shown by experiments using anti-GGT antibody and chemically modified inactive GGT, the osteoclast-forming activity of GGT is not associated with the its enzymatic activity, which catalyzes transpeptidation and hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl moiety of glutathione and related compounds. In the induction of osteoclasts, therefore, it would be expected that GGT functions as a cytokine-like molecule, such as IL-1, via interaction with a presumable receptor. Furthermore, our results indicate that GGT acts on the bone marrow-adherent cells and the ST2 cells to express RANKL. Further investigation would be required to elucidate osteoclastogenesis mediated by GGT-dependent RANKL expression.The GGT plays an important role in normal development. GGT-deficient GGTm1/GGTm1 mice have some metabolic defects and exhibit growth retardation (34Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z.-Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C.-N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is unlikely that GGT is essential for physiological osteoclastogenesis because a recent study demonstrated that the number of osteoclasts was increased in GGT-deficient GGTm1/GGTm1 mice (35Levasseur R. Barrios R. Elefteriou F. Glass II, D.A. Lieberman M.W. Karsenty G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2761-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although GGTm1/GGTm1 mice have some bone abnormalities, including osteoclast, chondrocyte, and osteoblast, N-acetylcysteine treatment rescued most of these abnormalities. It was considered that the phenotypes observed in these mice are thought to result from impairment of cysteine metabolism (35Levasseur R. Barrios R. Elefteriou F. Glass II, D.A. Lieberman M.W. Karsenty G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2761-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the osteoclast-forming activity of GGT is clearly independent of its enzymatic activity. GGT may act as an enhancer for RANKL expression under the pathological conditions, such as bone metastasis, and serve as a local bone-resorbing factor. Although the details remain to be clarified, this study has contributed to elucidating a distinct alternative mechanism or a mechanism that accelerates abnormal bone loss.Expression of GGT is elevated in hepatic diseases and chronic alcoholism (33Taniguchi N.

Martinez-Riera A. Alcohol. 2000; 22: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that OPG prevents an ethanol-mediated bone loss by inhibiting osteoclast formation (40Zhang J. Dai J. Lin D.L. Habib P. Smith P. Murtha J. Fu Z. Yao Z. Qi Y.

This is consistent with our inhibition study of GGT-induced osteoclast formation by OPG, and, thus, osteoclast formation by GGT may account for osteopenia induced by these hepatic diseases.

VCAM-1 is an important adhesion molecule that is expressed on endothelial cells and has a critical role in endothelial activation, inflammation, lymphatic pathophysiology, and atherogenesis. The Sry-related high mobility group box factor Sox18 has previously been implicated in endothelial pathologies. Mutations in human and mouse Sox18 leads to hypotrichosis and lymphedema. Furthermore, both Sox18 and VCAM-1 have very similar spatio-temporal patterns of expression, which is suggestive of cross-talk. We use biochemical techniques, cell culture systems, and the ragged opossum (RaOP) mouse model with a naturally occurring mutation in Sox18 to demonstrate that VCAM-1 is an important target of Sox18. Transfection, site-specific mutagenesis, and gel shift analyses demonstrated that Sox18 directly targeted and trans-activated VCAM-1 expression. Importantly, the naturally occurring Sox18 mutant attenuates the expression and activation of VCAM-1 in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo quantitation of VCAM-1 mRNA levels in wild type and RaOP mice demonstrates that RaOP animals show a dramatic and significant reduction in VCAM-1 mRNA expression in lung, skin, and skeletal muscle. Our observation that the VCAM-1 gene is an important target of SOX18 provides the first molecular insights into the vascular abnormalities in the mouse mutant ragged and the human hypotrichosislymphedema-telangiectasia disorder.

The formation of blood vessels occurs through two distinct mechanisms, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). Vasculogenesis leads to the vascularization of the endodermally derived organs such as lung, intestine, spleen, liver, and stomach, whereas angiogenesis involves the vascularization of the organs of mesodermal and ectodermal origin such as the limbs, kidney, and the brain.

The Sox family displays both overlapping and distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns during embryogenesis and development. Aberrant Sox expression, mutation, or disruption leads to a number of diseases; for example, Sry and Sox9 are involved in sex reversal (13Koopman P. Gubbay J. Vivian N. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R.

The situation is similar for Sox18. In situ analysis of Sox18 has demonstrated expression in the mesenchyme underlying the developing hair follicle, in the presumptive heart, and in the developing vasculature (10Pennisi D. Gardner J. Chambers D. Hosking B. Peters J. Muscat G. Abbott C. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The naturally occurring mouse mutant ragged (Ra) of which there are four allelic variants, Ra, ragged Jackson (RaJ), ragged-like (Ragl) and RaOP, all contain mutations in Sox18 (15James K. Hosking B. Gardner J. Muscat G.E. Koopman P. Genesis. 2003; 36: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All these mutants display defects in hair and skin development. However, most life threatening is the generalized edema suffered by these animals (16Slee J. J. Genet. 1957; 55: 570-584Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is probably due to lymphatic aberrations (17Slee J. J.

Recently, a report has been published describing the investigation of several mutations in SOX18 and the hypotrichosislymphedema-telangiectasia (HLT) disorder in humans (20Irrthum A. Devriendt K. Chitayat D. Matthijs G. Glade C. Steijlen P.M. Fryns J.P. Van Steensel M.A. Vikkula M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Patients present with early onset alopecia of the scalp and lymphedema. The most severe lymphatic abnormality presented was non-immune hydrops fetalis (of unknown etiology). Telangiectasia was present in only in some of the patients studied, as were other anomalies such as thinness and transparency of the skin, hydrocele, and cutaneous papular vascular lesions. One of the major functions for the blood and lymphatic vascular system is to provide efficient access for leukocytes and other immune system molecules to all tissues of larger animals. The immune system responds to damage or illness via the accumulation of leukocytes, leading to a localized inflammation in the diseased area. This inflammatory response is necessarily tightly coordinated, as the lack of control can itself lead to various diseases, for example arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, atherosclerosis, and allergy (21Steinman L. Zamvil S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Smolen J.S. Steiner G. Nat. Rev.

Of the multitude of proteins involved in the immune system response, the cell adhesion molecules play a major role in mediating immune function and inflammation (25Krieglstein C.F. Granger D.N. Am.

Davis V. Li H. McCoy M.J. Sharpe A. Cybulsky M.I. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In vivo animal studies demonstrate that attenuated VCAM-1 function in mice provided protection against atherosclerosis. For example, mice with reduced (not ablated) VCAM-1 expression and function crossed with low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR–/– mice prone to atherosclerosis produce animals resistant to atherogenesis (35Cybulsky M.I. Iiyama K. Li H. Zhu S. Chen M. Iiyama M. Davis V. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Connelly P.W. Milstone D.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Much of the previous research has focused on the control of VCAM-1 expression via extracellular signals. For example, lipopolysaccharide and cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (36Barks J.L. McQuillan J.J. Iademarco M.F. J.

Moon S.O. Park S.K. Chae S.W. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcriptional regulation of VCAM-1 is less well understood. Most notable is the role of interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) in the control of VCAM-1 expression in muscle (42Jesse T.L. LaChance R. Iademarco M.F. Dean D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sox factors act as critical regulators of organ ontogeny via the modulation of expression of particular target genes. Surprisingly, relatively few target genes for this family of transcription factors have been described in the literature (11Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Therefore, to elucidate the function of Sox18 in the blood and lymphatic vascular system, the major site of expression and of abnormality in the ragged animal, it is important to find target genes in this organ. Our study demonstrates that native Sox18 (and not the mutant ragged form) is able to induce the activity of the VCAM-1 promoter. In biochemical assays we identified and characterized three Sox18 binding sites. However, we demonstrated that only the SoxB site at –715 is necessary for VCAM-1 trans-activation. In vivo validation of this data was obtained from the RaOP animals that have very significantly reduced levels (8–40-fold) of VCAM-1 expression (and not other adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, JCAM, NCAM-1, and PECAM-1). RNA and cDNA Preparation—RNA for realtime PCR was isolated from organs of RaOP and wild-type adult male siblings as described previously (45Hosking B.M. Wyeth J.R. Pennisi D.J. Wang S.C. Koopman P. Muscat G.E. Gene. 2001; 262: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with the exception that the lyophilized RNA was purified by processing ∼100 μg through a Qiagen RNeasy mini column. During this purification process the RNA was DNase-treated. Quantitation of the purified RNA was carried out as described previously (45Hosking B.M. Wyeth J.R. Pennisi D.J. Wang S.C. Koopman P. Muscat G.E. Gene. 2001; 262: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using 5 μg of purified RNA and primed with oligo(dT)18, using the Superscript III enzyme and the supplied manufacturer's protocol. Real Time PCR—Target cDNA levels were quantitated by real time RT-PCR using an ABI Prism™ 7700 Sequence Detector system utilizing SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR; used at 0.8×) as a nonspecific PCR product fluorescence label. Quantitation was >45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min two-step thermal cycling preceded by an initial 95 °C for 2 min for activation of 0.75 units of Platinum® TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The 25-μl reaction also contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each of dGTP, dATP, and dCTP, 400 μm dUTP, 0.5 units of uracil-N-glycosylase, 500 nm ROX reference dye (Invitrogen), and 200 nm each forward and reverse primers. Mus musculus primer sequences for VCAM-1 are as follows: forward, 5′-TGACAAGTCCCCATCGTTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCTCGCGACGGCATAATT-3′. Promoter Construct Generation—The sequence of the murine VCAM-1 promoter has been published elsewhere (46Korenaga R. Ando J. Kosaki K. Isshiki M. Takada Y. Kamiya A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1506-C1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is available on NCBI (accession number U42327). Mouse genomic DNA (C57BL/6) was a gift from J. Rowland, and 10 ng was used in the outer PCR amplification to generate the VCAM-1 promoter. Nested PCR was necessary for amplification of the 1895-bp promoter that has been published previously. Outer primers were constructed at the published upstream limit of murine VCAM-1 promoter at –1895 bp and within the first exon at 19 bp. The outer PCR was performed with 100 ng of each primer (–1895, 5′-GCCGGTACCGATCTACATAGCCACGGAGAG-3′; and 19, 5′-CGACCATCTTCACAGGCATTT-3′), 1.25 units of Pfu®, and 0.2 mm dNTPs in a final volume of 50 μl containing the supplied buffer (Promega). Hot start PCR was performed at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 4 min. The inner primers were constructed such that the 5′-primer at –1889 contained the restriction enzyme site KpnI (–1887, 5′-CGGGGTACCATAGCCACGGAGAGTTCTT-3′), whereas, the 3′-primer had the restriction enzyme site XhoI (–1, 5′-GCCCTCGAGTTCAAGTCTCTGCTTCAAAGCC-3′). 1 μl of the outer PCR was combined with buffer B and 0.25 units of polymerase mix from the Fail-Safe PCR system (Epicenter) and 100 ng of each inner primer in a final volume of 10 μl. The VCAM-1 inner PCR profile was the same as that used for the outer PCR. The product was digested with KpnI and XhoI, inserted into pGL2-Basic (pGL2B-Promega), and sequenced completely via automated sequencing using the ABI system and reagents. This clone was then used as the parental plasmid to generate all other sub-clones. Deletion clones were generated either by restriction digests or PCR amplification. VC1219 was generated by restriction digest with PstI and KpnI, and the vector plus the remaining insert were then blunt-ended with Klenow (New England Biolabs) and religated. Both VC754 and 504 were generated via PCR amplification with the primers 5′-GACTTCCTGTCATCCAGCAATGGGTCAAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCTTTGTTGAAAGAG-3′, respectively. The 3′-primer was the inner primer –1 from the initial nested PCR. The PCR profile was essentially the same as that done for the nested PCR, with the exception that the annealing temperature was 55 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis of the VCAM-1 promoter was undertaken via the QuikChange® II kit from Stratagene and carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primers used for the –1569 mutation are 5′-ATGACATGACATCATTGAGGTCCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGGACCTCAATGATGTCATGTCAT-3′. The primers used for the –715 mutation are 5′-GCTGGGGCATCATCAAACAAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTTGTTTGATGATGCCCCAG-3′. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—COS-1 (simian fibroblast) and SVEC4-10 (mouse high venule endothelial) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 6% CO2. C2C12 (mouse skeletal muscle) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum in 6% CO2. Cells for transfection were grown in 24-well dishes to 50–60% confluence before being transiently transfected with 2 μgofthe reporter plasmid and 1 μg of the expression plasmids in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum by a liposome-mediated procedure. Briefly, SVEC4-10 cells were transfected using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium propane methylsulfate (DOTAP) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in quantities 6-fold (v/w) the total amount of DNA, whereas COS-1 and C2C12 cells were transfected using 15 μl of DOTAP and 10 μl of 1,3-dioleoyloxy-2-(6-carboxyspermyl)-propylamid (DOSPER) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 24 h post-transfection the medium was replaced, and the cells were grown for a further 24–48 h. Each experiment represented at least two sets of independent quadruplicates to overcome the variability inherent in transfections. Cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (47Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—We have described previously the cloning and protein expression of a murine Sox 18 fusion construct with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) using the pGEX-1 bacterial expression vector (12Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Koopman P.A. Dowhan D.H. Dunn T.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2626-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli DH5a cells containing this vector were induced for 1–2 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside after the cells had grown to an A600 of 0.6. The pelleted cells were sonicated, and the cleared lysate containing the fusion protein was loaded onto glutathione-agarose columns in Dignam buffer C (containing protease inhibitors) (47Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After extensive column washing, the fusion protein was eluted with Dignam buffer C supplemented with 5 mm reduced glutathione. Probes used in all EMSAs were annealed and then radiolabeled using γ-32P and T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK). The oligonucleotide sequences used as probes are as follows: –1569, 5′-TTTTATGACATGACattgttGAGGTCCTC-3′ (top strand) and 5′-GAGGACCTCaacaatGTCATGTCATAAAA-3′ (bottom strand); –715, 5′-GGCTGGGGCattgtcAAACAAAAG-3′ (top strand) and 5′-CTTTTGTTTgacaatGCCCCAGCC-3′ (bottom strand); –491, 5′-GAAAGAGaacaatTTTTATTTTTTAAATTGCAAATGCATTTCTT-3′ (top strand) and 5′-AAGAAATGCATTTGCAATTTAAAAAATAAAAattgttCTCTTTC-3′ (bottom strand). The bases in lowercase letters represent the putative Sox binding sites. All EMSA experiments were carried out in a total of 20 μl in Dignam Buffer C containing 1–2 ng of T4 polynucleotide kinase-labeled probe and 2 μg of the purified, bacterially expressed GST-Sox 18. The assays were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and electrophoresed through a 6% (polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide; 20:1) gel in 80 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA. Gels were briefly soaked in 10% acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. Competition EMSAs were carried out basically as above with the exception that unlabeled probe was added to the reaction in 20–80-fold molar excess as compared with the labeled probe. Both the probe and an unlabeled competitor were added to the reaction at the same time and then incubated and electrophoresed as before. For these experiments, the unlabeled competitor in each reaction was the same double-stranded oligonucleotide as the probe used in that reaction. Cell-specific Transcription of the Mouse VCAM-1 Is Regulated by the 5′-Upstream Flanking Sequences—The naturally occurring Sox18 mutations in mice and humans (15James K. Hosking B. Gardner J. Muscat G.E. Koopman P. Genesis. 2003; 36: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Irrthum A. Devriendt K. Chitayat D. Matthijs G. Glade C. Steijlen P.M. Fryns J.P.

However, the most life threatening is the generalized edema caused by lymphatic vascular dysfunction (17Slee J. J. Genet. 1957; 55: 100-121Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Herbertson B.M. Wallace M.E. J. Med. Genet. 1964; 1: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 19Wallace M.E. Heredity. 1979; 43: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hence, we were particularly interested in the identification of Sox18 target genes that play a role in lymphatic function and thus may allow us to better understand the molecular basis of the ragged phenotype. We hypothesized that VCAM-1 was regulated by SOX18. Therefore, to test this supposition we examined the ability of VCAM-1 promoter sequences to direct the expression of the LUC gene in muscle, endothelial, and fibroblast cells. For this purpose, we designed primers to amplify the complete published murine VCAM-1 sequence (46Korenaga R. Ando J. Kosaki K. Isshiki M. Takada Y. Kamiya A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1506-C1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned the sequenced amplified product into the promoterless pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector. This plasmid was denoted as PGL2-VC1889 and encompasses 1889 bp immediately upstream of the murine VCAM-1 translation start codon (Fig. 1). To test if Sox18 could trans-activate the VCAM-1 promoter, we transfected it into fibroblasts and endothelial and skeletal muscle cell lines (Fig. 2). Transfection of pGL2-VC1889 into COS-1 fibroblasts and SVEC4-10 high venule endothelial cell lines demonstrated that the upstream promoter sequences of the VCAM-1 gene confer high level expression in a cell-specific manner. For example, pGL2-VC1889 activity in COS-1 fibroblasts is ∼ 5-fold greater than that of pGL2-Basic and 100-fold less than that of the constitutively active SV40 promoter. In contrast, in endothelial SVEC cells pGL2-VC1889 activity is ∼50-fold greater than that of pGL2-Basic and is similar in activity to the very efficient SV40 promoter. This is consistent with our previous study that reported a high level of Sox18 expression in the nuclei of SVEC4-10 (48Hosking B.M. Wang S.C. Chen S.L. Penning S. Koopman P. Muscat G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, when the VCAM promoter was transfected into proliferating C2C12 myoblasts, the VCAM-1 promoter activity was ∼50-fold greater than that of pGL2-Basic (data not shown), as has been reported previously (44Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3943-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the efficient cell specific expression of VCAM-1 is consistent with the in vivo expression profile of VCAM-1.Fig. 2VCAM-1 promoter regulates transcription in a cell/tissue-specific manner. The activity of the full-length VCAM-1 promoter in COS-1 fibroblast (left) and SVEC4-10 endothelial (right) cells is depicted. pGL2 control (pGL2C), driven by the promiscuous SV40 enhancer and early promoter, was used as a control for transfection efficiency and as a comparison for the level of cell-specific activity of the VCAM-1 promoter. pGL2-Basic (pGL2) is the empty luciferase vector, whereas VC1889 refers to 1889 bp of the murine VCAM-1 promoter cloned into pGL2B. 2 μg of each plasmid was transfected in all cell lines using a liposome-mediated procedure.

Dis. 2002; 61: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and transcription factors (e.g. IRF-2 and Oct-1) (42Jesse T.L. LaChance R. Iademarco M.F. Dean D.C. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether SOX18, could trans-activate the mouse VCAM-1 promoter in COS-1 fibroblasts. Co-transfection of a Sox18 expression construct with the pGL2-VC1889 promoter resulted in a moderate 5-fold activation (Fig. 3A). This activation is dose-dependent, as increasing amounts of Sox18 augmented the trans-activity of the VCAM-1 promoter (Fig. 3B). Thus, we demonstrate here for the first time that Sox18 trans-activates the promoter of VCAM-1. SOX and SRY proteins contain HMG domains that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. These proteins have been reported to bind in vitro and in vivo to sites with a core motif resembling (A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G (for review, see Ref. 11Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that SOX18 can bind and trans-activate a core consensus motif of AACAAAG (12Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Koopman P.A. Dowhan D.H. Dunn T.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2626-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As an initial step in the investigation to examine whether SOX18 was able to bind the murine VCAM-1 promoter, we searched the sequence of the promoter using MatInspector (50Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) and found three potential Sox binding sites (Fig. 1). Of these, the two at –491 (SoxC) and –1569 (SoxA) contain a perfect core consensus site (AACAAT) for the binding of Sox/Sry transcription factors. The core sequence of the site at –715 (SoxB) is slightly different from the consensus, withaGat position 1 (GACAAT). Interestingly, it has been reported that SOX17 can bind this sequence from a pool of otherwise random oligonucleotides (51Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T. Hayashi Y. Yazaki K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To investigate whether GST-SOX18 can interact with the putative SoxA, SoxB, and SoxC binding sites, we performed an EMSA using 32P-labeled oligos that consist of the Sox binding site in addition to some surrounding sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). As seen in Fig. 4A, the SOX18 protein bound strongly to all three putative Sox sites. In contrast, GST protein alone could not bind to any of the three oligonucleotides used in this study. Thus, SOX18 can potentially interact with all three sites in the VCAM-1 promoter. To examine the sequence-specificity of the protein-DNA interaction, we attempted to compete the binding with cold/unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the"

https://openalex.org/W2150659226,"The prion protein (PrP) is the major agent implicated in the diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The onset of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy is related to a change in conformation of the PrPC, which loses most of its α-helical content, becoming a β-sheet-rich protein, known as PrPSc. Here we have used two Syrian hamster prion domains (PrP 109–141 and PrP 109–149) and the murine recombinant PrP (rPrP 23–231) to investigate the effects of anilino-naphtalene compounds on prion oligomerization and aggregation.

Bis-ANS was the most effective inhibitor of prion peptide aggregation. Bis-ANS binds strongly to rPrP 23–231 leading to a substantial increase in β-sheet content and to limited oligomerization. More strikingly, the binding of bis-ANS to full-length rPrP is diminished by the addition of nanomolar concentrations of oligonucleotides, demonstrating that they compete for the same binding site. Thus, bis-ANS displays properties similar to those of nucleic acids, causing oligomerization and conversion to β-sheet (Cordeiro, Y., Machado, F., Juliano, L., Juliano, M. A., Brentani, R.

The onset of a particular transmissible spongiform encephalopathy is caused by the conversion of the cellular PrP (PrPC), which is found predominantly on the outer surface of neurons attached to the membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor, into an abnormal isoform, designated PrPSc (from Scrapie) (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Prion diseases may present sporadic, inherited, or transmissible origins. However, in most cases the PrPSc has the same primary sequence as the PrPC, indicating that the conversion from one form to the other is not caused by a covalent modification (1Prusiner S.B. Proc.

Aniline-naphtalene sulfonate derivatives, such as bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-sulfonate) and ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate) were utilized in this work to test their effects on the oligomerization properties of prion proteins. Bis-ANS binds strongly to tubulin and inhibits its assembly into microtubules in vitro (21Horowitz P. Prasad V. Luduena R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14647-14650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prevelige and co-workers (22Teschke C.M. King J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) also showed that bis-ANS inhibits bacteriophage P22 capsid assembly. More recently, Bonafe et al. (23Bonafe C.F. Glaser M. Voss E.W. Weber G. Silva J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that bis-ANS causes inactivation of vesicular stomatitis virus, probably by perturbing protein-protein interactions. Bis-ANS has been extensively used to probe conformational changes in proteins, because it binds to hydrophobic regions surrounded by positively charged residues (24Silva J.L. Silveira C.F. Correia-Junior A. Pontes L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 328: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The structures of ANS, bis-ANS, and AmNS are shown in Fig. 1. To investigate the effect of different hydrophobic compounds on prion peptide aggregation we have performed aggregation kinetic measurements in the presence of these naphtalene sulfonate compounds. Our results show that bis-ANS inhibits prion peptide aggregation to a greater extent than AmNS and ANS, although both aniline-naphtalene derived compounds (bis-ANS and ANS) bind to the prion domains studied in this work. No aggregation inhibition mediated by ANS was observed at the drug concentrations tested, and although we could not detect binding of AmNS to both the peptides and the recombinant murine PrP, this compound inhibited prion peptide aggregation at higher concentrations. Interestingly, when we tested the effect of bis-ANS binding on the recombinant murine prion protein, this compound triggered protein oligomerization, but inhibited aggregation. These results suggest a dual role for bis-ANS in the aggregation process, highly dependent on protein domain and conformational state. We have recently demonstrated that both the prion peptides and the recombinant cellular PrP interact tightly with several plasmids and double-stranded oligonucleotides (8Cordeiro Y. Machado F. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Brentani R.R. Foguel D. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49400-49409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and we show here that bis-ANS competes with DNA for binding to the peptides and to the cellular prion protein. Similar to nucleic acid, bis-ANS leads to an increase in the content of β-sheet, usually observed when oligomerization occurs. The ability of a hydrophobic molecule to inhibit fibrillization of the whole protein makes it an excellent compound to explore the highly fluctuating structure of PrP. Reagents—All reagents used were of analytical grade. The compounds bis-ANS, ANS, and AmNS were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The compound AmNS was purchased from Riedel-de Haën (Seelze, Germany). The 34-mer double-stranded DNA sequence used (polyGC) was synthesized and purified by Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). Peptide Synthesis and rPrP (23–231) Expression and Purification—The prion peptides were kindly provided by Profs. M. A. Juliano and L. Juliano from Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, synthesized in solid phase. Purity of the peptides was assessed by mass spectrometry and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The peptides were maintained in a 6 m urea, 10 mm SDS stock solution that was diluted at least 100 times in the aggregation kinetic assays. The recombinant PrP (23–231) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by high-affinity column refolding as described previously (27Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). rPrP 23–231 histidine tag was cleaved by α-human thrombin (kindly provided by Prof. Robson Q. Monteiro, Departamento de Bioquímica Médica, Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro), and rPrP was further purified as previously described (27Zahn R. von Schroetter C.

Spectroscopic Measurements—Light scattering and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL), in “L” geometry (at 90° in relation to excitation light). Aggregation was followed as a function of light scattering (excitation 320 nm, emission 320 nm). For the aggregation kinetic assays, the peptides previously unfolded in a 5 or 6 m urea solution at pH 4.0 or 5.0 were diluted in buffer and light scattering was monitored as a function of time. Maximum light scattering obtained from each kinetic trace was measured and normalized considering control as 100% aggregation. The tryptophan fluorescence of rPrP (23–231) and of the peptide PrP (109–149) was measured by exciting at 280 nm and the emission verified from 300 to 420 nm. bis-ANS, ANS, and AmNS were excited at 360 nm, and fluorescence emission was collected from 400 to 600 nm for bis-ANS and from 400 to 650 nm for ANS and AmNS. Far-UV Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra of rPrP (23–231) were recorded in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with 2.0 mm path-length cells at 25 °C. All spectra were subtracted from the respective buffer spectra and were collected with 4 accumulations. We used as models two peptides corresponding to Syrian hamster PrP (SHaPrP) residues 109–141 (PrP 109–141) and 109–149 (PrP 109–149) and the recombinant cellular murine PrP (rPrP 23–231). The peptides studied correspond to a loop and to the first α-helix of the N-terminal region of PrP, which is implicated in the conversion into β-sheets, and it is one of the most conserved regions in the PrP (28Schatzl H.M. Da Costa M. Taylor L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The conversion into β-sheets is followed by aggregation into amyloid fibers (29Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T.L. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The peptide PrP (109–141) is of particular interest because structural data are available and its aggregation properties are well documented (29Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T.L. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The slightly longer peptide, PrP (109–149), was chosen because it contains a tryptophan residue at position 145 and it would be helpful for the fluorescence measurements. In mixed water/organic solvents and detergents, the peptide PrP (109–141) assumes a stable α-helical structure (29Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T.L. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and the random-coil structure is stable in the presence of high urea concentrations. The aggregation of prion peptides was monitored by different spectroscopic measurements. The peptides were unfolded in buffer at pH 4.0–5.0 containing 6 m urea and were further diluted in the same buffer without the denaturant. Aggregation was monitored by the increase in light scattering at 320 nm as a function of time. On dilution in aqueous buffer, aggregation occurred within a few seconds (Fig. 2, A and B) and was markedly dependent on peptide concentration (Fig. 2C). We have performed circular dichroism measurements for both peptides in buffer containing SDS, confirming the data from the literature (29Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T.L. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Both peptides displayed α-helical secondary structure in sodium acetate buffer pH 4.0 in the presence of 100 mm SDS (data not shown). PrP (109–141) peptide aggregated preferentially at pH 4.0, and PrP (109–149) similarly aggregated at pH 4.0 and pH 5.0. PrP (109–141) required higher concentrations than PrP (109–149) to achieve the same extent of aggregation (Fig. 2, A and B). PrP 109–141 at 10 μm aggregated less than PrP 109–149 at ten times lower concentration (1.0 μm) (Fig. 2, A and B). The emission fluorescence spectra of PrP (109–149) were collected and we observed that the tryptophan fluorescence was quenched upon aggregation (data not shown). We tested whether the compounds bis-ANS and ANS could inhibit the prion peptide aggregation. Bis-ANS and ANS are aniline-naphtalene derived compounds (Fig. 1) that are well described for their ability to bind to hydrophobic regions on proteins, resulting in an increase in its fluorescence quantum yield upon binding to these pockets (24Silva J.L. Silveira C.F. Correia-Junior A. Pontes L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Ferrão-Gonzales A.D. Souto S.O. Silva J.L. Foguel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The partially unfolded peptides were diluted in buffer containing varying concentrations of bis-ANS, and the aggregation was monitored by changes in light scattering. It was observed that bis-ANS inhibited prion peptide aggregation to a great extent at concentrations below 5 μm (Fig. 3) for both prion domains (data not shown for PrP 109–141). The aggregation inhibition was dependent on compound concentration (Fig. 3), but aggregation was not completely abolished even using higher concentrations of bis-ANS. We consider the possibility that a small fraction of the peptides in solution was aggregated prior to incubation with bis-ANS. The binding of the peptides to bis-ANS was also verified by the increase in fluorescence emission of the probe (Fig. 4, A and B; data not shown for PrP 109–141). The binding of the two peptides to the bis-ANS was very similar, indicating a 1 to 1 binding stoichiometry. If the bis-ANS is added to previously aggregated PrP (109–149), it is not able to bind to the same extent as observed upon adding the unfolded peptide to a bis-ANS solution. This result suggests that, after aggregation takes place, there are not enough exposed hydrophobic sites for probe binding, and this compound cannot reverse the aggregation reaction. We monitored the fluorescence emission spectra of a 2.0 μm solution of PrP (109–149) upon addition of bis-ANS (Fig. 5). This compound quenched the peptide tryptophan fluorescence, indicating proximity of bis-ANS binding site to the peptide tryptophan moiety.Fig. 4Titration of PrP (109–149) binding to bis-ANS (2.0 μm).

In contrast with the results obtained with bis-ANS, neither of these compounds could inhibit significantly PrP 109–149 aggregation at the concentrations tested. Only AmNS showed a minimal inhibition effect at concentrations greater than 50 μm (Fig. 6C). To further investigate the interaction of prion with bis-ANS, we studied the interaction of the recombinant murine prion protein (rPrP 23–231) with bis-ANS and verified the contribution of this hydrophobic compound to the aggregation profile of the whole prion protein as well. We have performed titration curves to calculate the average prion protein affinity to bis-ANS. As our data show (Fig. 7A), rPrP appears to bind to bis-ANS over the same concentration range observed for the peptide (Fig. 3), suggesting that the binding regions in the whole protein are located in the domain comprising aminoacids 109–149. rPrP fluorescence intensity was also quenched in the presence of increased concentrations of bis-ANS, in agreement with the data obtained with prion peptide (Fig. 7B). In contrast to the results obtained with the prion peptides, addition of bis-ANS to the full-length rPrP induced an increase in light scattering corresponding to the assembly into a small oligomer (Fig. 7A). There was only a limited increase in light scattering for rPrP in the presence of bis-ANS (∼3 times) in comparison with prion peptide aggregation (∼20 times) (Fig. 2A). In addition, the prion protein exhibited a high β-sheet content when bound to bis-ANS as verified by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig. 7C). We have previously demonstrated that both the prion peptides and the recombinant cellular PrP interact strongly with several double-stranded oligonucleotides (8Cordeiro Y. Machado F. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Brentani R.R. Foguel D. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49400-49409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here we tested if nucleic acid and bis-ANS would compete for binding to prion peptide and to rPrP. Fig. 8 shows that addition of a double-stranded oligonucleotide to bis-ANS bound rPrP, displaces the hydrophobic compound, as seen from the decrease in bis-ANS fluorescence emission upon nucleic acid addition. The same result was obtained for PrP 109–149 (data not shown). This dual effect of bis-ANS on prion protein makes this compound highly important to sequester crucial conformations of the protein, which may be useful to the understanding of the disease and to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Here we describe that a hydrophobic compound (bis-ANS) can either inhibit aggregation of small prion domains or cause limited oligomerization of the full-length protein. These effects are very similar to those caused by nucleic acids, which we proposed could act as catalysts in the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (8Cordeiro Y. Machado F. Juliano L.

The capacity of this very simple molecule, bis-ANS, to populate oligomeric conformations of the prion protein provides an useful new tool to study the prion conversion reaction. Since the discovery of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agent there has been a great deal of effort expended to preventing or treating this disease, mainly by searching for compounds that could preclude the PrPC → PrPSc conversion. Unfortunately, no such molecule has proven to be efficient in combating this disease (18Korth C. May B.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

But quinacrine did not prolong survival in a murine Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease model (33Collins S.J. Lewis V. Brazier M. Hill A.F. Fletcher A. Masters C.L. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and high doses of quinacrine generated liver damage without clearance of the disease in humans suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (34Follette P. Science. 2003; 299: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Many current approaches in drug screening for prion diseases have focused on the identification of existing compounds that could be directly employed as a “second-use” approach, bypassing many clinical stages in drug approval. Screening for activity is mainly conducted by evaluating antagonization of prion propagation in cell and animal models of the disease, as it represents a more “realistic” approach than an in vitro cell-free system. However, questions concerning the suitability of therapy with compound screening to date is questionable, mainly due to limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (35Forloni G. Iussich S. Awan T. Colombo L. Angeretti N. Girola L. Bertani I. Poli G. Caramelli M. Grazia-Bruzzone M. Farina L. Limido L. Rossi G. Giaccone G. Ironside J.W. Bugiani O. Salmona M. Tagliavini F. Proc. Natl.

Virol. 2003; 77: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) has shown that in a high-throughput screening assay for PrPSc inhibitors, of several compounds tested, some displayed high inhibition efficiency. A few of these new PrPSc inhibitors cross the blood-brain barrier. Given their ability to inhibit prion peptide aggregation, the anilino-naphtalene compounds described here might serve as lead compounds with anti-prion activity. Despite the fact that bis-ANS promoted the β-sheet conversion of rPrP, its binding limited the aggregation to a large extent. Previous data from the literature have described that bis-ANS binds strongly to tubulin and potently inhibits its assembly into microtubules in vitro (21Horowitz P. Prasad V. Luduena R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14647-14650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that it could also inhibit bacteriophage P22 capsid assembly (22Teschke C.M. King J. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10658-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Early results from our research group also characterize naphthalene sulfonates, including bis-ANS, as inhibitors of β-amyloid peptide aggregation. 2A. D. Ferrão-Gonzales, personal communication. ANS has been used as an indicator of protein aggregation as it is known to bind to hydrophobic surfaces in proteins and bis-ANS has been extensively used to probe conformational changes in proteins, as it binds to hydrophobic regions surrounded by positively charged residues (24Silva J.L. Silveira C.F. Correia-Junior A. Pontes L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Gibbons D.L. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49400-49409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) has shown that the same prion domains studied here bind with high affinity to several double-stranded DNA sequences and that peptide aggregation was prevented upon binding to DNA. We showed here that bis-ANS competes with DNA for binding to the peptides and to the cellular recombinant prion protein. Moreover, potential compounds that would primarily act through disruption of hydrophobic interactions seem to be the most prominent, because it seems to be the force that commonly directs protein aggregates such as PrPSc, due to stabilization of intermolecular β-sheet structures (36Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20276-20284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Srisailam S. Kumar T.K.S Yu C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS prevents prion peptide aggregation is not completely understood. However, our data indicate that binding of bis-ANS to the prion hydrophobic domains causes, among other effects, a steric impediment of contact between the peptides. Thus, when the peptide is bound to bis-ANS it cannot interact with another peptide molecule. The stoichiometry of the bis-ANS:PrP (109–149) binding was close to 1.0. Concerning the full-length PrP protein, the binding of bis-ANS seems to lead to larger conformational changes and oligomerization. Indeed, in future work we will attempt to characterize the structural properties of the bis-ANS bound oligomers by nuclear magnetic resonance. Bis-ANS has exerted similar effects on other proteins, such as on the isolated GroEL apical domain fragment, where it induces the formation of a folding intermediate with increased hydrophobic surface not observed in tetradecameric GroEL (38Smoot A.L.

The other naphtalene-derived probes used (ANS and AmNS) were not as efficient in inhibiting aggregation as bis-ANS. Only AmNS showed minimum aggregation inhibition efficiency at concentrations above 50 μm. Considering that these molecules are similar in substituting groups and its positions, it seems that a crucial aspect of binding to prion protein and inhibition of aggregation is the extension of aromatic rings. Thus, AmNS and ANS would be not so effective in inhibition of protein aggregation because the contact of just one naphtalene ring to the peptide surface is not enough to prevent contact between other peptides. A more extended list of anilino-naphtalene sulfonate analogs with different derived pharmacophoric substituants is currently being tested for inhibition and disruption of prion aggregation.

However, its mechanism of action in bone cells is largely unknown. This study examined the effect of PTH on mouse osteocalcin gene expression in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells and primary cultures of bone marrow stromal cells. PTH increased the levels of osteocalcin mRNA 4–5-fold in both cell types. PTH also stimulated transcriptional activity of a 1.3-kb fragment of the mouse osteocalcin gene 2 (mOG2) promoter. Inhibitor studies revealed a requirement for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in the PTH response. Deletion of the mOG2 promoter sequence from –1316 to –116 caused no loss in PTH responsiveness whereas deletion from –116 to –34 completely prevented PTH stimulation. Interestingly, this promoter region does not contain the RUNX2 binding site shown to be necessary for PTH responsiveness in other systems. Nuclear extracts from PTH-treated MC3T3-E1 cells exhibited increased binding to OSE1, a previously described osteoblast-specific enhancer in the mOG2 promoter. Furthermore, mutation of OSE1 in DNA transfection assays established the requirement for this element in the PTH response. Collectively, these studies establish that actions of PTH on the osteocalcin gene are mediated by multiple signaling pathways and require OSE1 and associated nuclear proteins.

All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Cultures—Two previously described MC3T3-E1 subclonal cell lines with high osteoblast differentiation potential were used in this study (32Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Both subclones (MC-4 and MC-42 cells) express osteoblast phenotypic marker genes and mineralize only after growth in a medium containing ascorbic acid. MC3T3-E1 subclone 42 (MC-42) cells have the same phenotype as MC-4 cells and also contain stably integrated copies of a 1.3-kb mOG2 promoter driving a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase expression closely follows levels of endogenous OCN mRNA (32Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were maintained in ascorbic acid free α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were not used beyond passage 15. Mouse Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Cultures (BMSCs)—Isolation of mouse BMSCs was described previously (41Krebsbach P.H. Kuznetsov S.A. Satomura K. Emmons R.V. Rowe D.W. Robey P.G. Transplantation. 1997; 63: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tibiae and femurs were isolated, and the epiphyses were cut. Marrow was flushed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10–8m dexamethasone into a 60-mm dish, and the cell suspension was aspirated up and down with a 20-gauge needle to break up clumps of marrow. The cell suspension (marrow from two mice/flask) was then cultured in a T75 flask in the same medium. After 10 days, cells reached confluency and were ready for experiments. DNA Constructs—All luciferase reporter plasmids (except wild-type and mutant 4OSE1mOG-luc, which were constructed in –34mOG2pGL3B-luc vector) were constructed by cloning mOG2 promoter inserts and multimeric oligonucleotides into the p4-luc promoterless luciferase expression vector as previously described (33Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). p657OSE2mut-luc, which contains a 2-bp substitution mutation in OSE2 at positions –134 and –133 (CCAAGAACA), was described previously (33Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). p116OSE1mut3-luc and p657OSE1mut3-luc, which both contain a 3-bp substitution mutation in OSE1 at positions –52, –51, and –50 (TTAGTACA), were generated from p116-luc and p657-luc by PCR amplification using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two primers used for making these mutant constructs were GCATCCCCTGCTCCTCCTGCTTAGTACAGAGAGCACAGAGTAGCCG (forward) and CGGCTACTCTGTGCTCTCTGTACTAAGCAGGAGGAGCAGGGGATGC (reverse). –34mOG2pGL3B-luc was constructed by cloning the –34 to +13 mOG2 minimal promoter region into the BglII/HindIII site in pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Multimers (four copies) of wild-type or mutated (containing OSE1mut3) oligonucleotide 4 were cloned into the Bg1II site of the –34mOG2pGL3B-luc vector. All sequences were verified by automatic DNA sequencing. Transfections—Cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection contained 0.5 μg of the indicated plasmid plus 0.05 μg of pRL-SV40 containing a cDNA for Renilla reniformis luciferase to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested and assayed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Gel Mobility Shift Assays— Nuclear extracts were prepared, and gel mobility shift assays were conducted as described previously (32Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 1 μg of nuclear extracts. The OSE2 wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift assays in this study were described previously (32Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Additional oligonucleotides used in this study are described under “Results.” RNA Analysis—RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots were fractionated on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper as described by Thomas (42Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Mouse OCN cDNA probe used for hybridization was obtained from Dr. John Wozney (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) (43Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Bueker J.L. Kriz R. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts were excised from plasmid DNA with the appropriate restriction enzymes and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis before labeling with α-[32P]dCTP using a random primer kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were performed as previously described using a Bellco Autoblot hybridization oven (44Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and quantitatively scanned using a Packard A2024 InstantImager. All values were normalized for RNA loading by probing blots with cDNA to 18 S rRNA (45Renkawitz R. Gerbi S.A. Glatzer K.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 173: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated two to five times, and qualitatively identical results were obtained. Statistical analyses were performed using Instat 3.0 software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA). Unless indicated otherwise, each value reported is the mean and standard deviation of triplicate independent samples. PTH Stimulates Osteocalcin Gene Expression and Promoter Activity—The effect of PTH on mouse OCN gene expression was evaluated in MC-4 cells and primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells. Confluent cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PTH for 6 h. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, PTH stimulated OCN mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with a significant stimulatory effect first detected at 10–10m. PTH also stimulated OCN message levels in primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells (Fig. 1B). Time course experiments showed that the levels of OCN mRNA began to rise within 1 h of PTH administration and remained elevated for at least 6 h (Fig. 1C). PTH stimulation was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is not required for the PTH response (Fig. 1D). To establish whether the mOG2 promoter can be activated by PTH, MC-42 cells, which contain stably integrated copies of a 1.3-kb mOG2 promoter driving a firefly luciferase reporter gene, were treated with various concentrations of PTH (from 10–13 to 10–7m) for 6 h. Cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, PTH stimulated promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner with a detectable response seen at a PTH concentration of 10–9m (significance at p < 0.001). Measurable activation of the mOG2 promoter was observed 1 h after PTH addition with maximal induction occurring between 3 and 6 h and lasting for more than 6 h (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2PTH activates OCN promoter activity in stably transfected MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells.A, dose dependence. MC-42 cells containing stably integrated copies of a 1.3-kb mOG2-luc construct were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes and cultured overnight in 10% FBS medium. Cells were then switched to 0.1% FBS medium in the absence or presence of the indicated concentration of PTH (from 10–12 to 10–7m) for 6 h. Cells were then harvested for luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was normalized to total protein. B, time course. MC-42 cells were treated as in A for the indicated times in the absence (○) or presence (•) of 10–7m PTH. Data represent mean ± S.D. Experiments were repeated three times, and qualitatively identical results were obtained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Multiple Signaling Pathways Mediate PTH Stimulation— PTH signals mainly through the PKA pathway, although involvement of PKC and MAPK pathways has also been described. To identify signaling pathways mediating PTH induction of the mOG2 gene, we examined the effects of various inhibitors or activators. As shown in Fig. 3A, H89, a selective inhibitor of the PKA pathway, completely abolished the PTH-stimulated OCN gene expression. Forskolin, a well known activator of PKA, increased OCN expression. In combination with PTH, the effect of forskolin was not additive, indicating that the PKA pathway is maximally stimulated. GF109203X, a specific inhibitor of the PKC pathway, also dramatically decreased PTH stimulation. Interestingly, U0126 (a specific inhibitor of MAPK) but not its inactive analog, U0124, also partially suppressed PTH stimulation. Similar results were obtained when PTH-induced mOG2 promoter activity was examined in MC-42 cells (all three inhibitors significantly blocked PTH induction, p < 0.001; Fig. 3B). The concentrations of the inhibitors or activators used in this study are in the ranges reported by us and others to selectively affect the relevant pathways (18Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R.

Compounds did not reduce cell DNA or protein under the current conditions (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that PTH stimulation of OCN gene expression requires PKA and PKC as well as MAPK signaling pathways. Minimal PTH-response Region Is within 116 bp of the Transcriptional Start Site—Several deletion mutants of the mOG2 promoter driving firefly luciferase gene expression have been described and shown to be active in osteoblast cell lines (32Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To determine in which region PTH is necessary to activate transcription, these constructs were transiently transfected into MC-4 cells in the presence or absence of PTH. Results showed that luciferase activity of both control and PTH-treated groups decreased with progressively larger 5′ deletions. However, a major drop in PTH stimulation was observed when the promoter was deleted from the –116 to –34-bp region (Fig. 4, inset). Thus, it is clear from these results that a major PTH-responsive element is located in the –116 to –34 mOG2 promoter region. PTH Treatment Increases Binding of Nuclear Proteins to OSE1—As an initial step to identify the DNA sequence responsible for the PTH response, an 82-bp DNA oligonucleotide from –116 to –34 of the mOG2 promoter was synthesized and used as a probe for gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from MC-4 cells with or without PTH treatment. Results revealed that PTH treatment increased nuclear protein binding to this region (data not shown). To further identify the DNA sequence responsible for PTH responsiveness, four smaller overlapping DNA oligonucleotides (designated oligonucleotide 1, 2, 3, and 4, located at –116 to –89, –98 to –69, –80 to –50, and –61 to –34, respectively) covering the entire 82-bp region from –116 to –34 of the mOG2 promoter were synthesized (Fig. 5A). These oligonucleotides were then used as probes for gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from MC-4 cells with or without PTH treatment. As shown in Fig. 5B, PTH had virtually no effect on the binding of nuclear proteins to oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (containing an E-box motif, CACATG, and a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein motif, CCAATT, respectively). In contrast, PTH treatment dramatically increased binding to oligonucleotides 3 and 4 (Fig. 5B, bands 1 and 2). The lower shifted band (band 3) bound to and was not competed by the four oligonucleotides and thus was clearly nonspecific. Because the region shared by oligonucleotides 3 and 4 contains the OSE1 core sequence, TTACATCA, we predicted that a PTH-induced nuclear factor binds to this region. To confirm this, a set of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing 3-bp mutations that span the entire OSE1 region was synthesized and evaluated in competitive gel mobility shift assays using wild-type oligonucleotide 4 as the probe and nuclear extracts from PTH-treated MC-4 cells (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, PTH-stimulated band 2 was completely abolished by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides 1, 5, and 6 but not by unlabeled mutant oligonucleotides 2, 3, and 4. These latter three oligonucleotides have 3-bp substitution mutations that exactly cover the OSE1 core sequence (TTACATCA). The band 2 increased by PTH treatment was further demonstrated to be the result of sequence-specific interactions in that it was disrupted by a 25–100-fold molar excess of OSE1 oligonucleotide but was not affected by the mutant oligonucleotide 3 (from CAT to GTA, mutant 3) (Fig. 6C). Band 1 was also competed by both unlabeled wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides 1, 5, and 6. However, mutant oligonucleotides 2, 3, and 4 could still partially compete its binding to the DNA oligo. It remains to be determined whether the band 1 and 2 protein-DNA complexes share common nuclear factors. These results clearly show that PTH treatment of cells increases the binding of a nuclear factor to OSE1. Because PTH regulates a number of transcription factors such as CREB, AP-1 family members, and RUNX2, we used supershift analysis to determine whether any of those factors might b"

In the intestinal tissue, the α1 chain is expressed and secreted in the subepithelial BM during the developmental period; in the adult rodent tissue, it is restricted to the BM of the dividing cells. To understand how laminin α1 chain expression is regulated, we cloned and characterized a 2-kb promoter region of the Lama1 mouse gene. Analysis of the promoter was conducted in the Caco2-TC7 intestinal epithelial cells by transient transfection of serially deleted and site-directed mutated promoter constructs, by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and expression of selected transcription factors. We determined that a proximal region, which includes an Sp1-binding GC box and a Krüppel-like element, was important for the promoter activity. This region is conserved between the human and mouse genes. Interestingly, two Krüppel-like factors KLF4 and KLF5 exhibit opposing effects on the Lama1 promoter activity that are decreased and increased, respectively, in the intestinal epithelial cells. These data corroborate the complementary expression of KLF4 and KLF5 along the intestinal crypt-villus axis and the parallel expression of KLF5 and laminin α1 chain in the crypt region. Finally, we showed that glucocorticoids stimulate the promoter activity. This study is the first characterization of the Lama1 promoter; we identified regulatory elements that may account for the expression pattern of the endogenous protein in the mouse intestine.

Laminins are heterotrimeric molecules formed by the association of α, β, and γ chains through disulfide bonds. Up to now, five different α chains (α1 to α5), three β chains (β1 to β3), and three γ chains (γ1 to γ3) have been identified; they are encoded by different genes. To date 15 laminin isoforms have been described (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 2Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. Ott M.C.

Laminin-1 (LN-1), the originally discovered laminin, consists of α1, β1, and γ1 chains (4Timpl R. Rohde H. Robey P.G. Rennard S.I. Foidart J.M. Martin G.R. J. Biol.

The role of laminins has been approached in various cellular models and elucidated because of genetic defects in humans and gene inactivation in mice (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev.

These experiments point to the major contribution of these molecules in the embryonic development, morphogenesis, and physiological processes (like cell proliferation, differentiation, cell shape, and movement) directly linked to tissue homeostasis and wound healing but also in tumor development and metastasis formation. Therefore, BM molecules must be precisely controlled to be expressed at the right time, in the relevant location, and in the appropriate amount. Significant progress has been achieved during the last years in the elucidation of the transcriptional regulation of laminin promoters and in the nature of the transcription factors involved in this regulation (see Refs. 9Aberdam D.

In parallel to the formation of a single epithelial cell layer, morphogenesis proceeds with the segregation of the epithelial cells into two distinct compartments comprising the proliferative cells (crypts) and the differentiating and differentiated cells (villi), respectively, underlined by a subepithelial BM. We and others have elucidated the composition of the intestinal BM during development as well as in the adult organ. At least five different LN isoforms have been found to be expressed with specific patterns as a function of the developmental stage and of the crypt-to-villus localization in rodents and humans (for reviews see Refs. 3Simon-Assmann P. Bolcato-Bellemin A.L. Turck N. Piccinni S. Olsen J. Launay J.F. Lefebvre O. Kedinger M. Galle P.R. Gerken G. Schmidt W.E. Wiedenmann B.

We have been particularly interested in further analyzing the regulation and role of laminin-1 (LN-1) and, in particular, of the α1 chain encoded by the LAMA1 gene for the following reasons. LN-1 is expressed early during intestinal development, specifically at the interface between endoderm and mesenchyme, and during the morphogenetic period in the subepithelial BM. In contrast, in the mature organ, the α1 chain is restricted to the crypt BM in rodents (20Simo P. Simon-Assmann P. Bouziges F. Leberquier C. Kedinger M. Ekblom P. Sorokin L. Development. 1991; 112: 477-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sasaki T. Giltay R. Talts U. Timpl R. Talts J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The use of interspecies intestinal endoderm/mesenchyme recombinants developed for various times as intracoelomic grafts allowed us to conclude that at the early stages of BM formation, the α1 chain found deposited in the BM is produced exclusively by the endodermal cells, whereas at later stages it is produced by both epithelial and mesenchymal tissue components (22Simo P. Bouziges F. Lissitzky J.C. Sorokin L. Kedinger M. Simon-Assmann P. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 1835-1845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Concerning the role of LN-1, earlier experimental work allowed us to point to the importance of this molecule in the differentiation of fetal intestinal endodermal and human colonic cancer cells. Indeed, in co-cultures of endodermal microexplants on mesenchymal cells, the deposition of LN-1 precedes the functional differentiation of the epithelial cells, which was blocked by the addition of anti-laminin antibodies. Furthermore, the deposition of the α1 chain was accelerated by the addition in the culture medium of glucocorticoids (GCs), known to accelerate the intestinal maturation (23Simo P. Simon-Assmann P.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 571-610Google Scholar). Further experiments, including mainly cultures of intestinal cells on LN-1 coatings, suggested the role of this matrix molecule in the morphological and functional cell differentiation (25Basson M.D. Modlin I.M.

The complex spatiotemporal expression pattern as well as the different roles of LN-1 observed in various experimental conditions suggest the existence of various regulatory pathways controlling its expression.In the present study, we characterize for the first time the 5′-flanking region of the Lama1 gene encoding laminin α1 chain. Through transient transfections in intestinal epithelial cells, we show that a proximal Sp1 site is crucial for the basal promoter activity. We also present evidence that the transcription of LAMA1 is regulated by transcription factors belonging to the intestinal Krüppel family: KLF4 (GKLF) and KLF5 (IKLF). In addition, glucocorticoids up-regulate the laminin α1 mRNA level and stimulate the promoter activity. This promoter analysis suggests a molecular basis for the tissue-specific expression pattern of the laminin α1 chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG Biotech (Germany).

In some experiments, dexamethasone (DX; 76.5 nm), a synthetic glucocorticoid, was added in the culture medium for 3, 4, 6, and 8 days. Mouse teratocarcinoma-derived parietal yolk sac carcinoma (PYS) cells that produce LN-1 (32Wewer U.M. Tichy D. Damjanov A. Paulsson M. Damjanov I. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. L. Sorokin (Lund, Sweden) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. The C20 intestinal fibroblast cell line (33Fritsch C. Orian-Rousseau V. Lefebvre O. Simon-Assmann P. Reimund J.M. Duclos B. Kedinger M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. The Drosophila S2 cell line, provided by the Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (Illkirch, France) cell culture service facilities, was cultured in Schneider medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. All cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C, except S2 cells which were maintained at 28 °C.Sequence Analysis—Sequence alignment was done using a Fasta program (34Chao K.M. Pearson W.R. Miller W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar), on www.infobiogen.fr/services/analyseq/cgi-bin/lfastan_in.pl. The search for putative transcription factor-binding elements was done by using MatInspector Professional program at www.genomatix.de or by using sequence data found in the literature.Plasmid Construction—Two λ clones were isolated and purified from a 129/sv genomic library using a PCR fragment probe corresponding to positions 56–180 bp of the murine laminin α1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number J04064). The inserts of these two clones were subcloned in the NotI site of pBluescript SK+ generating the plasmids pBSλ12 and pBSλ15 and were then sequenced. Each of them contains the potential promoter region, the first exon, and part of the first intron. A 2.4-kb BsrBI genomic fragment just upstream from the ATG initiator was subcloned in pPCRscript vector. From this construct, a 2-kb SpeI-BstXI fragment was subcloned in front of the luciferase gene at the NheI-SmaI sites of pGL3 basic, generating the plasmid pGL3-PLnα1. This 2-kb fragment was totally sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AJ519495). For the search of the initiation of the transcription, a genomic HincII-SacI fragment from pBSλ15 (containing the potential +1 transcription start site, the first exon, and a few nucleotides of the first intron) was subcloned into the SacI-HincII site of pBluescript SK+ vector generating pBSLnα1 5′HincII-SacI plasmid.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Generation of the Deletion Constructs—Mutagenesis was performed on a pGL3-PLnα1 construct using the Gene Editor kit. Primers for point mutations (see Table I) were designed in order to introduce a KpnI or an XhoI site in the core sequence of the putative transcription factor-binding sites. Serial promoter deletions were performed by cutting the different point mutation constructs with KpnI and followed by ligation. All constructs were verified by sequencing at the Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (Illkirch, France) sequencing service facility.Table IOligonucleotides used in this study for mutagenesis and shift experiments The mutated bases are underlined.MutagenesisSequencePLnα1s mut C/EBPβ and Δ-18365′-GGCAATTTAGGTATTGGGTACCAGAGTGAGG-3′PLnα1s mut GRE5′-GAGGAGTGGAAAACTCGAGCCTGTGAACTTTC-3′PLnα1s Δ-18055′-AAACTCTGTCCTGGTACCTTTCATAAAACA-3′PLnα1s mut AP1 and Δ-15965′-TCCAGCACCAGGGGTACCTGACCTGCAGGC-3′PLnα1s mut HNF3β5′-GGGCTGGCAAAGGTACCAAATGAAAACACAG-3′PLnα1 Δ-5125′-AACAAACAAAATGGTACCACAGCCACCCAA-3′PLnα1s mut KLF4 and Δ-985′-GGGCGCAGCGGGTACCCTTTGGGGGAG-3′PLnα1s mut Sp1 and Δ-635′-TGGGTAGGACAGGGGTACCGCGCGGCCAGG-3′Shift experimentsSequenceSp1 shift5′-GGGTAGGACAGGGGCGGGGCGCGGCCA-3′Mut Sp1 shift5′-GGGTAGGACAGGGGTACCGCGCGGCCA-3′KLF shift5′-TGGGCGCAGCGGGGCGCCTTTGGGGGA-3′Mut KLF shift5′-TGGGCGCAGCGGGTACCCTTTGGGGGA-3′SIF5′-GATCCGTGCAATAAAACTTTATGAGTAA-3′TDA5′-ATGCAGGAGAAAGAAGGGATGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—After cell homogenization with TriReagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.), the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g to discard genomic DNA contained in the pellet. RNA was then extracted according to the recommendations of the supplier. RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. After initial denaturation of 3 μg of total RNA with 50 pmol of oligo(dT) for 5 min at 75 °C, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 42 °C in 30 μl containing 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes, Finland), 0.4 mm each dNTP, in the 1× buffer supplied with the enzyme.PCRs were performed in 100 μl, containing 1 μl of cDNA solution, 50 pmol of primers, 0.5 unit of Dynazyme DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland), 0.25 mm each dNTP in 1× buffer (containing 1.5 mm MgCl2) supplied with the enzyme. Dynawax (Finnzymes) was used to separate the template cDNA and primers from the DNA polymerase before the first step of denaturation. PCR used an I-Cycler apparatus (Bio-Rad). Glucocorticoid receptor primers (recognizing mouse and human sequences) are as follows: RGC1, 5′-CAGCATGCCGCTATCGAAAATGT-C-3′; RGC2, 5′-TGTCAGTTGATAAAACCGCTGCCA-3′; annealing temperature 55 °C, between 35 and 40 cycles, product 737 bp (GenBank™ accession number M10901). Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase primers are as follows (recognizing mouse and human sequences): GAPDH1, 5′-GGCTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTGATCAATGG-3′; GAPDH2, 5′-GTCGCTGTTGAAGTCAGAGGAGACCACCTG-3′; annealing temperature 60 °C, between 25 and 30 cycles, product 685 bp (GenBank™ accession number M33197). General conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 25–40 cycles (depending of the pair of primers used) with denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature (55–60 °C) for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. A final elongation of 5 min was done at the end of cycling. Control PCR was performed directly on RNA without the step of cDNA synthesis; no amplified DNA fragment was detected in this case.PCR fragments were loaded on 3% (w/v) agarose ethidium bromide-stained gels and analyzed using Gel Doc 1000 apparatus (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR fragments were cloned in the pGEM-T easy plasmid and sequenced to confirm their identities.Northern Blot—10 μg of total RNA from Caco2-TC7 cells, treated or not with DX for 4, 6, and 8 days, or 3 μg of 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder (Invitrogen) were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels in the presence of 2 m formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science), and bound to the membrane with an UV cross-linker (Bioblock Scientific, France). The RNA integrity was checked by methylene blue staining of the membrane.Plasmids containing specific probe for mouse laminin α1 (26De Arcangelis A. Neuville P. Boukamel R. Lefebvre O. Kedinger M. Simon-Assmann P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and mouse GAPDH (described above) were employed. Antisense DIG RNA-labeled probes were synthesized using 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA with the DIG RNA labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Applied Science). Probe concentrations were estimated by serial dilutions of the labeling mix compared with an RNA labeling DIG standard (Roche Applied Science). Pre-hybridization was performed at 68 °C in 10 ml of DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche Applied Science) for at least 1 h. For hybridization, laminin α1 (50 ng/ml) or GAPDH (2 ng/ml) probe was denatured for 5 min at 100 °C, chilled on ice, and added to 10 ml of pre-warmed (68 °C) DIG Easy Hyb solution. Following overnight hybridization at 68 °C, the membranes were washed two times for 15 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C and two times 30 min in 0.1× SCC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Saturation of nonspecific binding sites was done for 1 h using blocking solution from Roche Applied Science. Anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) diluted to 1/20,000 was added for 30 min, and the blots were then washed twice with wash solution set from Roche Applied Science. Attophos (Roche Applied Science) was then added for 12 h, and the fluorescent signal was analyzed using a Molecular Imager FX apparatus (Bio-Rad) allowing quantifying signal over a 4 log range.RNase Protection Assay—One μg of pBS Lnα1 5′HincII-SacI plasmid linearized with XhoI was transcribed with 40 units of T3 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 30 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 1 nm UTP, 1 mm DTT, 25 units of RNaseout (Invitrogen) in 1× buffer supplied with the enzyme (Roche Applied Science) in a final volume of 30 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. Template DNA was removed by digestion with 5 units of RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and sodium acetate precipitation. Hybridization and RNase digestion were performed with the RPA III kit in accordance to the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion). In brief, 10 μg of total RNA (from a 15-day mouse placenta or PYS cells) was mixed with 80,000 cpm of Lnα1s 5′HincII-SacI antisense RNA probe in a final volume of 10 μl in the Ambion hybridization buffer. After initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 14 h. RNase A (0.25 unit/ml) and RNase T1 (10 units/ml) was then added in the RNase Digestion Buffer III for 30 min at 37 °C. After precipitation, the protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 7 m urea in a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel together with an unrelated sequence as a 1-bp molecular marker. Detection was done using a Molecular Imager FX apparatus (Bio-Rad).Transfection Experiments—For transfections, exponentially growing Caco2-TC7 (6 × 104 cells per well), C20, or S2 cells (15 × 104 per well) were seeded in 24-well culture dishes. For Caco2-TC7, 3 h before transfection, the cells were depleted in FCS and then transfected with Exgen 500/DNA solution (5 μl/1 μg of plasmid DNA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each transfection experiment contained 0.15 μg of pCMVβ-galactosidase as an internal transfection control. Transfected cells were lysed after 24–72hin150 μl of Dual Light lysis buffer (Tropix). In some experiments, dexamethasone at 76.5 nm final concentrations was added 24 h after transfection, and the cells were then harvested 48 h later.Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured with the Dual Light system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Tropix). To permit comparison between the various experimental situations, the luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. For C20 and S2 cells, transfections were done using jetPEI reagent (2 μl/μg DNA for C20 and 1 μl/μg DNA for S2) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Polyplus Transfection, France). Each transfection experiment contained 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid with different amounts (ranging from 5 to 500 ng) of transcription factor expression vectors and with 20 ng of pRL-null vector (Promega) as an internal transfection control. Transfected cells were lysed 48 h later in 150 μl of lysis buffer (Dual Luciferase kit, Promega), and luciferase activities were measured with the dual luciferase system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Transfections were performed in triplicate, and the results of two to six independent experiments were calculated as the mean of luciferase activity. A lumistar luminometer (BMG, Germany) was used to quantify light signal.Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)— Nuclear extracts from Caco2-TC7 or C20 cells cultured for 5–6 days were prepared as described (35Cadoret A. Bertrand F. Baron-Delage S. Levy P. Courtois G. Gespach C. Capeau J. Cherqui G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For EMSA, 2–5 μg of nuclear extract were mixed with 105 cpm of 5′-32P-labeled double-strand oligonucleotide probes (see Table I) in a DNA binding buffer containing 2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 2% glycerol, 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science) in a final volume of 20 μl and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The protein-DNA complexes were then separated on a non-denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. To demonstrate the specificity of the protein-DNA complexes, a large excess (50-fold) of a corresponding, mutated, or unrelated (SIF) unlabeled double-strand oligonucleotide (see Table I) was added 15 min before the radioactive probe. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with the radioactive probe for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies against Sp1 (rabbit antibody SC-59, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), KLF4 (rabbit antiserum kindly provided by Dr. C-C. Tseng, Baltimore), or normal rabbit serum (Vector Laboratories) were then added for 15 min at room temperature.Western Blot—Western blot analysis of nuclear proteins extracted from Caco2-TC7 or C20 cells (cultured for 5–6 days) was performed. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method. Fifty μg of proteins were incubated for 5 min in Laemmli buffer (6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) containing 1% SDS (w/v) with 10 mm DTT at 100 °C. The proteins were then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris, 0.192 m glycine, pH 8.6, 20% (v/v) ethanol. After transfer, the nitrocellulose was saturated for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS/Tween 0.05%, milk 1% with specific antibodies"
https://openalex.org/W2025929854,"G alpha 13 stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho, such as p115Rho-GEF. Activated Rho induces numerous cellular responses, including actin polymerization, serum response element (SRE)-dependent gene transcription and transformation. p115Rho-GEF contains a Regulator of G protein Signalling domain (RGS box) that confers GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards G alpha 12 and G alpha 13 (ref. 3). In contrast, classical RGS proteins (such as RGS16 and RGS4) exhibit RGS domain-dependent GAP activity on G alpha i and G alpha q, but not G alpha 12 or G alpha 13 (ref 4). Here, we show that RGS16 inhibits G alpha 13-mediated, RhoA-dependent reversal of stellation and SRE activation. The RGS16 amino terminus binds G alpha 13 directly, resulting in translocation of G alpha 13 to detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) and reduced p115Rho-GEF binding. RGS4 does not bind G alpha 13 or attenuate G alpha 13-dependent responses, and neither RGS16 nor RGS4 affects G alpha 12-mediated signalling. These results elucidate a new mechanism whereby a classical RGS protein regulates G alpha 13-mediated signal transduction independently of the RGS box."
https://openalex.org/W2003371514,"DNA replication of plasmid P1 requires a plasmid-encoded origin DNA-binding protein, RepA. RepA is an inactive dimer and is converted by molecular chaperones into an active monomer that binds RepA binding sites. Although the sequence of RepA is not homologous to that of F plasmid RepE, we found by using fold-recognition programs that RepA shares structural homology with RepE and built a model based on the RepE crystal structure. We constructed mutants in the two predicted DNA binding domains to test the model. As expected, the mutants were defective in P1 DNA binding. The model predicted that RepA binds the first half of the binding site through interactions with the C-terminal DNA binding domain and the second half through interactions with the N-terminal domain. The experiments supported the prediction. The model was further supported by the observation that mutants defective in dimerization map to the predicted subunit interface region, based on the crystal structure of pPS10 RepA, a RepE family member. These results suggest P1 RepA is structurally homologous to plasmid initiators, including those of F, R6K, pSC101, pCU1, pPS10, pFA3, pGSH500, Rts1, RepHI1B, RepFIB, and RSF1010.

A large class of circular double-stranded DNA plasmids contain multiple repeated sequences, iterons, in their origins of replication that specifically bind plasmid encoded replication initiator proteins (recently reviewed by del Solar et al., Ref. 1del Solar G. Giraldo R. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Espinosa M. Diaz-Orejas R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 434-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the initiator protein to the plasmid origin is an essential step in the initiation of theta-type DNA replication and triggers the assembly of a replication complex at the site through interactions between the plasmid initiator, host proteins, and the plasmid origin DNA. Plasmid initiator proteins are not only essential for DNA replication, but in most cases are also involved in the control of replication by autoregulating their gene expression. Additionally, some plasmids also possess iterons located in separate copy control loci. Binding of the initiator protein simultaneously to the control locus and the origin regulates plasmid copy number by a mechanism involving pairing of the control site and origin iterons.In the work presented here we have studied the plasmid P1 initiator protein, RepA. RepA binds to five direct repeats of a 19-bp sequence in the P1 origin (2Abeles A.L. Snyder K.M. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 307-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Chattoraj D.K. Schneider T.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By binding to the origin iterons, RepA also represses transcription from the repA promoter, located within the origin repeats and it regulates copy number by binding a group of nine similar repeated sequences in a copy control locus. The purified RepA protein exists as a dimer in solution and is unable to bind DNA. The action of DnaJ and DnaK in an ATP-dependent reaction converts the inactive dimer to active monomer that is capable of binding the P1 iteron with high affinity (4Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 6Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GrpE is required under conditions where the reaction is limited by slow nucleotide exchange (7Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RepA monomer is the active form in vivo, since DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE are required for the stable maintenance of P1 plasmids and for repA promoter repression (8Bukau B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6030-6038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tilly K. Yarmolinsky M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tilly K. Sozhamannan S. Yarmolinsky M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 812-817PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro RepA can be activated for DNA binding by ClpA, a member of the Clp/Hsp100 family of ATP-dependent chaperones (11Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In this case, activation is the conversion of inactive dimers to active monomers. Although both ClpA and the DnaK chaperone system convert RepA dimers to monomers, they recognize different regions of RepA (12Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Kim S.Y. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44778-44783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The initiator proteins of several other plasmids also exist as dimers yet bind to origin iterons as monomers. RepE, the initiator protein of F plasmid, requires DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE for monomerization and activation of origin binding (14Kawasaki Y. Wada C. Yura T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3839-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The initiator of plasmid RK2 is activated in vitro for DNA binding by monomerization by either the DnaK chaperone system in combination with ClpB or by ClpX (16Konieczny I. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18483-18488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The chaperone system used to activate the RK2 initiator in vivo has not been identified, suggesting the possibility that several chaperone systems are able to carry out the reaction. Recent studies have suggested that iteron DNA binding by RepA of pPS10 facilitates the conversion of inactive dimers to active monomers (18Diaz-Lopez T. Lages-Gonzalo M. Serrano-Lopez A. Alfonso C. Rivas G. Diaz-Orejas R. Giraldo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18606-18616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For RepA of pSC101, the monomer is active in iteron DNA binding, but the monomer-dimer transition is independent of molecular chaperones (19Manen D. Upegui-Gonzalez L.C. Caro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8923-8927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Ingmer H. Fong E.L. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the R6K initiator is able to bind to its iteron as a dimer or monomer (21Urh M. Wu J. Forest K. Inman R.B. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Structural studies of a monomeric mutant of RepE of F plasmid in complex with the 19-bp iteron demonstrated that RepE consists of topologically similar N- and C-terminal domains related to each other by internal pseudo 2-fold symmetry, despite the lack of amino acid similarity between the two domains (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two domains bind to two consecutive major grooves on one face of the helix. Amino acid homology between RepE and the initiator proteins of R6K, pSC101, pCU1, pPS10, pFA3, and pGSH500 suggests that those proteins bind their respective iterons similarly (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).P1 RepA does not share sequence homology with RepE and could not initially be aligned with the other plasmid initiators. In this study we addressed the question of whether P1 RepA might be structurally similar to the RepE class of plasmid initiator proteins, to another class of initiator proteins, or to a known class of DNA-binding proteins by fold prediction analysis and molecular modeling. We were able to align RepA with F plasmid RepE and generate a model of a RepA monomer bound to DNA based on the crystal structure of monomeric RepE. The model was tested experimentally and our results indicate that P1 RepA is structurally similar to the class of plasmid initiator proteins to which RepE belongs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ATP was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England BioLabs and polymerase chain reaction reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides used in DNA binding experiments were synthesized and PAGE purified by Sigma Genosys.Plasmids—Site-directed mutants of wild-type RepA and RepA-His6 (13Kim S.Y. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44778-44783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were constructed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). RepA His134 and Gly156 were converted to Asn and Val, respectively, generating point mutants RepA(H134N) and RepA(G156V). Lys88, Lys128, Arg130, Arg245, and Arg269 were converted to alanines, generating RepA(K88A), RepA(K128A), RepA(R130A), RepA(R245A), and RepA(R269A). To make RepA(3M), H134N, G156V, and N142K were introduced by megaprimer PCR. The sequences of all the mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. [3H]oriP1 plasmid DNA (3590 cpm/fmol) was prepared as described (5Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Proteins—RepA and RepA mutants were purified as described (4Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The purity of all proteins was greater than 95% as determined by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations are expressed as molar amounts of RepA dimers and ClpA hexamers. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were 3H-labeled in vitro using succinimidyl propionate, N-[propionate-2,3-3H] as described (24Hoskins J.R. Pak M. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).RepA Activation and DNA Binding Assays—For measuring DNA binding by nitrocellulose filter binding, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v)), 10 mm MgOAc, 1 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.5 pmol of ClpA, and RepA or RepA mutant protein as indicated. Proteins were diluted in Buffer A containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v). After 10 min at 24 °C, calf thymus DNA (1 μg) and 10 fmol of [3H]oriP1 plasmid DNA (3590 cpm/fmol) were added. Following 5 min at 0 °C, the mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and the retained radioactivity was measured.For measuring DNA binding by gel retardation, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained Buffer A, 10 mm MgOAc, 5 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.64 pmol of ClpA, and RepA or RepA mutant protein as indicated. After 20 min at 24 °C, 2.5 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide, prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides, were added. After 10 min at 0 °C, the samples were electrophoresed in 8% polyacrylamide Tris borate/EDTA gels and stained with SYBR green (Molecular Probes). Band intensities were quantified using 300-nm transillumination and an Eagle Eye II (Stratagene) image acquisition system.Molecular Modeling of RepA—RepA was aligned to RepE using 2-fold recognition programs, bioinbgu and 3D-PSSM (25Fischer D. Altman R.B. Dunker A.K. Hunter L. Klein T.E. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. World Scientific, Teaneck, NJ2000: 119-130Google Scholar, 26Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The alignment obtained was combined manually with the previously published multiple alignment of RepE and the initiator proteins of R6K, pSC101, pCU1, and pPS10 (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The alignment was manually adjusted to eliminate breaks or insertions in secondary structures compared with the x-ray structure of RepE. The final alignment was used to build a model of a monomer of RepA with reference to a monomer of RepE using the automated homology modeling program, modeler, of the homology modeling option of the InsightII program (Accelrys, Inc.). In two regions of the x-ray structure where there were gaps, the modeler program inserted the corresponding residues. The model was then superimposed on the RepE protein structure using the program Sheba (27Jung J. Lee B. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The root mean-squared deviation between the two molecules is 1.1 Å over 191 of 211 Cα atoms of RepA. The superimposed proteins along with the RepE iteron DNA were displayed using InsightII on a SGI work station and then the RepE protein structure was removed, generating a model of RepA bound to a 23-bp oligonucleotide with the RepE iteron sequence. Modeling of the initiator proteins of R6K, pSC101, pCU1, and pSP10 was carried out similarly using a protein alignment that was slightly modified from the previously published alignment (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of RepE as the template.Illustrations of P1 RepA, F RepE, and R6K pi dimers were made by superimposing the models of P1 RepA and R6K pi monomers and the crystal structure of the F RepE monomer on each of the protomers of the pPS10 RepA dimer structure (28Giraldo R. Fernandez-Tornero C. Evans P.R. Diaz-Orejas R. Romero A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using the program Sheba. The program Molscript was used to generate the ribbon diagrams.The atomic coordinates for the molecular model of the P1 RepA monomer are deposited in the model data base (www.rcsb.org/pdb). Molecular models of P1 RepA with DNA, R6K pi, pSC101 RepA, pPS10 RepA, and pCU1 will be provided upon request.RESULTSMolecular Modeling of P1 RepA Bound to DNA—When we queried the protein data base with the P1 RepA amino acid sequence using blastp, the RepE family of initiator proteins were not identified, as previously reported (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, a Pfam search placed both RepA and RepE in the Rep3 family of the Pfam data base, indicating similarity between the two proteins. We used 2-fold recognition programs, bioinbgu (25Fischer D. Altman R.B. Dunker A.K. Hunter L. Klein T.E. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. World Scientific, Teaneck, NJ2000: 119-130Google Scholar) and 3D-PSSM (26Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), to determine if the amino acid sequence of RepA could be identified with any existing protein folds. Both programs predicted RepA to fold similarly to RepE of F plasmid with medium to high confidence. Alignment of RepA with RepE obtained from the fold-recognition programs was combined manually with the multiple alignment of RepE and the initiator proteins of plasmids R6K, pSC101, pCU1, and pPS10, which were previously shown to be related to RepE (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Manual adjustments of this alignment were done to avoid breaks or insertions within the secondary structures of the model when compared with the x-ray structure of RepE (Fig. 1). RepE and RepA align such that amino acid 71 of RepA aligns with the first amino acid of the RepE crystal structure, residue 15. The adjusted alignment of the other initiators differs slightly from that of Komori et al. (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The final alignment was used to build a model of RepA with reference to RepE (Fig. 2, A and B). From the alignment and model of RepA it can be seen that RepA, like RepE, is composed of two domains that are structurally similar although they do not share amino acid homology. Each domain contains a HTH DNA binding motif (29Brennan R.G. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1903-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using similar methods, we modeled the initiator proteins of R6K, pSC101, pCU1, and pPS10 using our refined alignment of the proteins and the crystal structure of RepE as the template (Fig. 2, C-F). RepA of pPS10 has previously been modeled (30Maestro B. Sanz J.M. Diaz-Orejas R. Fernandez-Tresguerres E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the published alignment (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The structural similarity of P1 RepA and F RepE with the other plasmid initiator proteins is apparent. The models provide useful tools for designing site-directed mutants to elucidate the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involved in the process of initiation of DNA replication.Fig. 2Models of initiator proteins bound to DNA.A, model of a P1 RepA monomer bound to DNA.

The DNA binding helices, α4 and α4′, are red. The site-directed P1 RepA DNA binding mutants used in these studies are shown as balls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Site-directed RepA Mutants Defective in DNA Binding—We next wanted to test the validity of the model experimentally. One prediction is that RepA binds to one face of the DNA. This was confirmed by previous DNA footprinting experiments showing that RepA binds exclusively to one face of the DNA, through two consecutive major groove interactions (31Abeles A.L. Reaves L.D. Austin S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 43-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Papp P.P. Chattoraj D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The model predicts that RepA should contact the major groove of the DNA binding site through a N-terminal and a C-terminal HTH motif. To test the model, we constructed site-directed mutations in RepA, two in the predicted N-terminal recognition helix, RepA(K128A) and RepA(R130A), and one in the predicted C-terminal recognition helix, RepA(R245A) (indicated in Figs. 1 and 2A). We purified the proteins and measured DNA binding both by a gel shift assay using a 33-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the RepA consensus binding site and by nitrocellulose filter binding assay using plasmid DNA containing the P1 origin of replication. As a control, and as previously seen, RepA bound specifically to the consensus iteron in a reaction requiring chaperone activation, either ClpA (Ref. 11Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar and Fig. 3) or DnaJ and DnaK (5Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When the mutant proteins were tested for DNA binding, RepA(R130A) and RepA(R245A) bound P1 iteron DNA with about 10% the affinity of wild type following activation by ClpA (Fig. 3A). These results strongly suggest that Arg130 and Arg245 participate in RepA-DNA interactions. RepA(K128A) bound oriP1 DNA with about 60% the affinity of wild type after activation (Fig. 3B). Although Lys128 is predicted to be in the DNA recognition helix of RepA, the biochemical results indicate that it is not as involved in DNA binding as Arg130.Fig. 3DNA binding by RepA mutants predicted to be DNA binding defective.A, RepA (diamonds), RepA(R130A) (squares), or RepA(R245A) (triangles), at the concentrations indicated, was incubated with ClpA in the presence (closed symbols) or absence (open symbols) of ATP and DNA binding was measured using gel shift assay as described in “Experimental Procedures.” B, RepA (diamonds), RepA(K128A) (squares), or RepA(K88A) (circles) was incubated with ClpA (filled symbols) or without ClpA (open symbols), and DNA binding was measured using nitrocellulose filter binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, RepA (diamonds) or RepA(R269A) (triangles) was incubated with ClpA (filled symbols) or without ClpA (open symbols), and DNA binding was measured using nitrocellulose filter binding assay as in Fig. 3B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The model predicts that RepA should make contacts with the phosphate backbone of the DNA outside of the recognition helices in the N-terminal region of α2 (residues 87-89), the N-terminal region of α2′ (residues 204-206), between β3 and β4 (residues 170-173), and between β3′ and β4′ (residues 266-269). We constructed and tested mutants in two of these regions. RepA(K88A) was tested because it aligns with an arginine of RepE that contacts the phosphate backbone, R33 (shown in Figs. 1 and 2). We found that it bound oriP1 DNA with about 60% lower affinity than the wild type (Fig. 3B). RepA(R269A) was also tested and found to bind oriP1 DNA with about 25% lower affinity than wild type (Fig. 3C). Both of these results are consistent with these regions being in close proximity to the DNA.The observations that the mutant proteins bound P1 iteron containing DNA, albeit poorly in some cases, and required ClpA for activation suggested that the proteins folded in conformations similar to wild type. Thus these results support the validity of the model and the importance of residues in both DNA binding recognition helices, α4 and α4′. They also suggest that the residues in the N-terminal region of α2 and between β3′ and β4′ are important for DNA binding.DNA Binding by RepA to the 19-bp Binding Site and to the Half-Sites—The model predicts that RepA should contact both halves of the iteron. The structure data shows that the C-terminal DNA binding domain of RepE makes stronger protein-DNA contacts with the first half of the iteron than the N-terminal domain makes with the second half of the iteron (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two halves of the iterons were referred to as “first” and “second” before the structure of RepE demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of RepE binds to the first half-site and the N-terminal domain binds to the second half-site (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the N-terminal recognition helix of RepE, α4, only two residues contact the second half of the iteron directly while in the C-terminal recognition helix, α4′, four residues contact the first half of the iteron (22Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We wanted to test whether or not P1 RepA binds to the separate halves of the P1 iteron and whether RepA has a higher affinity for the first half of the site than the second. We compared DNA binding to 33-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either the 19-bp consensus RepA binding site, the first half of the site, or the second half of the site (shown in Fig. 4). When DNA binding to the consensus site was measured using RepA activated by ClpA, 50% retardation was seen with 80 nm RepA and 125 nm DNA fragment (Fig. 5A). When we measured RepA binding to the first half of the iteron, we found that RepA bound, but the apparent affinity was about 60-fold lower than that for the full site (Fig. 5B). DNA binding was specific and required activation by ClpA. In contrast we were unable to detect binding of activated RepA to the second half of the iteron, suggesting that the affinity was at least 300-fold lower than that for the full site (Fig. 5C). DNA binding was also not detected when we used an oligonucleotide containing the second half-site plus the T that is located in the middle of the 19 bp iteron (data not shown). The observation that RepA binds with higher affinity to the first half of the site than the second further suggests similarity between RepE and RepA.Fig. 4Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides used. The first and second half-site oligonucleotides were made by replacing the other half-site sequence with a random sequence of nine bp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5RepA binds to the consensus RepA binding site and to the first half-site. RepA at the concentrations indicated was incubated with ClpA with and without ATP. Then a 33-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the full RepA binding site, (A), the first half of the binding site (B), or the second half of the binding site (C), was added, and RepA-DNA complexes were detected by gel shift assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The model predicts that the C-terminal DNA binding domain of RepA interacts with the first half of the iteron. To test this we reasoned in the following way. Since RepA binds, although with lower affinity, to the first half of the iteron, mutants in the N-terminal DNA binding domain might bind the first half-site through interactions involving their wild-type C-terminal DNA binding domain with similar affinity as wild-type RepA. DNA binding studies confirmed this (Fig. 6). Both RepA(R130A) and wild-type RepA bound the first half-site with similar relative affinity, suggesting that they were both binding to the first half-site through interactions with their C-terminal DNA binding domain. Moreover the RepA(R130A) bound the first half-site DNA with similar affinity as it bound the full iteron (Fig. 3), suggesting that the defect in DNA binding to the full site reflects a defect in interaction of the second half-site with the N-terminal domain of RepA. In addition, the model predicted that RepA(R245A) would have weaker binding to the first half-site than wild-type RepA. When DNA binding was tested, there was no detectable binding by RepA(R245A) to the first half-site (Fig. 6). These results also support the validity of the molecular model.Fig. 6RepA(R130A) binds to the first half-site of the RepA binding site, but RepA(R245A) does not. RepA(R130A) (closed squares), RepA(R245A) (closed triangles), or wild-type RepA (closed diamonds) was incubated with ClpA in the presence of ATP. A 33-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the first half of the RepA binding site was added, and DNA binding was detected by gel shift assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the absence of ATP, no DNA binding was detected by either the wild-type or mutant proteins (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Th"
https://openalex.org/W2013089875,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cellular single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) becomes phosphorylated during meiosis in two discrete reactions. The primary reaction is first observed shortly after cells enter the meiotic program and leads to phosphorylation of nearly all the detectable RPA. The secondary reaction, which requires the ATM/ATR homologue Mec1, is induced upon initiation of recombination and only modifies a fraction of the total RPA. We now report that correct timing of both RPA phosphorylation reactions requires Ime2, a meiosis-specific protein kinase that is critical for proper initiation of meiotic progression. Expression of Ime2 in vegetative cells leads to an unscheduled RPA phosphorylation reaction that does not require other tested meiosis-specific kinases and is distinct from the RPA phosphorylation reaction that normally occurs during mitotic growth. In addition, immunoprecipitated Ime2 catalyzes phosphorylation of purified RPA. Our data strongly suggest that Ime2 is an RPA kinase in vivo. We propose that Ime2 directly catalyzes RPA phosphorylation in the primary reaction and indirectly promotes the Mec1-dependent secondary reaction by advancing cells through meiotic progression. Our studies have identified a novel meiosis-specific reaction that targets a key protein required for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. This pathway could be important in differentiating mitotic and meiotic DNA metabolism.

Our studies have identified a novel meiosis-specific reaction that targets a key protein required for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. This pathway could be important in differentiating mitotic and meiotic DNA metabolism. Meiosis is a specialized process in which a single diploid cell undergoes one round of DNA replication followed by two consecutive rounds of nuclear division to generate four haploid progeny. For most species examined, the first nuclear division is directly preceded by a programmed recombination phase that is required for proper chromosome segregation and also serves to enhance genetic variability. In multicellular eukaryotes, this remarkable capacity to both rearrange chromosomal content and halve the chromosome number is restricted to a subset of cells destined to form gametes. However, single-celled eukaryotes such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can also undergo meiosis, leading to the production of haploid spores upon starvation. In either case, the reduction in ploidy resulting from meiosis is a prerequisite to zygote formation, whereupon the cellular DNA content is returned to a diploid state. Studies in a variety of systems have revealed that regulation of chromosome dynamics and maintenance of genomic integrity during meiosis require the induction of numerous proteins upon commitment of cells to meiotic differentiation. Among these are the meiosis-specific protein kinases that initiate and/or propagate critical meiotic signaling pathways. In S. cerevisiae, the protein kinase Ime2 is an important regulator of meiotic initiation (1Smith H.E. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell.

In the absence of Ime2 function, cells do not progress normally into “pre-meiotic” DNA replication and are deficient in completing downstream events in the sporulation process. Recent studies have demonstrated that Ime2 isolated by immunoprecipitation catalyzes phosphorylation of Ndt80 (6Sopko R. Raithatha S. Stuart D. Mol. Cell.

Another study has shown that Ime2 immunoprecipitates catalyze phosphorylation of Ime1 (11Guttmann-Raviv N. Martin S. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell.

Martin S. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that Ime2 regulates proteins that are more directly associated with controlling meiotic progression, such as the B-type cyclin inhibitor Sic1 (14Dirick L. Goetsch L. Ammerer G. Byers B. Science. 1998; 281: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the anaphase-promoting complex ubiquitin ligase activator Cdh1 (15Bolte M. Steigemann P. Braus G.H. Irniger S.

Given that Ime2 is required for proper pre-meiotic DNA replication, other potential targets of Ime2 protein kinase activity include proteins that are involved in the initiation of DNA synthesis. One candidate is replication protein A (RPA), 1The abbreviations used are: RPAreplication protein AssDNAsingle-stranded DNAHahemagglutinin epitopeIme2-His/Hahistidine and hemagglutinin epitope-tagged version of Ime2Ime2kd-His/Hakinase-dead version of Ime2-His/HaSPMsporulation mediumDTTdithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: RPAreplication protein AssDNAsingle-stranded DNAHahemagglutinin epitopeIme2-His/Hahistidine and hemagglutinin epitope-tagged version of Ime2Ime2kd-His/Hakinase-dead version of Ime2-His/HaSPMsporulation mediumDTTdithiothreitol. an abundant single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein that is required for DNA replication, repair, and recombination (for review see Ref. 16Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). RPA is an evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric complex, and each subunit is essential for viability in yeast (17Heyer W.D. Rao M.R.S. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2321-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A fundamental role of RPA is to stabilize the ssDNA that is generated during DNA transactions. RPA also interacts with several other proteins required for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Consequently, RPA is likely to play an important regulatory role in DNA metabolism. Consistent with this hypothesis, RPA is phosphorylated periodically during the mitotic cell cycle and also in response to genotoxic stress in both human and yeast cells (19Brill S.J. Stillman B.

Our recent studies have demonstrated that yeast RPA also becomes phosphorylated in at least two separate reactions during meiotic progression (25Brush G.S. Clifford D.M. Marinco S.M. Bartrand A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The primary RPA phosphorylation reaction first occurs soon after cells enter meiosis and would appear to coincide temporally with Ime2 induction. The secondary reaction occurs upon initiation of meiotic recombination and requires the protein kinase Mec1, an important regulator of DNA metabolic checkpoints (26Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 27Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H.

Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15075-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3725-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mec1 is homologous to the human protein kinase ATM, which is mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (31Savitsky K. Bar-Shira A. Gilad S. Rotman G. Ziv Y. Vanagaite L. Tagle D.A. Smith S. Uziel T. Sfez S. Ashkenazi M. Pecker I. Frydman M. Harnik R. Patanjali S.R. Simmons A. Clines G.A. Sartiel A. Gatti R.A.

Science. 1995; 268: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar), and is even more homologous to the human “ATM- and Rad3-related” protein kinase ATR (for review see Ref. 32Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Despite the participation of Mec1, our data have suggested that the secondary RPA phosphorylation reaction is not involved in meiotic Mec1-dependent checkpoint delay processes. Instead, it is likely that Mec1-dependent RPA phosphorylation functions to regulate recombination itself. The possibility that phosphorylation modulates RPA function in DNA metabolism is supported by earlier studies employing the cell-free SV40 DNA replication system. These experiments have suggested that certain forms of phosphorylated human RPA are inefficient in supporting DNA replication and might preferentially function in DNA repair (22Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 33Park J.S. Park S.J. Peng X. Wang M. Yu M.A. Lee S.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In order to further understand the function of RPA phosphorylation, we have investigated the mechanism underlying the sequential RPA phosphorylation reactions that occur during meiotic progression. We now demonstrate that proper timing of both primary and secondary meiotic RPA phosphorylation requires Ime2. Our genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the initial meiosis-specific reaction is directly catalyzed by Ime2. The secondary Mec1-dependent reaction is indirectly activated by the Ime2-dependent promotion of meiotic progression. Nearly all of the detectable RPA becomes phosphorylated in the primary Ime2-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that this novel meiotic pathway plays a significant role in directing the meiosis-specific DNA metabolic functions of RPA. Strains—The following yeast strains derived from SK-1 (35Kane S.M. Roth R. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 8-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cells were used in this study: DSY1089 (wild type) (30Stuart D.

A PCR-based strategy (36Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) was used to replace a 2-kb fragment containing the entire open reading frame of IME2 with TRP1 in a haploid strain. This mutation was then transmitted to other strains by standard mating and sporulation protocols. A similar method was used to replace a 1.1-kb genomic region containing the SIC1 open reading frame with a 1.6-kb kanMX4 fragment. The following yeast strains containing a W303 (37Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) genetic background were also used: W303-1A (wild type), MATaade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,115 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1; YGB23 (rfa2-S122D), MATaade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,115 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 rfa2-S122D; YGB138 (wild type), MATa/α ade2-1/” can1-100/” his3-11,115/” leu2-3,112/” trp1-1/” ura3-1/”; YGB140 (rfa2-S122A), MATa/α ade2-1/” can1-100/” his3-11,115/” leu2-3,112/” trp1-1/” ura3-1/” rfa2-S122A/”. Mutant alleles of RFA2 encoding Rfa2 with serine-to-aspartate (S122D) or serine-to-alanine (S122A) substitutions at residue 122 were generated in progenitor haploids by “pop-in/pop-out replacement” (38Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). All mutations generated in our laboratory were confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Analysis of ectopic Ime2 expression included ime2, mek1, rim15, smk1, and sps1 deletion mutants from the homozygous diploid deletion set (Invitrogen). Ime2 Plasmids—PCR-based cloning methods were employed to generate plasmids expressing C-terminally tagged versions of Ime2. A sequence encoding six histidine repeats followed by three hemagglutinin epitope (Ha) repeats was inserted at the NotI site of pRS426 (39Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar) to generate pRS426-His/Ha. Oligonucleotide primers designed to engineer an XmaI site upstream of the IME2 promoter and a NotI site immediately prior to the IME2 stop codon were used to amplify the entire IME2 gene from pAM405 (1Smith H.E. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2142-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), generously provided by Craig Giroux (Wayne State University). The PCR fragment was inserted directly into pGEM-T (Promega) by “TA” cloning. DNA sequencing revealed two PCR-generated mutations that were corrected by replacement with a restriction fragment from pAM405. IME2 was then excised from the pGEM-T clone with XmaI and NotI and inserted between the XmaI and NotI sites of pRS426-His/Ha. The resulting plasmid, pDC005, encodes a C-terminally tagged version of Ime2 designated Ime2-His/Ha. The plasmid pDC006, which encodes a kinase-dead mutant of Ime2 (Ime2kd-His/Ha) resulting from a lysine-to-alanine mutation at residue 97 (11Guttmann-Raviv N. Martin S. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was generated from pDC005 by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Yeast cells were transformed with plasmids using a lithium acetate-based procedure (40Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Media, Growth, and Sporulation—Complex medium containing glucose (YPD) or glycerol (YPG) and synthetic complete medium lacking uracil were prepared as described (41Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 145-149Google Scholar). Sporulation medium (SPM) consisted of 0.3% potassium acetate and 0.02% raffinose supplemented with leucine at 0.0025% and arginine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil each at 0.0005%. All incubations were carried out at 30 °C. SK-1 cells were synchronously sporulated as described (25Brush G.S. Clifford D.M. Marinco S.M. Bartrand A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, single colonies were selected following growth on YPG and incubated in YPD overnight. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate 200 ml of YPA (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% potassium acetate) at an A600 of 0.2 for pre-sporulation growth. After 12 h of incubation, pre-sporulation cells were washed once with 20 ml of SPM, resuspended in 200 ml of SPM, and further incubated for the indicated times. Western Blot Analysis—To prepare denatured extracts, cells that had been washed with water and stored at -80 °C were resuspended in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) and subjected to three cycles of freezing (dry ice for 2 min) followed by heating (95 °C for 2 min). The suspensions were then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet cell debris, and aliquots of the supernatants were further analyzed as described below. Immunoprecipitated and purified proteins (see below) were dissolved in sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 s. To allow for reproducible detection of immunoprecipitated Ime2 by Western blot analysis, 20 μg of carrier protein (yeast crude extract devoid of Ime2-His/Ha) was added to the Ime2 immunoprecipitates. Samples to be analyzed for Rfa2 phosphorylation were subjected to electrophoresis through a 12% low cross-linking SDS-polyacrylamide gel (150:1 w/w acrylamide/bisacrylamide). For analyses not requiring such resolution, 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 w/w acrylamide/bisacrylamide) were employed. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.2-μm pore size, Schleicher & Schuell) in Western buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol). RPA subunits were detected after incubation with anti-Rfa1 (24Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3725-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), anti-Rfa2 (24Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3725-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), or affinity-purified anti-Rfa3 polyclonal antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce). Antiserum directed against Rfa3 as well as the affinity-purified preparation and pre-immune serum were generously provided by Steven Brill (Rutgers University). Ime2-His/Ha was detected after incubation with monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce). Protein bands were visualized by autoradiography using chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). DNA Content Analysis—Cells were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry after staining with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) as described previously (25Brush G.S. Clifford D.M. Marinco S.M. Bartrand A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DNA content histograms were generated using WinMDI software. Immunoprecipitation—Stationary phase cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1 m EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (2.5 ml/g cells), and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The cells were harvested by centrifugation again, resuspended in YPS (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 1 m sorbitol) containing 200 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T (1 ml/g cells; U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and incubated at 30 °C for 2.5 h. The resulting spheroplasts were collected, washed twice with YPS, and then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Resulting suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysate was incubated on ice for 2 h with antibody (HA.11, anti-Rfa1, or anti-Rfa3) or the respective control (no antibody, Rfa1 pre-immune serum, or Rfa3 pre-immune serum). Immune complexes were collected on EZview Red Protein G Affinity Gel (Sigma) by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking and were subsequently washed once with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with lysis buffer alone. RPA Purification—RPA was purified from exponentially growing W303-1A (wild type) and YGB23 (rfa2-S122D) cells and from synchronously sporulating DSY1089 cells (wild type; 6-h time point). Purification over three columns (Affi-Gel Blue, ssDNA cellulose, and Mono Q) was performed based on methods described previously (19Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 42Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Relative levels of Rfa2 in the W303-1A and YGB23 RPA preparations were determined from a silver-stained gel (Fig. 4C) using a Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440CF equipped with 1D Image Analysis Software, version 3.5.3. Protein Kinase Assay—HA.11 immunoprecipitates were washed two times with kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and then assayed for protein kinase activity in kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (25 μl final volume). Purified RPA (5.3 pmol) and M13mp18 single- or double-stranded DNA (17 fmol; New England Biolabs) were added where indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min and then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried either directly or after silver staining (Fig. 4C), and incorporation of radioactive inorganic phosphate into protein was detected by autoradiography and Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. Meiotic RPA Phosphorylation Requires Ime2—Our previous studies (25Brush G.S. Clifford D.M. Marinco S.M. Bartrand A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) revealed that the middle subunit of yeast RPA (Rfa2) becomes phosphorylated in two separate reactions during meiotic progression. Because the primary reaction is induced early in meiosis when Ime2 is also known to be induced, we investigated Rfa2 status in wild type and ime2 mutant cells subjected to starvation conditions that induce entry into the meiotic program. As observed previously, two Rfa2 phosphoisomers were detected by Western blot analysis in wild type cells (Fig. 1A). A primary phosphoisomer was first observed early in meiosis prior to the bulk of pre-meiotic DNA replication (see Fig. 1B) and persisted throughout most of meiotic progression. A secondary hyperphosphorylated phosphoisomer, comprising only a small fraction of the total Rfa2, was induced later in sporulation. We demonstrated previously that generation of this phosphoisomer requires both Mec1 and initiation of recombination (25Brush G.S. Clifford D.M. Marinco S.M. Bartrand A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Deletion of IME2 abolished nearly all meiotic Rfa2 phosphorylation as determined by Rfa2 electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous reports (1Smith H.E. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2142-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida M. Kawaguchi H. Sakata Y. Kominami K. Hirano M. Shima H. Akada R. Yamashita I. Mol. Gen.

Genet. 1996; 253: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the ime2 mutant cells did not progress normally through pre-meiotic DNA replication, exhibiting a significant delay in the onset of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1B). In addition, these cells were incapable of forming mature asci at later time points (data not shown). Genetic studies suggest that Ime2 regulates pre-meiotic DNA replication by promoting phosphorylation and degradation of the B-type cyclin inhibitor Sic1 (14Dirick L. Goetsch L. Ammerer G. Byers B. Science. 1998; 281: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ime2 indirectly activates meiotic Rfa2 phosphorylation by relieving Sic1-mediated inhibition of a cyclin-dependent kinase, we examined sic1 mutant and ime2 sic1 double mutant cells induced to enter meiosis. Deletion of SIC1 led to an accumulation of G2 cells that were incapable of entering the sporulation program (Fig. 2B) (14Dirick L. Goetsch L. Ammerer G. Byers B. Science. 1998; 281: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As a result, a residual mitotic Rfa2 phosphoisomer was detected in sic1 and ime2 sic1 cells throughout the time course (Fig. 2A). In sic1 cells, two Rfa2 phosphoisomers were observed, whereas in ime2 sic1 cells, a single Rfa2 phosphoisomer was observed that did not appear to change in abundance relative to unphosphorylated Rfa2 during the time course. Therefore, deletion of SIC1 did not rescue the defect in Rfa2 phosphorylation conferred by deletion of IME2, arguing against the involvement of a B-type cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex in catalyzing meiotic Rfa2 phosphorylation. It should be further noted that our ime2 sic1 double mutant did not appear to progress though meiosis as judged by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B) or formation of mature asci (data not shown). These results do not support the contention that a sic1 deletion can rescue the defect in ime2 cells that leads to defective meiotic progression. Ime2 Expression in Vegetative Cells Promotes RPA Phosphorylation—We further investigated the potential role of Ime2 as an RPA kinase by introducing IME2 into cells on a high copy 2-μm vector to allow for inappropriate mitotic expression of the meiosis-specific protein kinase. Cells expressing a His/Ha-tagged version of Ime2 (Ime2-His/Ha) exhibited two Rfa2 phosphoisomers during exponential growth, whereas cells expressing the kinase-dead version of tagged Ime2 (Ime2kd-His/Ha) exhibited the single Rfa2 phosphoisomer typical of mitotic cells (Fig. 3A, bottom panel, lanes 1 and 2). Expression of both forms of Ime2 was verified by Western blot analysis with antibody directed against Ha (Fig. 3A, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). The wild type Ime2 appeared to have slig"
https://openalex.org/W1975997492,"We show that the pseudoperoxidase activity of ferrylmyoglobin (MbIV) promotes oxidative degradation of doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer anthracycline known to induce severe cardiotoxicity. MbIV, formed in vitro by reacting horse heart MbIII with H2O2, caused disappearance of the spectrum of DOX at 477 nm and appearance of UV-absorbing chromophores that indicated opening and degradation of its tetracyclic ring. Electron spray ionization mass spectrometry analyses of DOX/MbIV ultrafiltrates showed that DOX degradation resulted in formation of 3-methoxyphthalic acid, the product of oxidative modifications of its methoxy-substituted ring D. Other methoxy-substituted anthracyclines similarly released 3-methoxyphthalic acid after oxidation by MbIV, whereas demethoxy analogs released simple phthalic acid. Kinetic and stoichiometric analyses of reactions between DOX and MbIII/H2O2 or hemin/H2O2 showed that the porphyrin radical of MbIV-compound I and the iron-oxo moiety of MbIV-compound II were sequentially involved in oxidizing DOX; however, oxidation by compound I formed more 3-methoxyphthalic acid than oxidation by compound II. Sizeable amounts of 3-methoxyphthalic acid were formed in the heart of mice treated with DOX, in human myocardial biopsies exposed to DOX in vitro, and in human cardiac cytosol that oxidized DOX after activation of its endogenous myoglobin by H2O2. Importantly, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were damaged by low concentrations of DOX but could tolerate concentrations of 3-methoxyphthalic acid higher than those measured in murine or human myocardium. These results unravel a novel function for MbIV in the oxidative degradation of anthracyclines to phthalic acids and suggest that this may serve a salvage pathway against cardiotoxicity.

Under normal conditions the majority of Mb is found in its oxygenated form (MbO2), which interacts slowly with H2O2 (k = 20.8 s–1m–1); however, both deoxy-MbII and metmyoglobin (MbIII) react rapidly with H2O2 (k = 3.6 × 103 and 3.4 × 104 s–1m–1, respectively) (1Yusa K. Shikama K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6684-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Galaris D. Korantzopoulos P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An ideal setting for reactions between Mb and H2O2 has therefore been identified in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, a condition characterized by conversion of MbIIO2 to MbIII/deoxy-MbII during ischemia and by formation of H2O2 during blood reflow (3Arduini A. Eddy L. Hochstein P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Gunther M.R. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide causes two-equivalent oxidation of MbIII to ferrylmyoglobin (MbIV), a hypervalent species that oxidizes polyunsaturated fatty acids and several other biomolecules in a fashion similar to that described for the compound I or II of peroxidases. The reaction sequence through which MbIV is generated from MbIII has been considered as shown in Reactions 1 and 2,Por-MbIII-globin+H2O2→Por.-MbIV-globin+H2OReaction 1 Por.-MbIV-globin→Por-MbIV-globin.Reaction 1 myoglobin doxorubicin metmyoglobin ferrylmyoglobin hydrogen peroxide horseradish peroxidase lactoperoxidase daunorubicin idarubicin 2,2′-diazinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry total ion count cone voltage molecular ion 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan high pressure liquid chromatography. In Reaction 1, H2O2 converts MbIII to a compound I-like species in which both oxidizing equivalents are retained in the heme pocket, one in the form of a long lived iron-oxo moiety (FeIV=O) and the other in the form of a transient porphyrin π-cation radical (Por•) (5Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In Reaction 2, the porphyrin radical dissipates in the globin, causing formation of amino acid radicals while leaving the heme moiety in a FeIV=O form similar to compound II (5Egawa T. Shimada H.

We developed an interest in possible reactions between Mb and doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer anthracycline which exhibits activity against several tumors but also causes severe cardiotoxicity. The rationale for investigating DOX-Mb interactions was offered by several considerations. On the one hand, cyclic reduction-oxidation of a quinone moiety in the tetracyclic ring of DOX (Fig. 1) generates H2O2 in excess of the detoxifying capacity of cardiomyocytes (9Doroshow J.H. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3068-3074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Minotti G. Cairo G. Monti E.

Biochem. 2002; 234: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DOX causes a 4-fold stimulation of the autoxidation of MbIIO2 to MbIII (12Trost L.C. Wallace K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and inhibits MbIII reductases that would regenerate MbIIO2 (13Taylor D. Hochstein P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 2079-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, several factors seem to enable DOX to promote reactions between MbIII and H2O2, possibly exposing cardiomyocytes to lipid peroxidation or other forms of oxidative injury induced by MbIV. In contrast to these premises, however, we found that DOX inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by MbIV in reconstituted chemical models (14Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Giampietro R. Liberi G. Teodori G. Calafiore A.M. Minotti G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the “antioxidant” effect of DOX was due to its ability to reduce MbIV back to MbIII, a process mediated by a hydroquinone in juxtaposition to the quinone (cf.Fig. 1) (14Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Giampietro R. Liberi G. Teodori G. Calafiore A.M. Minotti G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We also noticed that electron transfer from DOX to MbIV was accompanied by a loss of the optical and fluorescent properties of the anthracycline, as if DOX underwent opening and degradation of its tetracyclic ring (14Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Giampietro R. Liberi G. Teodori G. Calafiore A.M. Minotti G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results provided unexpected evidence that DOX could both favor MbIV formation and prevent oxidative damage by serving itself as a suicide substrate for MbIV. Attempts to identify the product(s) of MbIV-dependent DOX degradation were unsuccessful (14Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Giampietro R. Liberi G. Teodori G. Calafiore A.M. Minotti G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and similar problems were encountered by other investigators when DOX was oxidized with horseradish peroxidase, microperoxidase 11 (product of the proteolytic digestion of cytochrome c), or •NO2 radicals generated through lactoperoxidase/NO2- or myeloperoxidase/NO2- (15Miura T. Muraoka S. Fujimoto Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Reszka K.J. McCormick M.L. Britigan B.E.

Lack of information about the nature of degradation products precludes an appraisal of the mechanisms and consequences of MbIV-anthracycline interactions. Therefore, we designed experiments to elucidate how MbIV oxidizes DOX and to identify the product(s) of DOX degradation. Moreover, we characterized the possible role of degradation product(s) in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Chemicals—Doxorubicin, daunorubicin (DNR), and 4-demethoxydaunorubicin (idarubicin, IDA) were obtained through the courtesy of Pharmacia-Upjohn, Milan, Italy. Thymol-free bovine liver catalase, horse heart MbIII, hemin, type VI-A horseradish peroxidase (HRP), bovine milk lactoperoxidase (LPO), 2,2′-diazinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), naphthazarin (5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and all other chemicals were from Sigma. 3-Methoxyphthalic acid was synthesized by oxidation of 2,3-dimethylanisole with a large NO– excess of potassium permanganate (19Wentzel B.B. Donners M.P.J. Alsters P.L. Feiters M.C. Nolte R.J.M. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 7797-7803Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and purified by crystallization from water. MbIV Formation—MbIV was formed by reacting MbIII with a 2-fold excess of H2O2. As shown previously (14Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Giampietro R. Liberi G. Teodori G. Calafiore A.M. Minotti G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this H2O2:MbIII ratio gives complete oxidation of MbIII to MbIV while also avoiding confounding factors due to the possible release of iron from the heme pocket. MbIII was quantitated by assuming ϵ630 nm = 3.5 mm–1 cm–1; MbIV was quantitated according to the formula: MbIV (mm) = ((249 × A550 nm) – (367 × A630 nm)) (20Mordente A. Santini S. Miggiano G.A.D. Martorana G.E. Petitti T. Minotti G. Giardina B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27394-27400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the experiments were carried out at 37 °C in 0.3 m NaCl, carefully adjusted to pH 7.0. This was done because we noticed that common buffers like phosphate or Tris or Hepes accelerated a spontaneous decay of MbIV to MbIII; buffers are also known to participate in anthracycline redox reactions (21Taatjes D.J. Gaudiano G. Resing K. Koch T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1276-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although unbuffered, the pH of incubations did not vary throughout the experiment. Spectrophotometric Assays for MbIV-dependent DOX Degradation— After correction of MbIII absorbance, known amounts of DOX were added, and the spectrum of the anthracycline at 477 nm was recorded immediately. Next, H2O2 was added, and the disappearance of the spectrum of DOX was monitored at regular times. Similar settings were adopted when hemin was used in place of MbIII; in the latter case 10 mm stock solutions of hemin were prepared in 100 mm NaOH and diluted appropriately with 50 mm phosphate buffer to obtain 1 mm working solutions. Spectrophotometric Assays for DOX-dependent MbIV Reduction—In the experiments described in the preceding section, involving sequential additions of MbIII and DOX and H2O2, stepwise H2O2-dependent oxidation of MbIII to MbIV/FeIV=O and DOX-dependent reduction of MbIV/FeIV=O to MbIII were monitored at 426 or 410 nm, respectively (6Rao S.I. Wilks A. Hamberg M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments, MbIII was added, and its spectrum (peaks at 502 and 630 nm) was recorded. Next, H2O2 was added, and the spectrum of MbIV/FeIV=O (peaks at 546 and 586 nm) was taken at regular times until DOX was included. Doxorubicin-dependent MbIV/FeIV=O reduction and MbIII regeneration were eventually monitored as disappearance of peaks at 546 and 586 nm or reappearance of peaks at 502 and 630 nm, respectively. HPLC-UV-ESI(+) MS Analysis of DOX Degradation—Varying amounts of DOX were incubated with equimolar MbIII and a 2-fold excess of H2O2. After 10 min the reaction mixtures were added with catalase (2600 units) to decompose any residual H2O2 and ultrafiltered through YM 10 Centricon® (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Myoglobin-free ultrafiltrates were injected without further manipulations into a BioSys 510 Liquid Chromatography System (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a (1 × 20 cm) Ultrogel Ac34 column (BioSepra SA, Villeneuve la Garenne Cedex, France) equilibrated with 2.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CH3COONH4. Samples were eluted with the same medium at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. UV-absorbing fractions were pooled, passed through Anotop 25® filters (Merck), and concentrated by evaporation. After suspension in a minimum volume of CH3OH, the sample was laid into a Waters 2790 separation module (alliance HT) equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array and a ZMD single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) as detectors in series. Reversed phase HPLC was performed using a LiChrospher® (Merck) analytical column (100 RP-18 (5 μm), 150 × 4 mm) and a mobile phase composed of (H2O + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid):(CH3CN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at an initial ratio of 80:20, which was decreased to 30:70 in 15 min and returned to initial conditions in 20 min, at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After chromatography and photodiode array detection (210–600 nm), mass spectra were acquired at low (unity) resolution in series at a rate of 300 atomic mass unit/s in compressed centroid mode. Standard ESI ion source, operated in positive ion mode, was used with capillary voltage of 3.25 kV and cone voltage (C.V.) of 20 or 50 V to obtain mass spectra under low or high energy conditions. The source and desolvation temperatures were 100 and 200 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizer gas at a flow rate of 59 liters/h and as the desolvation gas at a flow rate of 430 liters/h. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Because HPLC-UV-ESI(+) MS identified 3-methoxyphthalic acid (molecular mass = 196 daltons) as a possible product of MbIV-dependent DOX degradation, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to further characterize DOX/MbIV ultrafiltrates in comparison with authentic 3-methoxyphthalic acid. Reversed phase HPLC was carried out using a Waters Alliance 2795 separation module and an Agilent Hypersil ODS® column (2.1 × 250 mm; C18 5 μm, 120 Å). Ten microliter samples were eluted at a flow rate of 200 μl/min with (H2O + 0.2% HCOOH) – (10% CH3CN + 0.2% HCOOH). After 2 min CH3CN was increased linearly to reach 70% in 6 min and was then maintained isocratically for 4 more min. The HPLC system was directly coupled with a Micromass Quattro Ultima™ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-Spray ESI source, operated in negative ion mode to improve sensitivity. Analytical conditions were optimized with direct infusion of standard solutions of 4.5 μm 3-methoxyphthalic acid, dissolved in H2O•CH3CN (50:50, v/v), 0.2% HCOOH, and eluted at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The product ion scan mode for tandem MS was used. The mass spectrometer monitored the deprotonated molecule [M – H]– of 3-methoxyphthalic acid at m/z 195 via the first quadrupole filter, and collision-induced dissociation was performed at the second quadrupole (collision gas, argon, at 2.4e-3 mbar, and collision energy at 8 eV). The daughters of m/z 195 were monitored via the third quadrupole in the mass range of 50 –300 atomic mass units. Spectra were acquired in the continuous mode. The capillary and cone voltages were set at –3 kV and –40 V, respectively. The source and desolvation temperatures were set at 110 and 400 °C, respectively, and the desolvation gas (N2) flow was set at 600 liters/h. Cone gas (N2) was not used, whereas the nebulizer gas (N2) was left at its maximum flow. Other HPLC Assays for Anthracyclines and Phthalates—Anthracycline/MbIII/H2O2 incubations were extracted with a 4-fold excess of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1) and subjected to 10 min of low speed centrifugation. Next, 20 μl of the methanolic phase were analyzed for 3-methoxyphthalic acid or simple phthalic acid by reversed phase HPLC using an HP 1100 system (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA). Chromatography was performed using a Hewlett-Packard Zorbax CN column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) operated at 25 °C. Samples were eluted at the flow rate of 1.5 ml/min by using a 15-min linear gradient from 50 mm NaH2PO4 to CH3CN, 25 mm NaH2PO4, all adjusted to pH 4.0 with orthophosphoric acid and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Millipore Corp.). Phthalates were detected at 300 nm by on-line diode array spectrometer. Identification was obtained by co-elution with authentic standards and ESI(+)-MS analysis of peak fractions; quantification was obtained against standard curves prepared with known amounts of phthalates subjected to the same extraction and chromatographic procedures. Retention times of 3-methoxyphthalic acid or simple phthalic acid were 4.1 and 4.7 min, respectively. Anthracyclines were detected by diode array and fluorescence spectroscopy (excitation at 470 nm, emission at 550 nm); retention times of DOX, DNR, IDA, and naphthazarin were 12.1, 13.8, 14.3, or 14.5 min, respectively. Quantification was obtained against appropriate standard curves of each anthracycline. 3-Methoxyphthalic Acid Formation in DOX-treated Mice—Two- to three-month-old male Balb/c mice, weighing 20–30 g, were treated with DOX (10 mg/kg, intravenously) and sacrificed after 4 or 24 h. Heart, liver, and kidneys were removed, and 0.2-g aliquots were homogenized in ice-cold 0.3 m NaCl. Next, the homogenates were added with 5 ml of ice-cold acetone, incubated at –20 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged to precipitate proteins. The supernatants were vacuum-dried, cleared of gross particulates by low speed centrifugation in CH3OH, and assayed for DOX and 3-methoxyphthalic acid by HPLC. Fluorescent anthracycline metabolites, like the C-13 secondary alcohol metabolite and hydroxy- or deoxyaglycones, were also measured using appropriate standards (retention times: 10.9, 12.5, and 13.8 min, respectively). 3-Methoxyphthalic Acid Formation in Human Myocardium—Small myocardial samples were taken from the lateral aspect of excluded right atrium of patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass grafting. All specimens were routinely disposed of by the surgeons during cannulation procedures; therefore, patients were not subjected to any unjustified or ethically unacceptable loss of tissue (22Minotti G. Saponiero A. Licata S. Menna P. Calafiore A.M. Teodori G. Gianni L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1511-1515PubMed Google Scholar). Thin myocardial strips (∼0.1 g) were dissected and placed in 5 ml of Krebs bicarbonate buffer in the presence of 1–10 μm DOX. After 4 h at 37 °C the strips were removed, washed extensively in ice-cold 0.3 m NaCl, and extracted for HPLC analysis of DOX and fluorescent metabolites or 3-methoxyphthalic acid as described in the preceding section. In other experiments, pools of 10–15 anonymous biopsies were processed by sequential homogenization, 20-min centrifugations at 16,000 and 25,000 × g, and 90-min ultracentrifugation at 105,000 × g. The supernatant (cytosol) was used immediately or after precipitation with 65% ammonium sulfate, a procedure known to remove Mb by “salting out” (4Gunther M.R. Sampath V. Caughey W.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Giampietro R. Liberi G. Teodori G. Calafiore A.M. Minotti G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mb-containing or Mb-depleted cytosol (referred to as Mb+ or Mb– cytosol, respectively) was eventually dialyzed against two 1-liter changes of 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA to remove adventitious iron and other low molecular weight contaminants, and then against two 1-liter changes of 0.3 m NaCl to remove EDTA-iron complexes (23Minotti G. Cavaliere A.F. Mordente A. Rossi M. Schiavello R. Zamparelli R. Possati G.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1595-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Based on nephelometric and spectral assays by us and others (24Swaanenburg J.C. Visser-VanBrummen P.J. DeJongste M.J. Tiebosch A.T. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2001; 115: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the myoglobin content of right atrium homogenates and Mb+ or Mb– cytosol was determined to be 1.3 and 2.9 or 0.6 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. Whole homogenates and Mb+ or Mb– cytosol were eventually reconstituted with known amounts of DOX and H2O2 and assayed for anthracycline degradation and 3-methoxyphthalic acid formation by HPLC. Experiments with Isolated Cardiomyocytes—The embryonic rat heart-derived cell line H9c2 (American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1446)) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (25Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells were seeded in quadruplicate in 24-well plates (∼105 cells/well) and incubated overnight in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of DOX or 3-methoxyphthalic acid. At the end of treatment, cell viability was measured by 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) conversion assay as an indicator of mitochondrial function (Sigma kit) (26Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46517) Google Scholar) Other Conditions and Assays—Proteins were assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method (27Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The peroxidative activity of HRP, LPO, MbIII and hemin was determined by monitoring oxidation of ABTS to its cation radical ABTS•+ (ϵ660 nm = 12 × 103m–1 cm–1) (16Reszka K.J. McCormick M.L. Britigan B.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15349-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All values are given as means ± S.E.; where indicated, data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test, and differences were considered significant when p was < 0.05. Other conditions are indicated in the legends to figures and tables. MbIV-dependent DOX Degradation, Role of Compound I and II—Incubation of DOX with H2O2 and MbIII resulted in a time-dependent decay of the spectrum of the anthracycline and concomitant development of absorbance at 350 nm (Fig. 2A). These spectral changes were similar to those observed by others when monitoring reactions of DOX with H2O2 and HRP or lactoperoxidase (16Reszka K.J. McCormick M.L. Britigan B.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15349-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); under those conditions the loss of absorbance at 477 nm was attributed to degradation of the anthraquinone chromophore, whereas the increase of absorbance at 350 nm was attributed to accumulation of degradation product(s). In our study putative product(s) of anthracycline degradation were found to exhibit more complex characteristics. In fact, difference spectra obtained by subtracting the initial scan of DOX/MbIII mixtures to the scans obtained at regular times after H2O2 addition revealed that the increase in absorbance at 350 nm was accompanied by additional peaks at ∼210, 242, and 280 nm, possibly reflecting the formation and spectral overlapping of a complex mixture of degradation products (Fig. 2B). Doxorubicin degradation increased with the ratio of MbIV to DOX, near-to-complete degradation occurring at MbIV:DOX ratios around unity (Fig. 2C). MbIV was less effective than HRP or LPO at oxidizing a typical peroxidatic substrate like ABTS, its kcat/km for formation of ABTS•+ being ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than that determined for either peroxidase (1.8 ± 0.2 × 103 for MbIVversus 7 ± 0.4 × 105 or 1.1 ± 0.3 × 105m–1 s–1, respectively; n = 3). However, MbIV was more effective than HRP or LPO at degrading DOX, its kcat/km for DOX disappearance being ∼1 order of magnitude higher than that determined for either peroxidase (1.1 ± 0.2 × 103versus 0.9 ± 0.1 × 102 or 3 ± 0.2 × 102m–1 s–1, respectively; n = 3). Thus, a pseudoperoxidase like MbIV was more effective than authentic peroxidases at inducing oxidative degradation of DOX. Incubation of DOX with H2O2 and MbIII was also accompanied by appearance of peaks at 426 and 410 nm. The peak at 426 nm developed immediately after the addition of H2O2; it reflected oxidation of MbIII with H2O2 and consequent formation of FeIV=O (6Rao S.I. Wilks A. Hamberg M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peak at 410 nm developed later during the course of the reaction and eventually replaced the peak at 426 nm; it reflected reduction of FeIV=O back to MbIII (6Rao S.I. Wilks A. Hamberg M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that DOX degraded by oxidizing with FeIV=O/compound II, but the kinetics of DOX degradation did not match the kinetics of FeIV=O reduction/MbIII regeneration. In fact, the absorbance of DOX at 477 nm decreased immediately after mixing MbIII with H2O2 and dropped to ∼60% its initial level in ∼4 min, i.e. the time when FeIV=O was at its maximum detectable level (Fig. 3, A and B). Based upon these findings, we characterized whether DOX degradation was initiated by a compound I involving FeIV=O and a porphyrin radical. To obtain this information, we incubated DOX with H2O2/hemin, an established source of FeIV=O/porphyrin radical (28Van der Zee J. Barr D.P. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed that hemin was less effective than equimolar MbIII at catalyzing ABTS oxidation in the presence of H2O2, even when H2O2:hemin ratios were much higher than H2O2:MbIII ratios (units of peroxidative activities (nmol ABTS•+/nmol heme/min): 0.02 for 20:1 H2O2-hemin versus 0.4 for 2:1 H2O2-MbIII). Despite its reduced peroxidative activity, hemin/H2O2 was quite effective at degrading DOX, giving the same spectral changes obtained with MbIII/H2O2 (loss of absorbance at 477 and formation of multiple peaks at ∼210, 242, 280, and 350 nm; Fig. 4A and inset). Doxorubicin degradation actually occurred much faster with hemin-H2O2 than with MbIII-H2O2. This was observed when DOX was incubated with equimolar MbIII or hemin, and anthracycline degradation was normalized to peroxidative activities (Fig. 4B). It was also observed when the concentrations of H2O2 and MbIII or hemin were adjusted to achieve similar peroxidative activities in the incubations (Fig. 4C). The anthracycline-degrading activity of hemin/H2O2 could not be attributed to a denaturation of the heme pocket and consequent release of redox-active iron due to the high H2O2:hemin ratios used in this study; in fact, DOX underwent degradation also in the presence of EDTA (cf.Fig. 4, B and C).

We have calculated a three-dimensional reconstruction of EV12 bound to a fragment of DAF consisting of short consensus repeat domains 3 and 4 from cryo-negative stain electron microscopy data (EMD code 1057). This shows that, as for an earlier reconstruction of the related echovirus type 7 bound to DAF, attachment is not within the viral canyon but occurs close to the 2-fold symmetry axes. Despite this general similarity our reconstruction reveals a receptor interaction that is quite different from that observed for EV7. Fitting of the crystallographic co-ordinates for DAF34 and EV11 into the reconstruction shows a close agreement between the crystal structure of the receptor fragment and the density for the virus-bound receptor, allowing unambiguous positioning of the receptor with respect to the virion (PDB code 1UPN). Our finding that the mode of virus-receptor interaction in EV12 is distinct from that seen for EV7 raises interesting questions regarding the evolution and biological significance of the DAF binding phenotype in these viruses.

Echoviruses along with the coxsackieviruses and polioviruses comprise the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. Echovirus infection is usually mild, although these viruses are sometimes associated with severe disease such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and myocarditis. The Picornaviridae family also includes a number of other important human and animal pathogens including rhinoviruses and foot and mouth disease virus. Picornaviruses are small (∼300 Å in diameter), non-enveloped icosahedral viruses that have a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of between 7.0 and 8.5 kilobases. The genome encodes a single polyprotein, which is co- and post-translationally processed by viral proteases to yield the capsid and non-structural proteins required for virus replication. The capsid assembles as a pseudo T = 3 icosahedral shell from four protein species, VP1-VP4. VP1-3 occupy the three quasi-equivalent positions in the icosahedral lattice, whereas VP4 is located at the inner surface of the capsid (1Hogle J.M. Chow M. Filman D.J. Science. 1985; 229: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The rhinoviruses and enteroviruses share a common and distinctive morphology consisting of a raised, star-shaped platform at the pentameric apices of the capsid. Surrounding this is a narrow cleft, termed the “canyon” (2Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. Erickson J.W. Frankenberger E.A. Griffith J.P. Hecht H.J. Johnson J.E. Kamer G. Luo M. Mosser A.G. Rueckert R.R. Sherry B. Vriend G. Nature. 1985; 317: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). For many picornaviruses (the polioviruses, the major receptor group rhinoviruses, Coxsackie A virus type 21. and Coxsackie B virus type 3) it has been shown that the interaction with their cellular receptors (all of which are members of the Ig-superfamily of proteins) occurs in the canyon (3He Y.N.

Binding of these viruses to soluble monomeric receptor protein in vitro triggers an irreversible conformational change in the virus particle that manifests as a change in the sedimentation characteristics of the virus (from the 160 S mature virion to the 135 S A-particle) (8Hoover-Litty H. Greve J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 390-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar changes in sedimentation coefficient are seen when the virus interacts with the receptor at the cell surface, and such transformations are thought to be essential for successful entry and infection (9Fenwick M.L. Cooper P.D. Virology. 1962; 18: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Guttman N. Baltimore D. Virology. 1977; 82: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structural rearrangements that lead to this change in sedimentation include loss of VP4 and externalization of the N terminus of VP1, which is normally located at the inner surface of the capsid surrounding the pentameric apices in the mature virion. The extruded terminus of VP1, which is hydrophobic, becomes membrane-associated and is thought to form a pore through which the genome enters the cell cytoplasm (11Fricks C.E. Hogle J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1934-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the Rhinovirus and Enterovirus genera other types of receptor interactions have also been identified. The minor receptor group rhinoviruses, for example, bind the very low density lipoprotein receptor (12Hofer F. Gruenberger M. Kowalski H. Machat H. Huettinger M. Kuechler E. Blass D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This interaction does not lead to the irreversible conformational changes outlined above, and recent studies demonstrate that this receptor binds to the virion around the 5-fold symmetry axes, not in the canyon (13Hewat E.A. Neumann E. Conway J.F. Moser R. Ronacher B. Marlovits T.C. Blaas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6317-6325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of virus uncoating upon receptor binding suggests the existence of another, as yet unknown receptor or co-factor that induces uncoating. Many enteroviruses have been shown to bind decay-accelerating factor (DAF 1The abbreviations used are: DAF, decay-accelerating factor; SCR, short consensus repeat; EV, echovirus; ENV, enterovirus. ; CD55), a member of the regulator of complement activity protein family (14Bergelson J.M.

DAF is a 70-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein, present on the surface of the majority of serum-exposed cells, which functions to protect them from complement-mediated lysis by accelerating the decay of both the classical and alternative pathway C3 and C5 convertases. The regulator of complement activity protein family are defined by the presence of one or more short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, each of about 60 residues. DAF has four such domains, and these are linked to the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor by a heavily O-glycosylated serine/threonine/proline-rich region (19Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 35-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Complement control, Enterovirus binding, and other known interactions, including binding of the cellular ligand CD97 and bacterial adhesins, only involve the SCR domains (14Bergelson J.M. Chan M.

Immun. 1995; 63: 1663-1668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the DAF binding enteroviruses there is a range of different interactions. Coxsackie A virus type 21 (CV-A21) and Enterovirus type 70 (ENV70) bind the membrane-distal domain SCR 1 (15Karnauchow T.M. Tolson D.L. Harrison B.A. Altman E. Lublin D.M. Dimock K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5143-5152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shafren D.R. Dorahy D.J. Ingham R.A. Burns G.F. Barry R.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4736-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the DAF -binding echoviruses all interact with SCR 3, with additional binding to SCR 2 and/or SCR 4 (16Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Enterovirus binding to soluble monomeric DAF does not, however, lead to the conformational changes normally associated with uncoating that these viruses are observed to undergo at the cell surface (25Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The status of DAF as a sole cellular receptor has, therefore, been subject to question. Although other molecules have been implicated in cell binding and entry by DAF binding enteroviruses (26Spiller O.B. Goodfellow I.G. Evans D.J. Hinchliffe S.J. Morgan B.P. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Goodfellow I.G. Powell R.M. Ward T. Spiller O.B. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen.

Virol. 2001; 75: 4918-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), candidates that induce irreversible conformational changes in the virion have yet to be identified. Structural analysis of variants of echovirus type 11 that exhibit different cell tropism has, however, provided evidence for an as yet undiscovered canyon binding receptor while implicating a number of residues in the binding interaction with DAF both around the 5-fold symmetry axis and in the EF loop of VP2 (29Stuart A.D. McKee T.A. Williams P.A. Harley C. Shen S. Stuart D.I. Brown T.D.K. Lea S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7694-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The recent analysis of DAF binding in echovirus type 7 by cryomicroscopy and image reconstruction has shown that DAF does not bind in the canyon; rather, it binds to the hyper-variable region of VP2 just outside of the “south” rim of the canyon and also to another hyper-variable region of VP3 (30He Y.N. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In related viruses these regions have been shown to be antigenic and capable of eliciting a neutralizing antibody response, suggesting that the paradigm of segregation of receptor binding regions from those parts of the capsid surface subject to immune surveillance is not strictly adhered to in the enteroviruses. Similarly, receptor binding to hyper-variable epitopes has been demonstrated for the minor group rhinoviruses and foot and mouth disease virus. In these viruses a strategy is employed whereby conserved receptor binding domains are embedded in hyper-variable regions capable of mutation to escape the host immune response (13Hewat E.A. Neumann E. Conway J.F. Moser R. Ronacher B. Marlovits T.C. Blaas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6317-6325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Acharya R. Fry E. Stuart D. Fox G. Rowlands D. Brown F. Nature. 1989; 337: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In the EV7-receptor complex, bound DAF is located close to and lies across the 2-fold symmetry axes such that symmetry-related molecules are in steric collision (30He Y.N. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This complicates the interpretation of this reconstruction in terms of the known atomic structures for DAF (32Williams P. Chaudhry Y. Goodfellow I.G. Billington J. Powell R. Spiller O.B. Evans D.J.

There are, however, substantial data regarding specific residues both on the virus capsid and in the SCR 3 and 4 domains of DAF that are involved in receptor binding in the echoviruses (29Stuart A.D. McKee T.A. Williams P.A. Harley C. Shen S. Stuart D.I. Brown T.D.K. Lea S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7694-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Williams P. Chaudhry Y. Goodfellow I.G.

Echovirus type 12 (EV12) exhibits a distinct interaction with DAF, which predominantly involves SCR domains 3 and 4, a feature shared only with echovirus type 29 (16Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A recent mutagenic analysis of DAF structure and function demonstrated that EV12 binding involves a different face of the receptor than that bound by other echoviruses (32Williams P. Chaudhry Y. Goodfellow I.G. Billington J. Powell R. Spiller O.B. Evans D.J. Lea S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10691-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, conducted a structural investigation of the virus-receptor complex and present here a reconstruction of echovirus type 12 bound to SCR domains 3 and 4 of DAF, determined to 16-Å resolution by cryo-negative stain transmission electron microscopy and image reconstruction. Similarly to echovirus type 7, DAF binds to this virus outside the south rim of the canyon close to (but not over) the 2-fold symmetry axes. The distribution of density in our reconstruction is quite different, however, supporting the previous findings that there are at least three distinct virus-DAF interactions within the enteroviruses. By labeling the virus with only two domains of DAF we have been able to determine an unambiguous density for the receptor that is consistent with the crystallographic co-ordinates for DAF34. Docking of these data into the reconstructed protein envelope reveals that DAF binds to EV12 mainly via interactions between SCR 3 and VP2. The orientation determined for the DAF34 fragment allows us to superimpose the crystallographic data from a DAF fragment comprising all four SCR domains (DAF1234) onto our model. We find that 60 copies of this protein may be modeled onto the surface of the EV12 capsid without any significant molecular clashes between symmetry-related molecules or the virion itself. This further highlights the differences between the complex seen here and that seen in the earlier investigation of the EV7-DAF interaction. Virus and DAF34Preparation—Echovirus type 12 was routinely passaged in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Ten 1750-cm2 roller bottles (Corning Glass) of confluent rhabdomyosarcoma cells were infected with EV12 at high multiplicity (5 or higher), and the infection was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell-associated virus was released by 2 cycles of freeze thawing, and the resultant supernatant was clarified by low speed centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min) and filtered (0.2 μm) to remove particulates. Sodium chloride was added to a final concentration of 2.3% (w/v) followed by 7% polyethylene glycol 8000, and the preparation was stirred at 4 °C overnight. The precipitated virus was collected by centrifugation (5000 × g for 30 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using an 18-gauge needle and syringe. Large particulate material was removed by low speed centrifugation, and the remaining virus was pelleted through a 30% sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 6 h (TH641, Sorval) and resuspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using an 18-gauge needle and syringe. The partially purified virus was subsequently layered onto a 10-25% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h (TH641, Sorval); 160 S virus was extracted from the gradient and pelleted by centrifugation for 6 h at 40,000 rpm (TLS 55). Purified virus was resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and stored at -20 °C. The purity of the virus preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The two SCR domain fragment of decay-accelerating factor (DAF34) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as previously described (25Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Powell R.M. Schmitt V. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—EV12 preparations were labeled with DAF34 by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Unlabeled and labeled virus was then prepared for electron microscopy using the cryo-negative stain technique (36Adrian M. Dubochet J. Fuller S.D. Harris J.R. Micron. 1998; 29: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In brief, a 5-μl droplet of virus or labeled virus was loaded onto a freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil holey carbon support film (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany) for 30 s. Grids were then transferred to a droplet of ∼20% (w/v) ammonium molybdate solution (pH 7.4) for 10 s. Finally, grids were blotted and plunged into liquid nitrogen-cooled ethane slush. Vitrified virus preparations were then imaged in a JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope equipped with an Oxford instruments cryo-transfer stage. Focal-pair images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 30,000× and defocus of between 300 and 2,000 nm on Kodak SO-163 film under low electron dose conditions. Image Reconstruction—In total 14 focal pairs of unlabeled EV12 and 8 focal pairs of DAF34-labeled EV12 were selected for processing. Micrographs were digitized on a Dunvegan Hi-Scan drum scanner (Dunvegan SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) at a raster step size corresponding to 3.4 Å/pixel in the specimen. Particles were selected from each pair of micrographs using the program X3d, and deconvolution of the contrast transfer function was accomplished using the CTFMIX program, at which point the focal pairs were merged (37Conway J.F. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Orientations and origins were determined for the unlabeled EV12 data set using the polar Fourier transform method (PFT) (38Baker T.S. Cheng R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) using a starting model that was generated from the crystal structure of echovirus type 1 (39Filman D.J. Wien M.W. Cunningham J.A. Bergelson J.M. Hogle J.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the EMAN PDB2MRC program (40Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Subsequent iterations of three-dimensional reconstruction (41Crowther R.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1971; 261: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and polar Fourier transform refinement led to the calculation of a 20-Å resolution reconstruction that was used to determine initial origins and orientations for the DAF34 labeled data set. In both cases origins and orientations were further refined until they ceased changing significantly. Final reconstructions were calculated to 14 Å, and in both cases all inverse eigenvalues were less than 0.01, indicating that the data adequately filled reciprocal space to this resolution. Final resolutions for each reconstruction were estimated by randomly dividing the data sets into two subsets and calculating independent reconstructions, for which a number of measures of agreement were calculated, including the Fourier-shell correlation and the spectral signal to noise ratio. Reconstructions were deposited in the EM data bank (accession numbers are EMD 1057 for the DAF34-labeled virus and EMD 1058 for the unlabeled virus). Isosurfaces calculated from three-dimensional reconstructions were visualized in Iris Explorer (Numerical Algorithms Group, Oxford, UK) using a radial depth cueing module (42Dougherty M. Chiu W. Microsc. Microanal. 2000; 6: 282-283Crossref Google Scholar). To draw a direct comparison between our reconstructions and the previously determined model for EV7 bound to DAF1234, a density map was calculated at 14-Å resolution using the EMAN PDB2MRC program from the deposited co-ordinates of He et al. (30He Y.N. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1M11). Fitting of the EV11 and DAF34Crystal Structures to the Cryo-negative Stain Reconstruction—Visual inspection of an EV11 virus model (PDB code 1H8T) overlapped with the EV12-DAF34 density map confirmed the correctness of the original hand assignment for the reconstruction. The reconstructed volume was then placed at the origin of a cubic cell with a cell edge a = 599.375 Å, oriented so that its 3- and 2-fold axes coincided with the symmetry axes through the origin of space group P23, and was rendered periodic with P23 symmetry. The x-ray model for a pentameric asymmetric unit of EV11 was oriented and placed around the origin in the same cell. The overall correlation coefficients in real space between the experimental and model density was 0.76. The x-ray model for DAF domains 3 and 4 (PDB code 1H03) with all B factors set to 95 was manually placed in the EM density in an initial orientation with domain 3 closer to the virus (placement A). A second placement of the model was also generated by rotating the first so as to swap the positions of domains 3 and 4 (placement B). Alternative orientations of both placements A and B were sampled by rotation of each model around its major axis (defined by the midpoints of the 4 disulfide bonds) in steps of 30 degrees. Fig. 3 shows the real space correlation coefficients for the main chain atoms in each of the rotated models. Placement A in its original orientation gave the best correlation coefficients, suggesting that both the domain assignment and the DAF34 face assignments are correct. Maximum-likelihood rigid body refinement of the domain 4 model (residues 189-251) targeting the phases computed from the reconstruction (program CNS (43Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The Cα-Cα distance for the domain 3-4 junction is only 0.5 Å away from the distance given by ideal geometry, a reasonable level of accuracy for a fit at 16-Å resolution. DAF1234 was overlaid on the membrane-proximal fragment using the CCP4 program LSQkab (44Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2358) Google Scholar, 45Bailey S.

Cryo-negative Stain Imaging and Three-dimensional Reconstruction of EV12 Labeled with DAF34—The cryo-negative stain approach yielded high contrast images of virus preparations in a frozen hydrated state (Fig. 1). Analysis of the incoherently averaged power spectra, calculated from particle images cut from focal pair micrographs, showed that Thon rings were clearly visible out to 10 Å in these data. In total, 720 focal pair images of unlabeled EV12 virions and 1590 paired images of DAF34-labeled EV12 were corrected for the effects of the microscope contrast transfer function and processed to calculate three-dimensional image reconstructions. Final reconstructions were calculated from 617 unlabeled particle images and 903 DAF34-labeled images (Fig. 2). The resolutions of these reconstructions were determined to be 18 and 16 Å, respectively.Fig. 2Stereo pairs of surface rendered three-dimensional reconstructions of unlabeled EV12 virions (A) and DAF34-labeled virions (B). Isosurfaces of these reconstructions are merged and rendered in their respective color schemes to highlight the differences in density attributed to the two SCR domain fragment of DAF (C). A low resolution representation of EV7 bound to DAF1234, derived from PDB code 1M11 (30He Y.N. Lin F. Chipman P.R. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Shoham M. Kuhn R.J. Medof M.E. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), highlights the differently oriented densities in these two complexes (D). In this model the densities of two copies of DAF1234 are superimposed, laying across the virion 2-fold symmetry axes, giving rise to a hybrid density representing the two possible positions for the molecule. A radial depth-cue color scheme is used to indicate distance from the center of the virion (see the key).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reconstruction of the DAF34-bound virion has clear regions of contiguous density decorating the exterior of the capsid that can be attributed to the DAF fragment. This density is linear in appearance and consists of two readily defined domains. The density attributed to the DAF34 molecule is much weaker than that of the capsid itself, suggesting a low level of receptor occupancy. A low density threshold setting approximately equal to the average density of the reconstructed volume was, therefore, necessary to calculate an isosurface that encompassed the correct molecular volume for the DAF component of this reconstruction. Fortunately the high contrast in the reconstruction, brought about by the use of the cryo-negative stain technique, prevented the expansion of the virion density or incorporation of noise in the final representation of the volume. The apparent low occupancy in the virus-receptor complex is consistent with biochemical data and previously published reconstructions (16Powell R.M. Ward T. Goodfellow I. Almond J.W. Evans D.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W1997223485,"The UvsY recombination mediator protein is critical for homologous recombination in bacteriophage T4. UvsY uses both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to mediate the assembly of the T4 UvsX recombinase onto single-stranded (ss) DNA, forming presynaptic filaments that initiate DNA strand exchange. UvsY helps UvsX compete with Gp32, the T4 ssDNA-binding protein, for binding sites on ssDNA, in part by destabilizing Gp32-ssDNA interactions, and in part by stabilizing UvsX-ssDNA interactions. The relative contributions of UvsY-ssDNA, UvsY-Gp32, UvsY-UvsX, and UvsY-UvsY interactions to these processes are only partially understood. The goal of this study was to isolate mutant forms of UvsY protein that are specifically defective in UvsY-ssDNA interactions, so that the contribution of this activity to recombination processes could be assessed independent of other factors. A conserved motif of UvsY found in other DNA-binding proteins was targeted for mutagenesis. Two missense mutants of UvsY were isolated in which ssDNA binding activity is compromised. These mutants retain self-association activity, and form stable associations with UvsX and Gp32 proteins in patterns similar to wild-type UvsY. Both mutants are partially, but not totally, defective in stimulating UvsX-catalyzed recombination functions including ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange. The data are consistent with a model in which UvsY plays bipartite roles in presynaptic filament assembly. Its protein-ssDNA interactions are suggested to moderate the destabilization of Gp32-ssDNA, whereas its protein-protein contacts induce a conformational change of the UvsX protein, giving UvsX a higher affinity for the ssDNA and allowing it to compete more effectively with Gp32 for binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2008470773,"PI-SceI, a homing endonuclease of the LAGLIDADG family, consists of two domains involved in DNA cleavage and protein splicing, respectively. Both domains cooperate in binding the recognition sequence. Comparison of the structures of PI-SceI in the absence and presence of substrate reveals major conformational changes in both the protein and DNA. Notably, in the protein-splicing domain the loop comprising residues 53-70 and adopts a closed conformation, thus enabling it to interact with the DNA. We have studied the dynamics of DNA binding and subsequent loop movement by fluorescence techniques. Six amino acids in loop53-70 were individually replaced by cysteine and modified by fluorescein. The interaction of the modified PI-SceI variants with the substrate, unlabeled or labeled with tetramethylrhodamine, was analyzed in equilibrium and stopped-flow experiments. A kinetic scheme was established describing the interaction between PI-SceI and DNA. It is noteworthy that the apparent hinge-flap motion of loop53-70 is only observed in the presence of a divalent metal ion cofactor. Substitution of the major Mg2+-binding ligands in PI-SceI, Asp-218 and Asp-326, by Asn or nicking PI-SceI with trypsin at Arg-277, which interferes with formation of an active enzyme.substrate complex, both prevent the conformational change of loop53-70. Deletion of the loop inactivates the enzyme. We conclude that loop53-70 is an important structural element that couples DNA recognition by the splicing domain with DNA cleavage by the catalytic domain and as such communicates with the Mg2+ binding sites at the catalytic centers."
