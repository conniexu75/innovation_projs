https://openalex.org/W1979618971,"DNA from 61 unrelated patients with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was examined for mutations in three genes (DP1, SRP19, and DP2.5) located within a 100 kb region deleted in two of the patients. The intron-exon boundary sequences were defined for each of these genes, and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons from DP2.5 identified four mutations specific to APC patients. Each of two aberrant alleles contained a base substitution changing an amino acid to a stop codon in the predicted peptide; the other mutations were small deletions leading to frameshifts. Analysis of DNA from parents of one of these patients showed that his 2 bp deletion is a new mutation; furthermore, the mutation was transmitted to two of his children. These data have established that DP2.5 is the APC gene."
https://openalex.org/W1975993620,"Previous studies suggested that one or more genes on chromosome 5q21 are responsible for the inheritance of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome (GS), and contribute to tumor development in patients with noninherited forms of colorectal cancer. Two genes on 5q21 that are tightly linked to FAP (MCC and APC) were found to be somatically altered in tumors from sporadic colorectal cancer patients. One of the genes (APC) was also found to be altered by point mutation in the germ line of FAP and GS patients. These data suggest that more than one gene on chromosome 5q21 may contribute to colorectal neoplasia, and that mutations of the APC gene can cause both FAP and GS. The identification of these genes should aid in understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia and in the diagnosis and counseling of patients with inherited predispositions to colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1973916918,"We have investigated the feedback control that prevents cells with incompletely assembled spindles from leaving mitosis. We isolated budding yeast mutants sensitive to the anti-microtubule drug benomyl. Mitotic arrest-deficient (mad) mutants are the subclass of benomyl-sensitive mutants in which the completion of mitosis is not delayed in the presence of benomyl and that die as a consequence of their premature exit from mitosis. A number of properties of the mad mutants indicate that they are defective in the feedback control over the exit from mitosis: their killing by benomyl requires passage through mitosis; their benomyl sensitivity can be suppressed by an independent method for delaying the exit from mitosis; they have normal microtubules; and they have increased frequencies of chromosome loss. We cloned MAD2, which encodes a putative calcium-binding protein whose disruption is lethal. We discuss the role of feedback controls in coordinating events in the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1963750681,"We have identified mutant strains of S. cerevisiae that fail to properly arrest their cell cycles at mitosis in response to the loss of microtubule function. New bud emergence and DNA replication (but not cytokinesis) occur with high efficiency in the mutants under conditions that inhibit these events in wild-type cells. The inability to halt cell cycle progression is specific for impaired microtubule function; the mutants respond normally to other cell cycle-blocking treatments. Under microtubule-disrupting conditions, the mutants neither achieve nor maintain the high level of histone H1 kinase activity characteristic of wild-type cells. Our studies have defined three genes required for normal cell cycle arrest. These findings are consistent with the existence of a surveillance system that halts the cell cycle in response to microtubule perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2088028188,"Mutations of the lethal(1)discs large-1 (dlg) tumor suppressor gene of Drosophila cause neoplastic overgrowth of the imaginal discs. Sequencing of a near full-length cDNA predicts a protein containing a domain homologous to yeast guanylate kinase and a region homologous to SH3, a putative regulatory motif in nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases and other signal transduction proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against fusion peptides shows that the dlg gene product is localized in an apical belt of the lateral cell membrane, at the position of the septate junction. The results suggest that a signal transduction process involving guanine nucleotides occurs at the septate junction and is necessary for cell proliferation control in Drosophila epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1987269203,"The vitamin A derivative retinoic acid exerts its effects on transcription through two distinct classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). We provide evidence that expression of the gene for cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII), a key protein in the intestinal absorption of vitamin A, is dramatically up-regulated by retinoic acid in the presence of RXR but not RAR. This regulation is conferred through a specific cis element in the CRBPII promoter that contains five nearly perfect tandem repeats of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by a single nucleotide. The discovery of this new RX response element provides a means for distinguishing between the two retinoid receptor systems and suggests that an RXR-mediated pathway exists for modulating vitamin A metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2014364643,"THE Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is an auto-somal dominant disorder affecting limb and craniofacial development in humans1,2. GCPS-affected individuals are characterized by postaxial polysyndactyly of hands, preaxial polysyndactyly of feet, macroephaly, a broad base of the nose with mild hypertelorism and a prominent forehead. The genetic locus has been pinpointed to chromosome 7pl3 by three balanced translocations associated with GCPS in different families3,4,19. This assignment is corroborated by the detection of two sporadic GCPS cases carrying overlapping deletions in 7pl3 (ref. 7), as well as by tight linkage of GCPS to the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in 7pl2–13 (ref. 8). Of the genes that map to this region, those encoding T cell receptor-γ, interferon-β2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and Hox1.4, a potential candidate gene for GCPS, have been excluded from the region in which the deletions overlap7,9. Here we show that two of the three translocations interrup the GLI3 gene, a zinc-finger gene of the GLI-Krüppel family already localized to 7pl3 (refs 5, 6). The breakpoints are within the first third of the coding sequence. In the third translocation, chromosome 7 is broken at about 10 kilobases downstream of the 3' end of GLI3. Our results indicate that mutations disturbing normal GLI3 expression may have a causative role in GCPS."
https://openalex.org/W1504158642,"A growth factor-stimulated (MAP2-related) protein kinase, ERT, that phosphorylates the epidermal growth factor receptor at Thr669 has been purified from KB human tumor cells by Northwood and co-workers (Northwood, I. C., Gonzalez, F. A., Wartmann, M., Raden, D. L., and Davis, R. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15266-15276). The ERT protein kinase has a restricted substrate specificity, and the structural determinants employed for substrate recognition by this enzyme have not been defined. As an approach toward understanding the specificity of substrate phosphorylation, we have used an in vitro assay to identify additional substrates for the ERT protein kinase. In this report we describe two novel substrates: (a) the human c-myc protein at Ser62 and (b) the rat c-jun protein at Ser246. Alignment of the primary sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites located within the epidermal growth factor receptor (Thr669), Myc (Ser62), and Jun (Ser246) demonstrated a marked similarity. The observed consensus sequence was Pro-Leu-Ser/Thr-Pro. We propose that this sequence forms part of a substrate structure that is recognized by the ERT protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2148571591,"Overlapping genomic clones containing the entire sequence of the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene were isolated from a lamda phage human DNA library. This gene spans 21 kilobases (kb) and comprises 26 exons, ranging in size from 88 to 481 base pairs. Intron-exon boundaries were sequenced and the relative positions of the exons were mapped. The two different mRNAs transcribed from the ACE gene were assigned to their respective exons. The large endothelial type ACE mRNA (4.3 kb long) is transcribed from exon 1 to exon 26, excluding exon 13. The 3-kb long testicular ACE mRNA is transcribed from exon 13 to exon 26. Exon 13 encodes for the 67 amino acids of the NH2-terminal region of the testicular ACE, whereas downstream exons encode a sequence common to both isozymes. The gene duplication suggested by the internal homology of the endothelial ACE mRNA is now confirmed by the presence of two homologous clusters of eight exons (exons 4-11 and exons 17-24) having similar sizes and codon phases at exon-intron boundaries. The presence of two alternate promoters was investigated by ribonuclease protection assays. The different 5‘ ends of the two ACE transcripts revealed a promoter for the endothelial ACE mRNA in the 5‘-flanking region of the first exon and a promoter for the testicular ACE mRNA situated in intron 12."
https://openalex.org/W1524183923,"Differentiation of muscle cells to form postmitotic myotubes is usually viewed as being negatively controlled by medium components, sometimes designated mitogens. However, we have found that a family of mitogenic agents, the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), are potent stimulators of in myoblasts which act by inducing expression of the myogenin gene. We show here that this action of the IGFs occurs even when these growth factors are not added to the cell medium; upon transfer to low-serum differentiation medium, myoblasts begin active expression of the IGF-II gene, at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, autocrine secretion of IGF-II is essential for the process of terminal of the cells. These conclusions are based upon four lines of evidence. (1) The rate of spontaneous in several sublines of myogenic cells correlates with their level of expression of IGF-II. (2) C2 and Sol 8 cells, which secrete high levels of IGF-II, are relatively insensitive to exogenous IGFs, in contrast to L6 lines, which exhibit lower levels of IGF-II gene expression. (3) An antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to the first five codons of IGF-II inhibits myogenic in the absence but not in the presence of exogenous IGF-II. (4) Spontaneous in response to autocrine IGF-II involves the same mechanism that occurs in cells stimulated by the IGFs, i.e. elevation of expression of the myogenin gene."

https://openalex.org/W1550703182,"A growth factor-stimulated protein kinase activity that phosphorylates the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor at Thr669 has been described (Countaway, J. L., Northwood, I. C., and Davis, R. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10828-10835). Anion-exchange chromatography demonstrated that this protein kinase activity was accounted for by two enzymes. The first peak of activity eluted from the column corresponded to the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) kinase. However, the second peak of activity was found to be a distinct enzyme. We present here the purification of this enzyme from human tumor KB cells by sequential ion-exchange chromatography. The isolated protein kinase was identified as a 46-kDa protein by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated that the enzyme was functional in a monomeric state. A kinetic analysis of the purified enzyme was performed at 22 degrees C using a synthetic peptide substrate based on the primary sequence of the EGF receptor (KREL VEPLT669PSGEAPNQALLR). The Km(app) for ATP was 40 +/- 5 microM (mean +/- S.D., n = 3). GTP was not found to be a substrate for the purified enzyme. The Km(app) for the synthetic peptide substrate was 260 +/- 40 microM (mean +/- S.D., n = 3). The Vmax(app) for the isolated protein kinase was determined to be 400-900 nmol/mg/min. The purified enzyme was designated EGF receptor Thr669 (ERT) kinase. It is likely that the MAP2 and ERT kinases account for the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Thr669 observed in cultured cells. The marked stimulation of protein kinase activity caused by growth factors indicates that these enzymes may have an important function during signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1580289363,"DNA clones encoding the glycogen-binding (RG1) subunit of glycogen-associated protein phosphatase were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle lambda gt11 cDNA libraries. Overlapping clones provided an open reading frame of 3327 nucleotides that predicts a polypeptide of 1109 amino acids with a molecular weight of 124,257. Northern hybridization of rabbit RNA identified a major mRNA transcript of 7.5 kilobases present in skeletal, diaphragm, and cardiac muscle, but not in brain, kidney, liver, and lung. Southern analysis of rabbit genomic DNA digested with various restriction endonucleases gave rise to a single hybridizing fragment, suggesting that a single gene is present. Expression of the complete RG1 subunit coding sequence in Escherichia coli generated a protein of apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of approximately 160,000, similar to the size of the polypeptide detected by Western immunoblot in rabbit skeletal muscle extracts. The RG1 subunit shares significant homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAC1 gene product which is involved in activation of glycogen synthase and glycogen accumulation. The homology with GAC1 substantiates the role of this enzyme in control of glycogen metabolism. Hydropathy analysis of the RG1 subunit amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a hydrophobic region in the COOH terminus, suggesting a potential association with membrane. This result suggests that the same phosphatase regulatory component may be involved in targeting the enzyme both to membranes and to glycogen."
https://openalex.org/W1504163891,"Serpins encompass a superfamily of proteinase inhibitors that regulate many of the serine proteinases involved in inflammation and hemostasis. In vitro, many serpins are catalytically inactivated by proteinases that they do not inhibit, leading to the concept of proteolytic down-regulation of serpin inhibitory capacity. The extent to which down-regulation of serpin activity occurs in vivo is debated, since little is known of the rates at which the process occurs. To address this debate, we have measured the rates of inactivation of three serpins, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI), alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1ACT), and antithrombin III (ATIII), by three human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs-1, -2, and -3) thought to be involved in tissue destruction and repair. Our object was to establish a working kinetic model which can be used to predict whether serpin inactivation by these proteinases is likely to occur in vivo. We determined the rates of inactivation of these three serpins by each of the MMPs and compared these to rates of inhibition of the MMPs by an endogenous inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin. An equation designed to predict the extent of substrate hydrolyzed by an enzyme in the presence of an enzyme inhibitor gave the following predictions of the inactivation in vivo: (i) ATIII is unlikely to be inactivated by the MMPs. (ii) MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase) is unlikely to inactivate any of the three serpins. (iii) MMP-1 (tissue collagenase) will inactivate alpha 1PI and alpha 1ACT only when its concentration saturates that of its controlling inhibitors. (iv) MMP-3 (stromelysin) may inactivate small amounts of alpha 1PI and more significant amounts of alpha 1ACT, even in the presence of its controlling inhibitors. Any physiologic or pathologic inactivation of these serpins by these MMPs that occurs in vivo will probably be due to MMP-3, and will likely only take place in tissues and inflammatory loci where the concentration of MMP inhibitors is depressed."
https://openalex.org/W1530802090,"There are two isozymes of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), one produced by somatic tissues and a smaller protein synthesized by developing spermatozoa (testis ACE). To investigate the molecular control of testis ACE, we generated mice transgenic for a construct containing a putative testis-specific ACE promoter linked to the Escherichia coli reporter gene encoding beta-galactosidase. The transgenic mice express beta-galactosidase protein and RNA only within the testis. Histochemical analysis of the transgenic mice shows co-localization of beta-galactosidase protein and endogenous ACE within elongating spermatozoa. These studies demonstrate that transcription of testis ACE is controlled by a strong intragenic testis-specific promoter that is contained within a 698-base pair fragment immediately upstream from the transcription start site of testis ACE. Characterization of the testis ACE promoter may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling cell stage-specific gene expression in the male germ line."
https://openalex.org/W1563078713,"We determined the effect of okadaic acid (OA), a potent phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitor, on the intracellular pH (pHi) of rat thymic lymphocytes and human bladder carcinoma cells. OA induced a rapid and sustained cytosolic alkalinization. This pHi increase was Na(+)-dependent and was inhibited by 5,N-disubstituted analogs of amiloride, indicating mediation by the Na+/H+ antiport. As described for other stimulants, such as mitogens and hypertonic challenge, activation of the antiport by OA is attributable to an upward shift in its pHi dependence. Accordingly, the alkalinization produced by the phosphatase inhibitor was not additive with that induced osmotically. Activation of the antiport by OA was accompanied by a marked increase in phosphoprotein accumulation, revealing the presence of active protein kinases in otherwise unstimulated cells. We considered the possibility that phosphorylation of the antiport itself or of an ancillary protein is responsible for activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Consistent with this notion, the alkalinization induced by OA was absent in ATP depleted cells. More importantly, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated increased phosphorylation of the antiport following treatment with OA. We conclude that, upon inhibition of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, constitutively active kinases induce the activation of Na+/H+ exchange, possibly by direct phosphorylation of the antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1826729319,"We have developed a membrane binding assay by which we have been able to characterize the interaction between 125I-labeled retinol-binding protein and its receptor in microsome fractions derived from retinal pigment epithelial cells. The binding of retinol-binding protein to the membranes was fast, with a dissociation constant in the range of 31-72 nM, and maximum binding occurred at neutral pH. Receptor binding sites were also found in microsome fractions of liver and kidney, whereas lung and muscle contained few, if any. Chemical cross-linking of retinol-binding protein to the microsomal membranes yielded a major molecular complex of Mr 86,000 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein responsible for binding of retinol-binding protein was identified as a Mr 63,000 protein using a label transfer cross-linking technique. Further characterization demonstrated that the receptor for retinol-binding protein is a terminally glycosylated membrane protein noncovalently associated with a high molecular weight complex."
https://openalex.org/W1552975638,"Clonal PC12 lines deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) were made by stably expressing mutant regulatory subunits (RI) of PKA that are deficient in cAMP binding (Correll, L. A., Woodford, T. A., Corbin, J. D., Mellon, P. L., and McKnight, G. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16672-16678). Expression of the mutant RIs repressed cAMP-dependent activation of both PKAI and PKAII while having no effects on the cAMP binding to either free RI or RII or the level of catalytic subunit protein. These data suggest that RI and RII compete for the same pool of catalytic subunit and that the level of PKAI and PKAII are interdependent. We have used these cell lines to examine the requirement for PKA in mediating the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) and agents that are thought to act exclusively via cAMP-dependent pathways. While several responses to cAMP were strongly compromised in these lines, NGF-dependent responses were comparable in parental and PKA-deficient cells, including: 1) protein phosphorylation, 2) transcriptional induction of the immediate early gene egr1, 3) expression of the gene for GAP-43, 4) induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity, and 5) formation of neurites. Furthermore, transient expression of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (RSVPKI; Day, R. N., Walder, J. A., and Maurer, R. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 431-436) blocked cAMP, but not NGF, induction of regulatory elements derived from the gene for egr1. These experiments support the idea that NGF can regulate neuronal differentiation by pathways that are independent of cAMP-activatable PKA."
https://openalex.org/W1644153661,"We have expressed in mammalian cells a fragment (residues 1-302) of the alpha chain of platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib containing the von Willebrand factor- (vWF) binding site. The secreted soluble protein had an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa and reacted with conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies that bind only to native GP Ib, thus demonstrating its proper folding. After insolubilization on nitrocellulose membrane, the recombinant GP Ib alpha fragment bound soluble vWF in the presence of ristocetin or botrocetin with a dissociation constant similar to that exhibited by GP Ib.IX complex on platelets. Moreover, the interaction was blocked by anti-GP Ib monoclonal antibodies known to inhibit vWF binding to platelets. The sequence of GP Ib alpha between residues 269-287 has a strong net negative charge due to the presence of 10 glutamic or aspartic acid residues; 5 of these are contained in the sequence of a synthetic peptide (residues 251-279) previously shown to inhibit vWF-platelet interaction. In order to evaluate the possible functional role of these acidic residues, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to express two mutant GP Ib alpha fragments containing asparagine or glutamine instead of aspartic or glutamic acid, respectively. Mutant 1, with substitutions between residues 251-279, failed to bind vWF whether in the presence of ristocetin or botrocetin; in contrast, vWF binding to Mutant 2, with substitutions between residues 280-302, was nearly normal in the presence of ristocetin, but markedly decreased in the presence of botrocetin. Thus, mammalian cells transfected with a truncated cDNA sequence encoding the amino-terminal domain of GP Ib alpha synthesize a fully functional vWF-binding site; acidic residues in the sequence 252-287 are essential for normal function."
https://openalex.org/W1568073470,"Exposure of ventricular myocytes in primary culture to triiodothyronine (T3) increased the number of beta 1-adrenergic receptors per cell by 2.1 +/- 0.3-fold (n = 7) within 48 h. Immunoblots of membranes prepared from myocytes revealed a marked increase by T3 in the 64-kDa species of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. Steady-state levels of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNAs quantified by DNA-excess solution hybridization were 0.26 +/- 0.06 and 0.81 +/- 0.05 amol of beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA/micrograms of total cellular RNA, respectively (n = 4). beta 1-Adrenergic receptor mRNA increased to 0.90 +/- 0.07 amol/micrograms RNA by 2-4 h after exposure to T3 and then declined by 6 h to twice that of control cells. beta 2-Adrenergic receptor mRNA levels were unaffected by T3. Northern blot hybridization also showed a rapid and sustained increase of 2.2 +/- 0.4-fold (n = 4) in beta 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA. The rate of beta 1-adrenergic receptor gene transcription assessed by nuclear run-on transcription assays increased by 3.4 +/- 0.4-fold in cells treated for 30 min with T3. Ventricular cells contained nuclear T3 receptors and mRNAs of c-erbA genes that encode T3 binding proteins. These studies indicate that thyroid hormones regulate the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system by controlling the rate of transcription of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor gene. This regulation involves nuclear T3 receptors and appears to be exerted in a tissue-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1597158741,"We have isolated and sequenced two overlapping cDNA fragments which could encode the complete amino acid sequence of rat testis fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Northern blot analysis revealed that the major 2-kilobase mRNA isolated from rat testis hybridized with a cDNA fragment. A full length cDNA, which encoded a protein of 468 amino acids, was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein, purified to homogeneity, showed a Mr of 55,000 by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, compared to the deduced Mr of 54,023. Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase with the same Mr 55,000 was also present in rat testis extract. The active enzyme was a dimer as judged by molecular sieve filtration. The expressed enzyme was bifunctional with specific activities of 90 and 22 milliunits/mg of the kinase and the phosphatase activities, respectively. Various kinetic constants of the expressed fructose 6-P,2-kinase were KmFru 6-P = 85 microM and KmATP = 270 microM, and those of fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase were KmFru 2,6-P2 = 21 microM and KiFru 6-P = 3.4 microM. The enzyme was phosphorylated by Fru-2,6[2-32P]P2 and also by protein kinase C, but not by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which is in contrast to the liver and heart isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1553821226,"Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activities have been partially purified from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and analyzed for substrate specificity, calcium and pH requirements, and molecular weight. The purification procedure involved DEAE-cellulose and heparin-Sepharose chromatographies followed by Mono Q and size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. This technique resolves multiple peaks of activity using phosphatidylinositol (PI) and PI 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) as substrates. The major peak was purified to near homogeneity as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PLC activity in vascular smooth muscle cells can be divided into two types based on their calcium and pH requirements, substrate preferences, and molecular weights. The low molecular weight PLC hydrolyzes both PI and PIP2, has a molecular mass of 58 kDa, requires the most calcium for full activation, and has a PI-pH profile that shifts slightly with calcium concentration. Screening a cDNA library with oligonucleotides directed against several of the known PLCs identified a highly expressed PLC cDNA that is 99% homologous to PLC-alpha, suggesting that this low molecular weight peak in fact corresponds to PLC-alpha. The high molecular mass peak (157 kDa) shows much greater activity against PI than PIP2, is active at lower calcium concentrations, and has a PI-pH optimum of 5.0 regardless of calcium concentration. Each of the PIP2 PLC activities is strongly dependent on the relative levels of calcium and pH in the assay buffer. These observations suggest that vascular smooth muscle contains both a high and low molecular weight PLC whose activities are affected markedly by the changes in calcium and pH accompanying hormonal stimulation of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1539877462,"Anthrax toxin consists of three separate proteins produced by Bacillus anthracis: protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). Previous work showed that the process by which these proteins damage eukaryotic cells begins with binding of PA (83 kDa) to cell surface receptors. PA is then cleaved by a cell surface protease so as to expose a high-affinity binding site for LF or EF on the COOH-terminal, receptor-bound, 63-kilodalton fragment. In this report we more closely define a region of PA involved in receptor binding. The gene encoding PA was mutagenized so as to delete 3, 5, 7, 12, or 14 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the protein, and the truncated PA variants were purified from Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. Deletion of 3, 5, or 7 amino acids reduced the binding of PA to cells and the subsequent toxicity of the PA.LF complex to J774A.1 cells and also the ability to cause EF binding to cells. Deletion of 12 or 14 amino acids completely eliminated all these activities. These results show that the carboxy terminus comprises or is part of the receptor-binding domain of PA."
https://openalex.org/W1663021874,"2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases constitute a multimember family of interferon-inducible enzymes which need double-stranded RNA as an obligatory cofactor. We have isolated cDNA clones for two new murine synthetases. These two clones, 9-2 and 3-9, encoded proteins of 414 and 363 amino acid residues, respectively, out of which the amino terminal 346 residues were almost identical. They were also very similar to the corresponding regions of human synthetases E16 and E18. On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal 68 residues of clone 9-2 had no homology with the carboxyl-terminal residues of E18. These murine clones had only 67% amino acid identity with the previously isolated murine synthetase clone L3. 9-2 and 3-9 proteins were expressed efficiently by in vitro transcription and translation of cDNA clones containing the synthetase coding regions preceded by the 5'-untranslated region of the vesicular stomatitis virus NS gene. These in vitro synthetized proteins bound to double-stranded RNA and catalyzed the synthesis of 2'-5' oligoadenylates. A nested set of deletion mutants of the 9-2 clone was produced by restriction digestion and polymerase chain reaction. Functional testing of the corresponding truncated proteins revealed that a region between amino acid residues 104 and 158 was necessary for binding to double-stranded RNA and a region between residues 320 and 344 was necessary for enzyme activity. Moreover substitution of the lysine residue at position 333 by arginine did not affect the enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2140038371,"The structural and functional properties of arrestin were studied by subjecting the protein to limited proteolysis. Limited proteolysis by trypsin cleaves arrestin (48 kDa), producing 20-25-kDa fragments. Prior to this stage of proteolysis, trypsin produced 46.6-, 45.4-, and 42-kDa fragments. Structural analysis of the proteolytic fragments demonstrated major cleavage at the carboxyl terminus, indicating that the carboxyl terminus is highly exposed. We found that forms of arrestin truncated at their carboxyl terminus maintained their functional properties and bound to phosphorylated rhodopsin. Native arrestin binds only to photoexcited phosphorylated rhodopsin, whereas the truncated arrestin binds to phosphorylated rhodopsin independent of its exposure to light. The truncated forms of arrestin were separated from native arrestin by a chromatographic procedure and subsequently characterized in functional studies. The binding of the truncated forms of arrestin to phosphorylated photoexcited rhodopsin is more tight than the binding of native arrestin as determined by a direct binding assay and the phosphodiesterase assay. We suggest that the acidic carboxyl-terminal region of arrestin may act as a regulator for light-dependent binding to phosphorylated rhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1601690852,"In erythroleukemia cells infected with the polycythemia strain of the Friend virus complex, erythropoietin could be cross-linked mainly to a protein of 63 kDa when using disuccinimidyl suberate. In contrast, erythropoietin in other erythroleukemia cells cross-linked to two proteins of 85 and 100 kDa. When native erythropoietin receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated, the 63-kDa erythropoietin-cross-linked protein could be precipitated both by antibodies directed against the intracellular part of the cloned chain of the erythropoietin receptor and by antibodies directed against the envelope proteins of the Friend virus. However, after denaturation of the complexes, the 63-kDa protein was only precipitated by antibodies directed against the envelope proteins of the Friend virus. Enzymatic deglycosylation confirmed that erythropoietin was cross-linked with the envelope protein of the defective virus and bidimensional diagonal gel electrophoresis analyses showed that some of the erythropoietin cross-linked envelope proteins were dimerized by disulfide bonds. Thus, the main erythropoietin-receptor complex in the plasma membrane of these cells consisted of a molecule of the cloned chain of the erythropoietin receptor noncovalently associated with one or two disulfide-bonded molecule(s) of the envelope protein of the defective virus. Moreover, our results also showed that the viral envelope protein associated with the cloned chain of the erythropoietin receptor at a site distinct from the erythropoietin binding site."

To determine whether monoacylglycerol (MG) incorporation pathways are involved we incubated quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with [3H]glycerol-labeled sn-2-arachidonoyl MG, then analyzed the radioactive cell lipids that accumulated. We also examined cell homogenates to identify enzyme activities that might promote the incorporation of sn-2-arachidonoyl MG into other cell lipids. The cell incubation experiments demonstrated rapid labeling of several lipids, including diacylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylinositol. They also demonstrated selective labeling of sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. The cell homogenate experiments identified an sn-2-acyl MG acyltransferase activity, an MG kinase activity that phosphorylates sn-2-arachidonoyl MG in preference to sn-2-oleoyl MG, and a stearoyl-specific acyl transferase activity that converts sn-2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidic acid into sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidic acid. The results also showed that this stearoyl transferase could act with other enzymes to convert sn-2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidic acid into sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylinositol. The combined results indicate that Swiss 3T3 cells incorporate sn-2-arachidonoyl MG into phospholipids by at least two different pathways, including one that specifically forms sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylinositol."
https://openalex.org/W1557645014,"Our previous studies involving chimeric thyrotropin-lutropin/choriogonadotropin (TSH-LH/CG) receptors suggest that multiple segments spanning the entire extracellular domain of the human TSH receptor contribute to the TSH binding site. Nevertheless, the mid-region (segment C, amino acid residues 171-260) of the receptor extracellular domain is particularly important in TSH binding. In the present studies, we constructed seven new chimeric receptors in order to analyze segment C in further detail. Seven small segments spanning segment C of the TSH receptor were replaced with the counterpart of the rat LH/CG receptor. These mutant receptors were stably introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells and were tested for hormone binding and cAMP responsiveness to hormone stimulation. The results indicate that 11 amino acids of the TSH receptor (Lys-201 to Lys-211) and the corresponding region of the LH/CG receptor (Thr-202 to Ile-212) are important for specific TSH and human CG binding, respectively. In addition, nine amino acids of the TSH receptor (Gly-222 to Leu-230) are also involved in TSH binding. A further conclusion from these data is that TSH and human CG bind to partially overlapping sites on their respective receptor molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1542532626,"Results obtained with adipocyte ghosts indicated that the relative pumping activities of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 isoforms of the (Na+,K+) pump depend strongly on intracellular sodium concentration, [Na+]i (McGill, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15817-15823). Accordingly, [Na+]i was determined in rat adipocytes as a function of ouabain concentration and found to increase gradually as the concentration of ouabain increased. Incubation conditions were therefore designed such that the [Na+]i at 0 M and 10(-5) M ouabain were identical, in order to study the activities of both forms of the pump under identical conditions. Under these conditions, the alpha 2 isozyme accounts for 42% of the total pumping activity; these data prove that the activity of the alpha 2 isozyme is suppressed to a much greater extent than that of the alpha 1 isozyme, in relation to maximally obtainable activities measured in plasma membranes (Lytton J., Lin, J.C., and Guidotti, G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1177-1184). Furthermore, insulin stimulation of 86Rb+/K+ uptake in adipocytes results from a 58 and a 128% increase in the activities of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 isozymes (Na+,K+) pump, respectively. In addition, it is shown that under the conditions used to determine the [Na+]i dependence of 86Rb+/K+ uptake into adipocytes (0 mM KCl, various [NaCl]), [Na+]i decreases rapidly upon the addition of KCl/86RbCl for the initiation of the uptake measurement. By making uptake measurements quickly after the addition of KCl to eliminate the effect of a decreasing [Na+]i, we demonstrate that the stimulation of the alpha 1 isozyme is due to a small decrease in the K0.5Na+ whereas the stimulation of the alpha 2 isozyme results from a decrease in the K0.5Na+ and an increase in the Vmax."
https://openalex.org/W1507966045,"The combination of low temperature EPR, magnetic circular dichroism, and resonance Raman spectroscopies reveals the presence of a single [3Fe-4S]+,0 center as the sole iron-sulfur prosthetic group in glutamate synthase from spinach leaves. The electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of the oxidized and reduced cluster are analogous with those of similar clusters in bacterial ferredoxins. It was not possible to convert the [3Fe-4S] cluster to a [4Fe-4S] cluster by incubating with iron under reducing conditions. Taken together with the published amino acid sequence data for plant and bacterial glutamate synthases, this suggests that the [3Fe-4S] cluster is not an isolation artifact resulting from oxidative degradation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The likelihood that a [3Fe-4S] cluster is an intrinsic component of all plant and bacterial glutamate synthases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1517650038,"We report the purification and characterization of an active catalytic fragment of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, derived from autophosphorylation and subsequent limited chymotryptic digestion of the purified rat forebrain soluble kinase. The purified fragment was completely Ca2+/calmodulin-independent, existed as a monomer, and phosphorylated synapsin I at the same sites as does the native form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Kinetic studies with the purified fragment revealed a more than 10-fold increase in Vmax and a 50% decrease in Km for synthetic peptide substrates, compared with native Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. No 32P-labeled autophosphorylated residues were detected in the purified active fragment, indicating that the autophosphorylation sites were not contained within this fragment. Comparative studies of this active fragment (30 kDa) and its inactive counterpart (32-kDa fragment) revealed certain structural details of both fragments. Calmodulin-overlay study, immunoblot analysis, and direct amino acid sequencing suggest that both fragments contain the entire NH2-terminal catalytic domain and were generated by distinct cleavage within the regulatory domain. The putative cleavage sites for both fragments are discussed."

In the present studies, most of the endogenous rodent receptors were found to be immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells but not the parental cells with a monoclonal antibody specific for human receptor. These data indicate that in these transfected cells, most of the endogenous rodent receptors are in a hybrid complex with the overexpressed human receptor. These results together with the in vitro studies of Treadway et al. (Treadway, J.L., Morrison, B.D., Soos, M.A., Siddle, K., Olefsky, J., Ullrich, A., McClain, D.A., and Pessin, J.E. (1991) Proc.

The fbcQ cistron is 372 base pairs long and encodes 124 amino acid residues. The molecular mass of subunit IV, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, is 14,384 Da. A hydropathy plot of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed only one transmembrane helix; it is near the C-terminal end. The 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-(3,7-dimethyl[3H]octyl)-1,4-benzoquinone ([3H]azido-Q)-labeled subunit IV was isolated from the [3H]-azido-Q-treated cytochrome b-c1 complex. A ubiquinone-binding peptide was obtained by digesting the labeled subunit IV with V8 protease followed by high performance liquid chromatography separation. Amino acid analysis and partial N-terminal sequencing of this ubiquinone-binding peptide revealed that it corresponded to residues 77-124 of subunit IV. Based on the hydropathy profile and predicted tendency to form alpha-helices and beta-sheets, we propose a structural model for subunit IV. In this model the ubiquinone-binding domain is located near the surface of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1961175644,"We have identified nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) on the cell surface and a truncated nerve growth factor receptor (NGFRt) in the conditioned medium of NGFR-negative cells that have been transfected with either the gene or the cDNA for the full-length receptor. By using cell surface iodination or metabolic labeling of A875 human melanoma cells, coupled with immunoprecipitation, we have determined the half-life of the cell-associated receptor to be approximately 7 h. Concomitant with receptor degradation is the accumulation of NGFRt in the extracellular medium. Approximately one-fifth of the labeled receptor can be recovered as the truncated species. These data support the hypothesis that NGFRt is generated by proteolysis of previously intact receptor. Furthermore, although no specific protease inhibitor assayed could affect this processing, NGFR degradation and truncation were retarded by treatment with: 1) the weak base amines, ammonium chloride or methylamine; 2) the carboxylic ionophore, monensin; or 3) the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, all agents that dissipate endosomal/lysosomal proton gradients via alternate mechanisms. Incubation of cells at 4 degrees C precluded NGFR degradation and truncation. The presence of ligand did not alter the time course of receptor truncation."
https://openalex.org/W1518880964,"Reductive optical/EPR titrations of trimethylamine dehydrogenase with sodium dithionite have been performed, indicating that the equilibrium distribution of reducing equivalents between the covalently bound FMN and 4Fe/4S centers in partially reduced trimethylamine dehydrogenase is pH-dependent. In the case of two-electron reduced enzyme, formation of fully reduced flavin with oxidized iron-sulfur is favored below pH 7.5, whereas above pH 8 formation of flavin semiquinone with reduced iron-sulfur is preferred. The rates of electron transfer between the sites have been measured with the stopped-flow rapid mixing technique using a pH jump. The observed rate constants fall in the range of 200 s-1 to 1000 s-1 at 25 degrees C with the larger values occurring at higher values of final pH. The values of the rate constants depend on the final pH and are independent of observation wave-length. The temperature dependencies of these reactions give linear Arrhenius plots with activation energies in the range of 12 to 16 kcal/mol, consistent with prototropic equilibria being associated with electron transfer. The pH dependence of EPR spectral line widths for the flavin semiquinone and static optical spectra suggest that the semiquinone form of flavin present at pH 10 is anionic, whereas the neutral form is present at pH 7. The observed rate constants at 25 degrees C are greater than or equal to 100-fold larger than kcat for this enzyme and indicate that intramolecular electron transfer is not intrinsically rate-limiting in overall catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1549364861,"Disruption of the gene for subunit 6 of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex (QCR6) causes a temperature-sensitive petite phenotype in contrast to deletion of the coding region of QCR6, which shows no growth defect. Mitochondria from the petite strain carrying the disruption allele were devoid of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity but retained cytochrome c oxidase and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activities. Optical spectra of cytochromes in mitochondrial membranes from the petite strain lacked a cytochrome b absorption band and had a reduced amount of cytochrome c1. Analysis of mitochondrial translation products showed normal synthesis of cytochrome b. Western analysis of mitochondrial membranes from this disruption strain indicates core protein 1 of the cytochrome bc1 complex is present in normal amounts, while cytochrome c1, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, subunit 6, and subunit 7 were absent or present in very low amounts. Taken together, these findings indicate a loss of assembly of the cytochrome bc1 complex. High copy suppressors of the disruption strain were selected. Two separate families of suppressors were found. The first contained QCR6. The second family consisted of overlapping clones of a second gene distinct from QCR6. These plasmids contained QCR9, the gene which codes for subunit 9 of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex. Suppression of the QCR6 disruption strain by overexpression of QCR9 indicates a critical interaction between these two proteins in the assembly of the cytochrome bc1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1602665067,"The effects of a variety of detergents and neutral salts on the structure of the eukaryotic high molecular mass aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex have been directly determined by observing alterations in the composition, sedimentation behavior, and electron microscopic appearance of the rabbit reticulocyte complex. The intact complex is shown to exhibit the enzymatic activities, polypeptide composition, relative stoichiometry, and morphological features that are characteristic of this eukaryotic multienzyme particle. The structure of the high molecular mass aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex is seen to be resistant to both ionic and nonionic detergents. However, both 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate and deoxycholate induce formation of large protein aggregates. In contrast, the chaotropic salts LiCl and NaSCN both selectively remove individual polypeptides from the high molecular mass aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex and promote formation of specific particulate subcomplexes which have distinct sizes, polypeptide compositions, and structural features. These data support the view that many of the protein interactions within the high molecular mass amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase complex are hydrophobic in nature. This study also provides direct evidence that the complex contains a core of tightly interacting synthetases onto which the remaining polypeptides are arrayed. The structural alterations observed here may account for the ability of these reagents to markedly inhibit several enzymatic activities within the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1662448355,"We have reported recently the isolation of a cDNA for nuclear encoded subunit Vb of mouse cytochrome c oxidase by screening mouse bone marrow and kidney cDNA libraries. In the present study, this cDNA was used as a probe to screen a mouse genomic library and isolate the complete gene encoding subunit Vb. Southern blot hybridization of mouse genomic DNA with the cDNA probe suggested the occurrence of multiple genes including many retroinserts. Restriction analysis followed by Southern blot hybridization of genomic clones was used to identify the putative retroinserts from the intron containing genes. Of the 10 initial genomic clones isolated, one clone (MG3) showing the most complex hybridization pattern was found to contain the complete gene for subunit Vb. The DNA sequence analysis show that the subunit Vb gene contains four exons of 149, 73, 99, and 189 bases interrupted by three relatively small introns of 520, 165, and 648 nucleotides in a gene spanning about 2.5 kilobase pairs. As determined by a combination of primer extension and S1 protection analyses, the major transcription start site appears to be located 49 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. The ability of the 5' upstream DNA to initiate transcription was studied using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmids in NIH 3T3 cells. Using this system we observed that a segment of the gene spanning nucleotides -574 to +45 can drive the transcription of CAT gene in an orientation dependent manner. The upstream region of subunit Vb gene lacks the TATA and CAAT elements, although it contains several GC rich elements and a pyrimidine rich stretch around the transcription start site."
https://openalex.org/W1605930166,"We have investigated the role of integration host factor (IHF) in the replication of plasmid R6K by studying the maintainance of the plasmid in a strain of Escherichia coli that lacks both subunits of IHF and in an isogenic wild type strain and found that all three origins, alpha, beta, and gamma, were functional in the absence of IHF; however, loss of IHF reduced the copy number of those replicons initiating solely from ori gamma by 5-fold. Concomitant loss of direct repeats within the origin that bind the R6K replication initiator protein, Pi, resulted in a further reduction in copy number. Using gel mobility shift analysis, we showed that IHF bound specifically only to one site within the A/T rich region of the minimal origin adjacent to the Pi binding sites. The origin region possessed no intrinsic DNA curvature although IHF induced a strong bend upon binding. Combination footprinting with different orders of addition of Pi and IHF suggested that there was no cooperativity between the two proteins with regard to DNA binding. Hydroxyl-radical footprinting revealed hypersensitive asymmetric periodic cleavage sites within the origin region in the presence of IHF that extended over 200 base pairs and a localized perturbation of cleavage chemistry. The presence of periodic cleavages was dependent upon the presence of the wild type R6K origin sequence and was not observed when the IHF binding site was positioned adjacent to a heterologous sequence. We observed that the conformational changes induced by IHF upon binding to the R6K origin were negatively correlated with the observed decrease in copy number, and therefore, origin conformation altered by protein-DNA interaction may play an important role in the regulation of replication initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1494236334,"Lateral motion of the viral envelope proteins in the target cell membrane was shown recently to be essential for cell fusion by Sendai virus (Henis, Y. I., Herman-Barhom, Y., Aroeti, B., and Gutman, O. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17119-17125). To explore the mechanism that gives rise to this requirement, we have now investigated the distribution of Sendai virus envelope proteins (F, the fusion protein, and HN, the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein) on human erythrocytes in the course of fusion, using fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. In these studies, both the F and the HN proteins were found to accumulate in cell-cell contact regions, on the time scale of the fusion process. We propose that migration of the viral glycoproteins to cell contact regions and accumulation at the contact sites are essential parts of the fusion mechanism and form the basis to the requirement for their lateral motion in the fusion event."

The respective rat cDNAs were inserted into vectors constructed from pKK233-2 by replacing its replication origin with that of pGEM-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The rPRS I and rPRS II were purified to apparent homogeneity with specific activities of 33,400 and 46,200 milliunits/mg, respectively; these values were at least 2.5-fold higher than the highest value for the mammalian enzyme so far reported. Both isoforms showed a similar dependency on Pi as an absolute activator. Sulfate partially substituted for Pi. The maximal activities of rPRS I and rPRS II with sulfate were 43 and 7%, respectively, of those seen with Pi. The two isoforms differed in sensitivity to inhibition by ADP and GDP. Inhibition of rPRS I and rPRS II by 0.3 mM ADP was 87 and 54%, respectively, and inhibition by 1 mM GDP was 93 and 24%, respectively. rPRS II was 180-fold more sensitive than rPRS I to heat inactivation at 49 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2109750398,"Abstract Ribonuclease T1 was purified from an Escherichia coli overproducing strain and co-crystallized with adenosine 2'-monophosphate (2'-AMP) by microdialysis against 50% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol in 20 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM calcium acetate, pH 4.2. The crystals have orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with cell dimensions a = 48.93(1), b = 46.57(4), c = 41.04(2) A; Z = 4 and V = 93520 A3. The crystal structure was determined on the basis of the isomorphous structure of uncomplexed RNase T1 (Martinez-Oyanedel et al. (1991) submitted for publication) and refined by least squares methods using stereochemical restraints. The refinement was based on Fhkl of 7,445 reflections with Fo greater than or equal to 1 sigma (Fo) in the resolution range of 10-1.8 A, and converged at a crystallographic R factor of 0.149. The phosphate group of 2'-AMP is tightly hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of the active site residues Tyr38, His40, Glu58, Arg77, and His92, comparable with vanadate binding in the respective complex (Kostrewa, D., Choe, H.-W., Heinemann, U., and Saenger, W. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 7592-7600) and different from the complex with guanosine 2'-monophosphate (Arni, R., Heinemann, U., Tokuoka, R., and Saenger, W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15358-15368) where the phosphate does not interact with Arg77 and His92. The adenosine moiety is not located in the guanosine recognition site but stacked on Gly74 carbonyl and His92 imidazole, which serve as a subsite, as shown previously (Lenz, A., Cordes, F., Heinemann, U., and Saenger, W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7661-7667); in addition, there are hydrogen bonds adenine N6H . . . O Gly74 (minor component of three-center hydrogen bond) and adenosine O5' . . . O delta Asn36. These binding interactions readily explain why RNase T1 has some affinity for 2'-AMP. The molecular structure of RNase T1 is only marginally affected by 2'-AMP binding. Its empty guanosine-binding site features a flipped Asn43-Asn44 peptide bond and the side chains of Tyr45, Glu46 adopt conformations typical for RNase T1 not involved in guanosine binding. The side chains of amino acids Leu26, Ser35, Asp49, Val78 are disordered. The disorder of Val78 is of interest since this amino acid is located in a hydrophobic cavity, and the disorder appears to be correlated with an empty guanosine-binding site. The two Asp15 carboxylate oxygens and six water molecules coordinate a Ca2+ ion 8-fold in the form of a square antiprism."
https://openalex.org/W1606065549,"The RAD6 (UBC2) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is involved in DNA repair, induced mutagenesis, and sporulation, encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Since the RAD6 gene product can transfer ubiquitin directly to histones in vitro without the participation of a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3), it has been suggested that in vivo it also acts by the unassisted conjugation of ubiquitin to histones or to other target proteins. Here we show that the RAD6 protein can ligate ubiquitin in vitro to a hitherto unknown set of exogenous target proteins (alpha-, beta-, and kappa-casein and beta-lactoglobulin) when supplemented by a putative ubiquitin protein ligase (E3-R) from S. cerevisiae. RAD6 supplemented with E3-R ligates 1 or, sometimes, 2 ubiquitin molecules to the target protein molecule. UBC3 (CDC34) protein in the presence of E3-R has barely detectable activity on the non-histone substrates. Other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes tested (products of the UBC1 and UBC4 genes) do not cooperate with E3-R in conjugating ubiquitin to the same substrates. Thus, E3-R apparently interacts selectively with RAD6 protein. These findings suggest that some of the in vivo activities of the RAD6 gene may involve E3-R."

Chem. 242, 5744-5750), were studied. Herein it is demonstrated that the (Na+,K+) pump in ghosts is identical to that described in isolated plasma membranes, sharing the following characteristics: 1) the Ki values for ouabain are 1.3 x 10(-7) M and 4.5 x 10(-5) M for the alpha 2 and alpha 1 isozymes, respectively; 2) the K0.5 values for sodium are 11.4 +/- 1.6 and 7.2 +/- 3.8 mM for the alpha 2 and alpha 1 isozymes, respectively; 3) both forms of the (Na+,K+) pump are insensitive to insulin stimulation, presumably because the activities are already maximal. The ghosts are not in an insulin-stimulated state because the activity of the glucose transporter is not increased as it is in ghosts prepared from insulin-treated cells. In addition, presented evidence demonstrates that ghost internal sodium concentration, [Na+]i, is very sensitive to changes in the activity of the (Na+,K+) pump. If the [Na+]i, of adipocytes is also very sensitive to the activity of the (Na+,K+) pump, the mechanism of insulin stimulation of the adipocyte (Na+,K+) pump requires reexamination."
https://openalex.org/W1550934644,"The hydrodynamic properties of the previously purified glutamate-binding protein from rat synaptic membranes were determined in order to estimate the molecular size of the protein in its native state. This protein is apparently a subunit of a multisubunit complex that forms the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor and has a molecular size of approximately 70 kDa based on electrophoretic migration under denaturing conditions. On the basis of results obtained from H2O/D2O sucrose density gradient sedimentation and gel filtration chromatography of the purified glutamate-binding protein we calculated the partial specific volume of the protein-detergent complex to be 0.766 cc3/g, the Stokes radius of the complex as 4.9 nm, the Mc of the complex as 203,000 +/- 22,000 and the Mr of the protein as 182,000 +/- 19,000. These results are indicative of stable self-association of the glutamate-binding protein and are in agreement with recent studies indicating that more than one molecule of glutamate may be required to activate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-associated ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1539589925,"Abstract Lanthanides are useful probes in Ca2+ binding proteins, including sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase. Here, we report that lanthanides compete with Rb+ and Na+ for occlusion in renal (Na+,K+)-ATPase. The lanthanides appear to bind at a single site and act as competitive antagonists, without themselves becoming occluded. All lanthanides tested are effective with the order of potencies Pr greater than Nd greater than La greater than Eu greater than Tb greater than Ho greater than Er, but differences are small. The presence of Mg2+ ions does not affect competition of La3+ with Na+ or K+ suggesting that the effects are not exerted via divalent metal sites. Lanthanides compete with Rb+ and Na+ in membranes digested with trypsin so as to produce 19-kDa and smaller fragments of the alpha-chain (Karlish, S.J.D., Goldshleger, R., and Stein, W. D. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 4566-4570), also suggestive of a direct interaction of lanthanides with Na+ and K+ sites. Effects of lanthanides on conformational changes of fluorescein-labeled (Na+,K+)-ATPase are Na(+)-like. They stabilize the E1 state and compete with K+ ions. The Ki for La3+ is 0.445 microM. The apparent affinity in fluorescence assays is proportional to enzyme concentration (Ki = 32.4*[protein] + 0.445 microM La3+), suggesting that lanthanides are also bound nonspecifically (possibly to phospholipids). Direct assays confirm that Tb3+ binding is nonspecific. Measurements of the rate of various conformational transitions show that the rate of E2(K+)----E1(X) (X = Na+ or La3+) is significantly inhibited by La3+ compared to Na+. La3+ ions also slightly accelerate the rate of the E1----E2(K+) conformational transition. The dissociation rate of La3+ has been measured by monitoring the rate of E1(La3+)----E2(K+). It is 1.741 s-1 at 25 degrees C. Based on this value, it is unlikely that La3+ ions are stably occluded, consistent with the conclusion from occlusion experiments. In the future, lanthanides bound to monovalent cation sites with high affinity may become useful probes for location and characterization of sites, although it will be necessary to take into account the large amount of nonspecific binding."

Chem. 266, 15048-15053) have described and partially characterized phosphatidylinositol glycans (PI glycans) present in Tetrahymena mimbres. We now describe the time course of PI glycan labeling from exogenous [3H]myristate, [14C]glucosamine, and [3H]ethanolamine. Over the first 2-12 h following pulse radioisotope addition a sizeable proportion of the radioactivity associated with the protein pellet remaining after cell delipidation existed as PI glycans. These compounds were distributed throughout the cell, with the largest proportion at 12 h being associated with a fraction containing mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes. However, by 24 h radioactivity had nearly disappeared from the PI glycans and had become associated with proteins by a process that was almost totally inhibited by cycloheximide or tunicamycin. PI glycans appeared to be incorporated mainly into a protein migrating on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a relatively broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 24-29 kDa. The exact mobility of the protein band within this molecular weight range was dependent upon the growth temperature of the cells. The apparent molecular masses of the principal PI-anchored proteins formed by other closely related Tetrahymena species varied widely, ranging from 22 to 76 kDa. The PI-anchored proteins may belong to a group of surface proteins known as immobilization antigens. Treatment of 24-h-labeled T. mimbres cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C in vivo released labeled proteins from the cells. Some labeled proteins were present even in the medium of control, non-phospholipase-treated cells. Tetrahymena PI glycans appear to accumulate in a metabolic pool from which they are gradually removed for attachment to externally oriented PI-anchored proteins. Tetrahymena is a versatile system well suited for studying the regulation of PI-anchored protein biochemistry."
