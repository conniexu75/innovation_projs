https://openalex.org/W3148554359,"A large-scale screen to target SARS-CoV-2 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome is initially expressed as two large polyproteins. Its main protease, M pro , is essential to yield functional viral proteins, making it a key drug target. Günther et al. used x-ray crystallography to screen more than 5000 compounds that are either approved drugs or drugs in clinical trials. The screen identified 37 compounds that bind to M pro . High-resolution structures showed that most compounds bind at the active site but also revealed two allosteric sites where binding of a drug causes conformational changes that affect the active site. In cell-based assays, seven compounds had antiviral activity without toxicity. The most potent, calpeptin, binds covalently in the active site, whereas the second most potent, pelitinib, binds at an allosteric site. Science , this issue p. 642"
https://openalex.org/W3150530242,"This study aims at investigating the nature of resilience and stress experience of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirteen healthcare workers from Italian and Austrian hospitals specifically dealing with COVID-19 patients during the first phase of the pandemic were interviewed. Data was analysed using grounded theory methodology. Psychosocial effects on stress experience, stressors and resilience factors were identified. We generated three hypotheses. Hypothesis one is that moral distress and moral injury are main stressors experienced by healthcare workers. Hypothesis two states that organisational resilience plays an important part in how healthcare workers experience the crisis. Organisational justice and decentralized decision making are essential elements of staff wellbeing. Hypothesis three refers to effective psychosocial support: Basic on scene psychosocial support based on the Hobfoll principles given by trusted and well-known mental health professionals and peers in an integrated approach works best during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3149639952,"Overexpression and aggregation of α-synuclein (ASyn) are linked to the onset and pathology of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. Elevated levels of the stress-induced chaperone Hsp70 protect against ASyn misfolding and ASyn-driven neurodegeneration in cell and animal models, yet there is minimal mechanistic understanding of this important protective pathway. It is generally assumed that Hsp70 binds to ASyn using its canonical and promiscuous substrate-binding cleft to limit aggregation. Here we report that this activity is due to a novel and unexpected mode of Hsp70 action, involving neither ATP nor the typical substrate-binding cleft. We use novel ASyn oligomerization assays to show that Hsp70 directly blocks ASyn oligomerization, an early event in ASyn misfolding. Using truncations, mutations, and inhibitors, we confirm that Hsp70 interacts with ASyn via an as yet unidentified, noncanonical interaction site in the C-terminal domain. Finally, we report a biological role for a similar mode of action in H4 neuroglioma cells. Together, these findings suggest that new chemical approaches will be required to target the Hsp70-ASyn interaction in synucleinopathies. Such approaches are likely to be more specific than targeting Hsp70's canonical action. Additionally, these results raise the question of whether other misfolded proteins might also engage Hsp70 via the same noncanonical mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3141901980,"The retina dissects the visual scene into parallel information channels, which extract specific visual features through nonlinear processing. The first nonlinear stage is typically considered to occur at the output of bipolar cells, resulting from nonlinear transmitter release from synaptic terminals. In contrast, we show here that bipolar cells themselves can act as nonlinear processing elements at the level of their somatic membrane potential. Intracellular recordings from bipolar cells in the salamander retina revealed frequent nonlinear integration of visual signals within bipolar cell receptive field centers, affecting the encoding of artificial and natural stimuli. These nonlinearities provide sensitivity to spatial structure below the scale of bipolar cell receptive fields in both bipolar and downstream ganglion cells and appear to arise at the excitatory input into bipolar cells. Thus, our data suggest that nonlinear signal pooling starts earlier than previously thought: that is, at the input stage of bipolar cells."
https://openalex.org/W3150898546,"Objective The study was aimed at investigating the association between postpartum women’s breastfeeding self-efficacy levels and their depression levels, social support levels, and breastfeeding attitudes in early postpartum period. Methods The cross-sectional study was carried out in Kirklareli in Turkey. The population of the study consisted of 398 women aged 15–49 in the first 42 days of the postpartum period who presented to eight family health centers. The study data were collected face-to-face using the Personal Information Form, Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Breastfeeding Attitudes of the Evaluation Scale (BAES). Results The mean age of the participants was 28.61±5.72 (Min:18, Max: 44), and the mean score they obtained from the BSES-SF was 55.13±8.39. Statistically significant differences were detected between the participants’ BSES-SF scores and age groups, employment status, perceived income level, and the number of living children ( p &lt; 0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected between marital status, educational status and BSES-SF scores (p &gt; 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis adjusted according to the sociodemographic characteristics, BAES, EPDS and MSPSS accounted for 48.3% of the BSES-SF. A negative association was found between BSES-SF scores and EPDS scores (β = −0.178, 95% CI:−0.349, −0.006), and a positive relation between the BAES scores (β = 0.194, 95% CI: 0.163, 0.226) and the MSPSS scores (β = 0.114, 95% CI: 0.037, 0.191). Conclusion As the level of depression of women increases in the postpartum period, the level of breastfeeding self-efficacy decreases. The breastfeeding self-efficacy increases as the level of social support increases and as the attitudes that drive breastfeeding behavior change positively."
https://openalex.org/W3147462310,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was the first oncogenic human retrovirus identified in humans which infects at least 10–15 million people worldwide. Large HTLV-1 endemic areas exist in Southern Japan, the Caribbean, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia, and equatorial regions of Africa. HTLV-1 TAX viral protein is thought to play a critical role in HTLV-1 associated diseases. We have used numerous bio-informatics and immuno-informatics implements comprising sequence and construction tools for the construction of a 3D model and epitope prediction for HTLV-1 Tax viral protein. The conformational linear B-cell and T-cell epitopes for HTLV-1 TAX viral protein have been predicted for their possible collective use as vaccine candidates. Based on in silico investigation two B cell epitopes, KEADDNDHEPQISPGGLEPPSEKHFR and DGTPMISGPCPKDGQPS spanning from 324–349 and 252–268 respectively; and T cell epitopes, LLFGYPVYV, ITWPLLPHV and GLLPFHSTL ranging from 11–19, 163–171 and 233–241 were found most antigenic and immunogenic epitopes. Among different vaccine constructs generated by different combinations of these epitopes our predicted vaccine construct was found to be most antigenic with a score of 0.57. T cell epitopes interacted strongly with HLA-A*0201 suggesting a significant immune response evoked by these epitopes. Molecular docking study also showed a high binding affinity of the vaccine construct for TLR4. The study was carried out to predict antigenic determinants of the Tax protein along with the 3D protein modeling. The study revealed a potential multi epitope vaccine that can raise the desired immune response against HTLV-1 and be useful in developing effective vaccines against Human T-lymphotropic virus."
https://openalex.org/W3143655355,"Understanding the relationship between mechanical variables derived from actions such as jumping, sprinting, or ballistic bench press throwing and sport-specific performance moves is of scientific and practical interest for strength and conditioning coaches for improving training programs. We examined the association between mechanical variables derived from the force-velocity (FV) profiles of the aforementioned actions and spike and serve ball speeds in elite volleyball players. Twenty-two male elite volleyball players (age: 24.3 ± 4.5 years; height: 1.89 ± 0.06 m; body mass: 86.3 ± 8.6 kg) were tested in two sessions. Squatting, sprinting, and bench press throwing FV profiles were determined in the first session, while spike and serve ball speeds were assessed in the second session. The theoretical maximal force ( F 0 ) of vertical jumping, the theoretical maximal velocity of sprinting, and the F 0 of bench press throwing in ascending order, were strongly associated (r s range 0.53–0.84; p&lt;0.05) with spike and serve ball speeds. These mechanical variables explained 20%-36% of the variability in spike and serve ball speeds, with a greater influence on the serve speed. These results suggest that assessing jumping, sprinting, and bench press throwing force-velocity profiles might help provide player-specific training programs and optimize performance in these technical-tactical actions in male elite volleyball players."
https://openalex.org/W3143714690,"Human male reproductive development has a prolonged prepubertal period characterized by juvenile quiescence of germ cells with immature spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) precursors (gonocytes) present in the testis for an extended period of time. The metabolism of gonocytes is not defined. We demonstrate with mitochondrial ultrastructure studies via TEM and IHC and metabolic flux studies with UHPLC-MS that a distinct metabolic transition occurs during the maturation to SSCs. The mitochondrial ultrastructure of prepubertal human spermatogonia is shared with prepubertal pig spermatogonia. The metabolism of early prepubertal porcine spermatogonia (gonocytes) is characterized by the reliance on OXPHOS fuelled by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. Interestingly, at the same time, a high amount of the consumed pyruvate is also reduced and excreted as lactate. With maturation, prepubertal spermatogonia show a metabolic shift with decreased OXHPOS and upregulation of the anaerobic metabolism-associated uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). This shift is accompanied with stem cell specific promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) protein expression and glial cell-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF) pathway activation. Our results demonstrate that gonocytes differently from mature spermatogonia exhibit unique metabolic demands that must be attained to enable their maintenance and growth in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3149979547,"Background and objective Currently there is paucity of evidence in the literature in relation to normative values for diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and total lung capacity (TLC) among Indigenous Australians. Hence, in this study we assessed the DLCO and TLC parameters among Indigenous Australians in comparison to Australian Caucasian counterparts. Methods DLCO and TLC values were assessed and compared between Indigenous Australians and Australian Caucasians matched for age, sex and body mass index, with normal chest radiology. Results Of the 1350 and 5634 pulmonary function tests assessed in Indigenous Australian and Australian Caucasian adults respectively, a total of 129 Indigenous Australians and 197 Australian Caucasians met the inclusion criteria. Absolute DLCO and TLC values for Indigenous Australians were a mean 4.3 ml/min/mmHg (95% CI 2.86, 5.74) and 1.03 L (95% CI 0.78, 1.27) lower than Australian Caucasians (p&lt;0.01). Percentage predicted values were 15.38 (95% CI 11.59, 19.17) and 16.63 (95% CI 13.59, 19.68) points lower for DLCO and TLC, respectively. Lower limit of normal (LLN) values did not significantly differ between groups, however a significantly greater proportion of Indigenous Australians recorded values below the LLN in comparison to Australian Caucasians for DLCO (64 vs. 25%, p&lt;0.01) and TLC (66 vs. 21%, p&lt;0.01). Significant differences for the interaction of sex on DLCO and TLC were noted in Australian Caucasians, with reduced or absent sex differentiation among Indigenous Australians. Conclusions There are significant differences in DLCO and TLC parameters between Indigenous Australian compared to Australian Caucasians. Appropriate DLCO and TLC norms need to be established for Indigenous Australians."
https://openalex.org/W3152218033,"Recent studies suggest that air pollutant exposure may increase the incidence of mental health conditions, however research is limited. We examined the association between ozone (O 3 ) and fine particles (PM 2.5 ) and emergency department (ED) visits related to mental health outcomes, including psychosis, neurosis, neurotic/stress, substance use, mood/affective, depression, bipolar, schizotypal/delusional, schizophrenia, self-harm/suicide, and homicide/inflicted injury, from 2005 through 2013 in California. Air monitoring data were provided by the U.S. EPA’s Air Quality System Data Mart and ED data were provided by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. We used the time-series method with a quasi-Poisson regression, controlling for apparent temperature, day of the week, holidays, and seasonal/long-term trends. Per 10 parts per billion increase, we observed significant cumulative 7-day associations between O 3 and all mental health [0.64%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21, 1.07], depression [1.87%, 95% CI: 0.62, 3.15], self-harm/suicide [1.43%, 95% CI: 0.35, 2.51], and bipolar [2.83%, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.15]. We observed 30-day lag associations between O 3 and neurotic disorder [1.22%, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.97] and homicide/inflicted injury [2.01%, 95% CI: 1.00, 3.02]. Same-day mean PM 2.5 was associated with a 0.42% [95% CI: 0.14, 0.70] increase in all mental health, 1.15% [95% CI: 0.62, 1.69] increase in homicide/inflicted injury, and a 0.57% [95% CI: 0.22, 0.92] increase in neurotic disorders per 10 μg/m 3 increase. Other outcomes not listed here were not statistically significant for O 3 or PM 2.5 . Risk varied by age group and was generally greater for females, Asians, and Hispanics. We also observed seasonal variation for outcomes including but not limited to depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, self-harm/suicide, and homicide/inflicted injury. Ambient O 3 or PM 2.5 may increase the risk of mental health illness, though underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Findings warrant further investigation to better understand the impacts of air pollutant exposure among vulnerable groups."
https://openalex.org/W3150369211,"The elevated intestinal permeability due to mucosal barrier defects is not only secondary to inflammatory bowel disease but also precedes enteritis. Tetrandrine, a bisbenzyl isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the dried roots of Stephamis tetlandra S. Moor, was previously demonstrated to ameliorate colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Here, we investigate whether and how tetrandrine protects against the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier under colitis condition. The data show that oral administration of tetrandrine significantly counteracted the increase of intestinal permeability in DSS-treated mice, enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of Occludin and Claudin1 in the colon, but hardly affected the expression of ZO-1 and Mucin2. In vitro, tetrandrine treatment rescued the decrease of monolayer transmembrane resistance and the increase of epithelial cell permeability induced by TNF-α, upregulated the expression of Occludin, and downregulated the expression of Claudin1 but did not affect the expression of ZO-1. The siRNA of Occludin largely weakened the protective effect of tetrandrine on the epithelial barrier function in Caco-2 cells. MiR-429 mimic obviously counteracted the upregulation of tetrandrine on the expression of Occludin and the amelioration on epithelial barrier defects, in contrast, miR-429 inhibitor showed the opposite effects. The antagonist (CH223191) and siAhR of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) nearly completely diminished the effects of tetrandrine, including inhibition of the miR429 expression, the upregulation of Occludin expression, and amelioration of intestinal epithelial barrier defects in Caco-2 cells. In colitis mice, CH223191 significantly weakened the protective effect of tetrandrine on colitis and intestinal mucosal barrier and diminished the downregulation on miR-429 expression and the promotion on Occludin expression in the colon. In summary, tetrandrine can attenuate the intestinal epithelial barrier defects in colitis through promoting Occludin expression via the AhR/miR-429 pathway, and it might be used to treat colitis as a barrier protector."
https://openalex.org/W3145266244,"Pancreatic diseases including diabetes and exocrine insufficiency would benefit from therapies that reverse cellular loss and/or restore cellular mass. The identification of molecular pathways that influence cellular growth is therefore critical for future therapeutic generation. Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) is an enzyme that post-translationally modifies and activates the mRNA translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Previous work demonstrated that the inhibition of DHPS impairs zebrafish exocrine pancreas development; however, the link between DHPS, eIF5A, and regulation of pancreatic organogenesis remains unknown. Herein we identified that the conditional deletion of either Dhps or Eif5a in the murine pancreas results in the absence of acinar cells. Because DHPS catalyzes the activation of eIF5A, we evaluated and uncovered a defect in mRNA translation concomitant with defective production of proteins that influence cellular development. Our studies reveal a heretofore unappreciated role for DHPS and eIF5A in the synthesis of proteins required for cellular development and function."
https://openalex.org/W3150781133,"The first exposures to microbes occur during infancy and it is suggested that this initial colonization influences the adult microbiota composition. Despite the important role that the gut microbiome may have in health outcomes later in life, the factors that influence its development during infancy and early childhood have not been characterized fully. Guidelines about the introduction of solid foods and cessation of breastfeeding, which is thought to have a significant role in the transition to a more adult-like microbiota, are not based on microbiome research. There is even less understanding of approaches used to transition to solid food in the preterm population. The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of early life dietary events on gut microbiome community structures and function among infants born at term and pre-term. We plan to prospectively monitor the gut microbiome of infants during two critical timepoints in microbial development: the introduction of solid foods and cessation from breastmilk. A total of 35 participants from three primary observational birth cohorts (two full-term cohorts and one pre-term cohort) will be enrolled in this sub-study. Participants will be asked to collect stool samples and fill out a study diary before, during and after the introduction of solids and again during weaning from breastmilk. We will use frequent fecal sampling analyzed using 16S rRNA gene profiling, metagenomics, metabolomics, and targeted bacterial culturing to identify and characterize the microbial communities, as well as provide insight into the phenotypic characteristics and functional capabilities of the microbes present during these transitional periods of infancy. This study will provide a comprehensive approach to detailing the effects of dietary transition from breastmilk to a more adult-like solid food diet on the microbiome and in doing so will contribute to evidence-based infant nutrition guidance."
https://openalex.org/W3141020713,"The microvasculature is important for both health and exercise tolerance in a range of populations. However, methodological limitations have meant changes in microvascular blood flow are rarely assessed in humans during interventions designed to affect skeletal muscle blood flow such as the wearing of compression garments. The aim of this study is, for the first time, to use contrast-enhanced ultrasound to directly measure the effects of compression on muscle microvascular blood flow alongside measures of femoral artery blood flow and muscle oxygenation following intense exercise in healthy adults. It was hypothesized that both muscle microvascular and femoral artery blood flows would be augmented with compression garments as compared with a control condition. Ten recreationally active participants completed two repeated-sprint exercise sessions, with and without lower-limb compression tights. Muscle microvascular blood flow, femoral arterial blood flow (2D and Doppler ultrasound), muscle oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy), cycling performance, and venous blood samples were measured/taken throughout exercise and the 1-hour post-exercise recovery period. Compared with control, compression reduced muscle microvascular blood volume and attenuated the exercise-induced increase in microvascular velocity and flow immediately after exercise and 1 hour post-exercise. Compression increased femoral artery diameter and augmented the exercise-induced increase in femoral arterial blood flow during exercise. Markers of blood oxygen extraction in muscle were increased with compression during and after exercise. Compression had no effect on blood lactate, glucose, or exercise performance. We provide new evidence that lower-limb compression attenuates the exercise-induced increase in skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow following exercise, despite a divergent increase in femoral artery blood flow. Decreased muscle microvascular perfusion is offset by increased muscle oxygen extraction, a potential mechanism allowing for the maintenance of exercise performance."
https://openalex.org/W3149212799,"Background People who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately affected by hepatitis C virus (HCV). Data tracking the engagement of PWID in the continuum of HCV care are needed to assess the reach, target the response, and gauge impact of HCV elimination efforts. Methods We analyzed data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) surveys of PWID recruited via respondent driven sampling (RDS) in San Francisco in 2018. We calculated the number and proportion who self-reported ever: (1) tested for HCV, (2) tested positive for HCV antibody, (3) diagnosed with HCV, (4) received HCV treatment, (5) and attained sustained viral response (SVR). To assess temporal changes, we compared 2018 estimates to those from the 2015 NHBS sample. Results Of 456 PWID interviewed in 2018, 88% had previously been tested for HCV, 63% tested antibody positive, and 50% were diagnosed with HCV infection. Of those diagnosed, 42% received treatment. Eighty-one percent of those who received treatment attained SVR. In 2015 a similar proportion of PWID were tested and received an HCV diagnosis, compared to 2018. However, HCV treatment was more prevalent in the 2018 sample (19% vs. 42%, P-value 0.01). Adjusted analysis of 2018 survey data showed having no health insurance (APR 1.6, P-value 0.01) and having no usual source of health care (APR 1.5, P-value 0.01) were significantly associated with untreated HCV prevalence. Conclusion While findings indicate an improvement in HCV treatment uptake among PWID in San Francisco, more than half of PWID diagnosed with HCV infection had not received HCV treatment in 2018. Policies and interventions to increase coverage are necessary, particularly among PWID who are uninsured and outside of regular care."
https://openalex.org/W3140725843,"The incidence of allergic rhinitis (AR) has increased rapidly in Taiwan during the past 30 years; however, potential risk factors of AR have yet to be examined. The purpose of this study is to explore the prevalence, personal and environmental risk factors of rhinitis. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 26418 first graders (6–8 years old) in Taipei with a response rate of 94.6% (24999/26418). Modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaires were completed by their parents or main caregivers. Logistic regression was used to examine possible personal and environmental (in early life and current) factors related to rhinitis. The prevalence of rhinitis in the past 12 months was 42.8% in 6–8 years old children. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for both males and females revealed that male gender, antibiotic use in first year of life, bronchiolitis before the age of two years, diagnosed asthma, and diagnosed eczema, having a cat the first year of life were associated with an increased risk of rhinitis. Having older siblings, on the other hand, may reduce the risk of rhinitis. Based on the present study, we may recommend less use of antibiotics the first year of life and not having a cat in the home in the child’s first year of life as preventive measures to reduce the risk of rhinitis. From the subgroup analysis, we can take preventive measures for the different risk factors of rhinitis and the severity of rhinitis in each subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W3142143740,"The conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein TRAPα (translocon-associated protein, also known as signal sequence receptor 1, SSR1) has been reported to play a critical but unclear role in insulin biosynthesis. TRAPα/SSR1 is one component of a four-protein complex including TRAPβ/SSR2, TRAPγ/SSR3, and TRAPδ/SSR4. The TRAP complex topologically has a small exposure on the cytosolic side of the ER via its TRAPγ/SSR3 subunit, whereas TRAPβ/SSR2 and TRAPδ/SSR4 function along with TRAPα/SSR1 largely on the luminal side of the ER membrane. Here, we have examined pancreatic β-cells with deficient expression of either TRAPβ/SSR2 or TRAPδ/SSR4, which does not perturb mRNA expression levels of other TRAP subunits, or insulin mRNA. However, deficient protein expression of TRAPβ/SSR2 and, to a lesser degree, TRAPδ/SSR4, diminishes the protein levels of other TRAP subunits, concomitant with deficient steady-state levels of proinsulin and insulin. Deficient TRAPβ/SSR2 or TRAPδ/SSR4 is not associated with any apparent defect of exocytotic mechanism but rather by a decreased abundance of the proinsulin and insulin that accompanies glucose-stimulated secretion. Amino acid pulse labeling directly establishes that much of the steady-state deficiency of intracellular proinsulin can be accounted for by diminished proinsulin biosynthesis, observed in a pulse-labeling as short as 5 minutes. The proinsulin and insulin levels in TRAPβ/SSR2 or TRAPδ/SSR4 null mutant β-cells are notably recovered upon re-expression of the missing TRAP subunit, accompanying a rebound of proinsulin biosynthesis. Remarkably, overexpression of TRAPα/SSR1 can also suppress defects in β-cells with diminished expression of TRAPβ/SSR2, strongly suggesting that TRAPβ/SSR2 is needed to support TRAPα/SSR1 function."
https://openalex.org/W3150952078,"Purinergic signaling regulates several renal physiological and pathophysiological processes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles released by most cell types, which, in non-renal tissues, modulate purinergic signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EVs from renal proximal tubule (HK2) and collecting duct cells (HCD) on intra- and intersegment modulation of extracellular ATP levels, the underlying molecular mechanisms, and the impact on the expression of the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (αENaC). HK2 cells were exposed to HK2 EVs, while HCD cells were exposed to HK2 and HCD EVs. Extracellular ATP levels and αENaC expression were measured by chemiluminescence and qRT-PCR, respectively. ATPases in EV populations were identified by mass spectrometry. The effect of aldosterone was assessed using EVs from aldosterone-treated cells and urinary EVs (uEVs) from primary aldosteronism (PA) patients. HK2 EVs downregulated ectonucleoside-triphosphate-diphosphohydrolase-1 (ENTPD1) expression, increased extracellular ATP and downregulated αENaC expression in HCD cells. ENTPD1 downregulation could be attributed to increased miR-205-3p and miR-505 levels. Conversely, HCD EVs decreased extracellular ATP levels and upregulated αENaC expression in HCD cells, probably due to enrichment of 14-3-3 isoforms with ATPase activity. Pretreatment of donor cells with aldosterone or exposure to uEVs from PA patients enhanced the effects on extracellular ATP and αENaC expression. We demonstrated inter- and intrasegment modulation of renal purinergic signaling by EVs. Our findings postulate EVs as carriers of information along the renal tubules, whereby processes affecting EV release and/or cargo may impact on purinergically regulated processes."
https://openalex.org/W3139741795,"Chondrosarcoma is a cartilage-forming bone tumor, well known for intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have designed a targeted chondrosarcoma gene therapy using a bacteriophage (phage) particle to deliver therapeutic genes. Phage has no tropism for mammalian cells, allowing engineered phage to be targeted to specific cell surface receptors in cancer. We modified the phage capsid to display the RGD4C ligand on the pIII minor coat proteins to specifically bind to αvβ3 or αvβ5 integrin receptors. The endosomal escape peptide, H5WYG, was also displayed on recombinant pVIII major coat proteins to enhance gene delivery. Finally, a human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapeutic transgene expression cassette was incorporated into the phage genome. First, we found that human chondrosarcoma cells (SW1353) have high expression of αvβ3, αvβ5 integrin receptors, and both TNFα receptors. Targeted particle encoding a luciferase reporter gene efficiently and selectively mediated gene delivery to these cells. When SW1353 cells were treated with the targeted particle encoding a TNFα transgene, significant cell killing was evident and was associated with high expression of TNFα and apoptosis-related genes. In vivo, mice with established human chondrosarcoma showed suppression of tumors upon repetitive intravenous administrations of the targeted phage. These data show that our phage-based particle is a promising, selective, and efficient tool for targeted chondrosarcoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3139754016,"Human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an atypical chemokine implicated in intercellular signaling and innate immunity. MIF orthologs (MIF/D-DT-like proteins, MDLs) are present throughout the plant kingdom, but remain experimentally unexplored in these organisms. Here, we provide an in planta characterization and functional analysis of the three-member gene/protein MDL family in Arabidopsis thaliana. Subcellular localization experiments indicated a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of MDL1 and MDL2, while MDL3 is localized to peroxisomes. Protein–protein interaction assays revealed the in vivo formation of MDL1, MDL2, and MDL3 homo-oligomers, as well as the formation of MDL1-MDL2 hetero-oligomers. Functionally, Arabidopsis mdl mutants exhibited a delayed transition from vegetative to reproductive growth (flowering) under long-day conditions, but not in a short-day environment. In addition, mdl mutants were more resistant to colonization by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola. The latter phenotype was compromised by the additional mutation of SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2 (SID2), a gene implicated in the defense-induced biosynthesis of the key signaling molecule salicylic acid. However, the enhanced antibacterial immunity was not associated with any constitutive or pathogen-induced alterations in the levels of characteristic phytohormones or defense-associated metabolites. Interestingly, bacterial infection triggered relocalization and accumulation of MDL1 and MDL2 at the peripheral lobes of leaf epidermal cells. Collectively, our data indicate redundant functionality and a complex interplay between the three chemokine-like Arabidopsis MDL proteins in the regulation of both developmental and immune-related processes. These insights expand the comparative cross-kingdom analysis of MIF/MDL signaling in human and plant systems."
https://openalex.org/W3140218141,"Based on the discovery that the estrogen synthase aromatase (CYP19A1) is abundantly expressed in high- grade gliomas, the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole is being investigated in pre-clinical models as a novel agent against this malignancy. Here, we investigated the systemic and brain pharmacokinetics of letrozole following single and steady state dosing in both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, we employed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to gain quantitative insights into the blood-brain barrier penetration of this drug. Letrozole (4 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally daily for 5 days (for males) and 11 days (for females) and intracerebral microdialysis was performed for brain extracellular fluid (ECF) collection simultaneously with venous blood sampling. Drug levels were measured using HPLC and non-compartmental analysis was conducted employing WinNonlin®. Simcyp animal simulator was used for conducting bottom-up PBPK approach incorporating the specified multi-compartment brain model. Overall, marked gender-specific differences in the systemic and brain pharmacokinetics of letrozole were observed. Letrozole clearance was much slower in female rats resulting in markedly higher plasma and brain drug concentrations. At steady state, the plasma AUC 0–24 was 103.0 and 24.8 μg*h/ml and brain ECF AUC 0–12 was 24.0 and 4.8 μg*h/ml in female and male rats, respectively. The PBPK model simulated brain concentration profiles were in close agreement with the observed profiles. While gender-specific differences in letrozole PK are not observed in the clinical setting, these findings will guide the dose optimization during pre-clinical investigations of this compound. The PBPK model will serve as an important clinical translational tool."

Suppression of inflammatory responses and promotion of Th2 responses prevent pathogenesis. IL-4 commonly promotes Th2 responses and inhibits inflammatory and Th1 responses. Therefore, IL-4 is widely considered as a beneficial cytokine via its Th2-promoting role that is predicted to provide protection against severe malaria by inhibiting inflammatory responses. However, IL-4 may also induce inflammatory responses, as the result of IL-4 action depends on the timing and levels of its production and the tissue environment in which it is produced. Recently, we showed that dendritic cells (DCs) produce IL-4 early during malaria infection in response to a parasite protein and that this IL-4 response may contribute to severe malaria. However, the mechanism by which IL-4 produced by DCs contributing to lethal malaria is unknown. Using Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected C57BL/6 mice, a CM model, we show here that mice lacking IL-4Rα only in CD8α+ DCs are protected against CM pathogenesis and survive, whereas WT mice develop CM and die. Compared with WT mice, mice lacking IL-4Rα in CD11c+ or CD8α+ DCs showed reduced inflammatory responses leading to decreased Th1 and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses, lower infiltration of CD8+ T cells to the brain, and negligible brain pathology. The novel results presented here reveal a paradoxical role of IL-4Rα signaling in CM pathogenesis that promotes CD8α+ DC-mediated inflammatory responses that generate damaging Th1 and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses.

Malaria caused by the protozoan parasites of the Plasmodium genus, especially by Plasmodium falciparum, manifests in several organ-related fatal pathologies, including cerebral malaria (CM), acute lung and liver injury, and kidney damage (1de Souza M.C. Pádua T.A. das Graças Henriques M. Multiple organ dysfunction during severe malaria: The role of the inflammatory response.in: Rodriguez-Marales A.J. Current Topics in Malaria. InTech Publishing, Rijeka, Croatia2016Crossref Google Scholar). Of these pathologies, CM is the most devastating (2Storm J. Craig A.G. Pathogenesis of cerebral malaria-inflammation and cytoadherence.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2014; 4: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Proinflammatory cytokines play key roles in the development of protective immunity to malaria, but their persistent elevated levels subsequently contribute to severe malaria (3Hunt N.H. Grau G.E. Cytokines: Accelerators and brakes in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 491-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Dendritic cells (DCs) play key roles in malaria by producing early proinflammatory responses and inducing adaptive immune responses through antigen presentation (4Amorim K.N. Chagas D.C.

Opdenakker G. Van den Steen P.E. The immunological balance between host and parasite in malaria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 40: 208-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After malaria infection, DCs of the host are the major early responders that produce proinflammatory cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN-I), TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 (3Hunt N.H. Grau G.E.

Pham T.-T. Opdenakker G. Van den Steen P.E. The immunological balance between host and parasite in malaria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 40: 208-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The combined action of DC presenting antigens and cytokine signaling, particularly that of IL-12, activates NK and T cells, lead to Th1 development, IFN-γ production, and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity (6Walsh K.P. Mills K.H. Dendritic cells and other innate determinants of T helper cell polarisation.Trends Immunol. 2013; 34: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Normally, as infection progresses, DCs gradually produce lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, concomitantly increasing the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10, leading to Th2 development and IL-4 production (4Amorim K.N. Chagas D.C. Sulczewski F.B. Boscardin S.B. Dendritic cells and their multiple roles during malaria infection.J. Immunol. Res. 2016; 20162926436Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 5Deroost K. Pham T.-T. Opdenakker G. Van den Steen P.E. The immunological balance between host and parasite in malaria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 40: 208-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Collectively, these responses result in protective immunity to malaria, reducing the risk of pathogenesis. However, unbalanced pro-/anti-inflammatory and Th1/Th2 responses contribute to severe pathologies (5Deroost K. Pham T.-T. Opdenakker G. Van den Steen P.E. The immunological balance between host and parasite in malaria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 40: 208-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). During the liver stage of malaria infection, IL-4/IL-4R signaling plays important roles in the development of protective effector and memory CD8+ T cell responses (7Morrot A. Zavala F. Regulation of the CD8+ T cell responses against Plasmodium liver stages in mice.Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the blood stage of malaria infection, IL-4 and IL-4R gene polymorphisms associate with increased incidences of CM, and severe anemia and illnesses (8Verra F. Luoni G. Calissano C. Troye-Blomberg M. Perlmann P. Perlmann H. Arcà B. Sirima B.S. Konaté A. Coluzzi M. Kwiatkowski D. Modiano D.

Dis. 2009; 200: 1530-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, how IL-4/IL-4Rα signaling contributes to severe malaria illnesses remains not understood. Although IL-4 is primarily a master Th2 effector, it induces opposing effects depending on timing and levels of its production in the prevailing immune and tissue microenvironments (10Paul W.E. History of interleukin-4.Cytokine. 2015; 75: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gaining insight into the mechanisms by which IL-4Rα signaling contributes to lethal malaria is likely to be useful in developing effective vaccine and/or therapeutics. Studies have shown that DCs treated with IL-4 produce IL-12p70, which is inflammatory and induces Th1 and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses (11Yao Y. Li W. Kaplan M.H. Chang C.-H.

Recently, we showed that, splenic CD8α− DCs, but not CD8α+ DCs, in PbA-infected mice produce IL-4 (15Wu X. Gowda N.M. Kawasawa Y.I. Gowda D.C.

In addition, DCs treated in vitro with P. falciparum–infected red blood cells (IRBCs) or whole parasite proteins produce IL-4 and that IL-4 production may contribute to severe malaria (15Wu X.

However, it is not known how IL-4Rα signaling induced by endogenous IL-4 contributes to lethal malaria. Based on the above observations (11Yao Y. Li W. Kaplan M.H. Chang C.-H.

Dis. 2009; 200: 1530-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that IL-4/IL-4Rα signaling contributes to fatal malaria pathogenesis by upregulating inflammatory responses by DCs. We tested this hypothesis in Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected C57BL/6 mice, an experimental CM (ECM) model that exhibits neurological conditions similar to those of human CM. The results show, for the first time, that mice lacking IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs resist the development of CM through downregulation of proinflammatory and Th1 responses, leading to reduction in the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and reduced infiltration of these cells into the brains. To test the hypothesis that IL-4/IL-4Rα signaling in DCs contributes to CM, we conditionally deleted IL-4Rα in CD11c+ DCs, CD8α+ DCs, or T cells by crossing IL-4Rαfl/fl mice, respectively, with CD11cCre (16Caton M.L. Smith-Raska M.R. Reizis S. Notch-RBP-J signaling controls the homeostasis of CD8- dendritic cells in the spleen.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), Clec9ACre (17Schraml B.U. Van Blijswijk J. Zelenay S. Whitney P.G. Filby A. Acton S.E. Rogers N.C. Moncaut N. Carvajal J.J. Reis e Sousa C. Genetic tracing via DNGR-1 expression history defines dendritic cells as a hematopoietic lineage.Cell. 2013; 154: 843-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and LckCre mice (18Hennet T. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. T-cell-specific deletion of a polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene by site-directed recombination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12070-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which express Cre recombinase under the control of CD11c, Clec9A, and Lck promoter, respectively. The mice deficient in IL-4Rα in classical DCs (cDCs, CD11c+ DCs) (CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice), CD8α+ DCs (Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice), or T cells (LckCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice) were selected by genotyping (Fig. S1). We analyzed IL-4Rα expression in splenic DCs of wild-type (WT), IL-4Rα−/−, CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl, and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice by flow cytometry. Both cDCs of WT mice and CD8α− DCs of Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice expressed IL-4Rα at normal levels. However, there was no significant expression of IL-4Rα by cDCs in CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice, CD8α+DCs in Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice, or both cDCs and CD8α+ DCs in IL-4Rα−/− mice that lack IL-4Rα globally (Fig. 1). These results indicate that Cre-lox recombination deleted IL-4Rα in cDCs of CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice and CD8α+DCs of Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice. The conditional IL-4Rα knockout mice were infected with PbA and monitored for survival and parasitemia. Cohoused WT mice, CD11cCre mice, littermate WT (Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl) mice obtained from either CD11cCre-lox or Clec9ACre-lox cross, and IL-4Rα−/− mice were used as controls. All cohoused WT, CD11cCre, and Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice developed severe symptoms of CM at 6 to 8 days postinfection (dpi), exhibiting limb paralysis, deviation of the head, ataxia, lack of sensory and motor control, and died between 8 and 11 dpi. Also, ∼90% IL-4Rα−/− mice and LckCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice developed severe CM conditions and died between 9 and 11 dpi (Fig. 2A). The remaining ∼10% mice developed moderate CM conditions, but still died at 16 dpi. In contrast, ∼85% infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice and ∼65% infected Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice were protected against pathogenesis of CM and survived until 25 and 28 dpi, respectively, and died between 26 and 29 dpi (Fig. 2A). There were no significant differences in parasitemia in all mouse groups, including control mice (Fig. 2B). In the mice that survived CM conditions, parasitemia steadily increased after 14 dpi, reaching ∼50% by 24 dpi and then all died. Together, these results indicate that IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs, but not in other cell types, including T cells, contributes to ECM. Common pathological features of CM in humans and mice include infiltration of immune cells to the brain and loss of blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, leading to vascular leakage and brain dysfunction (19Riggle B.A. Manglani M. Maric D. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Neto O.L.A. Taylor T.E. Seydel K.B. Nath A. Miller L.H. CD8+ T cells target cerebrovasculature in children with cerebral malaria.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 130: 1128-1138Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine the role of IL-4Rα signaling in DCs contributing to ECM clinical conditions, we examined pathological features in the brains of PbA-infected Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl, IL-4Rα−/−, CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl, and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice. We assessed BBB damage in infected mice by injecting Evans blue, a dye that binds to serum albumin and normally does not enter the brain. There was negligible entry of albumin–Evans blue complex into the brains of infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 3, A and B). By contrast, infected littermate WT (Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl) mice had substantially high levels of Evans blue in the brains. These results demonstrated that IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs contributes to malaria-induced BBB disruption. H&E-stained brain sections of cohoused infected WT, IL-4Rα−/− and Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice at 6 dpi showed high levels of immune cell infiltration in blood vessels (Fig. 3, C and D). By contrast, there was no significant infiltration of immune cells in infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 3, C and D). Together the above results indicated that IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs contributes to ECM. As IL-4/IL-4Rα signaling can induce inflammatory responses by cDCs via induction of IL-12p70 production (11Yao Y. Li W. Kaplan M.H. Chang C.-H. Interleukin (IL)-4 inhibits IL-10 to promote IL-12 production by dendritic cells.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Guenova E. Volz T. Sauer K. Kaesler S. Müller M.R. Wölbing F. Chen K. Schwärzler C. Brossart P. Röcken M. Biedermann T. IL-4-mediated fine tuning of IL-12p70 production by human DC.Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 3138-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that IL-4Rα signaling in response to malaria early during infection activates DCs to produce inflammatory cytokines, contributing to ECM. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of costimulatory molecules and IL-12p35 that indicates the levels of functional IL-12p70 by splenic DCs in PbA-infected mice. At 4 dpi, compared with cDCs of littermate WT (Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl) mice, cDCs of infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice were substantially less activated as indicated by lower surface levels of the costimulatory molecule CD86, which is normally upregulated upon DC activation in response to pathogenic infections (Fig. 4A). At 5 dpi, the percentages of IL-12p70-producing CD8α+ DCs in CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice were significantly lower compared with Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrated that IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs promotes the activation and proinflammatory cytokine production by DCs in response to malaria infection. Activated DCs produce cytokines that signal to regulate the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses (6Walsh K.P. Mills K.H. Dendritic cells and other innate determinants of T helper cell polarisation.Trends Immunol. 2013; 34: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In particular, IL-12 signaling and antigen presentation by DCs activate T cells, promoting Th1 development. At 4 dpi, the activation of both splenic CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, measured by expression of CD69, was significantly lower in CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice than in Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 4, C and D). Further, the frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing the transcription factor Tbet, which indicates differentiation into Th1 cells, were significantly lower in CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 4F). Consistent with these results, the frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ was lower and the frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing IL-10 was higher in both infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice compared with Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 4E). Importantly, the frequency of granzyme B-expressing CD8+ T cells, which are known to migrate to the brains of PbA-infected mice and damage the BBB (19Riggle B.A. Manglani M. Maric D. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Neto O.L.A. Taylor T.E. Seydel K.B. Nath A. Miller L.H. CD8+ T cells target cerebrovasculature in children with cerebral malaria.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 130: 1128-1138Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), was lower in infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice than those in Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl WT mice (Fig. 4F). Collectively, the above data demonstrated that IL-4Rα signaling in DCs creates an inflammatory state, leading to marked increase in Th1 response and cytolytic function of CD8+ T cells, each of which contribute to ECM. Further, the above results taken together with our observation that global or T-cell-specific deficiency in IL-4Rα signaling results in ECM pathology and mortality indicate that IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs contributes to ECM pathogenesis. During ECM, T cells enter the brain, creating an inflammatory condition contributing to ECM pathology via CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ and CD8+ T cells producing granzyme B (20Villegas-Mendez A.

Invest. 2020; 130: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). So, we examined the role of IL-4Rα signaling in T cell infiltration into the brains. At 6 dpi, the numbers of immune cells that infiltrated into the brains of PbA-infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice were substantially lower compared with Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 5, A and B). CXCR3 is known to mediate the infiltration of T cells into the brains of PbA-infected mice (23Campanella G.S. Tager A.M. El Khoury J.K. Thomas S.Y. Abrazinski T.A. Manice L.A. Colvin R.A. Luster A.D.

A. 2008; 105: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The numbers of CXCR3 expressing CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells infiltrated into the brains were also significantly lower in infected CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice than in Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice (Fig. 5C). Although both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells move into the brain during ECM, it is granzyme B-producing cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that disrupt BBB integrity by interacting with endothelial cells, contributing to ECM pathology (19Riggle B.A. Manglani M. Maric D. Johnson K.R. Lee M.-H. Neto O.L.A. Taylor T.E. Seydel K.B. Nath A. Miller L.H. CD8+ T cells target cerebrovasculature in children with cerebral malaria.J. Clin.

Invest. 2020; 130: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The numbers of granzyme B+CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl compared with Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl WT mice (Fig. 5D). Additionally, the numbers of CD11a/LFA-1-expressing CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in CD11cCre.IL-4Rαfl/fl and Clec9ACre.IL-4Rαfl/fl mice compared with Cre−.IL-4Rαfl/fl control mice (Fig. 5E). In addition to its role as a marker of T cell activation, LFA-1 functions as a receptor for the adherence of CD8+ T cells to endothelia by binding to ICAM-1 (24Makgoba M.W. Sanders M.E. Luce G.E.G. Gugel E.A. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Shaw S. Functional evidence that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a ligand for IFA-1-dependent adhesion in T cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The LFA-1-mediated ICAM-1-dependent interaction of granzyme B-expressing CD8+ T cells with endothelial cells results in the disruption of BBB and ECM pathology (25Swanson II, P.A. Hart G.T. Russo M.V. Nayak D. Yazew T. Peña M. Khan S.M. Janse C.J. Pierce S.K. McGavern D.B. CD8+ T cells induce fatal brainstem pathology during cerebral malaria via luminal antigen-specific engagement of brain vasculature.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1006022Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together these results indicated that IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs promotes infiltration of T cells into the brains and increases the cytotoxicity in CD8+ T cells, contributing to ECM pathology and mortality. The novel finding of this study is that IL-4Rα signaling in CD8α+ DCs induces inflammatory responses to malaria, promoting Th1 development and cytotoxic lytic function of CD8+ T cells. Subsequently, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells infiltrate into brains and damage BBB via LFA-I-mediated ICAM-1-dependent interaction with endothelial cells, contributing to ECM and mortality (19Riggle B.A. Manglani M.

https://openalex.org/W3141782953,"Bassoon (BSN) is a presynaptic cytomatrix protein ubiquitously present at chemical synapses of the central nervous system, where it regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment and organizes voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In sensory photoreceptor synapses, BSN additionally plays a decisive role in anchoring the synaptic ribbon, a presynaptic organelle and functional extension of the active zone, to the presynaptic membrane. In this study, we functionally and structurally analyzed two mutant mouse lines with a genetic disruption of Bsn—Bsngt and Bsnko—using electrophysiology and high-resolution microscopy. In both Bsn mutant mouse lines, full-length BSN was abolished, and photoreceptor synaptic function was similarly impaired, yet synapse structure was more severely affected in Bsngt/gt than in Bsnko/ko photoreceptors. The synaptic defects in Bsngt/gt retina coincide with remodeling of the outer retina—rod bipolar and horizontal cell sprouting, formation of ectopic ribbon synaptic sites—and death of cone photoreceptors, processes that did not occur in Bsnko/ko retina. An analysis of Bsngt/ko hybrid mice revealed that the divergent retinal phenotypes of Bsngt/gt and Bsnko/ko mice can be attributed to the expression of the Bsngt allele, which triggers cone photoreceptor death and neurite sprouting in the outer retina. These findings shed new light on the existing Bsn mutant mouse models and might help to understand mechanisms that drive photoreceptor death."
https://openalex.org/W3142861708,"Aim Osteoporotic fractures negatively impact health-related quality of life and prognosis. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) impair bone quality and reduce bone strength. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between plasma levels of pentosidine, a surrogate marker for AGEs, and prevalent fractures in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Methods This cross-sectional study included 324 patients with CLD. Vertebral fractures were evaluated using lateral thoracolumbar spine radiographs. Information on prevalent fractures was obtained through a medical interview, medical records, and/or radiography. The patients were classified into low (L), intermediate (I), and high (H) pentosidine (Pen) groups based on baseline plasma pentosidine levels. Results Of the 324 patients, 105 (32.4%) had prevalent fractures. The prevalence of liver cirrhosis (LC) and prevalent fractures significantly increased stepwise with elevated pentosidine levels. The H-Pen group had the highest prevalence of LC (88.6%, p &lt; 0.001) and prevalent fractures (44.3%, p = 0.007), whereas the L-Pen group had the lowest prevalence of LC (32.1%, p &lt; 0.001) and prevalent fractures (21.0%, p = 0.007). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pentosidine as a significant independent factor related to prevalent fractures (odds ratio = 1.069, p &lt; 0.001). Pentosidine levels increased stepwise and correlated with liver disease severity. They were markedly high in patients with decompensated LC. In multiple regression analysis, liver functional reserve factors (total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio) significantly and independently correlated with pentosidine levels. Conclusions Plasma pentosidine was significantly associated with prevalent fractures and liver functional reserve in patients with CLD. Pentosidine may be useful in predicting fracture risk and should be closely followed in CLD patients with advanced disease."
https://openalex.org/W3146908390,"Myrf is a pleiotropic membrane-bound transcription factor that plays critical roles in diverse organisms, including in oligodendrocyte differentiation, embryonic development, molting, and synaptic plasticity. Upon autolytic cleavage, the Myrf N-terminal fragment enters the nucleus as a homo-trimer and functions as a transcription factor. Homo-trimerization is essential for this function because it imparts DNA-binding specificity and affinity. Recent exome sequencing studies have implicated four de novo MYRF DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutations (F387S, Q403H, G435R, and L479V) in novel syndromic birth defects involving the diaphragm, heart, and the urogenital tract. It remains unknown whether and how these four mutations alter the transcription factor function of MYRF. Here, we studied them by introducing homologous mutations to the mouse Myrf protein. We found that the four DBD mutations abolish the transcriptional activity of the Myrf N-terminal fragment by interfering with its homo-trimerization ability by perturbing the DBD structure. Since the Myrf N-terminal fragment strictly functions as a homo-trimer, any loss-of-function mutation has the potential to act as a dominant negative. We observed that one copy of Myrf-F387S, Myrf-Q403H, or Myrf-L479V, but not Myrf-G435R, was tolerated by the Myrf N-terminal homo-trimer for structural and functional integrity. These data suggest that F387S, Q403H, and L479V cause birth defects by haploinsufficiency, while G435R does so via dominant negative functionality."
https://openalex.org/W3146597825,"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different selection practices on the environmental sensitivity of reproductive and growth traits in males and females of three Nellore selection lines [control (NeC), selection (NeS), and traditional (NeT) lines]. Moreover, genetic trends for the intercept and slope were estimated for each line, and the possible reranking of sires was examined. A total of 8,757 records of selection weight (SW), 3,331 records of scrotal circumference (SC), and 2,311 records of days to first calving (DFC) from Nellore cattle born between 1981 and 2017 were analyzed. (Co)variance components and genetic parameters of all traits were estimated using a reaction norm model with Gibbs sampler. In all cattle lines, the mean heritability of the studied traits ranged from 0.39 to 0.75 for SW in both males and females, from 0.46 to 0.68 for SC, and from 0.06 to 0.57 for DFC along with the environmental descriptor. In all cattle lines, the genetic correlation coefficients between the intercept and slope ranged from 0.03 to 0.81 for SW, from -0.14 to 0.39 for SC, and from -0.87 to -0.42 for DFC. Genetic trends for the slope and proportion of plastic genotypes indicated that the NeS line was more responsive to environmental changes, whereas the NeC and NeT lines tended to respond more modestly. Reranking of sires was observed for all traits, specifically in the NeC and NeT lines, because of the weak correlation between the opposite extreme environments. In the NeS line, reranking of sires was observed for DFC alone. Our results indicate that the effects of genotype-environment interaction are important and should be considered in genetic evaluations of Nellore cattle. Moreover, different selection practices affected the environmental sensitivity of the Nellore selection lines tested in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3152341008,"Introduction Early postnatal care (EPNC) utilisation is crucial for averting maternal deaths as recommended by the World Health Organisation. About 30% of women do not obtain EPNC in Ghana and no national level study have investigated the determinants of EPNC. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing factors associated with EPNC uptake among women aged 15–49 in Ghana. Materials and methods The study utilised data from the women’s file of the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) and sampled 1,678 women aged 15–49 who had complete data on EPNC. Descriptive computation of EPNC was done. Since EPNC (which is the main outcome variable for the study) was dichotomous, the binary logistic regression was used to determine factors influencing utilisation of EPNC at 95% two-tailed confidence interval. The results were presented as adjusted odds ratio (AOR). Stata version 14.0 was used for all the analyses. Results Descriptively, the results indicated that 31% of women aged 15–49 sought EPNC. At the inferential level, women aged 40–44 were more likely to seek EPNC compared to those aged 15–19 [AOR = 3.66, CI = 1.25–10.67]. Islam women had higher odds of EPNC as compared with Christians [AOR = 1.70, CI = 1.23–2.35]. Comparatively, women of Mande ethnic group had higher propensity to seek EPNC than the Akan [AOR = 3.22, CI = 1.20–8.69]. Residents of the Greater Accra region were over 11 times probable to utilise EPNC compared with the residents of Western region. Conclusion The key determinants of EPNC were age, religion, ethnicity, marital status and region. Therefore, the Health Promotion and Education Unit and Reproductive and Child Health Department of the Ghana Health Service need to scale up EPNC sensitisation programmes and should target women aged 15–19, Christians and other category of women with less likelihood of EPNC in order to offset the disparities."
https://openalex.org/W3141667630,"Vascular rarefaction due to impaired angiogenesis is associated with contractile dysfunction and the transition from compensation to decompensation and heart failure. The regulatory mechanism controlling vascular rarefaction during the transition remains elusive. Increased expression of a nuclear RNA-binding protein CUGBP Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1) in the adult heart is associated with the transition from compensated hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure. Elevated CELF1 level resulted in degradation of the major cardiac gap junction protein, connexin 43, in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the most common cause of heart failure. In the present study, we investigated the role of increased CELF1 expression in causing vascular rarefaction in DCM. CELF1 overexpression (CELF1-OE) in cardiomyocytes resulted in reduced capillary density. CELF1-OE mice administered hypoxyprobe showed immunoreactivity and increased mRNA levels of HIF1α, Glut-1, and Pdk-1, which suggested the association of a reduced capillary density-induced hypoxic condition with CELF1 overexpression. Vegfa mRNA level was downregulated in mouse hearts exhibiting DCM, including CELF1-OE and infarcted hearts. Vegfa mRNA level was also downregulated to a similar extent in cardiomyocytes isolated from infarcted hearts by Langendorff preparation, which suggested cardiomyocyte-derived Vegfa expression mediated by CELF1. Cardiomyocyte-specific depletion of CELF1 preserved the capillary density and Vegfa mRNA level in infarcted mouse hearts. Also, CELF1 bound to Vegfa mRNA and regulated Vegfa mRNA stability via the 3' untranslated region. These results suggest that elevated CELF1 level has dual effects on impairing the functions of cardiomyocytes and microvasculature in DCM."
https://openalex.org/W3143162940,"The potential ergogenic effects of vitamin D (vitD) in high performing athletes has received considerable attention in the literature and media. However, little is known about non-supplemented university athletes and students residing at a higher latitude. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitD (biochemical status and dietary intake) on exercise performance in UK university athletes and sedentary students. A total of 34 athletes and 16 sedentary controls were studied during the spring and summer months. Serum vitD status and sunlight exposure were assessed using LC-MS/MS and dosimetry, respectively. Muscular strength of the upper and lower body was assessed using handgrip and knee extensor dynamometry (KE). Countermovement jump (CMJ) and aerobic fitness were measured using an Optojump and VO 2max test, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using paired/ independent t-tests, ANCOVA and Pearson/ Spearman correlations, depending on normality. VitD status increased significantly over the seasons, with athletes measuring higher status both in spring (51.7±20.5 vs. 37.2±18.9 nmol/L, p = 0.03) and summer (66.7±15.8 vs 55.6±18.8 nmol/L, p = 0.04) when compared to controls, respectively. Notably, 22% of the subjects recruited were vitD deficient during the spring term only (&lt;25nmol/L, n 9). Subjects with ‘insufficient’ vitD status (&lt;50nmol/L) elicited significantly lower CMJ when contrasted to the vitD ‘sufficient’ (&gt;50nmol/l) group (p = 0.055) and a lower VO 2 max (p = 0.05) in the spring and summer term (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively). However, an ANCOVA test showed no significant difference detected for either CMJ or VO 2max following adjustments for co-variates. In conclusion, we provide novel information on the vitD status, dietary intake, physical fitness and sunlight exposure of UK young adults across two separate seasons, for which there is limited data at present."
https://openalex.org/W3143325997,"Context Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disease with different subtypes and unclear etiology. Among the frequent comorbidities are autoimmune diseases, suggesting that autoantibodies (aAb) may be involved in PCOS pathogenesis. Objective As the gonadal axis often is dysregulated, we tested the hypothesis that aAb to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) are of diagnostic value in PCOS. Design An in vitro assay for quantifying aAb to the GnRH-R (GnRH-R-aAb) was established by using a recombinant fusion protein of full-length human GnRH-R and firefly luciferase. A commercial rabbit antiserum to human GnRH-R was used for standardization. Serum samples of control subjects and different cohorts of European PCOS patients (n = 1051) were analyzed. Results The novel GnRH-R-aAb assay was sensitive, and signals were linear on dilution when tested with the commercial GnRH-R antiserum. Natural GnRH-R-aAb were detected in one control (0.25%) and two PCOS samples (0.31%), and 12 samples were slightly above the threshold of positivity. The identification of samples with positive GnRH-R-aAb was reproducible and the signals showed no matrix interferences. Conclusion Natural GnRH-R-aAb are present in a very small fraction of adult control and PCOS subjects of European decent. Our results do not support the hypothesis that the GnRH-R constitutes a relevant autoantigen in PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W3144964168,"Studies demonstrate a role for neurotensin (NT) in obesity and related comorbidities. Bile acid (BA) homeostasis alterations are associated with obesity. We determined the effect of NT on BA metabolism in obese and non-obese conditions. Plasma and fecal BA profiles were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in male and female NT+/+ and NT-/- mice fed low-fat (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks (early stage of obesity) or greater than 20 weeks (late stage of obesity). The nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and BA transporter mRNA expression were assessed in ileum, mouse enteroids, and human cell lines. HFD decreased plasma primary and secondary BAs in NT+/+ mice; HFD-induced decrease of plasma BAs was improved in NT-deficient mice. In NT+/+ mice, HFD inhibited ileal FXR and BA transporter expression; HFD-decreased expression of FXR and BA transporters was prevented in NT-/- mice. Compared with LFD-fed NT+/+ mice, LFD-fed NT-/- mice had relatively lower levels of ileal FXR and BA transporter expression. Moreover, NT stimulates the expression of FXR and BA transporters in Caco-2 cells; however, stimulated expression of BA transporters was attenuated in NT-/- enteroids. Therefore, we demonstrate that HFD disrupts the BA metabolism and ileal FXR and BA transporter axis which are improved in the absence of NT, suggesting that NT contributes to HFD-induced disruption of BA metabolism and plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of ileal FXR and BA transporter signaling under obese conditions. Conversely, NT positively regulates the expression of ileal FXR and BA transporters under non-obese conditions. Therefore, NT plays a dual role in obese and non-obese conditions, suggesting possible therapeutic strategies for obesity control."
https://openalex.org/W3145714561,"The cochlear efferent feedback system plays important roles in auditory processing, including regulation of the dynamic range of hearing, and provides protection against acoustic trauma. These functions are performed through medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. The serotonin type 3A (5-HT3A) receptor is widely expressed throughout the nervous system, which suggests important roles in various neural functions. However, involvement of the 5-HT3A receptor in the MOC system remains unclear. We used mice in this study and found that the 5-HT3A receptor was expressed in MOC neurons that innervated outer hair cells in the cochlea and was involved in the activation of MOC neurons by noise exposure. 5-HT3A receptor knockout impaired MOC functions, potentiated noise-induced hearing loss, and increased loss of ribbon synapses following noise exposure. Furthermore, 5-HT3 receptor agonist treatment alleviated the noise-induced hearing loss and loss of ribbon synapses, which enhanced cochlear protection provided by the MOC system. Our findings demonstrate that the 5-HT3A receptor plays fundamental roles in the MOC system and critically contributes to protection from noise-induced hearing impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3139551688,"Transendothelial migration (TEM) of neutrophils under blood flow is critical in the inflammatory cascade. However, the role of endothelial plasticity in this process is not fully understood. Therefore, we used an in vitro model to test the dynamics of human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) TEM across lipopolysaccharide-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers. Interestingly, shRNA-E-selectin knockdown in HUVECs destabilized endothelial junctional integrity by reducing actin branching and increasing stress fiber at cell-cell junctions. This process is accomplished by downregulating the activation of cortactin and Arp2/3, which in turn alters the adhesive function of VE-cadherin, enhancing PMN transmigration. Meanwhile, redundant P-selectins possess overlapping functions in E-selectin-mediated neutrophil adhesion, and transmigration. These results demonstrate, to our knowledge, for the first time, that E-selectins negatively regulate neutrophil transmigration through alterations in endothelial plasticity. Furthermore, it improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying actin remodeling, and junctional integrity, in endothelial cells mediating leukocyte TEM."
https://openalex.org/W3140249501,"The muscle regeneration process requires a properly assembled extracellular matrix (ECM). Its homeostasis depends on the activity of different matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). The reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) is a membrane-anchored protein that negatively regulates the activity of different MMPs. However, the role of RECK in the process of skeletal muscle differentiation, regeneration, and fibrosis has not been elucidated. Here, we show that during skeletal muscle differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and in satellite cells on isolated muscle fibers, RECK is transiently up regulated. C2C12 myoblasts with reduced RECK levels are more prone to enter the differentiation program, showing an accelerated differentiation process. Notch-1 signaling was reduced, while p38 and AKT signaling were augmented in myoblasts with decreased RECK levels. Overexpression of RECK restores the normal differentiation process but diminished the ability to form myotubes. Transient up-regulation of RECK occurs during skeletal muscle regeneration, which was accelerated in RECK-deficient mice (Reck±). RECK, MMPs and ECM proteins augmented in chronically damaged WT muscle, a model of muscle fibrosis. In this model, RECK ± mice showed diminished fibrosis compared to WT. These results strongly suggest that RECK is acting as a potential myogenic repressor during muscle formation and regeneration, emerging as a new player in these processes, and as a potential target to treat individuals with the muscle-wasting disease."
https://openalex.org/W3144418742,"High-Grade Gliomas (HGG) are the most frequent brain tumor in adults. The gold standard of clinical care recommends beginning chemoradiation within 6 weeks of surgery. Disparities in access to healthcare in Argentina are notorious, often leading to treatment delays. We conducted this retrospective study to evaluate if time to chemoradiation after surgery is correlated with progression-free survival (PFS). Our study included clinical cases with a histological diagnosis of Glioblastoma (GBM), Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA) or High-Grade Glioma (HGG) in patients over 18 years of age from 2014 to 2020. We collected data on clinical presentation, type of resection, time to surgery, time to chemoradiation, location within the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (BAMA) and type of health insurance. We found 63 patients that fit our inclusion criteria, including 26 (41.3%) females and 37 (58.7%) males. Their median age was 54 years old (19–86). Maximal safe resection was achieved in 49.2% (n = 31) of the patients, incomplete resection in 34.9% (n = 22) and the other 15.9% (n = 10) received a biopsy, but no resection. The type of health care insurance was almost evenly divided, with 55.6% (n = 35) of the patients having public vs. 44.4% (n = 28) having private health insurance. Median time to chemoradiation after surgery was 8 (CI 6.68–9.9) weeks for the global population. When we ordered the patients PFS by time to chemoradiation we found that there was a statistically significant effect of time to chemoradiation on patient PFS. Patients had a PFS of 10 months (p = 0.014) (CI 6.89–13.10) when they received chemoradiation &lt;5 weeks vs a PFS of 7 months (CI 4.93–9.06) when they received chemoradiation between 5 to 8 weeks and a PFS of 4 months (CI 3.76–4.26 HR 2.18 p = 0.006) when they received chemoradiation &gt;8 weeks after surgery. Also, our univariate and multivariate analysis found that temporal lobe location (p = 0.03), GMB histology (p = 0.02) and biopsy as surgical intervention (p = 0.02) all had a statistically significant effect on patient PFS. Thus, time to chemoradiation is an important factor in patient PFS. Our data show that although an increase in HGG severity contributes to a decrease in patient PFS, there is also a large effect of time to chemoradiation. Our results suggest that we can improve patient PFS by making access to healthcare in Buenos Aires more equitable by reducing the average time to chemoradiation following tumor resection."
https://openalex.org/W3147425997,"After a violent earthquake, the supply of medical services may fall short of the rising demand, leading to overcrowding in hospitals, and, consequently, a collapse in the healthcare system. This paper takes the emergency care system in Taiwan as the research context, where first-aid hospitals are ranked to three levels, advanced, intermediate, and general, and, currently, emphasizes on a general emergency responsibility hospital. Having limited capacity and capability, a general emergency responsibility hospital treats minor and moderate injuries, from which the majority of earthquake-induced casualties suffer. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of this group of earthquake-induced non-urgent patients on the performance of a hospital. A patient flow model was built to represent patients’ paths throughout emergency care. Based on the model, discrete event simulation was applied to simulate patients’ trajectories and states of a hospital under four seismic scenarios, where patient visits are 1.4, 1.6, 1.9, and 2.3 times the normal number. A healthcare performance index, Crowdedness Index (CI), is proposed to measure crowdedness on a daily basis, which is defined as the ratio of the average waiting time for treatment to the recommended maximal waiting time. Results of simulations rendered the establishment of empirical equations, describing the relation between the maximum CIs and the patient growth ratios. In the most severe case in this study, the maximum CI exceeds 92 and it takes 10 days to recover from the quality drop. This highlights the problem a general emergency responsibility hospital may encounter if no emergency response measure is implemented. Findings are provided pertaining to the predication of a recovery curve and the alarming level of patient increase, which are supportive information for preparedness planning as well as response measure formulation to improve resilience."

Eastern North Pacific (ENP) killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) ecotypes differ in their diet, behavior, and morphology, but the same is not known for this species in the eastern Canadian Arctic (ECA) and Northwest Atlantic (NWA). Using compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of amino acids (AAs), we compared δ 15 N patterns of the primary trophic and source AA pair, glutamic acid/glutamine (Glx) and phenylalanine (Phe), in dentine collagen of (1) sympatric ENP killer whale ecotypes with well-characterized diet differences and (2) ECA/NWA killer whales with unknown diets. δ 15 N Glx-Phe was significantly higher in the ENP fish-eating (FE) than mammal-eating (ME) ecotype (19.2 ± 0.4‰ vs. 13.5 ± 0.7‰, respectively). Similar bimodal variation in δ 15 N Glx-Phe indicated analogous dietary divisions among ECA/NWA killer whales, with two killer whales having higher δ 15 N Glx-Phe (16.5 ± 0.0‰) than the others (13.5 ± 0.6‰). Inferences of dietary divisions between these killer whales were supported by parallel differences in threonine δ 15 N (–33.5 ± 1.6‰ and –40.4 ± 1.1‰, respectively), given the negative correlation between δ 15 N Thr and TP across a range of marine consumers. CSIA-AA results for ECA/NWA whales, coupled with differences in tooth wear (a correlate for diet), are consistent with ecotype characteristics reported in ENP and other killer whale populations, thus adding to documented ecological divergence in this species worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3146334657,"Introduction Deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have surpassed those due to communicable diseases globally and are projected to do so in Africa by 2030. Despite demonstrated effectiveness in high-income country (HIC) settings, the ED is a primary source of NCD care that has been under-prioritized in Africa. In this study, we assess the burden of leading NCDs and NCD risk factors in Kenyan Casualty Department patients to inform interventions targeting patients with NCDs in emergency care settings. Materials and methods Using the WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) tool and the Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), we conducted a survey of 923 adults aged 18 and over at Kenyatta National Hospital Emergency Department (KNH ED) between May-October 2018. Age, income, household size(t-test), sex, education, marital status, work status, and poverty status (chi-squared test or fisher’s exact test) were assessed using descriptive statistics and analyzed using covariate-adjusted logistic analysis. Results Over a third of respondents had hypertension (35.8%, n = 225/628), 18.3% had raised blood sugar or diabetes (18.3%, n = 61/333), and 11.7% reported having cardiovascular disease (11.7%, n = 90/769). Having lower levels of education was associated with tobacco use (OR 6.0, 95% CI 2.808–12.618, p &lt; 0.0001), while those with higher levels of education reported increased alcohol use (OR 0.620 (95% CI 0.386–0.994, p = 0. 0472). While a predominant proportion of respondents had had some form of screening for either hypertension (80.3%, n = 630/772), blood sugar (42.6%, n = 334/767) or cholesterol (13.9%, n = 109/766), the proportion of those on treatment was low, with the highest proportion being half of those diagnosed with hypertension reporting taking medication (51.6%, n = 116/225). Conclusions This study establishes the ED as a high-risk population with potential for high impact in East Africa, should targeted interventions be implemented. Comprehension of the unique epidemiology and characteristics of patients presenting to the ED is key to guide care in African populations."
https://openalex.org/W3147648981,"Hyperactivation of PARP1 is known to be a major cause of necrotic cell death by depleting NAD+/ATP pools during Ca2+ overload which is associated with many ischemic diseases. However, little is known about how PARP1 hyperactivity is regulated during calcium overload. In this study we show that ATR kinase, well known for its role in DNA damage responses, suppresses ionomycin, glutamate, or quinolinic acid-induced necrotic death of cells including SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. We found that the inhibition of necrosis requires the kinase activity of ATR. Specifically, ATR binds to and phosphorylates PARP1 at Ser179 after the ionophore treatments. This site-specific phosphorylation inactivates PARP1, inhibiting ionophore-induced necrosis. Strikingly, all of this occurs in the absence of detectable DNA damage and signaling up to 8 hours after ionophore treatment. Furthermore, little AIF was released from mitochondria/cytoplasm for nuclear import, supporting the necrotic type of cell death in the early period of the treatments. Our results reveal a novel ATR-mediated anti-necrotic mechanism in the cellular stress response to calcium influx without DNA damage signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3147870951,"Several studies have evidenced inadequate knowledge about epilepsy and inappropriate seizure management, influencing quality of life and social inclusion of patients with epilepsy. Aim of the study was to estimate the knowledge and the attitudes toward epilepsy in schoolteachers and students in Italy. Custom-designed and validated questionnaires in Italian on general and specific knowledge, and social impact of epilepsy have been administered in a random sample of schoolteachers and students. Overall, 667 schoolteachers and 672 students have been included. Among teachers and students, consider epilepsy a psychiatric disorder (16.8% and 26.5%) or an incurable disease (43.9% and 33%). The 47.5% of teachers declared to be unable to manage a seizing student, 55.8% thought it requires specific support and 21.6% reported issues in administer antiseizure medications in school. Healthcare professionals should have an active role in the educational system, dispelling myths, preparing educators and students with appropriate attitudes in the event of a seizure and prevent over limitations in patients with epilepsy. These findings highlight still poor knowledge and attitudes about epilepsy among teachers and students although the 99.4% claimed to have heard/read something about epilepsy. Therefore, improving existing dedicated educational/training interventions could be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3151139080,"Skeletal muscle tissue has a highly complex and heterogeneous structure comprising several physical length scales. In the simplest model of muscle tissue, it can be represented as a one dimensional nonlinear spring in the direction of muscle fibres. However, at the finest level, muscle tissue includes a complex network of collagen fibres, actin and myosin proteins, and other cellular materials. This study shall derive an intermediate physical model which encapsulates the major contributions of the muscle components to the elastic response apart from activation-related along-fibre responses. The micro-mechanical factors in skeletal muscle tissue (eg. connective tissue, fluid, and fibres) can be homogenized into one material aggregate that will capture the behaviour of the combination of material components. In order to do this, the corresponding volume fractions for each type of material need to be determined by comparing the stress-strain relationship for a volume containing each material. This results in a model that accounts for the micro-mechanical features found in muscle and can therefore be used to analyze effects of neuro-muscular diseases such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophies. The purpose of this study is to construct a model of muscle tissue that, through choosing the correct material parameters based on experimental data, will accurately capture the mechanical behaviour of whole muscle. This model is then used to look at the impacts of the bulk modulus and material parameters on muscle deformation and strain energy-density distributions."
https://openalex.org/W3139994133,"Purpose To investigate the therapeutic effect of local photothermal (PT) heating on suppression of stent-induced granulation tissue formation in mouse colon. Materials and methods A gold nanoparticle (GNP)-coated self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) was prepared using a two-step synthesis process for local PT heating under near-infrared laser irradiation. Twenty-four mice were randomly divided into two groups of 12 and subjected to SEMS placement in the colon. Group A received a GNP-coated SEMS without local heating and Group B received a GNP-coated SEMS and underwent local heating at 55°C after SEMS placement. The therapeutic effect of local heating was assessed by comparing the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and endoscopic results. Results Four mice were excluded because of stent migration (n = 3, group B) or death (n = 1, group A). Stent-induced granulation tissue-related variables were significantly lower in group B than in group A (p &lt; 0.001). In vivo endoscopic images, 4 weeks after stent placement, showed granulation tissue formation over the wire mesh in group A and relatively good patency of the stented colon with no definite irregularities in group B. There was more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) positivity in group A than in group B. Conclusion Local PT heating suppresses granulation tissue formation after stent placement in mouse colon."
https://openalex.org/W3144004496,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the main obstacles for therapies targeting brain diseases. Most macromolecules fail to pass the tight BBB, formed by brain endothelial cells interlinked by tight junctions. A wide range of small, lipid-soluble molecules can enter the brain parenchyma via diffusion, whereas macromolecules have to transcytose via vesicular transport. Vesicular transport can thus be utilized as a strategy to deliver brain therapies. By conjugating BBB targeting antibodies and peptides to therapeutic molecules or nanoparticles, it is possible to increase uptake into the brain. Previously, the synthetic peptide GYR and a peptide derived from melanotransferrin (MTfp) have been suggested as candidates for mediating transcytosis in brain endothelial cells (BECs). Here we study uptake, intracellular trafficking, and translocation of these two peptides in BECs. The peptides were synthesized, and binding studies to purified endocytic receptors were performed using surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, the peptides were conjugated to a fluorophore allowing for live-cell imaging studies of their uptake into murine brain endothelial cells. Both peptides bound to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) and the human transferrin receptor, while lower affinity was observed against the murine transferrin receptor. The MTfp showed a higher binding affinity to all receptors when compared to the GYR peptide. The peptides were internalized by the bEnd.3 mouse endothelial cells within 30 min of incubation and frequently co-localized with endo-lysosomal vesicles. Moreover, our in vitro Transwell translocation experiments confirmed that GYR was able to cross the murine barrier and indicated the successful translocation of MTfp. Thus, despite binding to endocytic receptors with different affinities, both peptides are able to transcytose across the murine BECs."
https://openalex.org/W3144049763,"This study aimed to describe the timing and patterns of pubertal maturation of girls living in rural Bangladesh. Starting in September 2015, a total of 15,320 girls from a birth cohort, aged 9 to 15 years at initial encounter, were visited twice at about a one year interval, typically in their birth month. Participants were asked to self-report extent of pubertal maturation, including breast development, pubic hair growth and age at menarche, if applicable. Pubertal stage (abbreviated as B2 and B3-4 for breast development and PH2 and PH3-4 for pubic hair growth) was assigned. Data from both visits were pooled, yielding a total of 29,377 age-related observations per pubertal characteristic. Probit regression models were used to estimate distributions of age at which each stage of pubertal development was attained. Before age 8, &lt;3% of the study population initiated pubertal maturation as indicated by onset of breast development (B2). The median (95% confidence interval) age of B2 and B3-4 was 11.02 (11.00–11.04) and 12.82 (12.80–12.83) years, respectively; and 12.93 (12.91–12.94) and 14.29 (14.27–14.31) years for the onset (PH2) and advanced stage (PH3-4) of pubic hair growth, respectively. Median age at menarche was 13.17 (13.15–13.19) years, with 2.15 years of timespan from B2 to menarche. Girls in rural Bangladesh progressed through puberty following a well-documented sequence of sexual maturation stages. The age at which each pubertal milestone took place was somewhat later, but the tempo from breast development to menarche was comparable to that observed elsewhere. Our findings present a current norm of pubertal maturation in a typical, rural adolescent population in South Asia, which could help inform future studies and interventions to preserve or improve early adolescent health and development."
https://openalex.org/W3144753821,"Little evidence exists about parental satisfaction and their influence on referral to paediatric Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT).This study aimed to examine the experiences of parents, children and clinicians of OPAT at a large tertiary children's hospital.A prospective e-survey, using closed and open questions, of parents (n = 33) of 33 children who had received OPAT (3 children completed a survey), and clinicians (n = 31) involved in OPAT at a tertiary hospital. Data were collected September 2016 to July 2018.Data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. The results show that OPAT offered benefits (less stress, re-establishment of family life) compared to hospital-based treatment for parents and children, although some were anxious. Clinicians' referral judgements were based on child, home, and clinical factors. Some clinicians found the process of referral complex.Most parents and children were satisfied with the OPAT service and preferred the option of home-based treatment as it promoted the child's comfort and recovery and supported family routines."
https://openalex.org/W3145491664,"This study aimed to explore the experiences of nursing students who have undertaken a short course in an overseas educational system to generate theoretical understanding of the experience of studying abroad. Learning in the health professions needs to considered in the context of globalization as a way of sharing knowledge and taking responsibility as world citizens. Studying abroad provides students with an opportunity to develop global health care competencies. A symbolic interactionist approach was adopted to gain insight into how the students constructed the meaning of studying abroad. The study was conducted at a university with 2 campuses in Taiwan. A purposive sampling strategy was employed to recruit 14 participants. Data were collected from August to November 2017 via individual in-depth interviews. A semi-structured interview guide was used. Qualitative content analysis was employed to analyse the data. Each interview was audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Most students identified both positive and negative experiences related to their professional and personal development and needs. They demonstrated motivation to leave their comfort zone and enter a challenging environment as well as a high level of adaptability. The experience enabled them to see themselves as part of the world and expanded their learning in positive ways. On completion of their course, they encouraged others to experience this enjoyable once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."

https://openalex.org/W3143204976,"COVID-19 has unfortunately halted lab work, conferences, and in-person networking, which is especially detrimental to researchers just starting their labs. Through social media and our reviewer networks, we met some early-career stem cell investigators impacted by the closures. Here, they introduce themselves and their research to our readers. COVID-19 has unfortunately halted lab work, conferences, and in-person networking, which is especially detrimental to researchers just starting their labs. Through social media and our reviewer networks, we met some early-career stem cell investigators impacted by the closures. Here, they introduce themselves and their research to our readers. During my training as an immunologist, I developed a secret love for stem cells. While studying type 1 diabetes, I had a naive question: are stem cells spared during autoimmunity? If not, regeneration could be compromised once immunological tolerance was restored. Thus, I sought to study whether tissue stem cells can evade cellular immunity. I discovered that most tissue stem cells are susceptible to immune attack, but some have an outstanding ability to cloak themselves from immune cells. My lab investigates the mechanisms controlling immune privilege in such stem cells and, as an extension, in cancer stem cells. We aim to use this knowledge to protect cells that are susceptible to immune recognition and, conversely, to identify how to effectively eliminate cancer stem cells by immunotherapy. When the pandemic started, everything got disrupted: the lab was closed, and I was stuck at home with my two little children. I was stressed about my trainees, my future, and my family in Spain. Then, another junior PI, who is also a mother of three children, reached out to me about my well-being and success. We started joint lab meetings and had honest conversations about our struggles. I felt seen and understood, and that made a whole world of difference. I learned a lesson and I no longer cloak like my beloved immune-privileged stem cells. I have joined committees for the advancement of women in science and for diversity, equity, and inclusion. COVID has taught me to speak up for myself, but also to work for those that may not have a voice. Adaptation to dietary changes profoundly influenced human evolution and continues to impact our modern lives. Tissue-resident adult stem and progenitor cells adjust their activity in response to their nutritional environment to maintain tissue homeostasis. Such adaptation relies on systemic mediators of inter-organ crosstalk to coordinate whole-body metabolism with the intracellular machinery that converts nutritional signals into transcriptional control of cell fate determination. My lab focuses on the interface of nutritional and transcriptional regulatory networks. We study how adult stem and progenitor cells perceive nutritional states and fine-tune their lineage decisions during tissue regeneration and disease development. Our goal is to translate nutrition facts into stem cell fate in the hopes of inspiring new therapeutic strategies. To this end, we use genetic mouse models, organoid systems, and transplantation experiments to identify and characterize the endocrinal and metabolic cell-fate determinants in the contexts of tissue homeostasis and adaptation to diet. The damages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are fact, not fate. I think the unexpected challenges in the past year are exceptional opportunities to explore new possibilities. Despite this ongoing uncertainty, the Cheng Lab at the Columbia Stem Cell Initiative (CSCI) started in the spring of 2021. With the guidance from leaders and the support from peers, we are excited to grow within our nourished niche and join the process of regeneration. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devasting disease initiated and maintained by leukemia stem cells (LSCs). To improve outcomes of AML patients, therapies designed to better eradicate LSCs are urgently needed. The goal of my lab is to develop new therapeutic strategies to target LSCs by identifying, characterizing, and targeting LSC-specific metabolic properties in AML patient samples. I immigrated to Canada in the spring of 2020 to start my lab at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. After a rushed drive with my husband and two dogs, we crossed the US-Canada border to find ourselves in a new city that would be shut down for months. Starting my faculty position during lockdown meant I had to hire and train lab members without meeting them face to face. While hardly ideal circumstances, this situation has forced my lab to quickly hone our communication skills and work together, which I believe will make us stronger in the long run. I have learned how self-motivated, resourceful, and talented my lab members are and it is exciting to see them starting to discover novel insights into LSC metabolism. This would not be possible without the support of my new colleagues. One thing I am particularly grateful for is to be going through this experience with another junior faculty member, Dr. Anastasia Tikhonova. Facing challenges together makes them feel more manageable and the process of overcoming them fun. I am hopeful for a bright future and will be forever thankful for the support I have been given by my team and colleagues. I’m fascinated by how epigenomic modifications determine not only cell fate, but also an array of subcellular and even tissue-level processes. For instance, epigenomic modifications influence regional mutation rates, but also more globally determine the tissue’s inflammatory state by controlling the expression of endogenous retroviruses. Increasingly, epigenomic deregulation is implicated in cancer initiation, in particular in pediatric cancers. In my lab we are addressing some intriguing yet unresolved questions: what are the epigenomic changes that turn a healthy cell into a cancerous one? Why is the developing body particularly vulnerable to epigenomically driven malignant transformation? Can the identification of the cells-of-origin of developmental cancers unlock novel treatment opportunities? I was ready to hit the ground running when I returned to the lab in March 2020 after maternity leave, with 4 months to complete a publication before the planned opening of my lab at IRSJD. That same month, the WHO declared a global pandemic, and life as we knew it came to a standstill. Yet, thanks to the scheduling creativity, collegiality, and kindness of the people around me, my plans were postponed only by a few months. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging, but it has also fostered solidarity, mutual understanding, and cooperation. Countless Zoom hours have consolidated old collaborations and forged new ones. My lab emerges from this experience with the firm belief that it is the consideration and appreciation of the people around us that ultimately make us more resilient. When COVID hit hard and my postdoc lab was forced to shut down, I was lucky enough to have already signed my dream job offer. But, with a skyrocketing number of cases delaying necessary lab renovations, my starting date was inevitably pushed back. One day, I was skimming through some books on management when I came upon this famous quote, and I realized the practice of scientific research fit perfectly with this lesson about preparedness. “Sharpening the axe” can mean something different to different people. To me, as a junior group leader in the times of COVID, it mostly meant honing in and polishing my scientific vision. The slow-down presented a great opportunity to take some time off from the bench to just think about science. What were the implications of my recent work and how did it relate to other findings in the field? How could it help address big, longstanding questions in stem cell and developmental biology? This sharpening has more than paid off, leading to exciting new questions, collaborations, and groundbreaking ideas. Now as the group leader of the Quantitative Stem Cell Dynamics lab at IRB Barcelona, I will be taking on the challenge of understanding how functional patterns emerge and evolve in regenerating and developing tissues, and how they drive disease variability, which is central to the success of personalized medicine. Overall, the lesson I learned is this: take time off, talk to collaborators, and think of the bigger picture. I know I’m not waiting until the next pandemic. Why do mammals fail to regenerate their limbs while some vertebrates, such as salamanders, have this capacity? Remarkably, mice and humans are still able to regenerate the tips of their fingers or toes, demonstrating that mammals are capable of multi-tissue regeneration. Using the mouse digit tip as a model system, my research focuses on understanding the molecular and cellular processes that promote complex tissue regeneration in lieu of fibrotic wound healing. After 5 years of postdoctoral training at the Hospital for Sick Children in Canada, I was thrilled to receive an offer to establish my own laboratory at the Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute. Only days after flying back to Canada following the interview, the COVID-19 pandemic shocked the nation and the lockdowns began. This ultimately delayed the next chapter of my life by 9 months. Although the pandemic has brought with it many challenges, I am overwhelmed by the support that I have received from both my past and present institute. Colleagues have gone out of their way to offer advice and provide support and with video conferencing becoming the “new normal.” I have had the opportunity to engage with many great scientific minds that I would not have imagined possible prior to the crisis. The pandemic has taught me that resilience, flexibility, and collaboration are fundamental traits for every young scientist and as I open the doors to my shiny new laboratory, I am hopeful and excited to begin the scientific journey ahead."

https://openalex.org/W3150047667,"Recognizing that microbial community composition within the human microbiome is associated with the physiological state of the host has sparked a large number of human microbiome association studies (HMAS). With the increasing size of publicly available HMAS data, the privacy risk is also increasing because HMAS metadata could contain sensitive private information. I demonstrate that a simple test statistic based on the taxonomic profiles of an individual’s microbiome along with summary statistics of HMAS data can reveal the membership of the individual’s microbiome in an HMAS sample. In particular, species-level taxonomic data obtained from small-scale HMAS can be highly vulnerable to privacy risk. Minimal guidelines for HMAS data privacy are suggested, and an assessment of HMAS privacy risk using the simulation method proposed is recommended at the time of study design."
