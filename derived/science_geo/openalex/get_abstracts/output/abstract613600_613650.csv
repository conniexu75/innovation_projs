https://openalex.org/W2810750457,"Soil tillage can affect the stability and formation of soil aggregates by disrupting soil structure. Frequent tillage deteriorates soil structure and weakens soil aggregates, causing them to be susceptible to decay. Different types of tillage systems affect soil physical properties and organic matter content, in turn influencing the formation of aggregates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term tillage on soil aggregates and aggregate-associated carbon in a black soil of Northeast China and to identify the optimal conservation tillage in this system. This research was conducted on a long-term tillage experimental field established in 1983 at the Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Gongzhuling, China. Plots were treated with four tillage systems including no tillage (NT), spacing tillage (ST), moldboard plowing (MP), and conventional tillage (CT). We took samples every 10cm from 0-60cm depth and demonstrated that water-stable soil aggregates >0.25mm in diameter accounted for over 66.0% of total aggregates for all tillage treatments, and the percentage for the ST treatment was 34.5% higher than in the other treatments. The NT treatment had the highest effect at 0-10cm depth, while the effect for the ST treatment was highest at 0-30cm. SOC storage decreased with soil depth, with a significant accumulation at 0-20cm depth. Across treatments, aggregate-associated C at a depth of 0-10cm was higher in the NT and ST treatments than in the MP and CT treatments. The advantage of the NT treatment weakened with soil depth, while the amount of aggregate-associated C remained higher for the ST treatment. There were more macro-aggregates in the ST and NT treatments than in the MP and CT treatments, while the MP and CT treatments had more micro-aggregates. The sum of macro-aggregate contributing rates for soil organic C (SOC) was significantly superior to that of the micro-aggregates. Water-stable aggregates increased by 34.5% in the ST treatment, effectively improving the soil structure. Furthermore, 0.25-1.00 and 1-2mm aggregates had the highest SOC storage and responded rapidly to the various tillage treatments. Hence, they can serve as indicators for the long-term influence of different tillage treatments on the distribution of aggregates and SOC."

RNA-Seq has great potential to dissect the molecular mechanisms of tolerance to environmental stresses. Transcriptome profiles in roots and shoots of two contrasting Iranian kabuli chickpea genotypes (Bivanij and Hashem) were investigated under water-limited conditions at early flowering stage using RNA-Seq approach. A total of 4,572 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Of these, 261 and 169 drought stress responsive genes were identified in the shoots and the roots, respectively, and 17 genes were common in the shoots and the roots. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed several sub-categories related to the stress, including response to stress, defense response and response to stimulus in the tolerant genotype Bivanij as compared to the sensitive genotype Hashem under drought stress. In addition, several Transcription factors (TFs) were identified in major metabolic pathways such as, ABA, proline and flavonoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, a number of the DEGs were observed in ""QTL-hotspot"" regions which were reported earlier in chickpea. Drought tolerance dissection in the genotypes revealed that the genes and the pathways involved in shoots of Bivanij were the most important factor to make a difference between the genotypes for drought tolerance. The identified TFs in the experiment, particularly those which were up-regulated in shoots of Bivanij during drought stress, were potential candidates for enhancing tolerance to drought."
https://openalex.org/W2811373433,"We assess the epidemiology and risk factors for mortality of bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients with acute leukemia (AL).Prospectively collected data of a cohort study from July 2004 to February 2016. Multivariate analyses were performed.589 episodes of BSI were documented in 357 AL patients, 55% caused by gram-positive bacteria (coagulase-negative staphylococci 35.7%, Enterococcus spp 10.8%) and 43.5% by gram-negative bacteria (E. coli 21%, PA 12%). We identified 110 (18.7%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, especially MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (7%). The 30-day mortality was 14.8%. Age (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.7-5.7); chronic lung disease (4.8; 1.1-21.8); fatal prognosis according to McCabe index (13.9; 6.4-30.3); shock (3.8; 1.9-7.7); pulmonary infection (3.6; 1.3-9.9); and MDR-PA infections with inappropriate treatment (12.8; 4.1-40.5) were related to mortality. MDR-PA BSI was associated to prior antipseudomonal cephalosporin use (9.31; 4.38-19.79); current use of betalactams (2.01; 1.01-4.3); shock (2.63; 1.03-6.7) and pulmonary source of infection (9.6; 3.4-27.21).MDR organisms were commonly isolated in BSI in AL. Inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment for MDR-PA is the primary factor related to mortality that can be changed. New treatment strategies to improve the coverage of MDR-PA BSI should be considered in those patients with risk factors for this infection."
https://openalex.org/W2810122408,"Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common cause of non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy in older adults. Optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCT-A) is an emerging, non-invasive method to study the microvasculature of the posterior pole, including the optic nerve head. The goal of this study was to assess the vascular changes in the optic nerve head and peripapillary area associated with NAION using OCT-A.Retrospective comparative case series.We performed OCT-A in 25 eyes (7 acute and 18 non-acute) in 19 patients with NAION. Fellow, unaffected eyes were analyzed for comparison. Patent macro- and microvascular densities were quantified in the papillary and peripapillary regions of unaffected, acutely affected, and non-acutely affected eyes and compared across these groups according to laminar segment and capillary sampling region, and with respect to performance on automated visual field testing.In acutely affected eyes, OCT-A revealed a reduction in the signal from the major retinal vessels and dilation of patent superficial capillaries in the peripapillary area. By contrast, non-acutely affected eyes showed attenuation of patent capillaries. The peripapillary choriocapillaris was obscured by edema in acute cases, but was similar between non-acute and unaffected eyes. The degree of dilation of the superficial microvasculature in the acute phase and attenuation in the non-acute phase each correlated inversely with visual field performance. The region of reduced patent capillary density correlated with the location of visual field defects in 80% of acute cases and 80% of non-acute cases.OCT-A reveals a dynamic shift in the superficial capillary network of the optic nerve head with strong functional correlates in both the acute and non-acute phases of NAION. Further study may validate OCT-A as a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of ischemic optic neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2809769714,"Enterococci represent one of the microbial world's most challenging enigmas. Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of high-risk/immunocompromised patients by enterococci exhibiting resistance to vancomycin (VRE) can lead to life-threating infections, including bloodstream infections and endocarditis. Decolonization of VRE from the GIT of high-risk patients represents an alternative method to suppress the risk of the infection. It could be considered as a preventative measure to protect against VRE infections in high-risk individuals. Though multiple agents (ramoplanin and bacitracin) have been evaluated clinically, no drugs are currently approved for use in VRE decolonization of the GIT. The present study evaluates ebselen, a clinical molecule, for use as a decolonizing agent against VRE. When evaluated against a broad array of enterococcal isolates in vitro, ebselen was found to be as potent as linezolid (minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of clinical isolates tested was 2 Î¼g/ml). Though VRE has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antibacterial agents, no resistance to ebselen emerged after a clinical isolate of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was serially-passaged with ebselen for 14 days. Against VRE biofilm, a virulence factor that enables the bacteria to colonize the gut, ebselen demonstrated the ability to both inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt mature biofilm. Furthermore, in a murine VRE colonization reduction model, ebselen proved as effective as ramoplanin in reducing the bacterial shedding and burden of VRE present in the fecal content (by > 99.99%), cecum, and ileum of mice. Based on the promising results obtained, ebselen warrants further investigation as a novel decolonizing agent to quell VRE infection."
https://openalex.org/W2809717759,"Dengue fever is a major international public health concern, with more than 55% of the world population at risk of infection. Recent climate changes related to global warming have increased the potential risk of domestic outbreaks of dengue in Korea. In this study, we develop a two-strain dengue model associated with climate-dependent parameters based on Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. We assess the potential risks of dengue outbreaks by means of the vector capacity and intensity under various RCP scenarios. A sensitivity analysis of the temperature-dependent parameters is performed to explore the effects of climate change on dengue transmission dynamics. Our results demonstrate that a higher temperature significantly enhances the potential threat of domestic dengue outbreaks in Korea. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of countermeasures on the cumulative incidence of humans and vectors. The current main control measures (comprising only travel restrictions) for infected humans in Korea are not as effective as combined control measures (travel restrictions and vector control), dramatically reducing the possibilities of dengue outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2810234082,"Background Neutrophil functions have long been regarded as limited to acute inflammation and the defense against microbes. The role(s) of neutrophils in cancer remain poorly understood. Neutrophils infiltrate tumors and are key effector cells in the orchestration of inflammatory responses. Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most recurrent endocrine malignant tumor and is responsible for 70% of deaths due to endocrine cancers. No studies are so far available on the role of neutrophils in TC. Objective Our purpose was to study the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils in TC. Methods Highly purified human neutrophils (>99%) from healthy donors were stimulated in vitro with conditioned media derived from TC cell lines TPC1 and 8505c (TC-CMs). Neutrophil functions (e.g., chemotaxis, activation, plasticity, survival, gene expression, and protein release) were evaluated. Results TC-derived soluble factors promoted neutrophil chemotaxis and survival. Neutrophil chemotaxis toward a TC-CM was mediated, at least in part, by CXCL8/IL-8, and survival was mediated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In addition, each TC-CM induced morphological changes and activation of neutrophils (e.g., CD11b and CD66b upregulation and CD62L shedding) and modified neutrophilsâ kinetic properties. Furthermore, each TC-CM induced production of reactive oxygen species, expression of proinflammatory and angiogenic mediators (CXCL8/IL-8, VEGF-A, and TNF-Î±), and a release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). Moreover, in TC patients, tumor-associated neutrophils correlated with larger tumor size. Conclusions TC cell lines produce soluble factors able to âeducateâ neutrophils toward an activated functional state. These data will advance the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immunity in TC."
https://openalex.org/W2810445495,"Background Poverty and human capital development are inextricably linked and therefore research on human capital typically incorporates measures of economic well-being. In the context of randomized trials of health interventions, for example, such measures are used to: 1) assess baseline balance; 2) estimate covariate-adjusted analyses; and 3) conduct subgroup analyses. Many factors characterize economic well-being, however, and analysts often generate summary measures such as indices of household socio-economic status or wealth. In this paper, a household wealth index is developed and tested for participants in the cluster-randomized Sanitation, Hygiene, Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in rural Zimbabwe. Methods Building on the approach used in the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS), we combined a set of housing characteristics, ownership of assets and agricultural resources into a wealth index using principal component analysis (PCA) on binary variables. The index was assessed for internal and external validity. Its sensitivity was examined considering an expanded set of variables and an alternative statistical approach of polychoric PCA. Correlation between indices was determined using the Spearmanâs rank correlation coefficient and agreement between quintiles using a linear weighted Kappa statistic. Using the 2015 ZDHS data, we constructed a separate index and applied the loadings resulting from that analysis to the SHINE study population, to compare the wealth distribution in the SHINE study with rural Zimbabwe. Results The derived indices using the different methods were highly correlated (r>0.9), and the wealth quintiles derived from the different indices had substantial to near perfect agreement (linear weighted Kappa>0.7). The indices were strongly associated with a range of assets and other wealth measures, indicating both internal and external validity. Households in SHINE were modestly wealthier than the overall population of households in rural Zimbabwe. Conclusion The SHINE wealth index developed here is a valid and robust measure of wealth in the sample."
https://openalex.org/W2810274860,"Introduction Physical activity is an important component of type 2 diabetes management. Physical activity level among general population in Nepal is reported to vary considerably. However, knowledge on physical activity in Nepali diabetics is very limited. Engagement in physical activity could be influenced by perception of barriers against adopting the behavior and benefits of adopting it. This study explores the prevalence of physical activity and factors that promote and hinder the behavior among urban residing diabetic patients from Nepal. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted using a simple random sampling of type 2 diabetic patients from two diabetes clinics at Lalitpur and Kaski districts of Nepal. Two hundred and seventy participants were surveyed to obtain information on physical activity using Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Metabolic equivalent values were calculated and categorized into high, moderate and low levels of physical activity. The information on perceived facilitators and barriers was collected by Exercise Barriers and Benefits Survey scale. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the measures were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Results The study showed relatively high prevalence of physical activity among the urban Nepali diabetic patients; 52% were moderately active and 28% highly active. Travel and work-related activities were the major contributors. Male participants, educated and those living in extended families were more motivated for physical activity than their counterparts. Physical fitness, strength and flexibility, better sleep at night, social interaction and longevity, were identified as the major facilitators. Family responsibilities, busy schedule and family discouragement were identified as barriers against being physically active. Conclusion The diabetic patients were mostly moderately physically active. Future research could explore different context-specific ways of remaining physically active, apart from walking and doing household chores. More focus should also be placed on leisure time physical activity as it was found to be low. Interventions could be designed by promoting the facilitators and addressing the barriers of physical activity, which is likely to reduce the healthcare costs of management of diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2811161895,"Retirement is a life transition involving an obligatory change in how people use their time. Because there are strong associations between use of time and health, different changes in time use following retirement may have different impacts on mental health.105 participants were followed from 6 months before retirement to 12 months after retirement. At each time-point, use of time was quantified using a validated computerised 24-hour recall. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS21), well-being with the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), life satisfaction with the Australian Unity Personal Well-being Index (AUPWI), and self-esteem with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Time-use data were analysed using compositional data analysis, which treats the 24-h day as a holistic ""activity composition"" rather than as individual activity domains. Time flow analytics were used to map patterns of change in time use from pre-retirement to post-retirement. Regression analysis was used to determine whether changes in the activity composition were significantly associated with changes in mental health. Compositional isotemporal substitution models were used to illustrate dose-response relationships between changes in time use and conditional changes in mental health for individual activity domains, such as sleep, screen time and physical activity.Following retirement, time no longer spent in work flowed mainly to household chores, sleep, screen time and quiet time (e.g. reading). Mental health improved overall. Changes in the activity composition were significantly related to conditional changes in DASS21 total score, depression, stress, and self-esteem, but not to anxiety, well-being or life satisfaction. Replacing work time with physical activity or sleep was associated with positive changes in mental health. Effect sizes for 60-minute substitutions ranged from -0.15 to +0.31.Following retirement, replacing work with physical activity, and to a lesser extent sleep, is associated with better mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2810219779,"Here high-speed Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) records sperm flagellar waveforms and swimming paths in 4 dimensions (X, Z, and t). We find flagellar excursions into the Z-plane nearly as large as the envelope of the flagellar waveform projected onto the XY-plane. These Z-plane excursions travel as waves down the flagellum each beat cycle. DHM also tracks the heads of free-swimming sperm and the dynamics and chirality of rolling of sperm around their long axis. We find that mouse sperm roll CW at the maximum positive Z-plane excursion of the head, then roll CCW at the subsequent maximum negative Z-plane excursion. This alternating chirality of rolling indicates sperm have a chiral memory. Procrustes alignments of path trajectories for sequences of roll-counterroll cycles show that path chirality is always CW for the cells analyzed in this study. Human and bull sperm lack distinguishable left and right surfaces, but DHM still indicates coordination of Z-plane excursions and rolling events. We propose that sperm have a chiral memory that resides in a hypothetical elastic linkage within the flagellar machinery, which stores some of the torque required for a CW or CCW roll to reuse in the following counter-roll. Separate mechanisms control path chirality."
https://openalex.org/W2810810860,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines cause pancreatic beta cell failure during the development of type 2 diabetes. This beta cell failure associates with mitochondrial dysfunction, but the precise effects of cytokines on mitochondrial respiration remain unclear. To test the hypothesis that pro-inflammatory cytokines impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by inhibiting oxidative ATP synthesis, we probed insulin release and real-time mitochondrial respiration in rat INS-1E insulinoma cells that were exposed to a combination of 2 ng/mL interleukin-1-beta and 50 ng/mL interferon-gamma. We show that 24-h exposure to these cytokines dampens both glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05, respectively), but does not affect KCl-induced insulin release. Mirroring secretory defects, glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated mitochondrial respiration are lowered after cytokine exposure (P < 0.01). Further analysis confirms that cytokine-induced mitochondrial respiratory defects occur irrespective of whether fuel oxidation is coupled to, or uncoupled from, ATP synthesis. These observations demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokines attenuate GSIS by restricting mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation capacity. Interleukin-1-beta and interferon-gamma also increase mitochondrial superoxide levels (P < 0.05), which may reinforce the inhibition of pyruvate oxidation, and cause a modest (20%) but significant (P < 0.01) loss of INS-1E cells. Cytokine-induced INS-1E cell failure is insensitive to palmitoleate and linoleate, which is at odds with the cytoprotection offered by unsaturated fatty acids against harm caused by nutrient excess. Our data disclose a mitochondrial mechanism for cytokine-impaired GSIS in INS-1E cells, and suggest that inflammatory and nutrient-related beta cell failure emerge, at least partly, through distinct paths."
https://openalex.org/W2810955037,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of brain disease that arises due to the aggregation and fibrillation of amyloid Î²-peptides (AÎ²). The peptide AÎ²17-42 forms U-shape protofilaments of amyloid mature fibrils by cross-Î² strands, detected in brain cells of individuals with AD. Targeting the structure of AÎ²17-42 and destabilizing its Î²-strands by natural compounds could be effective in the treatment of AD patients. Therefore, the interaction features of monomeric U-shape AÎ²17-42 with natural flavonoids including myricetin, morin and flavone at different mole ratios were comprehensively studied to recognize the mechanism of AÎ² monomer instability using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that all flavonoids have tendency to interact and destabilize AÎ² peptide structure with mole ratio-dependent effects. The interaction free energies of myricetin (with 6 OHs) and morin (with 5 OHs) were more negative compared to flavone, although the total binding energies of all flavonoids are favorable and negative. Myricetin, morin and flavone penetrated into the core of the AÎ²17-42 and formed self-clusters of AÎ²17-42-flavonoid complexes. Analysis of AÎ²17-42-flavonoids interactions identified that the hydrophobic interactions related to SASA-dependent energy are weak in all complexes. However, the intermolecular H-bonds are a main binding factor for shifting U-shape rod-like state of AÎ²17-42 to globular-like disordered state. Myricetin and morin polyphenols form H-bonds with both peptide's carbonyl and amine groups whereas flavone makes H-bonds only with amine substitution. As a result, polyphenols are more efficient in destabilizing Î²-sheet structures of peptide. Accordingly, the natural polyphenolic flavonoids are useful in forming stable AÎ²17-42-flavonoid clusters to inhibit AÎ²17-42 aggregation and these compounds could be an effective candidate for therapeutically targeting U-shape protofilaments' monomer in amyloid mature fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2810461273,"Gray leaf spot is a maize foliar disease with worldwide distribution and can drastically reduce the production in susceptible genotypes. Published works indicate that resistance to gray leaf spot is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes, with additive effect and influenced by environment. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions, including putative genes, associated with resistance to gray leaf spot under natural conditions of disease occurrence. A genome wide association study was conducted with 355,972 single nucleotide polymorphism markers on a phenotypic data composed by 157 tropical maize inbred lines, evaluated at MaringÃ¡ -Brazil. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with gray leaf spot, some of which were localized to previously reported quantitative trait loci regions. Three gene models linked to the associated single nucleotide polymorphism were expressed at flowering time and tissue related with gray leaf spot infection, explaining a considerable proportion of the phenotypic variance, ranging from 0.34 to 0.38. The gene model GRMZM2G073465 (bin 10.07) encodes a cysteine protease3 protein, gene model GRMZM2G007188 (bin 1.02) expresses a rybosylation factor-like protein and the gene model GRMZM2G476902 (bin 4.08) encodes an armadillo repeat protein. These three proteins are related with plant defense pathway. Once these genes are validated in next studies, they will be useful for marker-assisted selection and can help improve the understanding of maize resistance to gray leaf spot."
https://openalex.org/W2810697443,"FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) is a complex of SSRP1 and SPT16 that is involved in chromatin remodeling during transcription, replication, and DNA repair. FACT has been mostly studied in cell-free or single cell model systems because general FACT knockout (KO) is embryonically lethal (E3.5). FACT levels are limited to the early stages of development and stem cell niches of adult tissues. FACT is upregulated in poorly differentiated aggressive tumors. Importantly, FACT inhibition (RNAi) is lethal for tumors but not normal cells, making FACT a lucrative target for anticancer therapy. To develop a better understanding of FACT function in the context of the mammalian organism under normal physiological conditions and in disease, we aimed to generate a conditional FACT KO mouse model. Because SPT16 stability is dependent on the SSRP1-SPT16 association and the presence of SSRP1 mRNA, we targeted the Ssrp1 gene using a CreERT2- LoxP approach to generate the FACT KO model. Here, we highlight the limitations of the CreERT2-LoxP (Rosa26) system that we encountered during the generation of this model. In vitro studies showed an inefficient excision rate of ectopically expressed CreERT2 (retroviral CreERT2) in fibroblasts with homozygous floxed Ssrp1. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that the excision efficiency could only be increased with germline expression of two alleles of Rosa26CreERT2. The expression of one germline Rosa26CreERT2 allele led to the incomplete excision of Ssrp1. The limited efficiency of the CreERT2-LoxP system may be sufficient for studies involving the deletion of genes that interfere with cell growth or viability due to the positive selection of the phenotype. However, it may not be sufficient for studies that involve the deletion of genes supporting growth, or those crucial for development. Although CreERT2-LoxP is broadly used, it has limitations that have not been widely discussed. This paper aims to encourage such discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2810345961,"Pull-out force and insertion torque have not been generally used as intraoperative measures for the evaluation of pedicle screw stability because of their invasiveness. On the other hand, resonance frequency analysis is a non-invasive and repeatable technique that has been clinically used in dentistry to evaluate implant stability e.g. by the Osstell apparatus. In this study, the characteristics of the implant stability quotient (ISQ) value obtained by the Osstell apparatus in the field of spinal surgery were investigated. Biomechanical test materials simulating human bone were used to provide a comparative platform for evaluating each fixation strength measure, including pull-out force, insertion torque, and the ISQ value. To perform pull-out force measurement and to repeat pedicle screw insertion and removal, loosening was artificially created, and its effect was investigated. The grade of loosening was quantified on a micro-CT image after pedicle screw removal. In the comparison of the 3 fixation strength measures, the correlations of the ISQ value with the pull-out force (R2 = 0.339 p <0.0001) and the insertion torque (R2 = 0.337 p <0.0001) were lower than the correlation between pull-out force and insertion torque (R2 = 0.918 p <0.0001). On a micro-CT study, the material volume of the internal threads disappeared after destruction of its integrity due to repeated pedicle screw insertion and removal. Material integrity destruction of the internal threads decreased only the pull-out force and the insertion torque, but it did not affect the ISQ value. The ISQ value only decreased when the material volume of the internal threads disappeared, probably because the ISQ value reflects the resistance against a force in the perpendicular direction of the screw, unlike the conventional measures of fixation strength, such as pull-out force and insertion torque, which reflect axial load."
https://openalex.org/W2810766093,"Background High levels of sedentary behaviours have been independently associated with several negative health indicators, including obesity. Screen time (ST) is often used as a contributing measure of sedentary time. It is recommended that children spend no more than 2 hours on recreational sedentary screen-based activities daily. We describe screen-based sedentary time of urban school children and examine the associations between body mass index (BMI) and percent Body Fat (%BF) with ST levels. Methods Data were collected from 563 children aged 9 to 11 years attending 29 non-boarding primary schools in Nairobi, Kenya, as part of the International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment (ISCOLE). Data were analysed to test for associations between ST and sex, type of school attended (public verses private), Socioeconomic status, adiposity, and access to electronic devices. We also assessed participantsâ ST on school and weekend days. Results Of the participants recruited, 15.5% had high ST levels, 67.9% spent no more than 2 hours in recreational screen activities on school days while 74.2% did not meet the guidelines on weekend days. Participants sex was associated with daily ST (t = 3.5, p<0.001), ST on the weekend (t = 3.9, p <0.001) and total ST per week (t = 3.5, p<0.001) with males having higher ST than females. ST was associated with type of school for daily ST (t = 3.6, p <0.001), ST on the weekend (t = 4.5, p<0.001) and total ST per week (t = 3.6, p<0.001) where private schools pupils had higher ST. ST was not associated with BMI. ST was not associated with %BF except on weekend days (p = 0.038) where those classified as overfat/obese (fat) had higher ST. Conclusions A large proportion of children spend more time than recommended on screen activities particularly on weekend days. Strategies to improve healthy living should focus on the reduction of sedentary ST for school-aged children."
https://openalex.org/W2811046367,"Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are cognitively complex activities related to independent living in the community. Robust IADL scales are needed, however the psychometric properties of instruments have been little evaluated. There is no validated instrument for Sri Lankan older populations. Sri Lanka has the highest proportion of older people in South Asia with rapid population ageing. Therefore, it is essential to have standard instruments to assess activity limitations. We aimed to cross-culturally adapt the original Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale from English to Sinhala and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Sinhala version.Cross-cultural adaptation of the instrument was performed. The instrument was validated in a sample of 702 community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and above in Sri Lanka. Reliability (internal consistency and inter-rater reliability) was assessed. Construct validity of the scale was evaluated by performing exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and testing convergent and divergent validity.The Lawton IADL scale was successfully adapted to Sri Lankan context. Internal consistency of the scale was very high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). Very good inter-rater reliability was observed with very good agreement for all items. Inter-class correlations for overall IADL score ranged from 0.57 to 0.91. Results of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the unidimensionality of the scale. Goodness of fit indices in confirmatory factor analysis were in acceptable range (CFI = 0.98, SRMR = 0.06, NNFI = 0.97). Strength of associations were significant and in the expected direction. Results of the known group validity were also significant, confirming the convergent and divergent validity.The Lawton IADL scale was successfully translated and culturally adapted to Sinhala language. The Sinhala version demonstrated excellent reliability and construct validity. Given good psychometric properties, this scale would be recommended for use in future research."
https://openalex.org/W2811365993,"MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) is a robust target for hypoxia-inducible factor, and its overexpression has been detected in a variety of solid tumors. However, the role of miR-210 in the development, progression and response to therapy in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains undefined. We report here that high miR-210 expression was significantly correlated with the shorter survival of CCA patients. Overexpression of miR-210 inhibited CCA cell proliferation at the G2/M phase and reduced the gemcitabine sensitivity in CCA cells under CoCl2-induced pseudohypoxia. Concomitantly, inhibition of endogenous miR-210 activity using miRNA sponges increased cell proliferation under CoCl2-induced pseudohypoxia, resulting in an increase in gemcitabine sensitivity in CCA cells. We showed that HIF-3Î±, a negative controller of HIF-1Î±, was a target of miR-210 constituting a feed-forward hypoxic regulatory loop. Our data suggest an important role of miR-210 in sustaining HIF-1Î± activity via the suppression of HIF-3Î±, regulating cell growth and chemotherapeutic drug resistance in CCA."

Methods Thirty-seven patients (mean age: 45Â±13 y) with newly diagnosed gliomas and dynamic 18F-FET PET before any histopathologic investigation or treatment were retrospectively included. Each dynamic 18F-FET PET was realigned to the first image and spatially normalized in the Montreal Neurological Institute template. A tumor mask was semi-automatically generated from Z-score maps. Each brain tumor voxel was clustered in one of the 3 following centroids using dynamic time warping and k-means clustering (centroid #1: slowly increasing slope; centroid #2: rapidly increasing followed by slowly decreasing slope; and centroid #3: rapidly increasing followed by rapidly decreasing slope). The percentage of each dynamic 18F-FET TAC within tumors and other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters (maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios [TBRmax and TBRmean], time-to-peak [TTP] and slope) was compared between wild-type and IDH1 mutant tumors. Their prognostic value was assessed in terms of progression free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results Twenty patients were IDH1 wild-type and 17 IDH1 mutant. Higher percentage of centroid #1 and centroid #3 within tumors were positively (P = 0.016) and negatively (P = 0.01) correlated with IDH1 mutated status. Also, TBRmax, TBRmean, TTP, and slope discriminated significantly between tumors with and without IDH1 mutation (P range 0.01 to 0.04). Progression occurred in 22 patients (59%) at a median of 13.1 months (7.6â37.6 months) and 13 patients (35%) died from tumor progression. Patients with a percentage of centroid #1 > 90% had a longer survival compared with those with a percentage of centroid #1 < 90% (P = 0.003 for PFS and P = 0.028 for OS). This remained significant after stratification on IDH1 mutation status (P = 0.029 for PFS and P = 0.034 for OS). Compared to other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters, TTP and slope were associated with PFS and OS (P range 0.009 to 0.04). Conclusions Based on dynamic 18F-FET PET acquisition, we developed a full automatic clustering approach of TAC which appears to be a valuable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2809954937,"Although prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) reduces offspring growth, it may increase obesity risk at adolescence. Animal models of PAE display glucose intolerance and increased adiposity, suggesting that PAE causes metabolic reprogramming. We tested this hypothesis in a mouse model of binge PAE, wherein pregnant C57Bl/6J females received 3 g/kg alcohol (ETOH) daily from gestational day 12.5 to 17.5; maltodextrin (MD) and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) served as isocaloric nutritional controls, and sham (H2O) treatment controlled for gavage stress. Our comprehensive assessment quantified body composition, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and cardiovascular function in offspring at age 17 weeks. Although ETOH pups were initially lighter than all other groups, they did not have a unique obesogenic phenotype. Instead, a similar obesogenic phenotype emerged in all three caloric groups (MCT, MD, ETOH), such that caloric groups had greater post-weaning weight gain (both sexes), reduced gonadal fat weight (males), and reduced glucose clearance (males) compared against H2O offspring. PAE did not affect body composition, respiratory exchange ratio, metabolic adaption to high-fat or low-fat diet, eating behavior, and blood pressure, and ETOH values did not differ from those obtained from isocaloric controls. Exposure to a higher alcohol dose (4.5 g/kg) or a high-fat (60%) diet did not exacerbate differences in body composition or glucose tolerance. ""PAE-specific"" effects on postnatal growth, glucose tolerance, adiposity, or hypertension only emerged when PAE offspring were compared just against H2O controls, or against MD controls. We conclude that prior reports of obesity and glucose intolerance in adult PAE offspring reflect the contribution of added gestational calories, and not alcohol's pharmacologic action. Results suggest that the increased adiposity risk in FASD is not caused by metabolic reprogramming, and instead originates from behavioral, medication, and/or dietary practices. This study highlights the importance of appropriate dietary controls in nutritional studies of PAE."
https://openalex.org/W2810301309,"Metabolic energy expenditure during human gait is poorly understood. Mechanical energy loss during heel strike contributes to this energy expenditure. Previous work has estimated the energy absorption during heel strike as 0.8 J using an effective foot mass model. The aim of our study is to investigate the possibility of determining the energy absorption by more directly estimating the work done by the ground reaction force, the force-integral method. Concurrently another aim is to compare this method of direct determination of work to the method of an effective foot mass model. Participants of our experimental study were asked to walk barefoot at preferred speed. Ground reaction force and lower leg kinematics were collected at high sampling frequency (3000 Hz; 1295 Hz), with tight synchronization. The work done by the ground reaction force is 3.8 J, estimated by integrating this force over the foot-ankle deformation. The effective mass model is improved by dropping the assumption that foot-ankle deformation is maximal at the instant of the impact force peak. On theoretical grounds it is clear that in the presence of substantial damping that peak force and peak deformation do not occur simultaneously. The energy absorption results, due the vertical force only, corresponding to the force-integral method is similar to the results of the improved application of the effective mass model (2.7 J; 2.5 J). However the total work done by the ground reaction force calculated by the force-integral method is significantly higher than that of the vertical component alone. We conclude that direct estimation of the work done by the ground reaction force is possible and preferable over the use of the effective foot mass model. Assuming that energy absorbed is lost, the mechanical energy loss of heel strike is around 3.8 J for preferred walking speeds (â 1.3 m/s), which contributes to about 15-20% of the overall metabolic cost of transport."
https://openalex.org/W2811403087,"This study examined the prevalence, characteristic features, and complications associated with the occurrence of unerupted permanent incisors among children and adolescents attending a university dental teaching hospital. A retrospective review was performed of the clinical records of children and adolescents who attended the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, Hong Kong between 2005 and 2014. All patients who had at least one unerupted permanent incisor tooth were included. A total of 266 subjects with 320 unerupted permanent incisors were identified. The prevalence of unerupted permanent incisors among children and adolescents was 2.0%. Permanent maxillary central incisors (70.6%) were the most commonly affected teeth. The most common cause for unerupted incisors were dilacerations (n = 83, 36.7%) for maxillary central incisors; developmental dental anomalies (n = 22; 30.6%) together with unfavorable root development (n = 22; 30.6%) for maxillary laterals incisors; and abnormal tooth/tissue ratio (n = 11, 50.0%) for mandibular incisors. A majority of unerupted incisors presented with complications the most common being ectopic/displacement/rotation of the unerupted incisors (46.6%), loss of space (36.9%) and midline shift (27.5%). In conclusion, the causes were distinct for different manifestations of unerupted permanent incisors. As the majority of unerupted incisors presented with complications, a systematic and organized method of history taking as well as clinical and radiographic examinations is mandatory in the diagnosis of unerupted permanent incisors."
https://openalex.org/W2810169966,"Although hemodynamic influence of the subprosthetic tissue, termed as pannus, may contribute to prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction, the relationship between pannus extent and hemodynamics in the prosthetic valve has rarely been reported. We investigated the fluid dynamics of pannus formation using in vitro experiments with particle image velocimetry. Subvalvular pannus formation caused substantial changes in prosthetic valve transvalvular peak velocity, transvalvular pressure gradient (TPG) and opening angle. Maximum flow velocity and corresponding TPG were mostly affected by pannus width. When the pannus width was 25% of the valve diameter, pannus formation elevated TPG to >2.5 times higher than that without pannus formation. Opening dysfunction was observed only for a pannus involvement angle of 360Â°. Although circumferential pannus with an involvement angle of 360Â° decreased the opening angle of the valve from approximately 82Â° to 58Â°, eccentric pannus with an involvement angle of 180Â° did not induce valve opening dysfunction. The pannus involvement angle largely influenced the velocity flow field at the aortic sinus and corresponding hemodynamic indices, including wall shear stress, principal shear stress and viscous energy loss distributions. Substantial discrepancy between the velocity-based TPG estimation and direct pressure measurements was observed for prosthetic valve flow with pannus formation."
https://openalex.org/W2809767483,"Background Otitis media (OM) is a major reason for childrenâs visits to physicians and a major cause of their being treated with antibiotics. It not only causes economic burdens but also influences hearing, speech, and education. To our knowledge, no nationwide population-based study has assessed the association between air pollution and OM. Therefore, this study evaluated the association between air pollution levels and the incidence of OM. Methods We identified cases of OM that occurred in South Korea between January 2011 and December 2012 from the Korea National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database, and evaluated its relationship with five air pollutants: particulate matter (PM10, particulates â¤10 Î¼m in diameter), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Associations between the weekly incidence of OM and the five air pollutants were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and their 99.9% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals after adjusting for gender, age, season, and region. Results We based our analysis on 160,875 hospital visits for OM by children aged <15 years. Correlations with higher concentrations of the five pollutants showed higher ORs than did the reference values at most time lags. PM10 had the largest influence on the OM incidence at a time lag of 0 weeks, whereas NO2 and O3 had the largest impacts on OM incidence at time lags of 1 and 4 weeks, respectively. Conclusion These findings support the notion that the incidence of OM is associated with ambient air pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2809839268,"Knowledge of genetic combining ability and gene action would help breeders to choose suitable parents and devise an appropriate breeding strategy for coriander. In the present study, six diverse genotypes of coriander, their 15 F1s and 15 F2s were evaluated through randomized complete block design with three replications to study genetic combining ability for agronomic and phytochemical traits in coriander. Plants were subjected to well-watered (WW), mild water-deficit stress (MWDS) and severe water-deficit stress (SWDS) irrigation regimes. The results indicate that water-deficit stress decreased all of the measured traits in both the F1 and F2 generations. General combining ability and specific combining ability effects were highly significant for all of the traits in both the F1 and F2 generations. Additive gene action was predominant for phonology and fruit yield component traits in all irrigation regimes in both the F1 and F2 generations. For fatty acid content and total lipid yield, non-additive gene action was predominant in the F1 generation while additive gene action was predominant in the F2 generation under MWDS and SWDS conditions. The P4 parent had the highest general combining ability for fruit yield components in both the F1 and F2 generations. The P6 parent had the highest general combining ability for phenological and phytochemical traits. The P4 and P6 parents are promising material to develop early flowering and early maturing genotypes coupled with high total lipids in advanced generations of segregation."

Patterns of morphological variation resulting from ontogenetic transformations and pathology are discussed. We employed x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans to examine two adult specimens of Elgaria panamintina and two adult specimens of Elgaria multicarinata, in addition to examining multiple traditionally prepared skeletal specimens of the latter species. CT scans provide simultaneous study of both articulated and disarticulated elements, allowing us to describe and document the morphology of the skull with exceptional precision and detail. The description of the skull of Elgaria panamintina serves as a generalization for all Elgaria; here we provide the first complete description of the skull of this genus for future uses in morphological and phylogenetic studies of both extant species and fossils."
https://openalex.org/W2811333354,"This study evaluated the morphological change in aqueous humor outflow (AHO) pathways using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) volumetric scans in glaucoma patients before and after glaucoma surgery. In this prospective observational case series, 15 eyes (13 patients) with glaucoma were treated with 120-degree Trabectome or 360-degree suture trabeculotomy and followed up for 3 months. B-scan images of the posttrabecular AHO pathway were reconstructed and the pathway areas were evaluated, before and after surgery. Changes in posttrabecular AHO pathway were qualitatively classified as ""increased"", ""non-significant change"", and ""decreased"" on reconstructed B-scan images. Quantitative measurements of the posttrabecular AHO pathway areas were performed pre- and postoperatively. Factors associated with both qualitative and quantitative changes in AHO pathway were investigated. From 30 regions (15 nasal and 15 temporal regions) in the 15 eyes, AHO pathways were analyzable in 20 regions pre- and postoperatively. Qualitative assessments of the pathway changes were ""increased"" in 8 regions, ""non-significant change"" in 9 regions, and ""decreased"" in 3 regions. Quantitative assessments of the average pathway area did not change significantly (from 3155Â±1633 pixels preoperatively to 3212Â±1684 pixels postoperatively, P = 0.50). All parameters relating to intraocular pressure changes or the surgical location were not associated with postoperative AHO pathway change. The intrascleral AHO pathway could be well visualized in glaucoma patients pre- and postoperatively using swept-source optical coherence tomography. However, structural changes in the AHO pathway assessed by SS-OCT were not significant after trabecular-targeted glaucoma surgery. Functional assessments of AHO are needed in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2809696647,"Although distinct amino acid motifs containing consecutive prolines (polyP) cause ribosome stalling, which necessitates recruitment of the translation elongation factor P (EF-P), they occur strikingly often in bacterial proteomes. For example, polyP motifs are found in more than half of all histidine kinases in Escherichia coli K-12, which raises the question of their role(s) in receptor function. Here we have investigated the roles of two polyP motifs in the osmosensor and histidine kinase EnvZ. We show that the IPPPL motif in the HAMP domain is required for dimerization of EnvZ. Moreover, replacement of the prolines in this motif by alanines disables the receptorâs sensor function. The second motif, VVPPA, which is located in the periplasmic domain, was found to be required for interaction with the modulator protein MzrA. Our study also reveals that polyP-dependent stalling has little effect on EnvZ levels. Hence, both polyP motifs in EnvZ are primarily involved in protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, while the first motif occurs in almost all EnvZ homologues, the second motif is only found in species that have MzrA, indicating co-evolution of the two proteins."

Maternal reports of infectious disease symptoms and antibiotic use were collected weekly by automated survey; household visits occurred every four months. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified by medical chart review. Urinary triclosan levels were measured in a participant subset. Differences by intervention group in reported infectious disease (primary outcome) and antibiotic use (secondary outcome) were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression and Fisher's Exact tests, respectively.Infectious illness occurred in 6% of weeks, with upper respiratory illness the predominant syndrome. Among 60 (45%) TC-exposed and 73 (55%) non-TC-exposed babies, infectious disease reports did not differ in frequency between groups (likelihood ratio test: p = 0.88). Medical visits with antibiotic prescriptions were less common in the TC group than in the non-TC group (7.8% vs. 16.6%, respectively; p = 0.02).Although randomization to TC-containing wash products was not associated with decreased infectious disease reports by mothers, TCs were associated with decreased antibiotic prescriptions, suggesting a benefit against bacterial infection.

https://openalex.org/W2810903897,"Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is a copper-dependent monoamine oxidase that contributes to the remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cross linkage of collagen and elastin fibres and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in cancer and fibrosis. In the skin, LOXL2 is essential for epidermal cell polarity and differentiation. However, its role in the dermis has not been evaluated. We found that Loxl2 is dispensable for mouse dermal development, maturation and homeostasis, yet affects dermal stiffness. Neither loss of Loxl2 nor increased Loxl2 expression affected dermal architecture following treatment with the phorbol ester TPA. Furthermore, Loxl2 expression did not alter the stroma of DMBA-TPA-induced tumours. We conclude that, although Loxl2 is expressed in both dermis and epidermis, its function appears largely confined to the epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W2810136663,"For better outcomes of the primary correction of cleft lip nasal deformity, it is important to clarify the specific morphological and biomechanical consequences of major surgical maneuvers during cleft lip nose correction. In this study, a finite element model was established basing on the micro-MRI imaging of an infant specimen with unilateral complete cleft lip deformity. Alar base adduction was simulated as a medially-directed force on the lateral crus (F1); columella straightening was simulated as a laterally-directed force on the medial crus (F2); and nasal tip enhancement was simulated as an anteriorly-directed force on the intermediate crus (F3). The deformation and stress distribution consequent to each force vector or different force combinations were analyzed in details. Our biomechnical analyses suggested that W\when loaded alone, the three forces generated disparate morphological changes. The combination of different force loadings generated obviously different outcomes. F3 generated the most intensive stress when compared to F1 and F2. When F2 was loaded on top of F1-F3 combination, it further relieved nasal deviation without incurring significant increase in stress. Our simulation suggested that alar base adduction, columella straightening, and nasal tip elevation should all be included in a competent cleft lip nose correction."
https://openalex.org/W2810264308,"Plant species disjunctions have attracted the interest of ecologists for decades. We investigated Trichloris crinita, a native C4 perennial grass with disjunct distribution between subtropical regions of North and South America, testing the hypothesis that the species has a similar realized climatic niche in both subcontinents. The climatic niche of T. crinita in North and South America was characterized and compared using presence records and five uncorrelated bioclimatic variables selected according to their ecological importance for the species. We used reciprocal modeling to make geographic projections of the realized niche within each subcontinent. Niche overlap between T. crinita distributions in North and South America was intermediate for the individual climatic variables and the multivariate space. In all cases the test of equivalence between climates inhabited by T. crinita indicated that the realized niche of the species differ significantly between subcontinents. Also, the similarity test showed that in the majority of cases the realized niche in both subcontinents was significantly different than that expected by chance. T. crinita occupied a greater diversity of environments in South than in North America, while in the latter its distribution was displaced to drier and warmer environments. The modeled geographic distribution using the actual occurrences of the species in North America did not accurately predict the distribution in South America, and vice versa. Together, these results led us to reject the hypothesis of similar niche of T. crinita in both subcontinents. This information may be useful to manage restoration efforts by presenting the suitable areas and climates for the species, and suggesting that translocation of individuals between subcontinents could only be recommended with caution because introduced genotypes can be potentially maladaptive, and could colonize sites actually not occupied by the species within each subcontinent."
https://openalex.org/W2809756846,"Co-evolution between pairs of residues in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of homologous proteins has long been proposed as an indicator of structural contacts. Recently, several methods, such as direct-coupling analysis (DCA) and MetaPSICOV, have been shown to achieve impressive rates of contact prediction by taking advantage of considerable sequence data. In this paper, we show that prediction success rates are highly sensitive to the structural definition of a contact, with more permissive definitions (i.e., those classifying more pairs as true contacts) naturally leading to higher positive predictive rates, but at the expense of the amount of structural information contributed by each contact. Thus, the remaining limitations of contact prediction algorithms are most noticeable in conjunction with geometrically restrictive contactsâprecisely those that contribute more information in structure prediction. We suggest that to improve prediction rates for such âinformativeâ contacts one could combine co-evolution scores with additional indicators of contact likelihood. Specifically, we find that when a pair of co-varying positions in an MSA is occupied by residue pairs with favorable statistical contact energies, that pair is more likely to represent a true contact. We show that combining a contact potential metric with DCA or MetaPSICOV performs considerably better than DCA or MetaPSICOV alone, respectively. This is true regardless of contact definition, but especially true for stricter and more informative contact definitions. In summary, this work outlines some remaining challenges to be addressed in contact prediction and proposes and validates a promising direction towards improvement."

A phase III trial has confirmed that both capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin are well tolerated for elderly patients with AGC, but their economic influence in China is unknown.The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to estimate the effects of capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin in elderly patients with AGC on health and economic outcomes in China.We created a Markov model based on data from a Korean clinical phase III trial to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of elderly patients in the capecitabine monotherapy (X) group and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) group. The costs were obtained from published reports and the local health system. The utilities were assumed on the basis of the published literature. Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (Monte Carlo simulations) were performed.In the cost-effectiveness analysis, X had a lower total cost ($45,731.68) and cost-effectiveness ratio ($65,918.93/QALY). The one-way sensitivity analysis suggested that the most influential parameter was the risk of requiring second-line chemotherapy in XELOX group. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted that the X regimen was cost-effective 100% of the time, given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $26,598.Our findings show that the XELOX regimen is less cost-effective compared to the X regimen for elderly patients with AGC in China from a Chinese healthcare perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2810641936,"Small integral membrane protein of the lysosome/late endosome (SIMPLE) is a 161-amino acid cellular protein that contains a characteristic C-terminal domain known as the SIMPLE-like domain (SLD), which is well conserved among species. Several studies have demonstrated that SIMPLE localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), early endosomes, lysosomes, multivesicular bodies, aggresomes and the plasma membrane. However, the amino acid regions responsible for its subcellular localization have not yet been identified. The SLD resembles the FYVE domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol (3)-phosphate (PI3P) and determines the subcellular localization of FYVE domain-containing proteins. In the present study, we have found that SIMPLE binds specifically to PI4P through its SLD. SIMPLE co-localized with PI4P and Rab11, a marker for recycling endosomes (REs, organelles enriched in PI4P) in both the IMS32 mouse Schwann cell line and Hela cells. Sucrose density-gradient centrifugation revealed that SIMPLE co-fractionated with syntaxin-6 (a TGN marker) and Rab11. We have also found that SIMPLE knockdown impeded recycling of transferrin and of transferrin receptor. Our overall results indicate that SIMPLE may regulate protein trafficking physiologically by localizing to the TGN and/or REs by binding PI4P."

A retrospective cohort of 5130 patients with NOAF was identified from a random sample of one million subjects between 2005 and 2010 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The standard incidence ratio of incident cancer and hazard ratios were calculated by modeling cumulative incidence with competing risk of death. During a mean follow-up duration of 3.4 years, 330 patients developed cancer. The standard incidence ratio of all malignancies was 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.26-1.57), suggesting a 41% increase in cancer risk compared with the general population. The risk of cancer was higher among men or the elderly with NOAF after adjusting for confounding factors and after considering the competing risk of death. The risk of cancer was not associated with CHA2DS2-VASc score (p = 0.32) among patients with NOAF. In conclusion, patients with NOAF were associated with a higher risk of cancer. Within this group, the risk of ischemic stroke (in terms of CHADS2-VASc score) did not reflect the risk of incident cancer."

This pair of studies investigate the nature of womenâs blame reactions towards survivors of sexual aggression, as well as the potential for provision of sympathy and support. Specifically, we focused on the previously neglected role of female self-objectification. It was expected that increased self-objectification would lead to decreased sympathy and support, and more rape victim blame. However, results of Study 1 showed that chronic self-objectification was actually related to higher levels of sympathy and support for a rape victim. Study two built upon the limitations of study one, and examined similar questions. It was expected that women who engaged in greater self-objectification would again show greater sympathy and support for the victim, replicating study oneâs results, and this was supported with a different scale. The overall relationship between self-objectification and sympathy and support was driven by body-relevant control beliefs. Implications and future directions are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2809797870,"Quality improvement in healthcare has often been promoted as different from and more valuable than peer review and other professional self-regulation processes. In spite of attempts to harmonize these two approaches, the perception of dichotomous opposition has persisted. A sequence of events in the troubled California prison system fortuitously isolated workforce interventions from more typical quality improvement interventions. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the relative contributions of professional accountability and quality improvement interventions to an observed decrease in population mortality and (2) explore the organizational dynamics that potentiated positive outcomes.Our retrospective mixed-methods case study correlated time-series analysis of mortality with the timing of reform interventions. Quantitative and qualitative evidence was drawn from court documents, public use files, internal databases, and other archival documents.Change point analysis reveals with 98% confidence that a significant improvement in age-adjusted natural mortality occurred in 2007, decreasing from 138.7 per 100,000 in the 1998-2006 period to 106.4 in the 2007-2009 period. The improvement in mortality occurred after implementation of accountability processes, prior to implementation of quality improvement interventions. Archival evidence supports the positive impact of physician competency assessments, robust peer review, and replacement of problem physicians.Our analysis suggests that workforce accountability provides a critical quality safeguard, and its neglect in scholarship and practice is unjustified. As with quality improvement, effective professional self-regulation requires systemic implementation of enabling policies, processes, and staff resources. The study adds to evidence that the distribution of physician performance contains a heterogeneous left skew of dyscompetence that is associated with significant harm and suggests that professional self-regulation processes such as peer review can reduce that harm. Beyond their responsibility for direct harm, dyscompetent professionals can have negative impacts on group performance. The optimal integration of professional accountability and quality improvement systems merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2810238988,"The gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is frequently mutated in several tumor types including gliomas. The most prevalent mutation in gliomas is a missense mutation leading to a substitution of arginine with histidine at the residue 132 (R132H). Wild type IDH1 catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±-KG) whereas mutant IDH1 converts Î±-KG into D2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). Unfortunately, there are few in vivo model systems for IDH-mutated tumors to study the effects of IDH1 mutations in tumor development. We have therefore created transgenic zebrafish lines that express various IDH1 mutants.IDH1 mutations (IDH1R132H, IDH1R132C and loss-of-function mutation IDH1G70D), IDH1wildtype or eGFP were cloned into constructs with several brain-specific promoters (Nestin, Gfap or Gata2). These constructs were injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the one-cell stage.In total more than ten transgenic zebrafish lines expressing various brain-specific IDH1 mutations were created. A significant increase in the level of D2HG was observed in all transgenic lines expressing IDH1R132C or IDH1R132H, but not in any of the lines expressing IDH1wildtype, IDH1G70D or eGFP. No differences in 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine and mature collagen IV levels were observed between wildtype and mutant IDH1 transgenic fish. To our surprise, we failed to identify any strong phenotype, despite increased levels of the oncometabolite D2HG. No tumors were observed, even when backcrossing with tp53-mutant fish which suggests that additional transforming events are required for tumor formation. Elevated D2HG levels could be lowered by treatment of the transgenic zebrafish with an inhibitor of mutant IDH1 activity.We have generated a transgenic zebrafish model system for mutations in IDH1 that can be used for functional analysis and drug screening. Our model systems help understand the biology of IDH1 mutations and its role in tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2810617298,"Immune activating cytokines Interferon (IFN)-Î³ and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± are known to activate macrophages for killing of Leishmania parasite. IFN-Î³ provides therapeutic potential while TNF-Î± has been recognized to mediate protection in visceral model of infection. In the present study we investigated whether combination of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± has better therapeutic strength than individually using one of these cytokines in Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) patients. We performed combined blockade of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± in VL splenic biopsies and demonstrated itâs impact on number of viable amastigotes and cytokine production. Additionally, selective depletion of splenic cell subsets was performed to establish the cellular sources of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±. Treatment of splenic aspirate cells with combination of anti-IFN-Î³ and anti-TNF-Î± monoclonal antibodies for 72 hours enabled no direct additive impact of these cytokines on parasite replication and IL-10 secretion, but IL-4 production was induced. Further assessment of splenic biopsies put forward CD4+ T cells as a source of IFN-Î³ whereas CD14+ cells contribute towards TNF-Î± production. Overall our results suggest, the interplay of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-Î³ derived from CD4+T lymphocytes and TNF-Î± from CD14+ cells has no direct additive impact on parasite replication but induces IL-4 production. Our data does not support direct targeting of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± for combination therapy but targeting these cytokines as an adjuvant in patients with exaggerated tissue inflammatory responses can have favourable patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2810773536,"Skeletal muscle fatigue has been shown to be associated with hyperphosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor 1 at serine 2843 (pRyR1Ser2843), due to chronic overloading exercise. We investigated whether pRyR1Ser2843, is a mechanism relevant for muscle fatigue also under acute, in contrast to chronic, muscle loading. 24 male subjects (age: 24,8Â±3,8; height: 182,8Â±7,2 cm; weight: 82,5Â±9,9 kg) were evenly (n = 6) assigned to the following four different resistance exercise (RE) groups: hypertrophy- (HYP), strength endurance- (SE), maximum power- (MAX) at the subjects' 10, 25 and 3 repetition maximum, respectively, and low intensity (LI) RE with 70% of the 10 repetition maximum. Each group completed three different RE volumes (1 set, 5, and 10 sets). Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken before and after exercise, analyzed for pRyR1Ser2843 and examined for association with RE-induced muscle fatigue which was determined as reduction in maximum isometric force (isoFmax) in the quadriceps femoris muscle also before and after exercise.The degree of RE-induced muscle fatigue was specific in terms of set volume as well as of RE mode. isoFmax was not reduced in any group after one set of RE. Five sets led to a significant reduction of isoFmax in HYP and SE but not in LI and MAX (p<0,05). Ten sets of RE, as compared to five sets, exclusively induced further muscle fatigue in LI. In terms of RE mode differences, isoFmax reduction was generally higher in HYP and SE than in MAX and Li after five and ten sets of RE (p<0,05). However, pRyR1Ser2843 did not show any significant regulation, regardless of exercise condition. We conclude that despite its relevance in reducing muscle contractility in chronic overloading, pRyR1Ser2843 does not reflect the degree of muscle fatigue exerted by acute hypertrophy-, strength endurance-, maximum power and low intensity-oriented exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2811013968,"Introduction Appropriate algorithms for the prediction of cardiovascular risk are strongly suggested in clinical practice, although still controversial. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the beneficial effect of phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors is demonstrated on endothelial function but not on the estimation of cardiovascular risk. Aim To study whether the chronic Vardenafil administration to men with T2DM influences variables correlated with the predicted long-term cardiovascular risk calculated by different validated algorithms. Methods Per-protocol analysis of a longitudinal, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, investigator-started, clinical trial. 54 male patients affected by T2DM were assigned to study (26patients) and control-group (28patients), respectively. The study included a treatment phase (24weeks) (Vardenafil/placebo 10mg twice-daily) and a follow-up phase (24weeks). Three time points were considered: baseline(V0), end of treatment(V1) and end of the study(V2). Parameters evaluated: endothelial health-related parameters and cardiovascular risk, assessed by calculating the Framingham (coronary hart disease [CHD], myocardial infarction [MI], stroke and cardiovascular disease [CVD]), ASSIGN and CUORE equations. Results Predicted cardiovascular risk at ten years resulted different using the three algorithms chosen, without differences between study and control groups and among visits. IL-6 was directly related to CHD, CVD and CUORE scores at V1 and with MI and STROKE at V2. Similarly, hs-CRP was directly related to CHD, MI, STROKE and CUORE only at V1 in the study group. Testosterone serum levels were inversely related to CHD and MI at V1 in study group. Discussion The predicted cardiovascular risk is different depending on the algorithm chosen. Despite no predictive risk reduction after six months of treatment, a possible effect of Vardenafil could be hypothesized through its action on inflammation markers reduction and through restoration of normal testosterone levels."
https://openalex.org/W2811187570,"Peptides that exhibit enzymatic or hormonal activities are regulatory factors and desirable therapeutic drugs because of their high target specificity and minimal side effects. Unfortunately, these drugs are susceptible to enzymatic degradation, leading to their rapid elimination and thereby demanding frequent dosage. Structurally modified forms of some peptide drugs have shown enhanced pharmacokinetics, improving their oral bioavailability. Here, we discuss a novel glycomimetic approach to modify lysine residues in peptides. In a model system, the Îµ-amine of Ts-Lys-OMe was reductively alkylated with a glucose derivative to afford a dihydroxylated piperidine in place of the amine. A similar modification was applied to H-KPV-NH2, a tripeptide derived from the Î±-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) reported to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Antimicrobial assays, under a variety of conditions, showed no activity for Ac-KPV-NH2 or the Î±- or Îµ-glycoalkylated analogs. Glycoalkylated peptides did, however, show stability toward proteolytic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2810315538,"Analyzing geological drilling hole images acquired by Axial View Panoramic Borehole Televiewer (APBT) is a key step to explore the geological structure in a geological exploration. Conventionally, the borehole images are examined by technicians, which is inefficient and subjective. In this paper, three dominant types of borehole-wall images on coal-rock mass structure, namely, border images, fracture images and intact rock mass images are mainly studied. The traditional image classification methods based on unified feature extraction algorithm and single classifier is not effect for the borehole images. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel two-stage classification approach to improve the classification performance of borehole images. In the first-stage classification, the border images are identified from three kinds of images based on texture features and gray-scale histograms features. For the remaining two types of images, in the second-stage classification, Gabor filter is first applied to segment the region of interest (ROI) (such as microfracture, absciss layer and horizontal cracks, etc.) and the central interference region. Then, using the same feature vector after eliminating the central interference region, fracture images are separated from intact rock mass images. We test our two-stage classification system with real borehole images. The results of experimental show that the two-stage classification method can effectively classify three major borehole-wall images with the correction rate of 95.55% in the first stage and 95% in the second stage."
https://openalex.org/W2810080706,"Yonaguni Island is a remote and isolated westernmost island in Japan, which is the fastest aging country in the world. This study evaluated the current status of medical supply-and-demand on the island and compared these results with previous surveys carried out in rural parts of Japan. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Yonaguni Municipal Clinic, the only medical facility in Yonaguni Island. The participants were patients who visited the clinic over one year, between July 2015 and June 2016. We calculated the rate per 1,000 persons per month of clinic visits, referrals to off-island medical facilities (e.g., hospitals and specialist clinics), referrals to off-island emergency departments, off-island hospitalizations after referral, home visits, and overnight observations at the clinic. In total, 6,197 patients (males, 46.3%) visited the clinic. The rate of clinic visits per 1,000 persons per month was 516.4 (Standard deviation [SD] 28.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 500.5-532.3). The rate per 1,000 persons per month was 14.0 (SD 3.9, 95% CI: 11.8-16.2) for off-island referrals, 3.8 (SD 2.1, 95% CI: 2.6-5.0) for referrals to emergency departments, 4.8 (SD 2.6, 95% CI: 3.3-6.2) for hospitalizations, and 3.2 (SD 1.7, 95% CI: 2.2-4.1) for home visits. The rate of clinic visits was higher in Yonaguni Island than in other rural areas, although the rate of off-island referrals was lower. There were no significant differences between the number of referrals to emergency departments, hospitalizations, and home visits in Yonaguni Island, in comparison to other studies. Our study showed that patients presenting with emergencies had similar rates of healthcare-seeking behavior to those reported in previous studies in Japan; however, the referral rate was lower. We assessed the ecology of medical care in this district by evaluating patient behavior on an isolated island where access to medical care is geographically limited."
https://openalex.org/W2810730310,"MALT1 controls several receptors-mediated signaling to nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) through both its scaffold and protease function. MALT1 protease activity is shown to inactivate several negative regulators of NF-ÎºB signaling and augment NF-ÎºB activation ability. In this study, MALT1 was demonstrated to autoprocess itself in the presence of oligomerization-competent BCL10. Cleavage occurred after Arginine 781 located in the C-terminus of MALT1. Shortened MALT1 cleavage products showed attenuated binding ability with TRAF6. Its NF-ÎºB activation ability was also weakened. Various MALT1 constructs including wild type, catalytically-inactive (MALT1_C464A), cleavage-defective (MALT1_R781L), or truncated (MALT1_1-781) form of MALT1 was introduced into MALT1-knocked-down-Jurkat T cells. Cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L retained its proteolytic and initial IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation activity as MALT1. Truncated MALT1_1-781 mutant showed weakness in IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation and the expression of NF-ÎºB targets IL-2 and IFN-Î³. Cleavage at R781 was detectable but marginal after activation with TPA/ionomycin or anti-CD3 antibody in lymphocytes. However, cleavage at R781 was evident in ABC-DLBCL cells such as OCI-Ly3, HBL-1. HBL-1 cells with induced expression of catalytically-inactive MALT1_C464A or cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L exhibited characteristic of retarded-growth. These findings suggested that cleavage at R781 of MALT1 played a role in the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells."
