https://openalex.org/W1963704405,"Abstract As shown in the accompanying paper, μ chains of the membrane-bound ( μ m ) and secreted ( μ s ) forms of IgM are encoded by two species of mRNA. Cloned cDNAs produced from the two μ mRNAs of M104E mouse myeloma tumors differ only at their 3′ ends, which encode either the μ m or μ s C terminus. In this paper, we show that both μ m and μ s mRNAs are produced from transcripts of a single μ gene. The last 187 nucleotides of μ s mRNA are derived from DNA contiguous with the 3′ end of the sequence encoding the C μ 4 domain. The μ m cDNA clone does not include these 187 nucleotides, but instead contains 392 nucleotides derived from two exons located 1850 bp 3′ to the C μ 4 sequence. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences show that in μ m mRNA, an RNA splice of 1850 nucleotides joins a site in the coding sequence at the end of C μ 4 with a site at the beginning of the first membrane-specific exon. A second RNA splice of 118 nucleotides joins sequences transcribed from the first and second membrane-specific exons. The differences observed between μ m and μ s cDNAs suggest that developmental control of the site at which poly(A) is added to transcripts of the μ gene determines the relative levels of μ m or μ s chain synthesis. We discuss possible models for the control of μ gene transcripts and the significance of this form of developmentally regulated RNA processing for the evolution of eucaryotic split genes."
https://openalex.org/W2085062936,"During differentiation, B lymphocytes undergo a shift from expression of membrane-bound IgM to IgM secretion. The μ chains of membrane and secreted IgM, μm and μs, respectively, differ in the amino acid sequence of their carboxy terminal regions. In this paper, we demonstrate that μm and μs heavy chains are encoded by separate mRNAs of 2.7 and 2.4 kb, respectively. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis of μ cDNA clones from a myeloma tumor that produces both types of μ chain indicate that the μm and μs mRNAs are identical throughout the coding region up to the 3′ end of the fourth constant region (Cμ4) domain, but differ in their C terminal coding and 3′ untranslated segments. From the nucleotide sequence of the μm cDNA clone, we predict the amino acid sequence of the 41-residue μm C terminal segment or “M” (membrane) segment. This sequence has characteristics consistent with its being a transmembrane peptide. Thus the μs chain has a 20-residue hydrophilic C terminal segment after the Cμ4 domain, and the μm chain has a 41-residue C terminal segment containing a hydrophobic sequence. We propose that comparable C terminal segments also will be found in other membrane-bound immunoglobulin heavy chains."
https://openalex.org/W2009580887,"Abstract The mRNA isolated from B lymphocyte tumor cell lines directs synthesis of two forms of μ heavy chain, one with a molecular weight of 67K and one of 64K. When these cell lines are converted to IgM-secreting cells by fusion with a myeloma cell, the 64K form of μ predominates; thus it is designated μ s (μ-secreted). The 67K form correlates with the presence of surface IgM; thus it is designated μ m (μ-membrane). Cells that make both forms of μ chain have two mRNAs, one of 2.4 kb that encodes μ s and one of 2.7 kb that encodes μ m . The difference between the μ s and μ m mRNAs can be localized to their 3′ ends by hybridizing 32 P-cDNA copies of the mRNA to a cloned copy of μ s mRNA, treating the mixtures with SI nuclease, and resolving the nuclease-resistant duplexes by electrophoresis. By probing the separated species of RNA with a DNA copy of the 3′ untranslated region of μ s mRNA, it was shown that the 3′ ends of the two μ mRNAs do not cross-hybridize. The difference between the two RNAs was mapped to the 3′ edge of the Cμ4 domain. Apparently two separate 3′ terminal sequences for μ mRNA are encoded in the genome, one that specifies an amino acid sequence appropriate for membrane-binding and a second that is involved in secretion. At different stages of immunocyte development, different μ mRNAs predominate: μ m during the lymphocyte stages and μ s during the secretion stages."

Binding of Bands 2.1 and 4.1 to spectrin was measured as 125I radioactivity precipitated by an anti-spectrin. Staphylococcus aureus complex. The association between spectrin and Band 2.1 is characterized by relatively high affinity (Kd congruent to 10(-7) M at pH 7.6) and saturation of available binding sites at a molar ratio of 1:1 (Band 2.1/spectrin heterodimer). Band 4.1 binding to spectrin is characterized by a similar affinity (Kd congruent to 10(-7) M at pH 7.6) with saturation of available sites occurring at a stoichiometric ration of 2:1 (Band 4.1/spectrin heterodimer). Scatchard plots of Band 4.1 binding to spectrin are curvilinear and consistent with a positively cooperative interation. Bands 2.1 and 4.1 bind to different sites on the spectrin molecule: unlabeled Band 4.1 does not competitively displace 125 I-Band 2.1 from spectrin in solution, and low angle rotary-shadowed platinum-carbon replicas of these polypeptides reveal two discrete binding sites."

I., Henry, S. A. & Fogel, S. (1980) J. Bacteriol. 141, 558-564) has been examined. The ability of cells of this strain to synthesize phosphatidylserine in vitro in a cell-free system is reduced at least 10-fold, whereas other phospholipid-synthesizing activities are present at normal or slightly elevated levels. While all phospholipid biosynthetic activities, except phosphatidylserine synthesis, can be demonstrated in vitro in the cho1 mutant, the entire pattern of phospholipid synthesis, accumulation, and turnover in vivo is distorted. Phosphatidylinositol synthesis is elevated, as is phosphatidylcholine synthesis. In addition, the turnover of phosphatidylcholine is more rapid in the cho1 mutant. The cho1 mutant appears to use almost exclusively the alternative pathway described by Kennedy and Weiss (1956) J. Biol. Chem. 222, 193-214) for the production of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, bypassing phosphatidylserine as an intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1502563924,"The functional interrelationships between the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase systems for arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets have not yet been clarified. Although a number of specific inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase, such as aspirin and indomethacin, have been described, few inhibitors of the lipoxygenase have been found. Several hydroxy and hydroperoxy derivatives of arachidonic acid were prepared and purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The effect of these compounds on oxygenation of [1-14C]arachidonic acid by platelet cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes was monitored both with an oxygen electrode and by analysis of radioactive products formed. It was found that 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid selectively inhibited platelet lipoxygenase activity at micromolar concentrations (I50 = 8 microM) without inhibiting the cyclooxygenase. The 15-hydroperoxy analog, although more potent, was less selective, whereas neither 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid nor 12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid (ricinoleic acid) appeared to affect either enzyme. The high degree of selectivity of the 15-hydroxy derivative of eicosatetraenoic acid makes it the most suitable inhibitor so far discovered for studying the functions of the platelet lipoxygenase system."

https://openalex.org/W1521905687,"Rat hepatocytes, freshly isolated by a collagenase perfusion technique, bound [3H]asialo-orosomucoid in a sugar-specific and calcium-dependent manner as expected for the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor. At least 90% of the total cell surface-bound [3H]asialo-orosomucoid represented specific binding and could be removed by washing with EDTA. Freshly isolated cells had about 7 x 10(4) surface receptors per cell. However, when cells were incubated at 37 degrees C, the number of surface receptors per cell rapidly increased 2- to 3-fold to about 2.2 x 10(5). This increase in receptor number occurred in the absence of serum and began within minutes, depending on the particular conditions used to keep the cells in suspension. (The maximal rate of appearance of new receptors at 37 degrees C was about 70 receptors per cell per s.) When cells were first exposed to a brief EDTA treatment at 4 degrees C, before measuring the binding of [3H]asialo-orosomucoid, the number of surface receptors per cell was found to increase by about 45%. Therefore, about 30% of the surface receptors on freshly isolated cells have already bound endogenous asialoglycoproteins or are present in the membrane in a cryptic form. At 4 degrees C the binding of [3H]asialo-orosomucoid was rapid (kon greater than or equal to 1.8 x 10(4) M-1s-1), whereas the dissociation of bound [3H]asialo-orosomucoid, measured in the presence of excess nonradioactive glycoprotein, was extremely slow (koff less than or equal to 0.9 x 10(-5) s-1). The association constant calculated from these data (Ka = 2.0 x 10(9) M-1) agreed well with that obtained from equilibrium binding experiments (Ka = 2.4 x 10(9) M-1) using untreated cells or cells which had first been treated with EDTA or incubated at 37 degrees C. In all cases, when the concentration of [3H]asialo-orosomucoid was higher than about 600 ng/ml, the Scatchard plots were curvilinear. The data are, however, consistent with the conclusion that there is a single high affinity receptor on the hepatocyte surface. The additional receptors that appear on the surface when cells are incubated at 37 degrees C or exposed to EDTA are identical with those on untreated cells,"
https://openalex.org/W1983407642,"We have studied the ribonucleoprotein morphology of nascent hnRNA using chromatin spreading methods. This approach allows visualization of multiple transcripts of the same DNA sequence. Thus the RNP structure of hnRNA molecules with the same nucleotide sequence can be compared. We find that RNP particles averaging 240 Å in diameter occur on the majority of hnRNA transcription units, but that RNA fibrils are generally not completely covered with particles. Furthermore, the RNP particle location is nonrandom for the transcripts of a given gene. Particle number and arrangement on RNP fibrils vary from one transcription unit to the next, and are not obviously related to transcription unit size or activity. Analysis of particle location with respect to the 5′ RNA terminus allows RNP particle localization to homologous sequences of less than 500 ribonucleotides on the different fibrils of a single transcription unit. RNP particles assemble very soon after synthesis of the particular sequence. Sites of particle formation are distinct from sites of double-stranded hairpin loops on the RNA fibrils. A differential, or differentially stable, RNP structure with respect to RNA sequence may bear on mechanisms of specific hnRNA processing."

Fish. 36, 1175-1180), this strain releases comparable levels of endo-beta-galactosidase with lower levels of exoglycosidases in the culture medium containing 0.3% of keratan sulfate. Endo-beta-galactosidase was purified by an improved purification procedure involving Amicon H1P10 hollow fiber filtration, QAE-Sephadex A-50, and CM-Sephadex C-50 chromatographies. The purified enzyme is completely free from proteases and exoglycosidases. The general properties of this enzyme are: molecular weight, 28,000; optimal pH, 5.5 TO 5.8; PI, pH 8.0. This enzyme hydrolyzed keratan sulfates isolated from different sources to produce 6-O-sulfo-GlcNAc beta1 leads to 3Gal as the major product. In addition, the specificity of this enzyme toward various glycoconjugates was also studied."
https://openalex.org/W2148072938,"Two sites per subunit of the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component of the kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase complex can be acetylated, and high levels of acetylation can be achieved under conditions in which only a few subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase component are functional (Cate, R. L., and Roche, T. E. (1979) J. Biol. Chem 254, 1659-1665). These obsewations suggest intersite transfer of acetyl groups between lipoyl moieties (two per subunit) of the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component. We have used flowquench rapid reaction studies to evaluate whether a relay system functions to transfer acetyl groups rapidly between sites on the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core. In complexes containing reduced levels of active pyruvate dehydrogenase component, four to seven acetyl groups per active pyruvate dehydrogenase component are introduced at a constant rate nearly equal, for the fraction of active enzyme, to the rate of the overall reaction catalyzed by the complex. The initial round of decarboxylation proceeds at a much faster rate than the incorporation of acetyl groups. Since both the first and second round of acetylation occurs at a constant rate equal to the rate of the overall reaction, reductive acetylation is the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. Furthermore, if only one lipoyl moiety services an a/3 unit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase component, the above data indicate that there is subsequent interlipoyl transfer of acetyl groups which occurs at a faster rate than the reductive acetylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1497518546,"The monovalent ionophore, monensin, inhibits secretion of many different proteins from a wide variety of cells. The site of blockage is at the golgi complex. We have exposed chick embryo chondrocytes in suspension culture to monensin, at concentrations ranging from 10(-8) to 10(-6) M. At the higher concentrations, between 10(-7) and 10(-6) M, monensin inhibited secretion of type II procollagen, which accumulated in the chondrocytes. At these concentrations of the ionophore, proteoglycan synthesis was inhibited, as measured by radioactive serine incorporation into core proteins and by radioactive glucosamine or SO4 incorporation into glycosaminoglycans. However, at a monensin concentration of 3 x 10(-8) M, the incorporations of serine and glucosamine were close to normal while SO4 incorporation was at 30% of control values. The ratio of glucosamine to serine in pronase-released glycosaminoglycans from culture media was unaffected by 3 x 10(-8) M monensin but the sulfate to serine ratio decreased to 29% of control values. Examination of the glycosaminoglycans by gel filtration showed a progressive increase in Kav values as sulfation decreased. Undersulfation was demonstrated by radiochromatographic analysis of the digestion products following incubation with chondroitinase ABC. The composite results show that monensin interferes with sulfation of newly synthesized proteoglycans."

https://openalex.org/W64812184,"The divalent cation ionophore A23187 stimulated release of prolactin from primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. The stimulation required Ca”, since the omission of Ca2+ or the presence of ethylene glycol bisw-aminoethyl ether)N,Np,W-tetraacetic acid inhibited the stimulation. Near-maximal stimulation was obtained with 5 PM A23187 for 10 min. The A23187stimulated release of prolactin was inhibited by preincubating cells for 1 h with 2-Br-a-ergocryptine (bromocriptine), a dopaminergic agonist. The half-maximal inhibition occurred at about 0.5 m and complete inhibition was observed at 3 m. Dopamine and dihydroergocryptine, another dopaminergic agonist, also inhibited the A23187 stimulation. d-Butaclamol and cis(Z)-flupenthixol, dopaminergic antagonists, blocked the bromocriptine inhibition, which suggested that the inhibition was caused by bromocriptine acting on the dopamine receptor. The A23187-stimulated release of prolactin from GH cells, a pituitary tumor cell line that lacks detectable dopamine receptors, was not inhibited by bromocriptine. Cycloheximide did not affect the bromocriptine inhibition, which suggested that protein synthesis is not required. Uptake of 46Ca2’ in the presence and absence of A23187 was not affected by bromocriptine. These data indicate that dopaminergic agonists inhibit prolactin release at a step after Ca2’ uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1605669747,"Abstract Recently, target analysis has been re-evaluated as a technique for the determination of molecular sizes (Kempner, E. S. & Schlegel, W. (1979) Anal. Biochem. 92, 2-10). The technique yields the size of the functional unit, i.e. the minimal assembly of structures necessary for a given function such as an enzymatic activity. Using this method, we have not determined the sizes of the functional units for different enzymatic activities on the arom conjugate from Euglena, a polyenzyme catalyzing five sequential reactions in the shikimic acid pathway, and on two conjugates from Escherichia coli carrying both aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities. In each conjugate, the size for different enzymatic activities was measured and found to be the same. When compared to the molecular weight obtained with other techniques, the target size matched either the entire conjugate (aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase conjugates I and II) or half the unit (arom conjugate). The information was obtained with minimal perturbation of the complexes and sparing laborious purification and reconstitution experiments. Tryptophan synthase was irradiated both as an intact conjugate and also as isolated subunits. In both structural forms, beta 2 was identified as the functional unit for the conversion of indole and serine to tryptophan. The results of this study give insight into the structural assembly of these polyenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1892817182,"The carbohydrate portion of prothrombin fragment 1 has been removed by fluorolysis in anhydrous HF. The deglycosylated protein retains its calcium- and membrane-binding properties. The slow, calcium-dependent protein transition monitored by changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence remains intact for the aglycoprotein. Calcium-dependent protein-membrane binding is also observed and can be quantitatively reversed with EDTA. The major alteration resulting from carbohydrate removal is the degree of protein self-association. Both the normal and deglycosylated proteins undergo a rapid self-association which approaches a dimer in the presence of calcium. This self-association is independent of the slow change in intrinsic fluorescence. The deglycosylated protein then undergoes a secondary self-association with kinetics identical with the fluorescence change. This secondary self-association also occurs on the membrane surface. This suggests that the calcium-dependent conformational change exposes a site on the protein which functions in secondary self-association. The carbohydrate apparently masks this site in the native molecule."

Inhibition of the carboxylase reaction was mixed competitive with respect to CO2 (Ki = 1.2 mM) and uncompetitive with respect to RuP2. For the oxygenase reaction, H2O2 was a competitive inhibitor with respect to O2 (Ki = 2.1 mM) and an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to RuP2. H2O2 did not alter the stoichiometry between CO2 and RuP2 in the carboxylase reaction, indicating that H2O2 was not itself a substrate for the enzyme. RuP2 decreased the rate of deactivation of the enzyme which occurred at limiting CO2 concentrations. H2O2 greatly enhanced this stabilizing effect of RuP2 but had no effect on the rate of deactivation in the absence of RuP2. The inhibitory and stabilizing effects of H2O2 varied similarly with H2O2 concentration. These instantaneous, reversible effects of H2O2 were readily distinguishable from an irreversible inhibitory effect which occurred quite slowly, and in the absence of RuP2. These observations are discussed in relation to the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and its activation-deactivation transformations."

Both U3A and U3B RNAs contained 5' caps and were 216 nucleotides long. The nucleotide sequence 1 to 87 was identical in both U3A and U3B, but differences were found at 18 positions in the remainder of the sequence. Of these differences, 11 were single base replacements, two were dinucleotide replacement AU leads to GG at positions 93 to 94, UC leads to GG at positions 173 to 174, and one was a trinucleotide replacement, UCG leads to CUU at positions 179 to 181. Of the total 18 base replacements, 11 (61%) were purine leads to purine or pyrimidine leads to pyrimidine. Interestingly, two base insertions/deletions were found in each RNA when both RNA sequences were compared for maximum sequence similarity.

The results, together with the data on cyanogen bromide peptides and two additional tryptic peptides from cyanogen bromide peptides reported in the accompanying paper, established the complete amino acid sequence of human erythrocyte phosphoglycerate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W18434774,"An intraspecies hybrid apoferritin was assembled by mixing subunits of horse heart ferritin, which consists mainly of H-type subunits, and horse spleen ferritin, in which L-type subunits predominate. Interspecies hybrid apoferritins were reconstituted from subunits of human liver-horse spleen ferritins and from rat liver-horse spleen ferritins. All the hybrid ferritins migrated as single zones with electrophoretic mobilities intermediate between those of the parent ferritins. Isoelectric focusing data and immunological patterns were consistent with the view that the reassembled apoferritins were composite molecules that contained subunits from each of the interacting forms. Reconstitution occurred in a random manner, as there was no apparent preference for assembly of homologous subunits. These results suggest that intersubunit interaction domains and recognition mechanisms that dictate formation of the highly specific quaternary structure assumed by this protein are common for different species of ferritins."
https://openalex.org/W2401159106,"The ribonucleotide reductase from Anabaena 7119 has been purified approximately 60- to 80-fold by conventional techniques and adsorption to the affinity medium, Matrix Gel Red A. The enzyme from Anabaena resembles the adenosylcobalamin-dependent reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii, in that it is a small molecule (molecular weight 72,000) with no subunit structure as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unlike its prototype, the Anabaena reductase is absolutely dependent on a divalent cation for activity, Ca2+ being the most effective. In addition, the Anabaena reductase shows a simple pattern of alloteric control by deoxyribonucleotides. CTP reduction is stimulated by dATP, GTP by dTTP, and ATP by dGTP. No reduction is observed in the absence of effectors, and none of the effectors inhibits enzyme activity. Thus, the Anabaena ribonucleotide reductase can be more easily studied by kinetic analysis than the Lactobacillus enzyme, and should provide additional information as to the mechanism of action of this enzyme in a photosynthetic organism."
https://openalex.org/W1523800232,"The proteolytic processing of rat pre-prolactin (Pre-Prl) to prolactin in isolated hemipituitaries was inhibited by the threonine analog, beta-hydroxynorvaline (Hnv). Pre-Prl accumulated as a major labeled intracellular product, even during pulse labeling longer than 2 h, but it was not secreted. Inhibition of Pre-Prl processing may result from incorporation of Hnv at the Pre-Prl cleavage site. This system offers the opportunity to study the disposition of an accumulated pre-protein in cells."

https://openalex.org/W1487105326,"Abstract The essential sulfhydryl group of the ornithine transcarbamylases (ornithine carbamoyltransferase, 2.1.3.3) from bovine liver and Streptococcus faecalis reacts preferentially with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol. The spectra of this derivative between pH 4.4 AND 8.8 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED INto the spectrum of the nitrophenolate ion (III) and two species of phenol (I and II). The lambda max of I and II (both enzymes) and III (bovine) are red shifted from those of the comparable species in the same derivative of 2-mercaptoethanol. Deprotonation of a residue on the enzyme must be responsible for the transition from I to II. The pK values of the phenolic group are 7.1 (mercaptoethanol), 7.7 (bovine), and 8.8 (S. faecalis). The red shift in the lambda max of III and the modest increase in the pK of the phenolic group are consistent with a relatively hydrophobic environment for the nitrophenolate ion in the bovine enzyme. Since deprotonation of the residue in the bovine enzyme perturbs the pK of the phenolic group only slightly, its effect may be indirect. Interaction with a neighboring carboxyl group (pK 5.3) would account for the large increase in the pK of the phenolic group in the S. faecalis enzyme, which is not accompanied by an appreciable shift in the lambda max. Carbamyl-P increases the pK of the phenolic group in both enzymes, a result consistent with its binding site being close to the essential sulfhydryl group."
https://openalex.org/W1977394153,The calcium ionophore A23187 brings about an influx of calcium and uptake of sucrose by endocytosis in Amoeba proteus. The amount of endocytotic sucrose uptake elicited by the ionophore depends upon the external calcium ion concentration. Calcium ion movements may serve to couple the surface phase of endocytosis with cytoplasmic uptake of the endocytotic inducer.
