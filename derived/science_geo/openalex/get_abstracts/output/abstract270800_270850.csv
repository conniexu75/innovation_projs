https://openalex.org/W2093777948,"Pinyon pine, Pinus edulis (Engelm.), in Northern Arizona is exposed to recurring high levels of herbivory by the moth Dioryctria albovitella (Hust.). During a 3-year period, infested trees experienced on average a 30 percent reduction in annual shoot production. This herbivory affects tree architecture, growth rate, reproductive output, and sexual expression. Less infested trees produce 47 percent more trunk wood, 43 percent more branch wood, and are monoecious. Architectural changes in infested trees can result infunctionally male plants due to a complete loss of normal female cone-bearing ability. When herbivores are experimentally removed, normal growth and reproduction patterns resume. These strong herbivore impacts should represent a potent selection pressure in the evolution of host traits."
https://openalex.org/W2056058685,The legumes are an important group of flowering plants with a poorly documented evolutionary history. New fossil evidence provides data on the timing of the origin of the two derived subfamilies of legumes (the Mimosoideae and Papilionoideae). These data strongly suggest the importance of bee pollinators during a major period of angiosperm diversification.
https://openalex.org/W2065842357,"Major environmental changes recorded in pollen records from various sites in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego are also reflected in pollen and cuticle data from dung of the late Pleistocene groundsloth. The most prominent change was the large-scale reduction of steppe environment about 10,000 years ago, which coincides with the latest dates for extinctions of many large grazers such as the giant groundsloth. Stress on food resources for all the large grazers may well have hastened their extinction. Hunting pressure by paleoindians may have been the final blow."
https://openalex.org/W2046876420,"Africanized drone honey bees (Apis mellifera) migrate into European honey-bee colonies in large numbers, but Africanized colonies only rarely host drones from other colonies. This migration leads to a strong mating advantage for Africanized bees since it both inhibits European drone production and enhances Africanized drone production."

https://openalex.org/W2046435876,"A deposit of fossil seabirds from the late Pliocene of Florida includes more than 130 skeletons of an extinct cormorant that is related phylogenetically to Recent species currently restricted to the eastern north Pacific. Evidence suggests the birds died in a single catastrophic event, perhaps a red tide. The fossil cormorant, along with other extinct seabirds and marine mammals, supports molluscan evidence for cold-water upwelling along the Florida Gulf Coast during the Pliocene. A decline in species richness of marine vertebrates throughout the Pliocene of Florida coincides with cessation of upwelling after emergences of the Panamanian Land Bridge."

It is concluded that the losses observed are greatly dependent upon the method of sample preparation, in particular the nature or any heat treatment which the sample materials undergo."

Evidence for its existence is now at the level of two standard deviations above background, but a solid claim for discovery will not be made until the probability is five standard deviations. That should require one more year of experimentation."

https://openalex.org/W2051151988,"On 10 December 1993 the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) at the Princetone Plasma Physics Laboratory generated 6 million watts, a world record for the amount of power produced by a fusion reactor. The achievement was heralded as proof of fusion's potential as a virtually inexhaustible supply of electrical energy. Sometime in late 1994 or early 1995 the 43-year-old lab will set another, less auspicious record: TFTR will be shut down, and the flagship lab in the U.S. fusion program will be left without an operating fusion experiment. This article examines DOE's fusion research program and shows that in the future Japan and Europe will dominate fusion research. The U.S. has only two operating reactors and may soon have only one. 2 figs."
