https://openalex.org/W2024457805,We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the human beta-globin gene. The purpose of this study is to obtain information necessary to study the evolutionary relationships between members of the human beta-like globin gene family and to provide the basis for comparing normal beta-globin genes with those obtained from the DNA of individuals with genetic defects in hemoglobin expression.

https://openalex.org/W1999477520,"The avian sarcoma virus-transforming gene product (pp60src) appears potentially able to mediate cell transformation via phosphorylation since it is tightly associated with a protein kinase activity. We have searched for and have been able to identify a normal cellular protein that appears to be a substrate of pp60src. The phosphorylation of this protein (34K) in transformation-specific in ASV-transformed cells of both avian and mammalian origin. Moreover, the 34K polypeptide serves as a substrate for the pp60src phosphotransferase activity in vitro and is phosphorylated at a site identical to the major site of phosphorylation in vivo. These data suggest that upon transformation the 34,000-dalton protein is phosphorylated directly as a result of pp60src activity."

https://openalex.org/W2030333676,"Purified circular DNA of SV40 or polyoma virus has been injected into unfertilized eggs of Xenopus laevis. Injected DNA initiates and completes multiple rounds of semiconservative replication while observing cellular regulatory signals. Thus replication initiation of double-stranded templates is induced after the oocyte is matured in vitro by progesterone. Only one round of replication of injected DNA is observed in a single cell cycle. When protein synthesis is inhibited unreplicated molecules continue to initiate replication at an undiminished rate, but reinitiation on previously replicated molecules is completely and selectively abolished. The DNA sequence requirements for the replication of injected DNA have been investigated. A variety of procaryotic DNA molecules and circularized fragments of SV40 or polyoma DNA replicate, regardless of whether they contain the viral origin of DNA replication. These results suggest that a specialized DNA sequence is not essential for the initiation of semiconservative DNA replication in the Xenopus embryo, nor is a specialized sequence essential for the mechanism which prevents reinitiation on a molecule which has already replicated within a cell cycle. The possibility is discussed that viral origins of replication are not valid models for the eucaryotic chromosome but are adaptations for uncoupling viral replication from the mechanism which prevents reinitiation within a cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2048450126,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide, a smooth-muscle relaxant neuropeptide with neurotransmitter properties, was relaxed during electrical field stimulation of guinea pig trachea. The amount released correlated with the degree of relaxation, and the release was blocked by tetrodotoxin. Prior incubation of the trachea with antiserum to vasoactive intestinal peptide reduced the relaxation. Thus vasoactive intestinal peptide may mediate the nonadrenergic relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1877124491,"We describe the complete nucleotide sequence of the human ϵ-globin gene including 387 nucleotides of 5′ flanking sequence and 301 nucleotides of 3′ flanking sequence. The arrangement of coding, noncoding and intervening sequences in this gene is entirely consistent with its identification as the embryonic β-like globin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2088046252,"Platelet-derived growth factor does not compete with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for binding to EGF receptors on the murine 3T3 cell surface, but it modulates EGF receptors in two ways: (i) it induces a transient down regulation of EGF receptors and (ii) it inhibits EGF-induced down regulation of EGF receptors. These data suggest a common cellular internalization mechanism for the receptors for both hormones."

https://openalex.org/W2039436446,"Incubation of astrocytoma cells with catecholamines results in a decrease in catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and a concomitant alteration in the sedimentation properties of particulate beta-adrenergic receptors. The altered receptors exhibit agonist binding properties similar to those of receptors that are ""uncoupled"" from adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2051500993,"Repeated electroconvulsive shock, applied to rats, induces a subsensitivity of dopamine autoreceptors located in the substantia nigra as indexed by single-unit electrophysiological techniques. This reduced sensitivity is time-dependent, since effects similar to those seen with repeated treatment were also observed when single electroconvulsive shock was followed by an appropriate treatment-free interval. These data, coupled with identical results after the repeated administration of tricyclic antidepressants, raise the possibility that a reduction of dopamine autoreceptor sensitivity could underlie both electroconvulsive shock and pharmacological treatment of depression."

https://openalex.org/W1976368638,"In the rat, doses of glucose sufficient to raise glucose concentrations in the blood to levels equivalent to those produced by a meal or stress suppress the firing of dopamine-containing neurons located within the substantia nigra. Glucose also prevents or reverses the increase in discharge rates of dopaminergic cells normally elicited by the antipsychotic agent haloperidol."

There was no change in pituitary or hypothalamic adrenocorticotropin content as a result of fasting. Endogenous opiates may be involved in physiological adaptation to fasting."

https://openalex.org/W2100459890,"A specific family of tandemly repeated DNA sequences was found to diminish in the human genome after serial passage of three strains of diploid fibroblasts. Eco RI restriction fragments of 340 and 680 bp were significantly reduced in quantity at late passage as determined by autoradiography of 14C-DNA and also by ethidium bromide fluorescence. The reduction in these closely related DNA sequences was confirmed by saturation hybridization to excess 3H-RNA transcribed from a homogeneous restriction fragment recleaved from the 340 bp DNA. The maximal fraction of DNA hybridizing to the 3H-RNA probe declined by 33–50% over 21–41 population doublings. Divergence and/or methylation of such sequences could not account for these results since the thermal stability of cRNA:DNA duplexes actually increased by 0.3°C at late passage. Total highly repetitive sequences assayed by reassociation kinetics were also substantially reduced at late passage, implying that depletion may be common to many repeat families in DNA. The denaturation temperature for such rapidly reassociated duplexes again increased slightly at late passage, possibly reflecting the minor decreases in DNA methylation which were detected in two of the cell strains. Karyotype analyses demonstrated that over 95% euploidy was maintained, with no specific chromosome loss and no visible deletions at late passage. The depletion of reiterated sequences during repeated cell division is thus attributed to numerous small DNA deletions, which may arise from unequal recombination coupled with selection or from a nonreciprocal mechanism such as excision."

https://openalex.org/W2015577413,"The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis has been implicated as the site of receptors mediating central responses of angiotensin II. Up to now, this had been based on indirect evidence, but direct visualization of angiotensin II at its site of action has now been achieved by the use of a biologically active fluorescent angiotensin II agonist. The ventricular surface of the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis showed intense fluorescence, which was virtually eliminated by an excess of unlabeled angiotensin II."

https://openalex.org/W1991468083,"Mice inoculated with herpes simplex virus (type 1) by the lip or corneal route and then passively immunized with rabbit antibody to herpes simplex virus developed a latent infection in the trigeminal ganglia within 96 hours. Neutralizing antibody to herpes simplex virus was cleared from the circulation and could not be detected in most of these mice after 2 months. Examination of ganglia from the antibody-negative mice revealed latent virus in over 90 percent of the animals, indicating that serum neutralizing antibody is not necessary to maintain the latent state. When the lips or corneas of these mice were traumatized, viral reactivation occurred in up to 90 percent of the mice, as demonstrated by the appearance of neutralizing antibody. This study provides a model for identifying factors that trigger viral reactivation."

https://openalex.org/W2031679432,"The anticonvulsants ethosuximide, sodium valproate, and trimethadione that are specific for petit mal epilepsy abolished in rats the electrical seizure activity and behavioral abnormalities produced by leucine enkephalin, whereas phenobarbital and phenytoin had no effect. The dose-response curve for naloxone against seizure activity induced by leucine enkephalin was the same as that in γ-hydroxybutyrate-induced petit mal. These data indicate that the epileptic properties of leucine enkephalin are petit mal-like and raise the possibility of involvement of enkephalinergic systems in petit mal epilepsy."

Microinjection of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and several related peptides into the periaqueductal gray matter significantly reduced responsiveness to pain and had a behavioral profile similar to that produced by beta-endorphin."

https://openalex.org/W2013414178,We have constructed two SV40 recombinants carrying a complete mouse alpha-globin gene with its presumptive promoter region. In one recombinant the globin gene can be transcribed either from its own promoter or from the adjacent viral late region promoter. In the other efficient globin expression should depend only upon the promoter carried by the chromosomal globin gene. We show that both viruses direct the synthesis of functional globin mRNA in infected monkey kidney cells and that this mRNA has a 5' terminus indistinguishable from that of authentic globin mRNA. These results suggest that the cloned globin gene contains a functional promoter that is accurately recognized in monkey kidney cells.

https://openalex.org/W1989232463,The coding sequences for the transforming (src) protein (p21) of Harvey murine sarcoma virus have been localized to a 1.3 kilobase pair segment near the 5' end of the viral genome. Ligation of the viral terminal repeat DNA to the left end of the src region DNA markedly enhanced the low transforming efficiency of the src region DNA.
https://openalex.org/W2054599495,The response to different environmental conditions and negative air ions was investigated on cerebral cortical serotonin and cyclic nucleotides. The results indicated that negative air ions alter the weight of the cerebral cortex and that concentrations of serotonin and cyclic nucleotides can be altered both by different environments and by negative air ions. The data stress the importance of the role of the environment when studying the structure and chemistry of the cerebral cortex.

https://openalex.org/W2050471025,"A glycoprotein of molecular weight 130,000 (gP130) has been precipitated from the cytoplasm of GR-strain mouse mammary tumor (GR-MMT) cells by a rabbit antiserum (anti-MMTV) to GR-strain mouse mammary tumor virus (GR-MMTV). This protein was not precipitated by antisera specific for detergent-disrupted C3H-strain MMTV (C3H-MMTV); C3H-MMTV glycoproteins; C3H-MMTV nonglycosylated proteins; GR-MMTV p25 or p12; RIII strain (milk) MMTV proteins; or Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) proteins; nor was it precipitated by normal rabbit serum. Two-dimensional thin layer analysis of 35S-methionine-containing tryptic peptides revealed that five of nine gp33 peptides and one of seven gp55 peptides are shared by gP130 and gPr76env. The envelope protein precursor, gPr76env, contains all of the gp33 peptides and six of seven gp55 peptides. One peptide in gPr76env, possibly a gp55-gp33 junction peptide, is also apparently present in gP130. Six of ten p25 peptides and four more gag-related peptides are shared by PR78gag and gP130. Protein gP130 also contains several tryptic peptides not found in gPr76env or in the core protein precursors Pr78gag, Pr110gag or Pr180gag-pol. Radioimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that gP130 could be precipitated from extracts of GR-MMTV cells with anti-MMTV serum even after antibodies to the known MMTV structural proteins had been removed from the serum by absorption. Both gP130 and a second protein, p30, were found in immunoprecipitates of detergent-disrupted isotopically labeled GR-MMTV treated with the absorbed anti-MMTV serum. These results suggest that antibodies to gP130 in the anti-MMTV serum are capable of recognizing those protein sequences unique to gP130; that is, those protein sequences which are not related to viral structural proteins. In light of these data and data published previously, gP130 is apparently a polyprotein containing juxtaposed components translated from the 5' and 3' end of the MMTV genome and protein components not previously identified as virus-specific."
