https://openalex.org/W3043831218,"Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, the longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here we serially analysed immune responses in 113 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages, with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. An early elevation in cytokine levels was associated with worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, patients with moderate COVID-19 displayed a progressive reduction in type 1 (antiviral) and type 3 (antifungal) responses. By contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of the disease. Moreover, severe COVID-19 was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors, including interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-13, immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four immune signatures, representing growth factors (A), type-2/3 cytokines (B), mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines (C), and chemokines (D) that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories. The immune profiles of patients who recovered from moderate COVID-19 were enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature A, whereas the profiles of those with who developed severe disease had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we have identified a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcome, as well as early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories."

When expanded, these tandem DNA repeats have been associated with more than 40 monogenic disorders1. Their involvement in disorders with complex genetics is largely unknown, as is the extent of their heterogeneity. Here we investigated the genome-wide characteristics of tandem repeats that had motifs with a length of 2-20 base pairs in 17,231 genomes of families containing individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)2,3 and population control individuals4. We found extensive polymorphism in the size and sequence of motifs. Many of the tandem repeat loci that we detected correlated with cytogenetic fragile sites. At 2,588 loci, gene-associated expansions of tandem repeats that were rare among population control individuals were significantly more prevalent among individuals with ASD than their siblings without ASD, particularly in exons and near splice junctions, and in genes related to the development of the nervous system and cardiovascular system or muscle. Rare tandem repeat expansions had a prevalence of 23.3% in children with ASD compared with 20.7% in children without ASD, which suggests that tandem repeat expansions make a collective contribution to the risk of ASD of 2.6%. These rare tandem repeat expansions included previously undescribed ASD-linked expansions in DMPK and FXN, which are associated with neuromuscular conditions, and in previously unknown loci such as FGF14 and CACNB1. Rare tandem repeat expansions were associated with lower IQ and adaptive ability. Our results show that tandem DNA repeat expansions contribute strongly to the genetic aetiology and phenotypic complexity of ASD."

https://openalex.org/W3044175205,"Chromothripsis and kataegis are frequently observed in cancer and may arise from telomere crisis, a period of genome instability during tumorigenesis when depletion of the telomere reserve generates unstable dicentric chromosomes1–5. Here we examine the mechanism underlying chromothripsis and kataegis by using an in vitro telomere crisis model. We show that the cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1, which promotes the resolution of dicentric chromosomes4, plays a prominent role in chromothriptic fragmentation. In the absence of TREX1, the genome alterations induced by telomere crisis primarily involve breakage–fusion–bridge cycles and simple genome rearrangements rather than chromothripsis. Furthermore, we show that the kataegis observed at chromothriptic breakpoints is the consequence of cytosine deamination by APOBEC3B. These data reveal that chromothripsis and kataegis arise from a combination of nucleolytic processing by TREX1 and cytosine editing by APOBEC3B. Nucleic acid processing by the cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1 and cytosine editing by APOBEC3B drive chromothripsis and kataegis during telomere crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3044717219,"It remains unknown if biophysical or material properties of biomolecular condensates regulate cancer. Here we show that AKAP95, a nuclear protein that regulates transcription and RNA splicing, plays an important role in tumorigenesis by supporting cancer cell growth and suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. AKAP95 forms phase-separated and liquid-like condensates in vitro and in nucleus. Mutations of key residues to different amino acids perturb AKAP95 condensation in opposite directions. Importantly, the activity of AKAP95 in splice regulation is abolished by disruption of condensation, significantly impaired by hardening of condensates, and regained by substituting its condensation-mediating region with other condensation-mediating regions from irrelevant proteins. Moreover, the abilities of AKAP95 in regulating gene expression and supporting tumorigenesis require AKAP95 to form condensates with proper liquidity and dynamicity. These results link phase separation to tumorigenesis and uncover an important role of appropriate biophysical properties of protein condensates in gene regulation and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3043844061,"N6-Methyladenosine (m6A), the methylation of the adenosine base at the nitrogen 6 position, is the most common epitranscriptomic modification of mRNA that affects a wide variety of biological functions. We have previously reported that hepatitis B viral RNAs are m6A-modified, displaying a dual functional role in the viral life cycle. Here, we show that cellular m6A machinery regulates host innate immunity against hepatitis B and C viral infections by inducing m6A modification of viral transcripts. The depletion of the m6A writer enzymes (METTL3 and METTL14) leads to an increase in viral RNA recognition by retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), thereby stimulating type I interferon production. This is reversed in cells in which m6A METTL3 and METTL14 are overexpressed. The m6A modification of viral RNAs renders RIG-I signaling less effective, whereas single nucleotide mutation of m6A consensus motif of viral RNAs enhances RIG-I sensing activity. Importantly, m6A reader proteins (YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) inhibit RIG-I–transduced signaling activated by viral RNAs by occupying m6A-modified RNAs and inhibiting RIG-I recognition. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the mechanism of immune evasion via m6A modification of viral RNAs.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are diverse viruses that belong to the Hepadnaviridae and Flaviviridae families, respectively, but share common pathologies (1Seeger C. Mason W.S.

Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates via an RNA intermediate termed pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) to produce viral DNA by the reverse-transcription activity by the encoded viral polymerase (1Seeger C. Mason W.S. Molecular biology of hepatitis B virus infection.Virology. 2015; 479-480 (25759099): 672-68610.1016/j.virol.2015.02.031Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). HCV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (viral polymerase) to replicate viral RNA from a template RNA (2Suzuki T. Aizaki H. Murakami K. Shoji I.

HBV and HCV infections cause liver inflammation and carry the risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (3de Martel C. Maucort-Boulch D. Plummer M. Franceschi S.

When a virus infects a host cell, an innate immune response, which represents the first line of defense, is triggered within minutes. Viruses, however, escape host innate immunity by subverting these pathways to optimize long-term survival (4Braciale T.J. Hahn Y.S. Immunity to viruses.Immunol. Rev. 2013; 255 (23947343): 5-1210.1111/imr.12109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The HBV pgRNA and HCV RNA genomes are recognized by RIG-I for the activation of interferon (IFN) synthesis (5Sato S. Li K. Kameyama T. Hayashi T. Ishida Y. Murakami S. Watanabe T. Iijima S.

HCV nonstructural proteins (NS3/4 protease) cleave mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) to block the innate immune signals (7Li X.D. Sun L.J. Seth R.B. Pineda G. Chen Z.J.J.

However, HCV infection still induces IFN synthesis in primary human hepatocyte and in the chimpanzee model, representing acute infection (8Yang D. Liu N. Zuo C. Lei S. Wu X. Zhou F. Liu C. Zhu H.

One of the mechanisms among others has been attributed to HBx protein, which disrupts RIG-I/MAVS signals by ubiquitination of mitochondria-associated MAVS protein (12Khan M. Syed G.H. Kim S.J.

The mechanisms by which these viruses suppress innate immunity continue to be the subject of investigations. The RIG-I signaling pathway is one of the host-defense systems, designed to eliminate the viral infection. RIG-I protein consists of tandem N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) that participate in signaling, a DExD/H-box helicase domain with RNA binding and ATP-hydrolysis activity, and a C-terminal domain. The 5′ ppp of double-strand RNA is the ligand of RIG-I (15Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzózka K. Jung A. Kato H. Poeck H. Akira S. Conzelmann K.K. Schlee M. Endres S. Hartmann G. 5′-Triphosphate RNA is the ligand for RIG-I.Science. 2006; 314 (17038590): 994-99710.1126/science.1132505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand RNA, RIG-I adopts auto-repressed conformation (16Pichlmair A. Schulz O. Tan C.P. Näslund T.I. Liljeström P. Weber F. Reis e Sousa C. RIG-I–mediated antiviral responses to single-stranded RNA bearing 5′-phosphates.Science. 2006; 314 (17038589): 997-100110.1126/science.1132998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). The conformational change of RIG-I is induced by RNA ligand interacting with a C-terminal domain, which releases CARDs for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and binding of unanchored Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains (17Zeng W. Sun L. Jiang X. Chen X. Hou F. Adhikari A. Xu M. Chen Z.J. Reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway reveals a signaling role of unanchored polyubiquitin chains in innate immunity.Cell. 2010; 141 (20403326): 315-33010.1016/j.cell.2010.03.029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The polyubiquitinated CARDs then engage the adaptor, MAVS via CARD–CARD domain interactions, to activate a cascade of downstream signaling resulting in type I IFN gene synthesis (18Gack M.U. Shin Y.C. Joo C.H. Urano T. Liang C. Sun L. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Chen Z. Inoue S. Jung J.U. TRIM25 RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase is essential for RIG-I–mediated antiviral activity.Nature. 2007; 446 (17392790): 916-92010.1038/nature05732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IRF-3, a transcription factor, is one of the key molecules in the pathway promoting the transcription of IFN genes (19Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Virus-dependent phosphorylation of the IRF-3 transcription factor regulates nuclear translocation, transactivation potential, and proteasome-mediated degradation.Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18 (9566918): 2986-299610.1128/mcb.18.5.2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The mammalian mRNAs are modified by diverse chemical modifications such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methlcytidine, and inosine in addition to N7-methylguanosine, which is part of the 5′-terminal cap (20Flamme M. McKenzie L.K. Sarac I. Hollenstein M. Chemical methods for the modification of RNA.Methods. 2019; 161 (30905751): 64-8210.1016/j.ymeth.2019.03.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Among the diverse internal RNA chemical modifications, m6A RNA methylation is the most prevalent mRNA modification. (21Shi H.L. Wei J.B. He C. Where, when, and how: context-dependent functions of RNA methylation writers, readers, and erasers.Mol.

Over 25% of mammalian transcripts are m6A-modified. m6A methylation has been linked to various biological processes, which include; innate immune response, sex determination, stem cell differentiation, circadian clock, meiosis, stress response, and cancer (21Shi H.L. Wei J.B. He C. Where, when, and how: context-dependent functions of RNA methylation writers, readers, and erasers.Mol.

A methyltransferase complex composed of METT3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, and WTAP place m6A modification on mRNA co-transcriptionally (21Shi H.L. Wei J.B. He C. Where, when, and how: context-dependent functions of RNA methylation writers, readers, and erasers.Mol.

This modification is typically enriched in 3′-UTR and near the stop codons of cellular mRNA. The m6A-modified mRNA is especially recognized by YTH-domain family proteins (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3) to regulate mRNA stability, translation, and localization (22Du H. Zhao Y. He J.Q. Zhang Y. Xi H.R. Liu M.F. Ma J.B. Wu L.G. YTHDF2 destabilizes m6A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.Nat.

Identification of m6A demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) and ALKBH5, capable of eliminating m6A methylation, suggests that m6A modification is reversibly catalyzed by methyltransferase and demethylase (24Yue Y.

Although differences in the role of m6A among viruses can lead to different consequences in their life cycle, these reports reinforce the notion that these RNA modifications might play an important role in various aspects of the viral life cycle and most importantly in disease pathogenesis. In this study, we define the role of m6A-modified HBV transcripts and the HCV RNA genome in regulating the host innate immune systems. We demonstrate that cellular m6A machinery regulates the RIG-I signaling pathway activated by virus infection. Importantly, m6A modification in the RIG-I–sensing region of viral RNAs reduces innate immune response by inhibition of RIG-I recognition of viral RNAs. Furthermore, we found that YTHDF2 binds m6A-modified viral RNAs preventing their recognition by RIG-I. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism of immune evasion via m6A modification of viral RNA, where YTHDF2 binds m6A-modified motifs of viral RNAs, preventing recognition by RIG-I. To determine whether m6A modification of viral RNA affects host immune response, we used the previously developed mutants of m6A modification sites (A1907C) of HBV 1.3-mer; in the pgRNA 5′ stem-loop (5′-MT), or the 3′ stem-loop (3′-MT) (Fig. 1A). The p-IRF-3 expression level was up-regulated in HBV 1.3-mer 5′-MT transfected cells compared with WT transfection, whereas mutation of m6A site in the 3′ stem-loop did not affect phosphorylation of IRF-3 (199 ± 25.7% increase of p-IRF-3 levels in 5′-MT transfection; Fig. 1B). Poly(I:C) serves as a positive control. Because the mutation of m6A site in ε structure leads to a base-pair mismatch in lower stem-loop, the secondary structure of lower stem-loop could be distorted by A1907C mutation (Fig. 1C). Because the induced p-IRF-3 by pHBV 1.3-mer 5′-MT transfection could be due to this structure alteration, we analyzed p-IRF-3 levels in cells transfected with compensatory mutant (CM) plasmid, in which U is mutated to G to restore base pairing (Fig. 1, C and D). Importantly, we found that p-IRF-3 levels were similar to the original mutant (5′-MT), suggesting that helical structural change did not cause this effect. Next, we determined whether cellular m6A machinery affects innate immune response activated by the presence of HBV RNA, and we depleted METTL3 and 14 by siRNA in HepG2 hepatoma cells and transfected these cells with HBV 1.3-mer plasmid. The silencing of m6A methyltransferases increased phosphorylation of IRF-3 induced by HBV transfection relative to its level in cells treated with control siRNA (178 ± 20.21% increase of p-IRF-3 level in METTL3 + 14 depletion) (Fig. 1E), whereas METTL3 and 14 overexpression reduced phosphorylation of IRF-3 (49 ± 5.69% decrease of p-IRF-3 in METTL3 and 14 overexpression) (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, HBV transfection in HepG2 cells induces IRF-3 activation but does not induce IFN synthesis (5Sato S. Li K. Kameyama T. Hayashi T. Ishida Y. Murakami S. Watanabe T. Iijima S. Sakurai Y. Watashi K. Tsutsumi S. Sato Y. Akita H. Wakita T. Rice C.M. et al.The RNA sensor RIG-I dually functions as an innate sensor and direct antiviral factor for hepatitis B virus.Immunity. 2015; 42 (25557055): 123-13210.1016/j.immuni.2014.12.016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, we could analyze only p-IRF-3 levels in HBV transfected cells. Previously, we reported that m6A modification of 5′ ε structure induces reverse-transcription activity, and m6A modification of 3′ ε structure reduces viral RNA stabilities. Thus, our observed effects of the silencing of m6A methyltransferases on IRF-3 activation could be due to the alterations of HBV replication and translation. To exclude this possibility, we depleted m6A machinery in pHBV 1.3-mer 5′-MT or 3′-MT transfected cells and analyzed phosphorylation of IRF-3 levels (Fig. S1, A and B). The knockdown of METTL3 and 14 did not affect p-IRF-3 levels in pHBV 1.3-mer 5′-MT transfected cells, whereas depletion of m6A methyltransferases induced phosphorylation of IRF-3 in pHBV 1.3-mer 3′-MT transfected cells. Collectively, these results suggest that m6A modification of HBV 5′ ε RNA critically determines IRF-3 activation during HBV replication. Because it is known that the 5′ ε structure is recognized by RIG-I to induce the innate immune response (5Sato S. Li K. Kameyama T. Hayashi T. Ishida Y. Murakami S. Watanabe T. Iijima S. Sakurai Y.

We also carried out similar experiments during HCV RNA transfection. We depleted METTL3 and 14 by siRNAs transfection of Huh7 cells and transfected these cells with in vitro transcribed HCV GND RNA from JFH-1 GND plasmid (Fig. 2, A–C). JFH-1 GND contains a point mutation in the viral polymerase region; hence it does not replicate but RIG-I sensing is normal (33Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z.J. Murthy K. Habermann A. Kräusslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Production of infectious hepatitis C virus in tissue culture from a cloned viral genome.Nat. Med. 2005; 11 (15951748): 791-79610.1038/nm1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Because HCV NS3/4 protein expression inhibits the immune response by cleaving the MAVS protein (7Li X.D. Sun L.J. Seth R.B. Pineda G. Chen Z.J.J. Hepatitis C virus protease NS3/4A cleaves mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein off the mitochondria to evade innate immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We determined IFN-β mRNA and IRF-3 phosphorylation levels in cells harvested at 16 h post-transfected with HCV GND RNA. We observed that METTL3 and 14 depletion significantly increased IFN-β synthesis and IRF-3 activation relative to its level in cells treated with control siRNA (1.6-fold increase of IFN-β mRNA in METTL3 + 14 depleted cells; 177 ± 15.5% increase of p-IRF-3 level in METTL3 + 14 depleted cells; Fig. 2, A and C). Conversely, overexpression of m6A methyltransferases complexes decreased IFN-β mRNA levels and phosphorylation of IRF-3 (2.1-fold decrease of IFN-β mRNA in METTL3 + 14 overexpression; 58 ± 17.1% decrease of p-IRF-3 level in METTL3 + 14 overexpression) (Fig. 2, D and F). These results suggest that host m6A machinery regulates the IRF-3–mediated IFN signaling pathway induced by the HCV RNAs in the early step of HCV infection. After determining that m6A machinery affects IFN signaling pathway activated by the HCV RNA, we next tested whether m6A modification within pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by RIG-I affects IFN-β mRNA level and phosphorylation of IRF-3. Saito et al. (6Saito T. Owen D.M. Jiang F.G. Marcotrigiano J. Gale M.

There are approximately 19 regions that are m6A-modified within the HCV RNA genome (27Gokhale N.S. McIntyre A.B.R. McFadden M.J. Roder A.E. Kennedy E.M. Gandara J.A. Hopcraft S.E. Quicke K.M.

We analyzed whether the HCV PAMP RNA contains m6A-methylated sites. Unexpectedly, the HCV PAMP RNA did not contain any m6A modification (DRACH motif), but an m6A modification site was identified at nucleotide 8766 of HCV RNA ∼100 bp upstream of the PAMP RNA (Fig. 2G) (27Gokhale N.S.

Because m6A methyltransferases regulated IFN signaling pathway activated by HCV RNA transfection, we assessed the possibility that m6A modification of HCV 8766 nucleotide affects the IRF-3–mediated IFN signaling pathway (Fig. 2, H and J). We addressed this question by mutating m6A sites at nucleotides 8766 (A8766C) and 331 (A331C) of HCV GND RNA, respectively. HCV A331C mutant genome was used as a negative control because it lacks an m6A DRACH consensus and is not a RIG-I–sensitive site. Initially, we analyzed IFN-β mRNA levels in A8766C-mutated HCV genome-transfected cells and found that A8766C mutation, but not A331C mutation, substantially increased IFN-β mRNA levels compared with the HCV GND WT infected cells. The A8766C mutated HCV RNA transfection also increased phosphorylation of IRF-3 (2.6-fold increase of IFN-β mRNA level and 253 ± 41.8% increase of p-IRF-3 level in HCV GND A8766C RNA transfected cells; Fig. 2, H and J). We next tested whether the depletion of m6A machinery affects IFN signals activated by HCV GND A8766C because other m6A sites of the HCV genome might affect IFN-β mRNA and IRF-3 activation. Interestingly, the silencing of METTL3 and 14 did not increase IFN-β mRNA and phosphorylation of IRF-3 in HCV GND A8766C transfected cells but induced IRF-3–mediated IFN-β expression in HCV GND A331C transfected cells (Fig. S2). These results illustrate that m6A modification of HCV 8766 nucleotide affects the function of HCV PAMP RNA. In particular, the deficiency of m6A modification in other nucleo"
https://openalex.org/W3044002183,"The RAG endonuclease initiates Igh locus V(D)J recombination in progenitor (pro)-B cells1. Upon binding a recombination centre-based JH, RAG scans upstream chromatin via loop extrusion, potentially mediated by cohesin, to locate Ds and assemble a DJH-based recombination centre2. CTCF looping factor-bound elements (CBEs) within IGCR1 upstream of Ds impede RAG scanning3-5; however, their inactivation allows scanning to proximal VHs, where additional CBEs activate rearrangement and impede scanning any further upstream5. Distal VH utilization is thought to involve diffusional access to the recombination centre following large-scale Igh locus contraction6-8. Here we test the potential of linear RAG scanning to mediate distal VH usage in G1-arrested v-Abl pro-B cell lines9, which undergo robust D-to-JH but little VH-to-DJH rearrangements, presumably owing to lack of locus contraction2,5. Through an auxin-inducible approach10, we degraded the cohesin component RAD2110-12 or CTCF12,13 in these G1-arrested lines. Degradation of RAD21 eliminated all V(D)J recombination and interactions associated with RAG scanning, except for reecombination centre-located DQ52-to-JH joining, in which synapsis occurs by diffusion2. Remarkably, while degradation of CTCF suppressed most CBE-based chromatin interactions, it promoted robust recombination centre interactions with, and robust VH-to-DJH joining of, distal VHs, with patterns similar to those of 'locus-contracted' primary pro-B cells. Thus, downmodulation of CTCF-bound scanning-impediment activity promotes cohesin-driven RAG scanning across the 2.7-Mb Igh locus."

Comparative analyses with two US Corn Belt lines explains the pronounced differences between both germplasms.

In the rodent cranial radiation model, we found that metformin enhanced the recovery of NPCs in the dentate gyrus, with sex-dependent effects on neurogenesis and cognition. A pilot double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02040376) in survivors of pediatric brain tumors who had been treated with cranial radiation. Safety, feasibility, cognitive tests and MRI measures of white matter and the hippocampus were evaluated as endpoints. Twenty-four participants consented and were randomly assigned to complete 12-week cycles of metformin (A) and placebo (B) in either an AB or BA sequence with a 10-week washout period at crossover. Blood draws were conducted to monitor safety. Feasibility was assessed as recruitment rate, medication adherence and procedural adherence. Linear mixed modeling was used to examine cognitive and MRI outcomes as a function of cycle, sequence and treatment. We found no clinically relevant safety concerns and no serious adverse events associated with metformin. Sequence effects were observed for all cognitive outcomes in our linear mixed models. For the subset of participants with complete data in cycle 1, metformin was associated with better performance than placebo on tests of declarative and working memory. We present evidence that a clinical trial examining the effects of metformin on cognition and brain structure is feasible in long-term survivors of pediatric brain tumors and that metformin is safe to use and tolerable in this population. This pilot trial was not intended to test the efficacy of metformin for cognitive recovery and brain growth, but the preliminary results are encouraging and warrant further investigation in a large multicenter phase 3 trial. A pilot clinical trial evaluating metformin in patients with pediatric brain tumors shows that it is a safe approach resulting in improved cognitive function that is consistent with the recovery of adult hippocampal neurogenesis observed in mouse models."

However, these assays are costly and time-consuming for routine handling of a large number of HIV-1 samples. For example, sample dilution is always required in the ELISA procedure to determine p24 protein levels because of the very narrow range of detectable concentrations in this assay. Here, we establish a novel HIV-1 production assay system to solve the aforementioned problems by using a recently developed small peptide tag called HiBiT. This peptide is a fragment of NanoLuc luciferase and generates a strong luminescent signal when complemented with the remaining subunit. To employ this technology, we constructed a novel full-length proviral HIV-1 DNA clone and a lentiviral packaging vector in which the HiBiT tag was added to the C terminus of the integrase. Tagging the integrase with the HiBiT sequence did not impede the resultant virus production, infectivity, or susceptibility to an integrase inhibitor. EM revealed normal morphology of the virus particles. Most importantly, by comparing between ELISA and the HiBiT luciferase assay, we successfully obtained an excellent linear correlation between p24 concentrations and HiBiT-based luciferase activity. Overall, we conclude that HiBiT-tagged viruses can replace the parental HIV-1 and lentiviral vectors, which enables us to perform a super-rapid, inexpensive, convenient, simple, and highly accurate quantitative assay for HIV-1/lentivirus production.

Therefore, the resultant NL4-3 viruses are extraordinarily well characterized through a considerable amount of virological research, providing a solid knowledge base for data acquisition and/or interpretation of interexperimental data. Quantitation of viral supernatants from cells transfected with proviral DNA clones, including pNL4-3, is commonly and routinely performed by conducting a standard reverse transcriptase (RT) assay (2Barré-Sinoussi F.

Particularly in the case of commercially available ELISA kits for HIV-1 detection, the major disadvantages are the high cost of the assays, and an intrinsic limitation in the linear ranges that require extensive dilution. In this study, we constructed a novel pNL4-3–based full-length proviral HIV-1 DNA clone and a lentiviral vector with a small luminescent peptide tag called HiBiT. When this 11 amino acid peptide tag binds to the larger counterpart protein called LgBiT, the full-length structure of the smallest luciferase protein called NanoLuc is formed (4Dixon A.S.

Because of its small size, HiBiT can be easily fused to the N or C terminus of the protein of interest. After expression of a HiBiT-tagged protein, the assay is performed by simply adding a lytic detection reagent containing LgBiT with the substrate, and the luminescence level of the HiBiT-tagged protein is quickly determined by a luminometer (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Using this system, we established a much faster (∼15 min), equally accurate, and inexpensive method, comparable to the recently established SG-PERT assay (5Vermeire J. Naessens E. Vanderstraeten H.

To generate a HiBiT-tagged HIV-1 proviral clone, we first introduced a restriction enzyme site of BamHI at the C-terminal end of the integrase (IN) ORF of the HIV-1 luciferase reporter virus construct pNL-Luc2-E(−)R(+) and used this as a cassette for insertion of the HiBiT tag (Fig. 1B). Then, we transfected 293T cells with the resultant construct pNL-Luc2-IN/HiBiT-E(−) or the parental construct pNL-Luc2-E(−), subjected the cell lysates to Western blot analyses, and found that the HiBiT tag sequence did not affect the expression of the HIV-1 Gag, Vif, and IN proteins (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A). This proviral clone was cotransfected into 293T cells with the vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G) expression plasmid, and the levels of p24 antigen in the viral supernatants were measured by ELISA (Fig. 1D). To normalize the transfection efficiency, transfected cells were lysed and subjected to assays for firefly luciferase activity. The luciferase reporter virus carrying the HiBiT-tagged IN (Luc2-IN/HiBiT virus) showed a WT level of virion production (Fig. 1E). Equal amounts of VSV-G-pseudotyped Luc2-WT and IN/HiBiT viruses were inoculated into 293T cells, and luciferase activities were measured to determine viral infectivity (Fig. 1D). The Luc2-IN/HiBiT virus was found to be equally infectious as the WT virus (Fig. 1F). Also in the case of HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped viruses (Fig. S2A), the Luc2-IN/HiBiT virus showed the WT levels of virion production (Fig. S2B) and infectivity (Fig. S2C). Moreover, we assessed whether the susceptibility of IN to its inhibitor was affected by the C-terminal tagging with HiBiT. To test this, we performed drug susceptibility assays using the IN inhibitor dolutegravir. The WT and Luc2-IN/HiBiT viruses were equally sensitive to dolutegravir (Fig. 1G). Thus, tagging the C-terminal end of the IN ORF with the HiBiT sequence does not interfere with the HIV-1 productivity, infectivity, or susceptibility to the IN inhibitor. To enable us to perform replication assays in primary cells that express the restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G), the intact function of Vif in the Luc2-IN/HiBiT virus needed to be verified, because an unrelated amino acid sequence derived from the HiBiT tag was inserted in the N-terminal sequence of Vif that overlaps with the C terminus of the IN ORF (although critical domains of Vif for APOBEC3 binding (7Dang Y.

To test whether anti-A3G activity remained intact in the Vif protein of the Luc2-IN/HiBiT virus, we cotransfected 293T cells with the VSV-G expression plasmid and either the parental pNL-Luc2, Vif-deficient pNL-Luc2-F(−)E(−), or pNL-Luc2-IN/HiBiT-E(−) construct, together with either a control plasmid or a plasmid encoding A3G, and used viruses obtained from the transfected cells for infection. A3G expression resulted in a marked reduction in infectivity of the Luc2-IN/HiBiT virus to the level of the NL-Luc2-F(−) virus (Fig. 2C), indicating that the Vif protein of the Luc2-IN/HiBiT virus lacks anti-A3G activity. To rescue the lost function of Vif whose sequence was interrupted by the HiBiT tag, we first disrupted the initiation codon of Vif overlapping with the C terminus of the IN ORF. After introducing the BlpI site, we inserted an oligo DNA linker corresponding to an N-terminal vif sequence immediately downstream of the stop codon of the HiBiT tag and codon-optimized the C terminus of the IN (to avoid homologous recombination during reverse transcription) (Fig. 2A). We prepared cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with this construct designated pNL-Luc2-IN/HiBiT-E(−)Fin, performed Western blot analyses and confirmed the expression of Vif (Fig. 2B) as well as that of IN (Fig. S1B) at the expected size. The VSV-G-pseudotyped Luc2-IN/HiBiT-Fin virus produced from cells transfected as described above was tested for infectivity and was found to be fully resistant against A3G (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the resultant virus gained intact Vif activity, as expected. It should be noted that because the vif sequence is completely conserved in this construct, its function in degrading not only A3G but also cellular PPP2R5 to trigger cell cycle arrest (11Salamango D.J.

HIV-1 Vif triggers cell cycle arrest by degrading cellular PPP2R5 phospho-regulators.Cell Rep. 2019; 29 (31665623): 1057-1065.e410.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), is likely unaffected. To determine whether an Env-intact full-length version of the viruses could normally replicate in CD4-positive T-cells, we generated a pNL4-3-based IN/HiBiT-Fin proviral clone (pNL-IN/HiBiT-Fin). We first performed transmission EM analyses using M8166 cells infected with either the resultant IN/HiBiT-Fin virus or the parental NL4-3 virus. Electron microscopic images revealed that mature particles of the IN/HiBiT-Fin virus were morphologically normal and indistinguishable from those of the parental NL4-3 virus, demonstrating that the insertion of the HiBiT tag has no influence on virion morphogenesis (Fig. 2D). We infected PHA-stimulated primary CD4-positive T-cells with the WT or IN/HiBiT-Fin virus. Then, we monitored virus replication by measuring the levels of p24 production in the supernatants and found that the replication kinetics of the IN/HiBiT-Fin virus was only slightly delayed compared with that of the parental virus, confirming that the IN/HiBiT-Fin virus is replication competent (Fig. 2E). Taken together, the results indicate that the addition of the N-terminal vif sequence into the C terminus of IN confers anti-A3G activity, resulting in efficient viral replication in primary CD4-positive T-cells. Finally, we assessed whether HiBiT-tagged viruses could be normally detected by HiBiT-based luciferase assays and whether a correlation between HiBiT-mediated luciferase activity and the p24 concentration could be observed. We prepared a high-titer virus stock by propagating the IN/HiBiT-Fin virus produced by M8166 cells and measured p24 by a commercially available ELISA kit. Then, we serially diluted the samples as standard viruses in 2-fold increments and subjected them to HiBiT luciferase assays as follows: we added equal amounts of samples and reagents, mixed them well, incubated them for 10 min, and performed measurements for 1 to 10 s per well by using a luminometer (Fig. 3A). HiBiT-mediated luciferase activity strongly correlated with p24 values in viral supernatants diluted on the order of microgram (Fig. 3B), as well as highly diluted samples on the order of picogram (Fig. 3C), with an excellent correlation between p24 levels and HiBiT luciferase activity (R2 = 1 and R2 = 0.9994, respectively). This indicates that the HiBiT activities can be directly translated to p24 antigen levels, routinely by this quick and easy method. In other words, we prepared the viral supernatants with known levels of p24 antigen and serially diluted them, and we could readily create a standard curve of HiBiT luciferase activity and determine the p24 levels of the samples of interest by measuring the activity in this assay. Overall, we conclude that the IN/HiBiT-Fin virus, in which the HiBiT tag and Vif linker were inserted into the C terminus of IN, is completely analogous to the parental HIV-1 strain and will be a highly convenient research tool for future HIV-1 studies. In this study, we established a novel system for the highly accurate, convenient, and super-rapid detection of the well-analyzed HIV-1 strain pNL4-3 carrying a luminescent peptide-tagged IN. This method provides an efficient routine for quantitating the virus production of full-length infectious HIV-1. Several research groups have developed different real-time RT-PCR methods for virion quantitation of lentiviral vectors or whole HIV-1 viruses, which target various HIV-1 viral genomes (reviewed in Ref. 12Delenda C. Gaillard C. Real-time quantitative PCR for the design of lentiviral vector analytical assays.Gene Ther. 2005; 12 (16231054): S36-S5010.1038/sj.gt.3302614Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and transgene mRNA (13Geraerts M. Willems S. Baekelandt V. Debyser Z. Gijsbers R. Comparison of lentiviral vector titration methods.BMC Biotechnol. 2006; 6 (16836756): 3410.1186/1472-6750-6-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These methods require RNA extraction and DNase treatment steps as well as a real-time RT-PCR procedure, taking a total of more than 4-5 h. More recently, Vermeire et al. (5Vermeire J. Naessens E. Vanderstraeten H. Landi A. Iannucci V. Van Nuffel A. Taghon T. Pizzato M. Verhasselt B. Quantification of reverse transcriptase activity by real-time PCR as a fast and accurate method for titration of HIV, lenti- and retroviral vectors.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (23227216): e5085910.1371/journal.pone.0050859Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reported a real-time PCR-based, accurate, fast, and relatively inexpensive method for retroviral quantification designated SG-PERT (SYBR Green I-based PCR-enhanced reverse transcriptase), directly determining RT activity in viral supernatants. According to the report, the reagent cost of the SG-PERT assay is ∼10 times lower per retroviral quantification compared with the measurement of p24 antigen levels with a commercial ELISA kit, and the assay itself only requires less than 2 h of hands-on time. In our study, the cost of the HiBiT-based assay reagents per well to quantify viral supernatants is almost equivalent to that of the SG-PERT assay. In addition, because of the wide range of detectable HiBiT activity, this assay does not require sample dilution similar to the SG-PERT assay, whereas p24 ELISA frequently requires three different dilutions that make the assay more time-consuming. Notably, whereas the whole ELISA procedure normally takes 4-5 h (including sample preparation, incubation, and washing), that of the HiBiT-based assay (a one-step procedure) only takes up to ∼15 min, which is even faster than the aforementioned SG-PERT assay duration. While our paper was in revision, a different type of HIV-1 reporter vector was reported by another group (14Kirui J. Freed E.O. Generation and validation of a highly sensitive bioluminescent HIV-1 reporter vector that simplifies measurement of virus release.Retrovirology. 2020; 17 (32430080): 1210.1186/s12977-020-00521-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In their paper, the NanoLuc luciferase itself was used to develop an HIV-1 bioluminescent reporter virus that can simplify measurement of virus production. The resultant virus indeed enabled sensitive quantitation of virion release, but exhibited a defect in viral infectivity and therefore required co-expression with WT Gag to reach WT levels of infectivity. This is probably because of the insertion of NanoLuc between Gag p17 and p24, leading to virion incorporation of this 19-kDa luciferase protein that might have affected Gag conformation and processing. In this context, our replication-competent IN/HiBiT-Fin virus will be a suitable tool for experiments that need to be performed based on multiple replication cycles, e.g. virological characterization of mutant viruses, analysis of host-virus interaction, high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs, and so on. One clear limitation of our study needs to be mentioned: Our system cannot be applied for bulk virus samples directly obtained from patients unless they are molecularly cloned and reconstructed into HiBiT-harboring proviral DNAs. Because the C-terminal domain of the IN is involved in DNA binding (15Chen J.C.-H. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J.W. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic core and C-terminal domains: A model for viral DNA binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (10890912): 8233-823810.1073/pnas.150220297Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), we might have to consider that the typical HIV-1 integration profiles could be altered by the HiBiT tagging at the C terminus. Moreover, with the use of our proviral DNA in studies in vivo (e.g. humanized mice), we cannot rule out the possibility that the HiBiT insertion could affect immunological responses. Therefore, it is likely that this method is specific for molecular clone-based virological studies. By taking advantage of this technique, we also constructed a lentiviral packaging vector carrying the HiBiT tag sequence, which is also fused to the C terminus of the integrase gene, because this could make lentiviral work more convenient. Consistent with the aforementioned observation using the proviral DNA, its viral protein expression (Fig. 4A and Fig. S1C), virion production (Fig. 4B), and transduction (Fig. 4C), including firefly luciferase activity/p24 ratio (Fig. S3), were comparable to those of the WT lentiviral vector. During the submission of this manuscript, we utilized this HiBiT lentiviral pseudotyping system to examine cell entry mediated by spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and found that the mutant spike protein from the globally dominant D614G variant showed ∼3.5-fold higher entry than that of the prototypic spike protein (16Ozono S. Zhang Y. Ode H. Tan T.S. Imai K. Miyoshi K. Kishigami S. Ueno T. Iwatani Y. Suzuki T. Tokunaga K. Naturally mutated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants show differential levels of cell entry.bioRxiv. 2020; Google Scholar). This finding is particularly important because such a small but detectable difference in cell entry can be amplified in multiple virus replication cycles, which might reflect the difference in viral transmissibility. It should be noted that our HiBiT lentiviral system allowed us to precisely normalize input virus doses (as shown in Fig. 3, B and C), and therefore provided an enhanced experimental accuracy in the comparison of cell entry between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Overall, our HiBiT-based assay offers the following advantages: 1) super-rapid (∼15 min); 2) inexpensive (∼ 0.5 U. S. dollars/sample); 3) practical and convenient (no dilution required); 4) extremely simple (one-step procedure); and 5) highly accurate (linear scale over six orders of magnitude ranging from 10 pg to 1 μg of p24 antigen). Overall, we conclude that the HiBiT-tagged proviral HIV-1 DNA and lentiviral vector can be used to replace their parental vectors, making them powerful and reliable molecular tools for future studies of virology. The VSV-G expression vector pC-VSVg, the HIV-1 Env expression vector pC-NLenv, the HIV-1 proviral construct pNL4-3, its indicator construct pNL-Luc2-E-R+ (referred hereafter as pNL-Luc2-E(−)), pNL-Luc2-F(−)E(−) and the A3G expression plasmid pC-hA3G-HA have been described previously (17Tada T.

To generate a luciferase reporter HIV-1 proviral DNA carrying HiBiT tag, the SbfI/EcoRI fragment of pNL-Luc2-E(−) was subcloned into PstI/EcoRI-digested pUC19 (termed pUNL-PE), and the BamHI site was introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) into pUNL-PE using the following specific oligonucleotides (restriction enzyme sites underlined); 5′-GAC AGG ATG AGG ATC CAC ACA TGG AAA AG-3′ and its antisense.

The PstI/SacI fragment of the resultant vector pBSPAX-IN/HiBiT was cloned back into SbfI/SacI-digested psPAX2, and the generated plasmid was designated psPAX2-IN/HiBiT. To create a lentiviral transfer vector expressing firefly luciferase, the SalI/SalI fragment of pWPI (19Wiznerowicz M. Trono D.

The resultant plasmid was digested with EcoRI to remove the internal ribosome entry site and EGFP and further digested with PmeI to insert a PCR-amplified/PmeI-digested codon-optimized luciferase (Luc2) fragment. Then, the SalI/SalI fragment of the plasmid was cloned back into SalI-digested pWPI, and the generated plasmid was designated pWPI-Luc2.

For lentivirus production, 293T cells were cotransfected with 500 ng of either psPAX2 or psPAX2-IN/HiBiT and 500 ng of pWPI-Luc2 by using FuGENE6. Sixteen h later, the cells were washed with PBS, and then 1 ml of fresh complete medium was added. After 24 h, the supernatants were harvested and subjected to an HIV-1 p24-antigen capture ELISA (ELISA; XpressBio) to determine the level of virion production. Cells were separated and lysed in 75 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) or in 75 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The former cell lysates were subjected to a luciferase assay to normalize the transfection efficiency using a firefly Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with a Centro LB960 luminometer (Berthold). The latter lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-p24 mAb (1:1000; Nu24) (20Tsunetsugu-Yokota Y. Akagawa K. Kimoto H. Suzuki K. Iwasaki M. Yasuda S. Häusser G. Hultgren C.

Supernatants containing either psPAX2- or psPAX2-IN/HiBiT–derived lentiviral particles were layered onto 20% (w/v) sucrose cushions and subjected to ultracentrifugation (90,000 rpm for 10 min) using an Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Pelleted virions were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-p24 mAb (1:1000; Nu24) and the anti-integrase peptide polyclonal antibody (1:1000; made in-house). Reacted proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare) and monitored using a LAS-3000 imaging system (FujiFilm). For NL4-3–based virus preparation, 293T cells (1.1 × 105) were cotransfected with 500 ng of pNL-Luc2-E(−), pNL-Luc2-IN/HiBiT-E(−), or pNL-Luc2-IN/HiBiT-E(−)Fin, and 20 ng of either pC-VSVg or pC-NLenv, with or without 10 ng of pC-hA3G-HA and an empty vector up to 1 μg by using FuGENE6. For lentivirus preparation, 293T cells were cotransfected with 475 ng of either psPAX2 or psPAX2-IN/HiBiT, 475 ng of pWPI-Luc2, and 50 ng of pC-VSVg by using FuGENE6. Sixteen h later, the cells were washed with PBS, and then 1 ml of fresh complete medium was added. After 24 h, the supernatants were harvested and treated with 37.5 units/ml DNase I (Roche) at 37°C for 30 min. The viral supernatants were subjected to HIV-1 p24 ELISA to measure the p24 antigen. To determine infectivity, HeLa or MAGIC5 cells (1 × 104) were incubated with the p24 antigen (1 ng) of each viral supernatant. After 48 h, cells were lysed in 100 μl of One-Glo Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega), and firefly luciferase activities were determined as described above. The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir (Abcam, ab231511) was 10-fold serially diluted and mixed with an equal volume of 1 ng of 24 antigens of the VSV-G-pseudotyped Luc2-WT and IN/HiBiT viruses. The mixture was added to HeLa cells (1 × 104). After 48 h, cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assays, as described above, to determine the levels of drug susceptibility. Experiments using human samples were approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan (approval number 887) and the approved studies abided by the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from healthy volunteer donors who signed an informed consent form. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. The CD4-positive T lymphocytes were purified using a Dynabeads CD4-positive isolation kit (Invitrogen) to obtain CD4-positive T cells, and purified cells were cultured in the presence of 3 μg/ml PHA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 units/ml IL-2 (Peprotech) for 72 h. CD4-positive T cells (2.5 × 105) were infected for 3 h with either NL4-3 or NL-IN/HiBiT-Fin virus (25 ng of p24 antigen), washed extensively with serum-free medium, and then cultured in fresh complete medium. Supernatants were sampled every 3 days, and p24 antigen production was quantified by ELISA. A high-titer virus stock as a standard sample was prepared by propagating IN/HiBiT-Fin virus in infected M8166 cells and measuring p24 by ELISA. After determining the levels of p24 antigen, the viral supernatant was aliquoted and stored for future use in different HiBiT-based assays, to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. To create a standard curve, the viral stock with known levels of p24 antigen derived from the IN/HiBiT-Fin virus was serially diluted. Either the standards or the samples of interest (25 μl) and LgBiT protein (1:100)/HiBiT Lytic Substrate (1:50) in Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Buffer (25 μl) (Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Detection System; Promega) were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature according to the modified manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was determined with a Centro LB960 luminometer. Note that HiBiT assays using target cell lysates were not performed to determine the levels of cell entry because of the background caused by nonspecific attachment of virions to the cell surface. H9 cells infected with either the WT NL4-3 or NL-IN/HiBiT-Fin virus were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then pre-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon 812 (TAAB Laboratories). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then observed under a transmission electron microscope (HT7700; Hitachi) at 80 kV.

We apply NINJA to create tumor cell lines with inducible neoantigen expression, which could be used to study antitumor immunity. We also show that the genetic regulation in NINJA mice bypasses central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms and allows for robust endogenous CD8 and CD4 T cell responses on neoantigen induction in peripheral tissues.

Mechanosensing is based on protein deformations and reorganizations, yet the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Using a cell-stretching device compatible with super-resolution microscopy and single-protein tracking, we explored the nanoscale deformations and reorganizations of individual proteins inside mechanosensitive structures. We achieved super-resolution microscopy after live stretching on intermediate filaments, microtubules and integrin adhesions. Simultaneous single-protein tracking and stretching showed that while integrins followed the elastic deformation of the substrate, actin filaments and talin also displayed lagged and transient inelastic responses associated with active acto-myosin remodelling and talin deformations. Capturing acute reorganizations of single molecules during stretching showed that force-dependent vinculin recruitment is delayed and depends on the maturation of integrin adhesions. Thus, cells respond to external forces by amplifying transiently and locally cytoskeleton displacements, enabling protein deformation and recruitment in mechanosensitive structures. Massou et al. combine cell stretching, super-resolution imaging and single-protein tracking to investigate integrin-based mechanosensing in live cells."

Most patients with CLN3 Batten have a deletion encompassing exons 7 and 8 (CLN3∆ex7/8), creating a reading frameshift7,8. Here we demonstrate that mice with this deletion can be effectively treated using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that induces exon skipping to restore the open reading frame. A single treatment of neonatal mice with an exon 5-targeted ASO-induced robust exon skipping for more than a year, improved motor coordination, reduced histopathology in Cln3∆ex7/8 mice and increased survival in a new mouse model of the disease. ASOs also induced exon skipping in cell lines derived from patients with CLN3 Batten disease.

Because of their dual protease and ligase activity, plant legumains have become of particular biotechnological interest, e.g. for the synthesis of cyclic peptides for drug design or for protein engineering. However, the molecular mechanisms behind their dual protease and ligase activities are still poorly understood, limiting their applications. Here, we present the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana legumain isoform β (AtLEGβ) in its zymogen state. Combining structural and biochemical experiments, we show for the first time that plant legumains encode distinct, isoform-specific activation mechanisms. Whereas the autocatalytic activation of isoform γ (AtLEGγ) is controlled by the latency-conferring dimer state, the activation of the monomeric AtLEGβ is concentration independent. Additionally, in AtLEGβ the plant-characteristic two-chain intermediate state is stabilized by hydrophobic rather than ionic interactions, as in AtLEGγ, resulting in significantly different pH stability profiles. The crystal structure of AtLEGβ revealed unrestricted nonprime substrate binding pockets, consistent with the broad substrate specificity, as determined by degradomic assays. Further to its protease activity, we show that AtLEGβ exhibits a true peptide ligase activity. Whereas cleavage-dependent transpeptidase activity has been reported for other plant legumains, AtLEGβ is the first example of a plant legumain capable of linking free termini. The discovery of these isoform-specific differences will allow us to identify and rationally design efficient ligases with application in biotechnology and drug development.

The plant cysteine proteases of the legumain family (C13 family, EC 3.4.22.34) have an important role in processing and maturation of seed storage proteins within the vacuole and, therefore, are also referred to as vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) (1Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Molecular characterization of a vacuolar processing enzyme related to a putative cysteine proteinase of Schistosoma mansoni.Plant Cell. 1993; 5 (8312744): 1651-165910.2307/3869746Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Plant legumains are structurally related to the mammalian caspases and exhibit a strong substrate sequence preference for cleavage after asparagine and, to a lesser extent, aspartate residues (2Abe Y. Shirane K. Yokosawa H. Matsushita H. Mitta M. Kato I. Ishii S. Asparaginyl endopeptidase of jack bean seeds. Purification, characterization, and high utility in protein sequence analysis.J. Biol.

Therefore, they are also synonymously referred to as the asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEP). In contrast to mammals, where only one functional legumain isoform is expressed, Arabidopsis thaliana contains four genes coding for legumains (α, β, γ, and δ-VPE) and other plants, even up to eight functional variants (4Julian I. Gandullo J. Santos-Silva L.K. Diaz I. Martinez M. Phylogenetically distant barley legumains have a role in both seed and vegetative tissues.J. Exp.

Plant legumains are expressed primarily in seeds and vegetative organs, consistent with their phylogenetic grouping into two angiosperm clades, the seed type (β-VPE) and nonseed or vegetative type VPEs (α-, γ- and δ-VPE) (5Muntz K.

Vegetative legumains are found in lytic vacuoles and have been suggested to play critical roles in plant programmed cell death and may functionally substitute for the caspases, which are absent in plants (9Hatsugai N.

The importance of legumains is especially illustrated in Arabidopsis mutant strains missing all four legumain genes (α, β, γ, and δ), which were shown to accumulate aberrantly processed seed storage proteins (12Gruis D.

Importantly, AtLEGβ can compensate for missing vegetative α and γ proteins, further confirming that AtLEGβ is the main player in precursor protein processing in seeds (10Shimada T. Yamada K.

Peptide cyclization in plants is typically catalyzed by legumains. Consequently, there is a high interest in understanding the ligation mechanism, specificity, and efficacy of different plant legumain isoforms. Recent studies led to the discovery of a marker of ligase activity (MLA) and a gatekeeper residue (Cys247, Oldenlandia affinis numbering) that allow us to predict ligase activity based on sequence information (20Yang R. Wong Y.H. Nguyen G.K.T. Tam J.P. Lescar J. Wu B. Engineering a catalytically efficient recombinant protein ligase.J. Am. Chem.

However, to validate these marker regions, experimental data on ligase activity of different legumain isoforms is indispensable. Structural analysis of plant legumains showed that they are synthesized as inactive zymogens composed of a caspase-like catalytic domain with AEP activity (AEP domain) and a C-terminal death domain-like prodomain (LSAM domain, legumain stabilization and activity modulation domain) that are connected by an activation peptide (AP) harboring the α6-helix (20Yang R.

Although this tripartite domain architecture (AEP-AP-LSAM) is conserved in mammalian and plant legumains, the activation process of vegetative-type proAtLEGγ (Arabidopsis thaliana prolegumain isoform γ) significantly differs from that of human legumain (31Dall E. Brandstetter H. Activation of legumain involves proteolytic and conformational events, resulting in a context- and substrate-dependent activity profile.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

Importantly, proAtLEGγ is present in an enzymatically latent dimer state that is mediated by AP-LSAM–AP′-LSAM′ interactions and depends on pH and protein concentration (21Zauner F.B. Dall E. Regl C. Grassi L. Huber C.G. Cabrele C. Brandstetter H. Crystal structure of plant legumain reveals a unique two-chain state with pH-dependent activity regulation.Plant Cell. 2018; 30 (29453229): 686-69910.1105/tpc.17.00963Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that conversion to the active, monomeric AEP form, i.e. release of the prodomain, proceeds via a previously unknown two-chain intermediate state. Two-chain AtLEGγ results from cleavage at the N-terminal side of the α6-helix within the AP and is suppressed by high protein concentration, where AtLEGγ dimerization is favored. Even after an initial cleavage within the AP, an enzymatically latent, dimeric two-chain AtLEGγ intermediate form remains stable at neutral pH. Only at acidic pH does the dimer dissociate to monomeric two-chain legumain, which may further release the LSAM domain and thereby convert to the mature AEP form. The identification of the dimer and two-chain states allowed the development of a pH-dependent four-step activation model of plant legumains, i.e. single chain–two chain conversion, α6-helix destabilization, dimer–monomer dissociation, and AEP–LSAM release. However, given the subtle regulation of these conversions, isoform-specific differences in activation are to be expected, with experimental data still lacking. Here, we present the crystal structure of zymogenic proAtLEGβ, which led to the discovery of a distinct activation mechanism, in contrast to AtLEGγ. Combining structural and biochemical information, we show, for the first time, that plant legumains follow isoform-specific autocatalytic activation mechanisms and differential strategies of activity regulation and stability. Furthermore, we provide evidence that seed type AtLEGβ is an active ligase capable of peptide cyclization. AtLEGβ ligase activity is not strictly linked to peptide bond cleavage but enables the efficient joining of free N and C termini. To our knowledge, AtLEGβ is the first example of a plant legumain for which we could demonstrate the ligation of free peptide termini. This study broadens our understanding of isoform-specific differences in plant legumains and their relevance in plant physiology. Furthermore, the study discloses new avenues to rationally design peptide ligases with applications in biotechnology and drug development. To understand isoform-specific differences between different AtLEGs, we determined the crystal structure of seed-type proAtLEGβ to a resolution of 2.0 Å (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the tetragonal space group contained 12 independent molecules. Like isoform γ, proAtLEGβ comprises an N-terminal caspase-like catalytic domain and a C-terminal legumain stabilization and activity modulation (LSAM) domain with death domain-like topology (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). The AEP and LSAM domain are connected by an activation peptide that harbors the α6-helix. Overall, the structure of proAtLEGβ closely resembles the structure of the homologous two-chain AtLEGγ indicated by a Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.49 Å. However, inspecting the individual subdomains unraveled specific differences. Whereas the catalytic AEP domains of AtLEGβ and γ superimpose very well with an overall Cα RMSD of 0.39 Å, we observed bigger differences in the LSAM domains with a Cα RMSD of 0.78 Å (determined with Pymol). This observation is also in agreement with a higher sequence identity of the β and γ catalytic domains (67% identity) compared with the LSAM domains (56% identity). Furthermore, we observed an isoform-specific glycosylation at Asn309, located at the bottom of the enzyme, which is also conserved in human legumain (Fig. 1A and 2A).Table 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsbThe structure was determined from a single crystal.

This dimer controls both the activation and activity of AtLEGγ (21Zauner F.B. Dall E. Regl C. Grassi L. Huber C.G. Cabrele C. Brandstetter H. Crystal structure of plant legumain reveals a unique two-chain state with pH-dependent activity regulation.Plant Cell. 2018; 30 (29453229): 686-69910.1105/tpc.17.00963Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the crystal structure of proAtLEGβ, we found all twelve independent protomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit to engage in symmetric dimer contacts, which were mediated by LSAM–LSAM′ interactions (Fig. 2A). However, these interactions were mediated by different amino acids and led to an ∼90° tilted orientation of the monomers within the β- and γ-dimer, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). Indeed, detailed analyses of the β and γ dimer interfaces revealed significant, isoform-specific differences. The proAtLEGγ dimer is mediated primarily by three symmetric anchoring sites, α6 and α7 helices, and a conserved cyclic protein recognition motif (cPRM) on the c341-loop. The α6 and α7 helices form a 4-helix bundle that is stabilized around a symmetric hydrophobic core formed by W363γ as well as Val383γ and L384γ, respectively (AtLEGγ numbering; Fig. 2, C and E). This hydrophobic core is further stabilized by a network of salt bridges on the N-terminal (R355γ–E371γ′ and D356γ–K376γ′) and C-terminal (K376γ–D356γ′ and E371γ–R355γ′) ends of the α6-helices. In contrast, the proAtLEGβ dimers in the crystal structure were predominantly mediated by the α7 helix. This interaction was formed around the symmetric H384β (H392γ) and further stabilized by one symmetric salt bridge (E390β–K383β′) as well as by a hydrophobic contact of the α7 C-terminal LFG motif (396β-398β) with W355β′ centered in the α6 helix (Fig. 2, D and E). The hydrophobic core of the α6-α7, α6′-α7′ four-helix bundle was missing, as was any stabilization by the conserved cPRM, despite key residues important for proAtLEGγ-like dimer formation being conserved in proAtLEGβ (Fig. S1). However, modeling a proAtLEGγ-like dimer uncovered repulsive charge densities of α7-α7′ helix contact residues in AtLEGβ (R380–R380′, K373–K383′, and D369–D386′) that will prohibit this γ-mode of dimerization (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2). Together, these findings suggest that the observed β-dimer is weak and probably only transient in solution. To test this conclusion, we performed size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments. As expected, at pH 7.0, proAtLEGβ migrated at the expected size of a monomer, similar to human legumain (Fig. 2F). Accordingly, proAtLEGβ was a monomer in solution. Comparing the crystal structure of proAtLEGβ with YVAD-cmk-inhibited AtLEGγ, we found that the AP binds to the nonprime substrate binding sites in a substrate-like orientation, similar to what we previously observed in mammalian prolegumain (Fig. 1B and 3, A and B). Therefore, the AP is blocking substrate access, keeping the proenzyme in a latent, inactive state. Additionally, we observed a conserved Gln346 (AtLEGβ numbering) on the N-terminal end of the α6 helix. Gln346 is binding into the S1 pocket in an unproductive orientation and thereby preventing cleavage of the AP and further blocking substrate access to the active site (Fig. 1B and 3B). This interaction was similarly observed in the crystal structure of A. thaliana legumain isoform γ; additionally, Gln346 is conserved throughout the plant VPE sequences, strongly suggesting that the Gln346-S1 binding forms a conserved mechanism in plant legumain activity regulation. Additionally, this interaction is further strengthened by the neighboring Arg347, which forms ionic interactions with Glu212, directly next to the catalytic Cys211 (Fig. 3C). Similar to two-chain AtLEGγ and mammalian prolegumains, the LSAM domain is further stabilized by two conserved disulfide bonds (Figs. 1B and 3B). On the C-terminal end of the LSAM domain, AtLEGβ harbors a potential vacuolar sorting signal, which, however, is not structured and, therefore, not visible in the electron density (Fig. 1A). In an effort to unravel the basic principles of proAtLEGβ activation, we analyzed the interdomain interfaces of AEP and LSAM domains. Interestingly, we found that the interface has a hydrophobic character with only two salt bridges identified by PDBe Pisa, R347-E212 and K422-D187, which are also conserved in proAtLEGγ (R355γ-E220γ and K432γ-D195γ;"

HIV self-testing (HIVST) may be useful for increasing testing rates in FSW. Methods We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews among FSW, nurses and lay counsellors providing services to FSWs in Botswana. We aimed to gain understanding of perceived acceptability, anticipated barriers, and preferred approaches to HIVST among FSW. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated. Transcripts were reviewed and coded independently by two investigators; high inter-coder agreement was achieved (Kappa = 0.80). Results We interviewed five care providers whose average age was 40 years (SD = 2,64, range = 37–43); three nurses and two counsellors. Thirty FSW were interviewed, with mean age 34 years (range = 20–52). Most (27; 90%) FSW expressed great interest in using HIVST kits. Facilitators of HIVST were: awareness of own risky sexual behaviours, desire to stay healthy, and perceived autonomy over one’s healthcare decisions. Perceived advantages of HIVST included convenience, privacy, and perception of decreased stigma. Identified barriers to HIVST included lack of knowledge about the HIVST kit, fear of testing due to anticipated stigma, mistrust of the test’s accuracy, doubt of self-competency to perform HIVST, and concerns about not linking to care. Assisting someone to test was noted as good for providing emotional support, but there were concerns about confidentiality breaches. Providers expressed concerns over low literacy among FSWs which could affect comprehension of testing instructions, and competency to perform testing and interpret results. Participants’ recommendations for implementation of HIVST included: ensuring wide dissemination of information on HIVST, engaging peers in information-sharing and education, making test kits accessible in FSW-friendly centres, and having clear instructions for linkage to healthcare and support. Conclusion HIVST shows high acceptability among FSWs in Gaborone Botswana, with providers expressing some concerns. Implementation should be peer-driven with healthcare provider oversight."
https://openalex.org/W3045812045,"Xylose, the second most abundant sugar in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates, can be fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing one of two heterologous xylose pathways: a xylose oxidoreductase pathway and a xylose isomerase pathway. Depending on the type of the pathway, its optimization strategies and the fermentation efficiencies vary significantly. In the present study, we constructed two isogenic strains expressing either the oxidoreductase pathway (XYL123) or the isomerase pathway (XI-XYL3), and delved into simple and reproducible ways to improve the resulting strains. First, the strains were subjected to the deletion of PHO13, overexpression of TAL1, and adaptive evolution, but those individual approaches were only effective in the XYL123 strain but not in the XI-XYL3 strain. Among other optimization strategies of the XI-XYL3 strain, we found that increasing the copy number of the xylose isomerase gene (xylA) is the most promising but yet preliminary strategy for the improvement. These results suggest that the oxidoreductase pathway might provide a simpler metabolic engineering strategy than the isomerase pathway for the development of efficient xylose-fermenting strains under the conditions tested in the present study."

Although the canonical disulfide bond formation pathway involving Ero1α and PDI has been well-studied so far, the physiological roles of the newly identified PDI oxidases, glutathione peroxidase-7 (GPx7) and -8 (GPx8), are only poorly understood. We here demonstrated that human GPx7 has much higher reactivity with H2O2 and hence greater PDI oxidation activity than human GPx8. The high reactivity of GPx7 is due to the presence of a catalytic tetrad at the redox-active site, which stabilizes the sulfenylated species generated upon the reaction with H2O2. Although it was previously postulated that GPx7 catalysis involved a highly reactive peroxidatic cysteine that can be sulfenylated by H2O2, we revealed that a resolving cysteine instead regulates the PDI oxidation activity of GPx7. We also determined that GPx7 formed complexes preferentially with PDI and P5 in H2O2-treated cells. Altogether, these results suggest that human GPx7 functions as an H2O2-dependent PDI oxidase in cells, whereas PDI oxidation may not be the central physiological role of human GPx8.

GPx family was historically named after its first identified member that catalyzes the reaction of peroxide with reduced glutathione (GSH) on its selenocysteine residue (32Brigelius-Flohé R.

Both GPx7 and GPx8 were suggested to interact with Ero1α in vivo and possibly modulate the peroxide-generating activity of Ero1α by scavenging H2O2 in its proximity (29Nguyen V.D. Saaranen M.J.

Additionally, the Ero1α–GPx8 complex may serve to prevent the diffusion of H2O2 from the ER (39Ramming T. Hansen H.G. Nagata K. Ellgaard L. Appenzeller-Herzog C. GPx8 peroxidase prevents leakage of H2O2 from the endoplasmic reticulum.Free Radic. Biol.

GPx7 and GPx8 commonly possess an essential peroxidatic cysteine residue (CP) in the typical motif, NVASX(C/U)G (Cys57 in GPx7 and Cys79 in GPx8), and a resolving cysteine residue (CR) in the highly conserved motif of GPx family, FPCNQF (Cys86 in GPx7 and Cys108 in GPx8) (40Tosatto S.C.

Whereas GPx7 and GPx8 share a highly similar overall structure, their topologies are distinct in the following points: GPx7 is purely a luminal protein, whereas GPx8 has a small N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a short transmembrane domain, and a catalytic-active domain facing the lumen (named the “luminal domain” in this work) (33Maiorino M. Bosello-Travain V. Cozza G. Miotto G. Roveri A. Toppo S. Zaccarin M. Ursini F. Understanding mammalian glutathione peroxidase 7 in the light of its homologs.Free Radic. Biol.

Although some structural and molecular insights have been gained into GPx7 and GPx8, the mechanistic details of GPx7/8-mediated PDI oxidation and their physiological roles in cells, especially their involvement in oxidative protein folding, still remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanistic basis of human GPx7- and GPx8-catalyzed PDI oxidation and identified their preferential substrates among PDI family members both in vitro and in vivo. We thus demonstrated that GPx7 was a much more efficient PDI oxidase than GPx8 because of even higher susceptibility of CP to H2O2, in which Gln92 contained in the catalytic tetrad plays a critical role. Although the GPx7 catalysis was known to involve the CP residue (31Bosello-Travain V. Conrad M. Cozza G. Negro A. Quartesan S. Rossetto M. Roveri A. Toppo S. Ursini F. Zaccarin M. Maiorino M. Protein disulfide isomerase and glutathione are alternative substrates in the one Cys catalytic cycle of glutathione peroxidase 7.Biochim. Biophys.

Our extensive studies also revealed that GPx7 bound PDI and P5 in H2O2-treated cells. Thus, human GPx7 is a potent PDI oxidase, whereas the role of human GPx8 seems largely distinct from that of GPx7 despite their structural similarity. Although both GPx7 and GPx8 are presumed to work as PDI-dependent peroxidases (29Nguyen V.D. Saaranen M.J. Karala A.R. Lappi A.K. Wang L. Raykhel I.B. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Wang C.C. Ruddock L.W. Two endoplasmic reticulum PDI peroxidases increase the efficiency of the use of peroxide during disulfide bond formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 406 (21215271): 503-51510.1016/j.jmb.2010.12.039Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the reactivity of these two enzymes with H2O2 have not been assessed precisely. To compare their peroxidase activities, we first mixed the fully reduced form of GPx7 or the luminal domain of GPx8 (1 μm each) with different concentrations (10, 50, and 200 μm) of H2O2 and followed their redox state changes (Fig. 1). The aliquot samples were treated with 1 mm maleimidyl PEG-2000 (mal-PEG 2k) for quenching at the indicated time points. Although the topmost and bottom bands are identifiable as reduced and oxidized species, respectively, the intermediate band is most likely a hyperoxidized species (SO2H or SO3H form), in which CR is mal-PEG modifiable, but CP is no longer alkylated because of the hyperoxidation with H2O2. In support of this, the intermediate bands significantly increased at higher H2O2 concentrations as observed particularly with GPx8 (Fig. 1, right panels). The present assay revealed much higher reactivity or affinity of GPx7 for H2O2 than that of GPx8; 10 μm H2O2 was sufficient to fully oxidize 1 μm GPx7 within 15 s after mixing, whereas most of the GPx8 remained reduced even after 5 min in the presence of 10 μm H2O2. Higher concentrations of H2O2 significantly accelerated GPx8 oxidation concomitant with increased generation of the hyperoxidized species, suggesting that the Kd for H2O2 value of GPx8 is much above 10 μm. To visualize H2O2-driven PDI oxidation by GPx7 and the luminal domain of GPx8, reduced PDI (10 μm) was reacted with GPx7 or GPx8 (1 μm each) in the presence of 10, 50, or 200 μm of H2O2, and the redox-state change of PDI was monitored by mal-PEG 2k modification of free cysteines followed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Consequently, GPx7 generated significant amounts of partially and fully oxidized PDI at early time points, whereas GPx8 hardly accelerated PDI oxidation compared with H2O2 alone. This result is in line with the present observation that GPx7 was oxidized by H2O2 much more efficiently than GPx8 (Fig. 1). Of note, GPx7-mediated PDI oxidation was slower at 200 μm H2O2 than at 50 μm H2O2. This is likely explained by the greater generation of a hyperoxidized GPx7 species during the catalysis of PDI oxidation in the presence of higher concentrations of H2O2. In support of this notion, most of GPx7 was converted to a hyperoxidized species during the catalysis of PDI oxidation at 200 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2B). The generation of a hyperoxidized species of GPx7 was greater in the presence of reduced PDI (Fig. 2B versus Fig. 1, left, middle, and bottom panel). This observation suggests that the catalytic cycle significantly increased the hyperoxidized species via redox reactions between H2O2 and reduced GPx7 generated by oxidizing PDI every turnover. A pKa value, which determines the degree of protonation at a given pH, represents a fundamental character of protein thiol groups (42Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. Prediction of pH-dependent properties of proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238 (8176733): 415-43610.1006/jmbi.1994.1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 43Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B.

To examine whether the pKa values of GPx7 and GPx8 can explain their different peroxidatic activities, we analyzed crystal structures of the enzymes (Protein Data Bank codes 2P31 for GPx7 and 3CYN for GPx8) using the program PROPKA3. The in silico analysis yielded the pKa values of peroxidatic cysteines (CP) of GPx7 and GPx8 to be 9.3 and 11.5, respectively. Thus, CP in GPx8 is predicted to have exceptionally low reactivity compared with CP in GPx7 and free cysteine in solution (pKa of 8.3). Altogether, the results tempt us to suspect a functional role of GPx8 as a H2O2-scavenging peroxidase in the ER. Effective thiol-based peroxidases commonly contain a catalytic triad or tetrad including a highly reactive, CP (40Tosatto S.C. Bosello V. Fogolari F. Mauri P. Roveri A. Toppo S. Flohé L. Ursini F. Maiorino M. The catalytic site of glutathione peroxidases.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10 (18500926): 1515-152610.1089/ars.2008.2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41Toppo S. Vanin S.

Indeed, GPx7 contains a catalytic tetrad consisting of Cys57, Trp142, Asn143, and Gln92 at the active site, where Gln92 is predicted to stabilize thiolated or sulfenylated Cys57 through a hydrogen bond upon reaction with H2O2 (40). Although GPx8 also conserves the first three residues, Cys79, Trp164, and Asn165, at the positions corresponding to Cys57, Trp142, and Asn143 in GPx7, respectively, we surmised that the replacement of Gln92 (in GPx7) to Ser114 (in GPx8) (Fig. 3, A and B) was a primary reason for much lower peroxidase activity of GPx8 than that of GPx7. In this context, the distance between the Sγ atom of GPx7 Cys57 and Oε1 of Gln92 is 3.1 Å, close enough to stabilize the thiolated GPx7 CP via a hydrogen bond to the Oε1; meanwhile the Sγ atom of GPx8 Cys79 is separated from the Oγ atom of Ser114 by 4.8 Å, far beyond a hydrogen-bonding distance (Fig. 3B). To explore the importance of the CP-neighboring residues in the different peroxidatic activities of GPx7 and GPx8, we constructed swap mutants where Gln is mutated to"

This revealed a linear relationship between the concentration of FA and the free energy of unfolding with a slope of mFA+pH (the combined contribution of FA and FA-induced lowering of pH), as well as a robust correlation between protein size and mFA+pH. We then measured the solubilization of fibrils formed from different FapC variants with varying numbers of repeats as a function of the concentration of FA. This revealed a decline in the number of residues driving amyloid formation upon deleting at least two repeats. The midpoint of denaturation declined with the removal of repeats. Complete removal of all repeats led to fibrils that were solubilized at FA concentrations 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than the repeat-containing variants, showing that at least one repeat is required for the stability of functional amyloid.

However, the fap system is evolutionarily younger than the curli system and only exists within a single phylum, the Proteobacteria (20Dueholm M.S. Otzen D. Nielsen P.H.

Both amyloid proteins CsgA and FapC consist of multiple imperfect repeats. CsgA has five, each ca. 20 residues in length and folded as individual β-hairpins separated by a tight turn (4–5 residues), according to a computationally predicted structure (21Tian P. Boomsma W. Wang Y. Otzen D.E. Jensen M.H. Lindorff-Larsen K. Structure of a functional amyloid protein subunit computed using sequence variation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015; 137 (25415595): 22-2510.1021/ja5093634Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In support of this, peptides corresponding to three of the individual repeats (repeats 1, 3, and 5) readily form amyloid on their own (22Wang X. Hammer N.D. Chapman M.R. The molecular basis of functional bacterial amyloid polymerization and nucleation.J. Biol.

FapC has 3 longer repeats (ca. 35 residues long) that are also predicted to form β-hairpins (14Rouse S.L. Matthews S.J. Dueholm M.S. Ecology and biogenesis of functional amyloids in Pseudomonas.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430: 3685-369510.1016/j.jmb.2018.05.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in FapC the repeats are separated by linker regions of variable lengths; the second linker shows especially large variations in size, with lengths ranging from 39 (in the Pseudomonas sp. strain UK4 used in this study) to more than 250 residues for Pseudomonas putida F1 (13Dueholm M.S. Petersen S.V. Sønderkær M. Larsen P. Christiansen G. Hein K.L. Enghild J.J. Nielsen J.L. Nielsen K.L. Nielsen P.H. Otzen D.E. Functional amyloid in Pseudomonas.Mol.

For FapC, stepwise removal of these repeats has only relatively little effect on the rapidity of fibrillation but increases the ensuing fibrils' tendency to fragment during shaking, thereby forming new growing fibrils (23Rasmussen C.B. Christiansen G. Vad B.S. Lynggaard C. Enghild J.J. Andreasen M. Otzen D. Imperfect repeats in the functional amyloid protein FapC reduce the tendency to fragment during fibrillation.Protein Sci. 2019; 28 (30592554): 633-64210.1002/pro.3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Whereas that study focused on the mechanistic roles of the different repeats, we here address the question of how removal of these repeats affects the stability of the formed fibrils. Given that functional amyloids are largely made for structural reasons, it is their stability (thermodynamics) rather than the ease of their formation (kinetics) that is critical to their functionality. This aspect has not been addressed for functional amyloids. However, to answer this question thoroughly, we need a reliable assay to determine fibril stability. For globular monomeric proteins, stability is defined by the distribution between native and denatured states. Analogously, there is an equilibrium between the fibrillated and monomeric state; the higher the concentration of the monomeric species (corresponding to a critical aggregation concentration, or cac), the less stable the fibril. Consequently, the free energy of fibrillation can be expressed as –RT ln cac (24O'Nuallain B. Shivaprasad S. Kheterpal I. Wetzel R. Thermodynamics of A beta(1-40) amyloid fibril elongation.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16171385): 12709-1271810.1021/bi050927hCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and for relatively unstable amyloids formed by misfolded proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, this can be further analyzed by displacing the equilibrium toward the monomeric state by, e.g. addition of denaturants (25Baldwin A.J. Knowles T.P. Tartaglia G.G. Fitzpatrick A.W. Devlin G.L. Shammas S.L. Waudby C.A. Mossuto M.F. Meehan S. Gras S.L. Christodoulou J. Anthony-Cahill S.J. Barker P.D. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M.

This formalism has been used to evaluate the stability of the Aβ peptide, aided by the relatively high Aβ cac (24O'Nuallain B. Shivaprasad S. Kheterpal I. Wetzel R. Thermodynamics of A beta(1-40) amyloid fibril elongation.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16171385): 12709-1271810.1021/bi050927hCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, fibrillation of functional amyloids such as FapC is very efficient and typically leads to impracticably low levels of monomer (13Dueholm M.S. Petersen S.V. Sønderkær M. Larsen P. Christiansen G. Hein K.L. Enghild J.J. Nielsen J.L. Nielsen K.L. Nielsen P.H. Otzen D.E. Functional amyloid in Pseudomonas.Mol.

For example, CsgA fibrils can be disassembled in a 1:1 mixture of hexafluoroisopropanol and TFA and subsequently reassembled in water or buffer (26Dorval Courchesne N.-M. Duraj-Thatte A. Tay P.K.R. Nguyen P.Q. Joshi N.S. Scalable production of genetically engineered nanofibrous macroscopic materials via filtration.ACS Biomater. Sci. Eng. 2017; 3: 733-74110.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00437Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas fungal amyloids consisting of hydrophobins can be extracted with TFA and formic acid (FA) (27de Vries O.M.H. Fekkes M.P. Wösten H.A.B. Wessels J.G.H. Insoluble hydrophobin complexes in the walls of Schizophyllum commune and other filamentous fungi.Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 330-33510.1007/BF00290915Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Overall, the simplest approach is to use the high concentrations (typically >80%) of FA that have been shown to solubilize functional amyloids. This phenomenon even serves as an operational basis to identify functional amyloid in complex mixtures (28Danielsen H.N. Hansen S.H. Herbst F.A. Kjeldal H. Stensballe A. Nielsen P.H. Dueholm M.S. Direct identification of functional amyloid proteins by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry.Biomolecules. 2017; 7: 5810.3390/biom7030058Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, the extent to which a protein fibril is dissolved by a progressive increase in FA may provide a measure of the fibril's stability. To investigate this systematically, however, we need a more general analysis of the denaturation potency of FA. To the best of our knowledge, such an analysis has not been performed yet, and here we provide it as part of our analysis of the stability of functional amyloid. Formic acid, HC(O)OH, is the simplest carboxylic acid. As a protein solvent, FA is superior to most common organic solvents (e.g. glycerol, DMSO, or TFA), solubilizing the protein polypeptide chain through protonation, destabilization of hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic residue interactions (29Zheng S. Doucette A.A. Preventing N- and O-formylation of proteins when incubated in concentrated formic acid.Proteomics. 2016; 16 (26840995): 1059-106810.1002/pmic.201500366Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Houen G.

High concentrations (>70%, v/v) of FA solubilize large, fibrous protein complexes, such as collagen, wool keratin, and silk fibroin (31Um I.C. Kweon H.Y. Lee K.G. Park Y.H.

Interestingly, the FA-solubilized form of fibroin seems to be more compact than that when solubilized in water, although fibroin is in random coil conformation in both solutions (31Um I.C. Kweon H.Y. Lee K.G. Park Y.H. The role of formic acid in solution stability and crystallization of silk protein polymer.Int. J. Biol.

Park Y.H. The role of formic acid in solution stability and crystallization of silk protein polymer.Int. J. Biol.

Doucette A.A. Preventing N- and O-formylation of proteins when incubated in concentrated formic acid.Proteomics. 2016; 16 (26840995): 1059-106810.1002/pmic.201500366Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amide derivative of FA, formamide (FM), is also able to solubilize and unfold globular proteins, such as myoglobin, cytochrome c, and insulin (34Herskovits T.T. Behrens C.F. Siuta P.B. Pandolfelli E.R. Solvent denaturation of globular proteins: unfolding by the monoalkyl- and dialkyl-substituted formamides and ureas.Biochim. Biophys.

Although not an acid, it still interacts with proteins through hydrogen bond disruption and solubilization of hydrophobic surfaces (36Khabiri M. Minofar B. Brezovsky J. Damborsky J. Ettrich R. Interaction of organic solvents with protein structures at protein-solvent interface.J. Mol. Model. 2013; 19 (22760789): 4701-471110.1007/s00894-012-1507-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, FM constitutes a protonation-free comparison to FA. Our objectives for this study were 2-fold: (1) to establish a quantitative basis for the use of FA to determine protein stability and (2) to employ this approach to determine the contribution of the individual repeats in FapC to fibril stability. To achieve goal 1, we investigate the impact of FA on the stability of proteins that unfold according to a simple two-state system, making it straightforward to assess the impact of FA on their stability. However, given FA's properties as an acid, the simple lowering of pH will, in itself, make a major contribution to FA's destabilizing properties. To extract the non-protonation-related denaturing properties of FA, we need to be able to subtract the contributions that a simple drop in pH would make to destabilization. This restricts our investigations to proteins that do not unfold at low pH unless other denaturing measures are involved, such as heat. Therefore, we have selected three acid-resistant proteins (hen egg white lysozyme [37Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R.

For all three proteins, we determine their stability in FA based on near-UV CD thermal scans over a range of FA concentrations. For each FA concentration, we carry out a thermal scan at the corresponding pH adjusted with HCl and subtract this effect from that of FA to quantitate the intrinsic contribution of FA to protein stability. Furthermore, we carry out these experiments using <30%, v/v, FA to minimize formylation (29Zheng S. Doucette A.A. Preventing N- and O-formylation of proteins when incubated in concentrated formic acid.Proteomics. 2016; 16 (26840995): 1059-106810.1002/pmic.201500366Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To achieve goal 2, we use the obtained relationship between FA concentration and its denaturation potency (m-values) to evaluate the FA depolymerization assays of eight different FapC constructs (Fig. S1) and thereby quantify the aggregative effect of individual repeats of FapC. To quantitate the denaturing potency of formic acid (FA), we used near-UV CD to carry out thermal scans of three model proteins in different concentrations of FA. The proteins are the 129-residue hen egg white lysozyme, the 101-residue ribosomal protein S6 from Thermus thermophiles, and the 76-residue bovine ubiquitin (Ubi). These proteins were selected for a number of reasons. First, they are well-characterized small proteins in a range of sizes (from 8.6 kDa through 12 kDa to 16.2 kDa) that have previously been used as model systems for fundamental studies in protein stability and folding (37Parker M.J.

From the same seed mixture, cover crop mixture expression varied greatly across farms and we hypothesized that this variation was correlated with soil inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations and growing degree days. We measured fall and spring biomass of a standard five-species mixture of canola (Brassica napus L.), Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum L), triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) seeded at a research station and on 8 farms across Pennsylvania and New York in two consecutive years. At the research station, soil inorganic N (soil iN) availablity and cumulative fall growing degree days (GDD) were experimentally manipulated through fertilizer additions and planting date. Farmers seeded the standard mixture and a “farm-tuned” mixture of the same five species with component seeding rates adjusted to achieve farmer-desired services. We used Structural Equation Modeling to parse out the effects of soil iN and GDD on cover crop mixture expression. When soil iN and fall GDD were high, canola dominated the mixture, especially in the fall. Low soil iN favored legume species while a shorter growing season favored triticale. Changes in seeding rates influenced mixture composition in fall and spring but interacted with GDD to determine the final expression of the mixture. Our results show that when soil iN availability is high at the time of cover crop planting, highly competitive species can dominate mixtures which could potentially decrease services provided by other species, especially legumes. Early planting dates can exacerbate the dominance of aggressive species. Managers should choose cover crop species and seeding rates according to their soil iN and GDD to ensure the provision of desired services."

KHARON is located in three distinct regions of the cytoskeleton: the base of the flagellum, the subpellicular microtubules, and the mitotic spindle. To deconvolve the different functions for KHARON, we have identified two partner proteins, KHAP1 and KHAP2, which associate with KHARON. KHAP1 is located only in the subpellicular microtubules, whereas KHAP2 is located at the subpellicular microtubules and the base of the flagellum. Both KHAP1 and KHAP2 null mutants are unable to execute cytokinesis but are able to traffic GT1 to the flagellum. These results confirm that KHARON assembles into distinct functional complexes and that the subpellicular complex is essential for cytokinesis and viability of disease-causing amastigotes but not for flagellar membrane trafficking.

Shape, form, function and Leishmania pathogenicity: from textbook descriptions to biological understanding.Open Biol. 2017; 7 (28903998): 17016510.1098/rsob.170165Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but two major forms amenable to laboratory investigation are the promastigotes that inhabit the midgut of the sand fly vector and the amastigotes that live inside parasitophorous vacuoles within mammalian host macrophages and cause disease. Promastigotes are elongated, spindle-shaped cells of ∼15 μm length with a single extended flagellum, and they are highly motile. In nature, infectious metacyclic form promastigotes are delivered to vertebrate hosts by a bite of the sand fly vector. They are subsequently taken up by macrophages and targeted to acidic phagolysosomal vesicles where they transform into oval-shaped amastigotes of ∼1-5 μm that are nonmotile and have a short flagellum that barely extends from the anterior end of the cell body. Previous studies from our laboratory focusing on membrane transport proteins that mediate uptake of important nutrients in Leishmania mexicana parasites identified a unique glucose/hexose transporter isoform that traffics selectively to the promastigote flagellar membrane (3Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Shinde U. Landfear S.M. Both sequence and context are important for flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 (22467850): 3293-329810.1242/jcs.103028Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and was designated GT1. Subsequent investigations on how this permease is selectively targeted to the flagellar membrane identified both a sequence within the N-terminal hydrophilic domain of GT1 that is required for flagellar targeting (3Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Shinde U. Landfear S.M. Both sequence and context are important for flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 (22467850): 3293-329810.1242/jcs.103028Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and a novel protein, named KHARON, or KH (4Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Vieira D.P. Yates P.A. David L. Beatty W. Elferich J. Landfear S.M. KHARON1 mediates flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter in Leishmania mexicana and is critical for viability of infectious intracellular amastigotes.J. Biol.

Although we originally referred to KHARON as Kharon1, we have subsequently employed the simpler designation KHARON, or KH, since this protein is not related in sequence to that of its partners and thus does not require a numerical designation. The null mutant generated when the KHARON or KH gene was deleted, named Δkharon or hereafter Δkh, was strongly impaired in trafficking of GT1 to the flagellum but was without other notable phenotypes in the promastigote stage. Strikingly, the Δkh null mutants were able to infect host macrophages as well as WT promastigotes, but the intracellular amastigotes died over the course of 7 days post-infection (4Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Vieira D.P. Yates P.A. David L. Beatty W. Elferich J. Landfear S.M. KHARON1 mediates flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter in Leishmania mexicana and is critical for viability of infectious intracellular amastigotes.J. Biol.

Vieira D.P. Sanchez M.A. Valli J. Gluenz E. Landfear S.M. Kharon1 null mutants of Leishmania mexicana are avirulent in mice and exhibit a cytokinesis defect within macrophages.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26266938): e013443210.1371/journal.pone.0134432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The intracellular amastigotes were able to replicate nuclei, but parasites could not undergo cytokinesis, leading to multinucleate, multiflagellated amastigotes that eventually disintegrated and were thus unable to support a productive infection (5Tran K.D. Vieira D.P. Sanchez M.A. Valli J. Gluenz E. Landfear S.M. Kharon1 null mutants of Leishmania mexicana are avirulent in mice and exhibit a cytokinesis defect within macrophages.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26266938): e013443210.1371/journal.pone.0134432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Localization studies indicated that KH is a cytoskeletal-associated protein and is attached to (i) microtubule-based structures at the base of the flagellum (4Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Vieira D.P. Yates P.A. David L. Beatty W. Elferich J. Landfear S.M. KHARON1 mediates flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter in Leishmania mexicana and is critical for viability of infectious intracellular amastigotes.J. Biol.

Hobbs S. Johnson E. Gluenz E. Landfear S.M. KHARON Is an essential cytoskeletal protein involved in the trafficking of flagellar membrane proteins and cell division in African trypanosomes.J. Biol.

The three subcellular loci for KH raise the question of how localization of this protein may be associated with its different functions. Thus, KH located at the base of the flagellum could participate in trafficking of GT1 from the flagellar pocket membrane (7Wheeler R.J. Sunter J.D. Gull K. Flagellar pocket restructuring through the Leishmania life cycle involves a discrete flagellum attachment zone.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129: 854-86710.1242/jcs.183152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), where membrane proteins are first trafficked during biosynthesis, into the contiguous flagellar membrane. KH may promote passage of GT1 through a “periciliary diffusion barrier” that prevents mixing of flagellar membrane proteins with other proteins from the surface membrane and has been functionally observed in multiple ciliated eukaryotes (8Nachury M.V. Seeley E.S. Jin H. Trafficking to the ciliary membrane: how to get across the periciliary diffusion barrier?.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26 (19575670): 59-8710.1146/annurev.cellbio.042308.113337Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, because GT1 is not stably expressed in intracellular amastigotes (9Rodriguez-Contreras D. Aslan H. Feng X. Tran K. Yates P.A. Kamhawi S. Landfear S. Regulation and biological function of a flagellar glucose transporter in Leishmania mexicana: a potential glucose sensor.FASEB J. 2015; 29 (25300620): 11-2410.1096/fj.14-251991Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), trafficking of this protein to the amastigote flagellum is not likely to be responsible for the fatal phenotype of Δkh null mutants inside macrophages. Although KH could be responsible for trafficking of other unknown proteins into the amastigote flagellum, a distinct possibility is that the failure of Δkh amastigotes to undergo cytokinesis may reflect a function of KH located at other sites within the parasite, either on the subpellicular cytoskeleton or in the mitotic spindle. Furthermore, KH might be associated in different multiprotein complexes with distinct subunits and unique properties at each of its three subcellular loci. If this hypothesis is correct, it may be possible to identify unique KH partners that could help deconvolve the multiple functions of this protein and ascribe different functional roles to distinct KH complexes. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that there may be three such complexes, KH Complex 1 located at the base of the flagellum, KH Complex 2 located on the subpellicular microtubules, and KH Complex 3 associated with the mitotic spindle. To test the multiple complex hypothesis, we initiated a search for molecular partners of KH. The initial strategy employed BioID (10Roux K.J. Kim D.I. Raida M. Burke B. A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 (22412018): 801-81010.1083/jcb.201112098Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), a method in which the mutant biotin ligase, BirA*, was fused to the N terminus of KH to biotinylate other proteins that are in close proximity, including potential molecular partners. The other approach was to tag KH with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag and identify other proteins that co-purify with the tagged fusion protein (11Tagwerker C. Flick K. Cui M. Guerrero C. Dou Y. Auer B. Baldi P. Huang L. Kaiser P. A tandem affinity tag for two-step purification under fully denaturing conditions: application in ubiquitin profiling and protein complex identification combined with in vivo cross-linking.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5 (16432255): 737-74810.1074/mcp.M500368-MCP200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This approach has led to the identification of two “KH-associated proteins,” KHAP1 and KHAP2, which are molecular partners of KH and co-localize with KH at the subpellicular microtubules but not at the mitotic spindle and, for at least one of them, not at the base of the flagellum. Gene knockouts of KHAP1 or KHAP2 block cytokinesis of amastigotes but do not affect trafficking of GT1 to the promastigote flagellar membrane, establishing the role of a unique KH complex at the subpellicular microtubules in cytokinesis of the disease-causing stage of the parasite life cycle. To identify molecular partners of KH, we first employed the proximity-dependent labeling technique BioID to identify proteins that are found near KH in live cells (10Roux K.J. Kim D.I. Raida M. Burke B. A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 (22412018): 801-81010.1083/jcb.201112098Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). This method is based on the observation that the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA* biotinylates other proteins within a ∼100 Å radius of a relevant BirA* fusion protein (12Kim D.I. Birendra K.C. Zhu W. Motamedchaboki K. Doye V. Roux K.J. Probing nuclear pore complex architecture with proximity-dependent biotinylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24927568): E2453-E246110.1073/pnas.1406459111Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). When L. mexicana promastigotes expressing BirA*::KH were incubated with biotin, several proteins were biotinylated, as demonstrated by the Western blotting in Fig. 1A This result supports the notion that KH associates with multiple other proteins. We used streptavidin-agarose resin to isolate biotinylated proteins from WT and BirA*::KH-expressing parasites, and identified the streptavidin-bound proteins by tandem MS. The proteins most enriched in the BirA*::KH sample are listed in Fig. 1B These data represent two replicate experiments in which each of these proteins was enriched by at least 10 counts in the BirA*::KH compared with WT sample in MS. The relative rank of each identified protein in each of the replicate experiments is listed on the right. Detailed ranking information can be found in Table S1, and complete MS results can be found in Table S4. Because proximity labeling typically identifies many proteins that are not bona fide partners of the BirA* fusion protein, we employed the complementary method of tandem affinity purification (TAP) to identify potential KH partners. KH is tightly bound to microtubules so that standard immunoprecipitation approaches would coprecipitate many microtubule-bound proteins that are not specifically associated with KH. To avoid this complication, we treated cells with formaldehyde to cross-link KH to partners that are within 2.3–2.7 Å (11Tagwerker C. Flick K. Cui M. Guerrero C. Dou Y. Auer B. Baldi P. Huang L. Kaiser P.

In these experiments, KH was first fused to the HBH tag (11Tagwerker C. Flick K. Cui M. Guerrero C. Dou Y. Auer B. Baldi P. Huang L. Kaiser P. A tandem affinity tag for two-step purification under fully denaturing conditions: application in ubiquitin profiling and protein complex identification combined with in vivo cross-linking.Mol. Cell.

This TAP tag is designed to allow sequential purification under strongly denaturing conditions with a metal affinity resin followed by streptavidin resin. Using tandem mass tagging followed by tandem MS, we identified proteins that were specifically enriched in the Δkh/HBH::KH formaldehyde–cross-linked sample as compared with a WT formaldehyde–cross-linked sample, thereby eliminating proteins that were abundant or interacting nonspecifically with the metal affinity or biotin resins used for sequential affinity purification. Proteins that were enriched in the cross-linked sample in two duplicate experiments are listed in Fig. 1C, with likely contaminants, such as ribosomal proteins, excluded from the list. The proteins are listed in the order of their enrichment in Experiment 1, as determined by the difference in total protein intensity calculated from the TMT reporter ion intensities of peptide spectral matches for each protein. Their relative rank in the results is given for each experiment. Only three proteins were enriched in both biological replicates of the BioID and TAP experiments. One of them, α-tubulin, was expected, because earlier experiments had shown that KH was tightly associated with microtubules (4Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Vieira D.P. Yates P.A. David L. Beatty W. Elferich J. Landfear S.M. KHARON1 mediates flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter in Leishmania mexicana and is critical for viability of infectious intracellular amastigotes.J. Biol.

The other two proteins are candidate KH partners and were named KH-associated proteins 1 and 2, or KHAP1 (LmxM.32.2440) and KHAP2 (LmxM.05.0380). The list of the top 20 identified proteins from each experiment can be found in Tables S2 and S3, and complete MS results can be found in Table S5. Bioinformatic analysis of KHAP1 indicates that this 502-amino acid, 56-kDa protein has orthologs broadly distributed among the kinetoplastid protists (tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/). However, HMMER analysis (13Potter S.C. Luciani A. Eddy S.R. Park Y. Lopez R. Finn R.D.

There were no conserved InterPro domains, but the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (14Lu S. Wang J. Chitsaz F. Derbyshire M.K. Geer R.C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Marchler G.H. Song J.S.

Interrogation of the secondary structure using PSIPRED (15Jones D.T. Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292 (10493868): 195-20210.1006/jmbi.1999.3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (4338) Google Scholar) predicted 59% helix content. Analysis using the COILS program (16Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J.

The prediction of coiled-coils suggests that these regions of the protein could be involved in protein–protein interactions via such structures, although the sequence of KH is not predicted to have any coiled-coils using the COILS program. KHAP2 is the ortholog of MARP-1 (microtubule-associated repetitive protein 1, Tb927.10.10360) from Trypanosoma brucei that has been the subject of several previous studies in that parasite (17Affolter M. Hemphill A. Roditi I. Muller N. Seebeck T. The repetitive microtubule-associated proteins MARP-1 and MARP-2 of Trypanosoma brucei.J. Struct.

This large 3196-amino acid, 374-kDa protein is closely associated with the subpellicular microtubules, but not the axonemes, of trypanosomes, but specific biological functions for MARP-1 are not known. MARP-1 consists largely of 38-amino acid repeats (except for short unique N- and C-terminal domains) that are predicted to have both helical and nonhelical segments. Due to the highly repetitive nature of the sequence of the orthologous L. mexicana KHAP2, the entire sequence of the ORF has not been determined from the L. mexicana genome, and the predicted ORF ends after only 783 amino acids, followed by undefined DNA sequence (tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/), thus leaving the majority of the ORF unresolved. Nonetheless, the sequenced component of KHAP2 consists of similar 38-amino acid repeats and is presumably parallel in the overall structure to MARP-1, consistent with our detection of several N terminally epitope-tagged KHAP2 species of over 200 kDa mobility (see Fig. 4C below). The reason for appearance of multiple species of distinct mobilities for both KHAP1 and KHAP2 in Western blots is not clear, but proteolytic degradation or post-translational modifications are possible explanations. To confirm potential association of each protein with KH, we epitope tagged them to test for overlap of fluorescent signal with KH. Immunofluorescence of Ty1::KHAP1 and OLLAS::KH (20Park S.H. Cheong C. Idoyaga J. Kim J.Y. Choi J.H. Do Y. Lee H. Jo J.H. Oh Y.S. Im W. Steinman R.M. Park C.G.

Methods. 2008; 331 (18054954): 27-3810.1016/j.jim.2007.10.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that KHAP1 colocalized with KH at the subpellicular microtubules (Fig. 2A). Analysis by Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC) showed a positive correlation of 0.66. A single protein labeled with two different antibodies had a CC of 0.90 in the same analysis, and a negative control where the two channels are rotated 90 degrees to one another had a CC of 0.02, as shown in Fig. S1. To eliminate the possibility of fixation artifacts, we endogenously tagged KHAP1 with the mNeonGreen fluorescent protein (mNG) (21Shaner N.C. Lambert G.G. Chammas A. Ni Y. Cranfill P.J. Baird M.A. Sell B.R. Allen J.R. Day R.N. Israelsson M. Davidson M.W. Wang J. A bright monomeric green fluorescent protein derived from Branchiostoma lanceolatum.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 (23524392): 407-40910.1038/nmeth.2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). This fluorescent fusion protein also localized to the cell periphery in live cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The localization was also performed for KHAP1 in amastigotes, detecting KHAP1::mNG by endogenous fluorescence in formaldehyde-fixed cells and colocalizing it with tubulin to show the amastigote periphery (Fig. 2D). Immunofluorescence of Ty1::KHAP2 and KH, employing a rabbit anti-KH polyclonal antibody, showed that these proteins also colocalize at the cell periphery with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.58 (Fig. 3A, Fig. S1). In live cells mNG-KHAP2 also localized to the cell periphery (Fig. 3B). In addition, KHAP2 localized to one to two small structures (yellow arrowheads, Fig. 3, A–C) that are adjacent to the DAPI-stained kinetoplast DNA. Expanded images of mNG::KHAP2 expressing promastigotes (Fig. 3C) show these dot-like structures, close to the kinetoplast DNA, as well as a filament at the base of the flagellum. The dot structures are likely basal bodies, which are located adjacent to the kinetoplast DNA, and the filament is probably proximal regions of the axoneme. However, more detailed localization studies will be required to determine the precise distribution of KHAP2 in this region of the cell. Immunoelectron microscopy employing 3HA::KH demonstrated that this protein is localized to the basal body (4Tran K.D. Rodriguez-Contreras D. Vieira D.P. Yates P.A. David L. Beatty W. Elferich J. Landfear S.M. KHARON1 mediates flagellar targeting of a glucose transporter in Leishmania mexicana and is critical for viability of infectious intracellular amastigotes.J. Biol.

Finally, mNG::KHAP2 also localized to the cell periphery in amastigotes, although in these smaller cells it is unclear whether mNG-KHAP2 still localized to the basal-body–like structures (Fig. 3D). Notably, similar expanded images of cells expressing KHAP1::mNG (Fig. 2C) do not show fluorescence in the basal body or base of the flagellum. Because one of the three locations observed for KH was the mitotic spindle (6Sanchez M.A. Tran K.D. Valli J. Hobbs S. Johnson E. Gluenz E. Landfear S.M. KHARON Is an essential cytoskeletal protein involved in the trafficking of flagellar membrane proteins and cell division in African trypanosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (27489106): 19760-1977310.1074/jbc.M116.739235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it was also important to determine whether KHAP1 or KHAP2 associated with KHARON at this site. Promastigotes expressing KHAP1::mNG were stained with the anti-β-tubulin KMX-1 antibody that allows visualization of mitotic spindles (22Sasse R. Gull K. Tubulin post-translational modifications and the construction of microtubular organelles in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90 (3075618): 577-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and parasites in the process of division were imaged. Fig. 2E shows KHAP1::mNG (green) at the cell periphery but not at the centrally located β-tubulin (red, white arrows) that is positioned between two DAPI-stained nuclei (light blue). In such images, the bright blue body is the duplicated kinetoplast DNA, whereas the nuclei stain less intensely with DAPI. Similarly, mNG::KHAP2 does not localize to the mitotic spindle (Fig. 3E). Overall, KHAP1 overlaps with KH at the subpellicular microtubules but not at the base of the flagellum or in the mitotic spindle, whereas KHAP2 has a similar localization but is also likely present at the base of the flagellum. Hence, KHAP1 is selective for the subpellicular microtubules, or the postulated KH Complex 2 (Introduction), and can be employed to interrogate the function of that complex. To verify that KHAP1 and KHAP2 are part of a complex with KH, we performed pulldown experiments under denaturing conditions, comparing formaldehyde-treated samples to untreated samples. In each case we used a His10-tagged KH (HIS::KH) as the bait for the pulldown, and tagged the protein of interest with the Ty1 epitope to enable its detection on Western blots. KH was detected with a rabbit antibody, generated in this study, which has strong specificity for KH (Fig. 4A). HIS::KH bound and eluted from the cobalt resin in both the cross-linked and uncross-linked samples (Fig. 4, B–D, upper panels marked HIS::KH, eluate, + cross-link and eluate, untreated), but both Ty1::KHAP1 and Ty1::KHAP2 were specifically enriched in the eluate only when the samples were cross-linked (Fig. 4, B and C, lower panels marked Ty1::KHAP1 or Ty1::KHAP2). These results indicate that KHAP1 and KHAP2 are in close enough proximity to KH to be cross-linked by formaldehyde, but that the interaction is disrupted under denaturing conditions if no cross-linking is performed, (Fig. 4, B and C). To demonstrate that the Ty1 tag did not independently associate with HIS::KH, we repeated the protocol with another protein, LmxM.29.2330, which was identified as a potential KH partner in the initial KH BioID experiment (Fig. 1B) but subsequently shown not to be a bona fide partner. Ty1-tagged LmxM.29.2330 was not enriched in the eluate in either the cross-linked or uncross-linked condition (Fig. 4D), so the observed interactions between HIS::KH and Ty1::KHAP1 or Ty1::KHAP2 are not driven by the epitope tags on these proteins or other nonspecific interactions. To further confirm the close association between KHAP1 or KHAP2 and KH, we performed the proximity ligation assay (PLA) as an alternative test of molecular association (23Fredriksson S. Gullberg M.

The CaMKII mutants K42M and K42R have been used interchangeably as research tools, although some reported phenotypic differences suggest that they may differ in the extent to which they impair ATP binding. Here, we directly compared the two mutations at the high ATP concentrations that exist within cells (~4 mM). We found that both mutations equally blocked GluA1 phosphorylation in vitro and GluN2B binding within cells. Both mutations also reduced but did not completely abolish CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation in vitro or CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses in neurons. Thus, despite previously suggested differences, both mutations appear to interfere with ATP binding to the same extent."
https://openalex.org/W3045551905,"Objectives As there were only regional studies in Hungary about the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS), we aimed to estimate its epidemiological features using data of Hungary’s single-payer health insurance system. Methods Pseudonymized database of claims reported by hospitals and outpatient services between 2004–2016 was analyzed and linked with an independent database of outpatient pharmacy refills between 2010–2016. We established an administrative case definition of MS and validated it on medical records of 309 consecutive patients. A subject was defined as MS-patient if received MS diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, code G35) on three or more occasions at least in 2 calendar years and at least once documented by a neurologist. Patients were counted as incident cases in the year of the first submitted claim for MS. We allowed a 6-year-long run-in period, so only data between 2010–2015 are discussed. Results Sensitivity of the administrative case definition turned out to be 99%, while specificity was >99%. Crude prevalence of MS has increased from 109.3/100,000 in 2010 to 130.8/100,000 in 2015 (p-value = 0.000003). Crude incidence declined from 7.1/100,000 (2010) to 5.4/100,000 (2015) (p-value = 0.018). Direct standardization − based on European standard population and results of nationwide Hungarian census of 2011 − revealed that age standardized prevalence was 105.2/100,000 (2010), which has grown to 127.2/100,000 (2015) (p-value = 0.000001). Age standardized incidence rate declined from 6.7/100,000 (2010) to 5.1/100,000 (2015) (p-value = 0.016). The ratio of MS-patients receiving ≥1 prescription for disease modifying treatment increased from 0.19 (2010) to 0.29 (2015) (p-value = 0.0051). The female/male ratio of prevalent cases remained 2.6. Discussion The prevalence of MS in Hungary is higher than previously reported, the incidence rate is moderate. The prevalence is rising, the incidence rate shows decline. The proportion of patients receiving disease modifying treatment grows but was still around 30% in 2015."

Diagnosis of schizophrenia before the age of 18 years remains complex and challenging, especially in young children. In France, there are no recent reliable epidemiological data about the prevalence of EOS. The present study evaluates the EOS rate in a target clinical population of children and adolescents in psychiatric and medico-social care centres in the South-East of France.Psychiatric and medico-social centres for children and adolescent in the geographical area have been contacted, and after receiving their agreement to participate in the study, eligible patients corresponding to inclusion criteria were selected based on patients' medical records. Main inclusion criteria were age 7 to 17 years and intelligence quotient > 35. EOS categorical diagnosis was assessed by Kiddie-SADS Present and Lifetime psychosis section.37 centres participated and 302 subjects have been included in the study. The main result was the categorical diagnosis of EOS in 27 subjects, corresponding to a rate of 8.9% in the study population. Half of the patients presented mild to moderate intellectual deficiency. Interestingly, only 2.3% had a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder noted in their medical records before standardized assessment.The results of the study highlight the importance of using a standardized diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the paediatric population. In fact, EOS might be underdiagnosed in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders and subnormal cognitive functioning.NCT01512641.

We explored the mutation signatures and expression levels of various CDCAs in detail in HNSCC. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis pipeline based on copy number and gene expressions data from patients with HNSCC in order to given new insights into the possible functions and distinct prognostics that underlie CDCAs regulation. We compared the transcriptional expression of CDCAs in HNSCC and found significantly elevated mRNA expression of CDCA1-8 in HNSCC tissues across multiple datasets. We also found CDCA5/6/8 are over-expressed both transcriptionally and translationally in patients with HNSCC. Our results suggested that that mRNA levels of CDCA1/2/4/7 related to the prognosis and can be used as a new useful biomarker for predicting the survival of HNSCC patients. The top 5 CDCAs neighboring gene alterations in HNSCCs were found in MYC, STAG1, RAD21, KLHL9 and NDC80. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model also showed that CD8+ T cells were higher (P<0.05) in HNSCC-HPV-pos patients and that this was related to CDCA1/2/3/4/5/7.

https://openalex.org/W3044650137,"Objectives Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) have higher prevalence of depression than the general population; however, the risk factors for depression in PD remain uncertain. Methods/Design Using the 2000–2010 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we selected 1767 patients aged ≧ 40 years with new-onset PD during 2000–2009. Among them, 324 patients with a new incidence of depression were enrolled as cases and 972 patients without depression were randomly selected as controls. The groups were frequency-matched at a ratio of 1:3 by age, sex, and index year. Thus, this nested case-control study compared differences between the cases and the controls. Logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for depression in PD. Results Compared with the controls, the odds ratio (OR) of anxiety disorders in the cases was 1.53 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16–2.02; P = 0.003), after adjusting for the confounding factors of age, sex, index year, geographic region, urban level, monthly income, and other coexisting medical conditions. The OR for sleep disturbances in the cases was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.14–1.96; P = 0.004) compared to the controls, after adjusting these confounding factors. Hence, the risk factors for depression in PD were nonsignificantly associated with physical comorbidities. Conclusions In the present study, depression in PD was significantly associated with anxiety disorders and sleep disturbances. Integrated care for early identification and treatment of neuropsychiatric comorbidities is crucial in patients with new-onset PD so as to prevent further PD degeneration."

However, HWC also holds potential as an effective intervention within a biopsychosocial chronic pain management framework. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of HWC on individuals with chronic pain. Methods Participants were referred by their primary care provider or insurance company to a comprehensive telephonic 12-month pain management HWC program. Relationships between pain outcomes and physical and psychological factors were retrospectively analyzed. Mixed linear-effects modeling explored whether physical and psychological variables were associated with pain outcomes over time. Results Four hundred nineteen participants (female, 58.9%; mean age, 54.8) enrolled in the program and 181 completed the intervention. After 12 months in the program, statistically and clinically significant reductions were observed for pain intensity (Hedges’ g = 1.00) and pain-related interference (Hedges’ g = 1.13). Linear mixed-effects modeling indicated that improvements in physical functioning and psychological factors were associated with improvements in pain intensity. Discussion Our results provide a novel analysis on the effects of HWC on chronic pain and pain-related interference. HWC appears to be a promising intervention to improve pain-related outcomes in a population with chronic pain. Further investigation of HWC as an intervention for chronic pain is warranted."

We hypothesized that an echocardiography index for left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, E/e’, might reflect the cerebral arteriolar compliance and evaluated the association between E/e’ and long-term progression rate of the cerebral WMH volume. This retrospective study included individuals who were ≥ 50 years of age, with a preserved LV ejection fraction (≥ 50%) and neurological function status (modified Rankin scale score ≤1), and underwent initial and follow-up MRI evaluations within intervals of 34–45 months. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and echocardiography markers such as ejection fraction, LV mass index, and E/e' were obtained. WMH volume progression rate between the baseline and follow-up MRIs was designated as the outcome factor. 392 individuals (57.1% men; mean age: 66.7±8.4 years) were followed-up for 38.2±3.4 months. The mean WMH volume progression rate was 1.35±2.65 mL/year. The log-transformed value of WMH volume progression rate was linearly associated with the log-transformed E/e’ (B coefficient = 0.365; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.180−0.551; P = 0.001), along with the log-transformed values of baseline WMH volume (B = 0.142; 95% CI 0.106−0.179; P<0.001) and glomerular filtration rate (B = -0.182; 95% CI -0.321−0.044; P = 0.010). Additionally, a subgroup with an E/e’ ≥15 exhibited a significantly higher WMH progression rate compared to the subgroups with lower E/e’ values (P<0.001), especially in the lower quartiles (quartiles 1 and 2) of the baseline WMH volume. We concluded that echocardiographic marker E/e’ is associated with the long-term progression rate of cerebral WMHs in population with preserved LV systolic function."

Using biochemical studies, we demonstrate that both GTP and dGTP bind to Rel, but only GTP (but not dGTP) can form the product.

A hyperphosphorylated guanosine nucleotide called (p)ppGpp shields bacteria from environmental stress and also plays a crucial role in bacterial pathogenesis; particularly in virulence, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance (1Dalebroux Z.D.

Therefore, enzymes that metabolize (p)ppGpp form distinct targets to develop new age anti-bacterials. Before now, efforts in this regard have found limited success and at best resulted in low potency inhibitors (5Wexselblatt E. Oppenheimer-Shaanan Y. Kaspy I. London N. Schueler-Furman O. Yavin E.

To develop effective inhibitors, it is essential to understand the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms in detail. Rel proteins, with varying length and sequence composition, have been reported from bacteria and chloroplasts; all of which are placed under the RelA/SpoT homolog superfamily. Of these subgroups, monofunctional Rel, bifunctional Rel, and SAS have been extensively studied and classified based on the number of domains they possess and their associated catalytic activities (4Atkinson G.C. Tenson T. Hauryliuk V. The RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) superfamily: distribution and functional evolution of ppGpp synthetases and hydrolases across the tree of life.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (21858139): e2347910.1371/journal.pone.0023479Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the length, the number of domains, and the mode of regulation, the active site responsible for the synthesis activity is common to all enzymes of these subgroups. Crystal structures of Rel proteins bound to substrates at the synthesis active site are available. They are (i) GDP-bound structure of the N-terminal domain of Rel from Streptococcus equisimilis (NRelSeq), (ii) AMP-CPP (nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) bound structure of SAS1 (RelQ) from Bacillus subtilis, and (iii) the structure of SAS2 (RelP) from Staphylococcus aureus bound to GTP and AMP-CPP together (i.e. the precatalytic structure). These provide great insights into the active-site architecture (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R.

The synthesis reaction is accomplished by transferring a diphosphate (Pβ-O-Pγ) from ATP to the 3′-OH oxygen of GTP/GDP, resulting in the formation of pppGpp or ppGpp. Based on a comparison of the active sites of the synthetase domain of Rel and the palm domain of DNA polymerase (Pol) β, it was believed that the conserved Glu323 at the active site in NRelSeq would activate the 3′-OH of the guanosine nucleotide for a nucleophilic attack on the β-phosphate of ATP (Fig. 1A) (8Hogg T.

Glu323 of NRelSeq corresponds to Glu139 in SAS1 and Glu174 in SAS2.

However, the last reported precatalytic structure of SAS2 (with both substrates bound together) does not support this mechanism and instead presents a metal ion promoted activation with inadequate details of the deprotonation mechanism (Fig. 1B) (10Manav M.C.

Moreover, the structural basis for the selection of nucleotide substrates in Rel still needs to be addressed rigorously. For example, monofunctional Rel preferentially utilizes GDP over GTP as the acceptor of the pyrophosphate, whereas bifunctional Rel favors GTP over GDP (11Cochran J.W. Byrne R.W.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has so far discussed the reasons for the discrimination between GTP and dGTP by Rel proteins. In this study, we revisit the pyrophosphate transfer mechanism proposed for the (p)ppGpp synthesis reaction. With careful analysis of the available substrate-bound structures of Rel family proteins, we question the proposed mechanism explaining the activation of the 3′-OH for a nucleophilic attack on the β-phosphate of ATP. We further attempt to understand why Rel does not utilize dGTP as a pyrophosphate acceptor, although it is similar to GTP. The structural analysis combined with biochemical studies presented here, confirm that the 2′-OH of GTP is not essential for binding at the active site. However, the inability to utilize dGTP as a substrate by different Rel homologs suggests an important role for 2′-OH in catalysis. Here, we investigate possible roles of 2′-OH of GTP for the catalytic reaction in Rel and show that it is an essential catalytic element. This work yet again underscores the selection of ribose nucleotides as second messengers and finds its roots in the old RNA world hypothesis. Diverse Rel homologs from bacteria and plants with distinct catalytic and regulatory domains are known (4Atkinson G.C. Tenson T. Hauryliuk V.

However, very few crystal structures are available, and that too of the catalytic domain alone. Despite the difference in their sequence length and domain architecture, bacterial bifunctional Rel and SAS proteins have a conserved active site for (p)ppGpp synthesis (Fig. 2A). The atomic structures of Rel homologs reveal that a characteristic fold, constituting five anti-parallel β-strands surrounded by α-helices, forms the (p)ppGpp synthetase domain (Fig. 2B) that shares structural similarity with the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Additionally, crystal structures of Rel bound to its substrates have further revealed that the β1–α1–β2 region (Fig. 2B, olive green) of the synthetase fold provides stabilizing interactions to ATP, whereas the β3–loop–β4 (Fig. 2B, purple) structure creates the site for GTP/GDP binding. To compare the structural differences between the synthesis domains of Rel homologs in different substrate-bound states, we superimposed the crystal structures of GDP-bound NRelSeq (PDB code 1VJ7, chain A), AMP-CPP–bound SAS1 (PDB code 5F2V, chain O), and the precatalytic-state structure of SAS2 (bound to both GTP and AMP-CPP together) (PDB code 6EWZ, chain A) (substrates have been deliberately omitted for clarity) (Fig. 2C). The synthesis domain of NRelSeq superposes well with SAS1 and SAS2, with root-mean-square deviations of 1.060 and 0.69 Å, respectively. Despite high structural similarity, significant differences could be observed in the synthetase fold. In the structure of SAS1 bound to AMP-CPP, the guanine nucleotide is absent, and the loop connecting β3 and β4, which is known to stabilize GTP, is unstructured (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1B). Similarly, it can be noted that the helix connecting β1 and β2 reorients in SAS1 and SAS2 to accommodate AMP-CPP compared with the structure of NRelSeq that is bound to GDP alone (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1). These observations highlight substrate induced restructuring of the active site elements in Rel. More evident in the superposed structures is the relatively open conformation of the active site of SAS2, where both the substrates are present together, emphasizing conformational changes in the synthetase active site caused by substrate binding. Such rearrangements are believed to be essential, not only for accommodating the substrates at the active site but also to bring the catalytic elements together (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Steinchen W.

Therefore, we further analyzed the position of the other elements of the active sites that are believed to play important roles for catalysis. While reporting the GDP-bound NRelSeq structure, the authors suggested rearrangements of the active site region caused by the binding of the second substrate. It was suggested that this rearrangement to a catalytically favorable conformation would accomplish the transfer of the pyrophosphate from ATP to the 3′-OH of GTP/GDP (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Further, the details of the mechanism of pyrophosphate transfer were proposed by drawing similarities to the active site of DNA Polβ. In DNA Polβ, the 3′-OH of one substrate (nucleotide) attacks the phosphodiester linkage of the second substrate (another nucleotide), resulting in the transfer of a dNMP to the 3′ position. In the case of Rel, the reverse would happen; instead of dNMP, the pyrophosphate would be transferred to the acceptor group. Both of these enzymes use Mg2+ for catalysis. Therefore, on comparing the active sites of the then-available crystal structures of these enzymes, Hogg et al. (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) had proposed a mechanism for pyrophosphate transfer. According to the proposal, a proton would be transferred from the 3′-OH to a highly conserved glutamate residue from the active site (which was identified as Glu323 in case of NRelSeq) to activate the 3′-OH group of the acceptor nucleotide (GTP/GDP). The loss of (p)ppGpp synthesis activity upon mutating this conserved Glu in Rel proteins further strengthened this assumption (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 16Bag S.

On examining GDP-bound NRelSeq structure, the nearest carboxyl oxygen of Glu323 is at a distance of nearly 6 Å from the 3′-OH of the bound GDP (Fig. S2). However, Hogg et al. (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) then suggested that rearrangement(s) at the active site will bring this catalytic residue within a hydrogen-bonding distance to the 3′-OH of the guanine nucleotide, when both the substrates bind simultaneously. This would ensure the abstraction of the proton to generate a nucleophile for the synthesis reaction to take place. As speculated, there are significant changes in the synthesis domain in response to substrate binding. However, examining the SAS2 precatalytic structure, where both the substrates are bound at the active site, the proposed proton acceptor Glu174 (corresponding to Glu323 of NRelSeq) is still at a distance of 4.92 Å from the 3′-OH group of the bound GTP (Fig. 3A). The observed distance between these two groups does not support the hypothesis by Hogg et al. (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) for proton transfer. On the contrary, from the crystal structure of SAS2 it appears that, like Asp107, the role of Glu174 is majorly to stabilize the catalytic Mg2+ at the active site (via water-mediated interactions) rather than activating the 3′-OH (Fig. 3B). Apparently, mutating the conserved Asp in NRelSeq also results in the loss of activity as with the Glu mutant (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Conformational antagonism between opposing active sites in a bifunctional RelA/SpoT homolog modulates (p)ppGpp metabolism during the stringent response [corrected].Cell. 2004; 117 (15066282): 57-6810.1016/S0092-8674(04)00260-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A similar loss of activity is observed on mutating corresponding conserved residues (Asp317 or Glu373) in 3S. Kalayil, M. Tech Thesis, 2009, IIT Kanpur. S. Kalayil, P. R. Patil, M. Sajish, J. Jhawar, and B. Prakash, unpublished data. NRelMtb. We speculate that a critical requirement is that both Asp and Glu, the conserved residues, would be needed for the proper coordination of the catalytic metal ion at the active site (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, Manav et al. (10Manav M.C. Beljantseva J. Bojer M.S. Tenson T. Ingmer H. Hauryliuk V. Brodersen D.E. Structural basis for (p)ppGpp synthesis by the Staphylococcus aureus small alarmone synthetase RelP.J. Biol.

Irrespective of the influence of the electropositive nature of Mg2+ for deprotonation, the proton from the 3′ hydroxyl group has to be transferred to an acceptor moiety. Upon careful examination of the precatalytic structure, there seems to be no such group in close proximity of the 3′-OH of GTP—not even a water molecule that can be activated by another residue. This makes it difficult to map the deprotonation mechanism (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the catalytic mechanism in DNA polymerase, which was a basis for the proposed catalytic mechanism in Rel, has been reestablished through molecular simulation studies in recent times (17Genna V. Vidossich P. Ippoliti E. Carloni P. De Vivo M. A self-activated mechanism for nucleic acid polymerization catalyzed by DNA/RNA polymerases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 (27530537): 14592-1459810.1021/jacs.6b05475Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The new evidence suggests that the generation of nucleophile at 3′-OH is not by any residue from the active site; instead it is due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding (17Genna V. Vidossich P. Ippoliti E. Carloni P. De Vivo M. A self-activated mechanism for nucleic acid polymerization catalyzed by DNA/RNA polymerases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 (27530537): 14592-1459810.1021/jacs.6b05475Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, we felt the need to revisit and critically scrutinize the current structural and biochemical data further, to understand the mechanism for (p)ppGpp synthesis. These efforts are presented below. For (p)ppGpp synthesis, GTP/GDP is the acceptor of the pyrophosphate group coming from ATP. We had earlier established that the choice of GTP verses GDP as a substrate is based on the conserved sequence motif, RXKD or EXDD, that is present in the synthesis domain of Rel; whereas the former prefers GTP, the latter prefers GDP (13Sajish M. Kalayil S. Verma S.K. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. The significance of EXDD and RXKD motif conservation in Rel proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19201753): 9115-912310.1074/jbc.M807187200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, recently it has been established that GMP too can be utilized as a substrate in some cases, where it results in the formation of pGpp, a variant of hyperphosphorylated guanosine nucleotide (14Gaca A.O. Kudrin P. Colomer-Winter C. Beljantseva J. Liu K. Anderson B. Wang J.D. Rejman D. Potrykus K. Cashel M. Hauryliuk V. Lemos J.A. From (p)ppGpp to (pp)pGpp: characterization of regulatory effects of pGpp synthesized by the small alarmone synthetase of Enterococcus faecalis.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197 (26124242): 2908-291910.1128/JB.00324-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In summary, Rel proteins utilize different guanosine phosphates as a substrate to form a range of hyperphosphorylated guanosine molecules. The selectivity for the guanine base in Rel, over other nucleotides, is achieved through noncovalent interactions offered by the active-site residues (8Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R.

Data on the risk factors of MDR-TB that can help inform policies are limited in Bhutan. This study aimed to determine the risk factors associated with MDR-TB.A nationwide unmatched case-control study was conducted that included 79 MDR-TB cases and 118 controls. Data was collected by trained health workers through interviews using a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with MDR-TB.The mean age of the participants was 32.4 and 33.7 years among the cases and the controls, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the odds of having MDR-TB was higher among those who slept for less than 9 hours a day (AOR: 2.77, 95%CI: 1.11-6.92), frequently travelled in public transport (AOR: 2.96, 95% CI: 1.36-6.48), and had previous TB treatment (AOR: 5.90, 95%CI: 2.55-13.64). A greater number of rooms was also marginally associated with odds of having MDR-TB.The findings suggest previous TB treatment, inadequate sleep duration, and travelling by public transport to be the risk factors associated with having MDR-TB in Bhutan. Intensification of early case detection, strengthening directly observed treatment strategy, improving treatment adherence, and increasing awareness can help control the rising MDR-TB epidemic."

A significantly higher minor allele frequency (15.6%) of the NOD2 frameshift mutation p.Leu1007fsX1008 (rs2066847) was seen in patients with aggressive disease compared to 8.2% in patients with mild disease (p = 2.6 x 10-5). Moreover, a total of 54 CD patients (5.0%) were homozygous for this NOD2 frameshift mutation. 100% of these patients had ileal disease compared to 82% of NOD2 wild-type carriers (p<0.0001). In homozygous carriers of the NOD2 frameshift mutation, 87% presented with ileal stenosis, 68.5% had fistulas, and 72.2% required CD-related surgery despite immunosuppressive therapy in 87% of these patients. All homozygous carriers of the 1007fs mutation who were active smokers had ileal stenosis and required CD-related surgery.Homozygosity for Leu1007fsX1008 is an excellent biomarker for predicting complicated CD on an individual patient level. Active smoking and homozygosity for this mutation is associated with a 100% risk for developing ileal stenosis requiring CD-related surgery. In these patients, smoking cessation and early initiation of immunosuppressive strategies may be beneficial."

This study aimed to identify DPs in a cohort of 92,448 pregnant Japanese women using fixed data from the Japan Environment and Children’s Study (JECS) to investigate the associations of DP with HRQOL. Methods During the first trimester, DPs were assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and HRQOL was assessed using the 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8). DPs such as Western, Japanese and Unbalanced DP were identified through principal component analysis (PCA). Multivariable logistic model analysis was used to assess the associations between DP and HRQOL as good or poor. Results We found a significant association between poor mental HRQOL in the univariate analysis for the Western DP (p = 0.014). However, this association was not significant in the multivariate analysis adjusted for basic confounders (p = 0.078). Western DP was not highly associated with poor physical HRQOL (from low-medium to high levels of intake; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.87–0.88, all p≤0.001, when comparing highest to lowest intake levels). A high intake of the Japanese DP was significantly associated with poor mental HRQOL and physical HRQOL (adjusted OR 1.20, p<0.0001 and adjusted OR 1.12, p = 0.005, respectively). A medium-high intake of the Unbalanced DP was not highly associated with poor physical HRQOL (adjusted OR 0.93, p = 0.048) but with poor mental HRQOL (adjusted OR 1.29, p<0.0001). Conclusion This is the first known prospective study to establish an association between DP and HRQOL in pregnant women. We hope that our findings will help in the field of nutritional science."

In order to understand individual speeding decisions, we need a better understanding of who speeds. In our paper, we test whether individuals' general pace of life is associated with speeding decisions. We use a novel speed-choice experiment that confronts participants with a scenario in which they repeatedly decide between driving fast or slow. This decision is associated with different accident risks. Before the experiment, each participant's pace of life was measured. Our results show that individuals with a slower pace of life are more likely to choose slow in the experiment and are also more likely to switch to slow, even when they had success by driving fast in the preliminary round. Therefore, individuals' pace of life may contribute to our understanding of speeding."
https://openalex.org/W3045881607,"Automatic monitoring of biodiversity by acoustic sensors has become an indispensable tool to assess environmental stress at an early stage. Due to the difficulty in recognizing the Amazon's high acoustic diversity and the large amounts of raw audio data recorded by the sensors, the labeling and manual inspection of this data is not feasible. Therefore, we propose an ecoacoustic index that allows us to quantify the complexity of an audio segment and correlate this measure with the biodiversity of the soundscape. The approach uses unsupervised methods to avoid the problem of labeling each species individually. The proposed index, named the Ecoacoustic Global Complexity Index (EGCI), makes use of Entropy, Divergence and Statistical Complexity. A distinguishing feature of this index is the mapping of each audio segment, including those of varied lengths, as a single point in a 2D-plane, supporting us in understanding the ecoacoustic dynamics of the rainforest. The main results show a regularity in the ecoacoustic richness of a floodplain, considering different temporal granularities, be it between hours of the day or between consecutive days of the monitoring program. We observed that this regularity does a good job of characterizing the soundscape of the environmental protection area of Mamirauá, in the Amazon, differentiating between species richness and environmental phenomena."

In humans, the COL6A4 gene coding for the α4 chain is inactivated by a large pericentral inversion (12Gara S.K. Grumati P. Urciuolo A. Bonaldo P. Kobbe B. Koch M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Three novel collagen VI chains with high homology to the alpha3 chain.J. Biol.

Two features make collagen VI unique within the collagen protein family. First, it contains only a short collagenous domain and, therefore, was named short-chain collagen in early studies (14Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. A short chain (pro)collagen from aged endochondral chondrocytes. Biochemical characterization.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9504-9509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jander R.

Indeed, collagen VI, in particular the long chains, mainly consists of tandem arrays of von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains (Fig. 1). These are well-known protein–protein interaction modules of ∼200 amino acid residues. They adopt a Rossman fold of a doubly wound, open twisted central β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices (16Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Chemical and biological evolution of a nucleotide-binding protein.Nature. 1974; 250 (4368490): 194-19910.1038/250194a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). For example, the six murine collagen VI chains contain 46 different VWA domains and, therefore, collagen VI is the prototypical VWA domain containing multiprotein assembly. Second, collagen VI forms very large complexes of about the size of a ribosome already before secretion. The α1, α2, and one of the long chains (α3 in most tissues) form a heterotrimeric triple helical monomer (17Odermatt E. Risteli J. van Delden V. Timpl R. Structural diversity and domain composition of a unique collagenous fragment (intima collagen) obtained from human placenta.Biochem. J. 1983; 211 (6870834): 295-30210.1042/bj2110295Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For formation of larger complexes to occur, two monomers assemble to a dimer in an antiparallel manner by forming a triple-helical segmented twisted supercoil (18Knupp C. Squire J.M. A new twist in the collagen story–the type VI segmented supercoil.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11157744): 372-37610.1093/emboj/20.3.372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two dimers then assemble laterally to form a tetramer. Several disulfide bridges stabilize the complex (1Engel J. Furthmayr H. Odermatt E. von der Mark H. Aumailley M. Fleischmajer R. Timpl R. Structure and macromolecular organization of type VI collagen.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 460 (3938630): 25-3710.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb51154.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The final secreted collagen VI tetramer, when made up by the α1α2α3 chains, contains up to 72 VWA domains. After secretion, intercalating overlapping end-to-end association of tetramers leads to the formation of the beaded microfibril, a process that is accompanied by proteolytic processing of the globular C-terminal part of the α3 chain (19Heumuller S.E. Talantikite M. Napoli M. Armengaud J. Morgelin M. Hartmann U. Sengle G. Paulsson M. Moali C. Wagener R.

Because of its size and heterogeneity, structural studies of collagen VI at atomic resolution are challenging. A nanostructure of the bead regions from the isolated α1α2α3 chain containing collagen VI microfibrils was determined using cryo-TEM (21Godwin A.R. Starborg T. Sherratt M.J. Roseman A.M. Baldock C. Defining the hierarchical organisation of collagen VI microfibrils at nanometre to micrometre length scales.Acta Biomater. 2017; 52 (27956360): 21-3210.1016/j.actbio.2016.12.023Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The beads have a compact hollow head region with four lobes, probably containing the C-terminal VWA domains from the three α-chains. The head is connected by an intermediate region to two tail regions, most likely containing the N1 VWA domains of all three α chains. However, the tandem array of VWA domains from the N terminus of the long α3 chain is lacking from the structure (21Godwin A.R. Starborg T. Sherratt M.J. Roseman A.M. Baldock C. Defining the hierarchical organisation of collagen VI microfibrils at nanometre to micrometre length scales.Acta Biomater. 2017; 52 (27956360): 21-3210.1016/j.actbio.2016.12.023Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, by utilizing SAXS, a C-shaped form of the N-terminal VWA domain tandem array of the α3 chain was determined (20Beecher N. Roseman A.M. Jowitt T.A. Berry R. Troilo H. Kammerer R.A. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Baldock C. Collagen VI, conformation of A-domain arrays and microfibril architecture.J. Biol.

Structural information at high resolution for the VWA domain array is lacking, even though the X-ray crystal structure of the single N5 VWA domain of the α3 chain revealed a C-terminal linker extension that allows the tandem arrangement of multiple VWA domains (23Becker A.K. Mikolajek H. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Werner J.M. A structure of a collagen VI VWA domain displays N and C termini at opposite sides of the protein.Structure. 2014; 22 (24332716): 199-20810.1016/j.str.2013.06.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As much of collagen VI is made up by the N-terminal tandem VWA domain array of the α3 chain, insight into its structure is required to understand collagen VI self-assembly into microfibrils and integration into the extracellular matrix. Further, such information will help in studies aimed at revealing the pathomechanisms underpinning collagen VI myopathies. Although mutations that affect the triple helix are the most common (24Butterfield R.J. Foley A.R. Dastgir J. Asman S. Dunn D.M. Zou Y. Hu Y. Donkervoort S. Flanigan K.M. Swoboda K.J. Winder T.L.

Here, we determine the structure of the collagen α3 N2 domain by X-ray crystallography and study the effects of introducing BM and UCMD patient mutations (Fig. 1) on the secretion efficiency of the single domains in cell culture. We investigate longer double and quadruple arrays of α3 chain-derived VWA domains (N5-N4 and N6-N3) by SAXS to assess the structural heterogeneity and the modular adaptability of the protein in solution. We also study the flexibility of N6-N3 by single-particle EM. The N2 domain located within the N-terminal region of the α3 chain carries several myopathy-causing mutations. To date, the location of the affected amino acid residues could only be estimated by homology modeling (29Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Zhang R.Z. Gotta S. Speer M.C. Tandan R. Timpl R. Chu M.L. A Bethlem myopathy Gly to Glu mutation in the von Willebrand factor A domain N2 of the collagen alpha3(VI) chain interferes with protein folding.FASEB J. 2000; 14 (10744632): 761-76810.1096/fasebj.14.5.761Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and conclusions on the consequences of mutations for the pathomechanism lack an experimentally determined structural basis. Therefore, the X-ray crystal structure of the human collagen VI α3 N2 domain was determined at a resolution of ∼2.3 Å, refined to RWork/RFree of 25.8/20.0% (Table 1). The data collected were anisotropic, with resolution estimates between 2.20 and 2.58 along different axes. This explains the relatively high Rmerge values in the outer shell (2.27–2.20 Å). The asymmetric unit contains two independent copies of the VWA domain, which are virtually identical (all-atom root mean square deviation [RMSD] of 0.23 Å) even in the loop sections, which indicates a certain structural rigidity.Table 1Dataset for the N2 VWA crystal and refinementParameterValue(s) for collagen VIData collectionSpace groupP1Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)36.64, 40.54, 57.11 α, β, γ (°)83.34, 76.80, 79.56Resolution (Å)55.43–2.2 (2.27–2.2)*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.Rsym or Rmerge0.22 (1.24)*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.I/σI4.6 (2.4)*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.Completeness (%)96.5 (96.5)*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.Redundancy3.4 (3.2)*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.RefinementResolution (Å)55.43–2.2No. reflections15,370 (1562)*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.No. of reflections used for Rfree761 (76)*Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.Rwork/Rfree (%)20.0/25.7No. of atoms3019Protein2915Water104B-factorsProtein26.86Water29.74RamachandranFavored (%)96.0Allowed (%)3.5Outliers (%)0.5RMSDBond lengths (Å)0.006Bond angles (°)0.65* Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The structure of the human collagen VI α3 N2 domain (Fig. 2A) is typical of the VWA domain family, adopting an alternating α/β Rossman fold made up of a central twisted core of five parallel (β1,2,4,5,6) and one anti-parallel (β3) β-strand surrounded by six α-helices. The sequence of the N2 domain does not indicate a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif, often present in VWA domains (30Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Distribution and evolution of von Willebrand/integrin A domains: widely dispersed domains with roles in cell adhesion and elsewhere.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (12388743): 3369-338710.1091/mbc.e02-05-0259Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Overall, the structure of the N2 domain is very similar to that of the α3 N5 domain (PDB entry 4IGI [23Becker A.K. Mikolajek H. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Werner J.M. A structure of a collagen VI VWA domain displays N and C termini at opposite sides of the protein.Structure. 2014; 22 (24332716): 199-20810.1016/j.str.2013.06.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar]) (Fig. 2B) with an RMSD Cα of 0.90 Å, even though the domains share only 31% sequence identity. Remnants of the C-terminal linker (as seen in Protein Data Bank accession no. 4IGI) that would otherwise connect to the N1 domain were not resolved, suggesting a level of structural heterogeneity in this region of the protein. Besides the unresolved C terminus, the major difference between the two structures is the short loop/turn in the N2 domain between β2 and α2 with the sequence 1670YEDGD1674. This is partly explained by the difference in primary structure in the N5 domain (1055LDVGPD1060), which is slightly longer and seems to allow different hydrogen bridging with Lys1636 at the N terminus and Lys1699 in the α2 helix of the N2 domain (Fig. 2C). The X-ray crystal structure of the N2 domain allows exact mapping of pathogenic mutations (Fig. 3A) and thereby gives clues for pathomechanisms. The mutations R1660C, D1674N, G1679E, and L1726R were selected from literature or from the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD; https://www.lovd.nl/), using the criteria that they were (i) likely pathogenic and/or (ii) had supporting data from patient material indicating pathogenicity (25Pan T.C.

The mutations cover a spectrum of prototypic locations within a VWA domain. G1679E is located in the central hydrophobic β sheet, L1726R in an α helix facing the hydrophobic core, and R1660C and D1674N are surface exposed in an α helix and a loop, respectively. As the recombinant expression of heterotrimeric collagen VI has not yet been achieved, only the mutated single VWA domains were expressed in HEK-293 EBNA cells to study their impact on expression and secretion (Fig. 3, B and C). The WT N2 domain is expressed and secreted and is well resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing (Fig. 3B) and reducing (Fig. 3C) conditions. The N2 domain carrying the R1660C mutation (lane 2) is expressed and secreted into the cell culture supernatant. However, in the cell lysate, an additional faster-migrating band is seen under nonreducing conditions. The N2 domain carrying the D1674N mutation (lane 3) is the only mutated domain that is expressed and secreted in a manner comparable to that of the WT N2 domain. Interestingly, under nonreducing conditions, the WT N2 domain and the R1660C and D1674N mutant domains in the cell culture supernatant show evidence of disulfide bond-mediated dimerization, with a slower-migrating band within the cell culture supernatant at 55 kDa (Fig. 3B) that disappears after reduction (Fig. 3C). R1660C shows qualitatively more of this dimer than D1674N and the native N2, which shows only trace levels. The surface-exposed location of the R1660C mutation likely increases the propensity of the domain to form disulfide-bonded dimers under oxidizing conditions. However, the dimerization observed in D1674N and trace dimerization in the native N2 domain can only be reconciled by the formation of a disulfide bond between two unpaired cysteine residues (C1825) located within the unstructured C-terminal tail. Strikingly, the G1679E (lane 4) and L1726R (lane 5) mutant domains are expressed but retained within the cell, shown by the strong band in the cell lysate and the lack of detectable material in the supernatant (Fig. 3, B and C). Although X-ray structures of single VWA domains may help to understand their particular function, e.g. by identifying binding surfaces, information about the connection of VWA domains and their relative arrangement to each other in space is also needed. Therefore, attempts at crystallizing tandem double domains were made. The variant N5-N4 was chosen as a prototype because the N5 domain, including parts of the linker to N4, has already been crystallized (23Becker A.K. Mikolajek H. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Werner J.M. A structure of a collagen VI VWA domain displays N and C termini at opposite sides of the protein.Structure. 2014; 22 (24332716): 199-20810.1016/j.str.2013.06.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the attempts to crystallize N5-N4 were unsuccessful. Therefore, in-line size exclusion chromatography SAXS (SEC-SAXS) (31Graewert M.A. Franke D. Jeffries C.M. Blanchet C.E. Ruskule D.

The SAXS results are summarized in Figure 4, Figure 5, and Fig. S2 and S3, and Table S2. The majority of the protein sample elutes from the gel filtration column as a monomer with an average MW of 43 kDa (expected MW from the N5-N4 amino acid sequence, 44.3 kDa) with an Rg of 2.90 ± 0.1 nm (Fig. 4A). The resulting p(r) profile yields a highly skewed distribution of real-space distances, indicating a rather elongated particle. The profile extends to the maximum diameter Dmax of ca. 10 nm and is dominated by a maximum at r = 2.6 nm and a well-defined secondary shoulder at 5 nm (Fig. 4B). The former feature points to the average cross-section of the particle. The latter feature is likely caused by contributions from scattering pair distances arising from well-defined, spatially separated domains. Low-resolution models of the protein in solution were calculated using ab initio modeling. The DAMMIN (32Svergun D.I.

https://openalex.org/W3045696594,"Autophagy, a self-degradative physiological process, is critical for homeostasis maintenance and energy source balancing in response to various stresses, including nutrient deprivation. It is a highly conserved catabolic process in eukaryotes and is indispensable for cell survival as it involves degradation of unessential or excessive components and their subsequent recycling as building blocks for the synthesis of necessary molecules. Although the dysregulation of autophagy has been reported to broadly contribute to various diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular mechanisms underlying the epigenetic regulation of autophagy are poorly elucidated. Here, we report that the level of lysine demethylase 3B (KDM3B) increases in nutrient-deprived HCT116 cells, a colorectal carcinoma cell line, resulting in transcriptional activation of the autophagy-inducing genes. KDM3B was found to enhance the transcription by demethylating H3K9me2 on the promoter of these genes. Furthermore, we observed that the depletion of KDM3B inhibited the autophagic flux in HCT116 cells. Collectively, these data suggested the critical role of KDM3B in the regulation of autophagy-related genes via H3K9me2 demethylation and induction of autophagy in nutrient-starved HCT116 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3045723229,"Aims The usefulness of mortality statistics relies on the validity of death certificate diagnosis. However, diagnosing the causal sequence of conditions leading to death is not simple. We examined diagnostic support for fatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and investigated its association with regional variation. Methods and results From Danish nationwide registers, we identified the study population (N = 3,244,051) of whom 36,669 individuals were recorded with AMI as the underlying cause-of-death between 2002 and 2015. We included clinical diagnoses, procedures, and claimed prescriptions related to atherosclerotic disease to evaluate the level of diagnostic support for fatal AMI in three diagnostic groups (Definite; Plausible; Uncertain). Adjusted mortality rates, rate ratios, and odds ratios were estimated for each AMI category, stratified by hospital region using multivariable regression models. More than one-third (N = 12,827, 35%) of deaths reported as fatal AMI had uncertain diagnostic support. The largest regional variation in AMI mortality rate ratios, varying from 1.16 (95%CI:1.02;1.31) to 1.62 (95%CI:1.43;1.83), was found among cases with uncertain diagnostic supportive data. Substantial inter-regional differences in the degree to which death occurs outside hospital [OR: 1.01 (95%CI:0.92;1.12) - 1.49 (95%CI:1.36;1.63)] and general practitioners determining the cause-of-death at home were present. Minor regional differences [OR: 0.96 (95%CI:0.85;1.07) - 1.16 (95%CI:1.04;1.29)] in in-hospital AMI mortality were observed. Conclusion There is significant regional variation associated with recording AMI as a cause-of-death. This variation is predominately based on death certificate diagnoses without diagnostic supportive evidence. Studies of fatal AMI should include a stratification on supportive evidence of the diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3046089329,"Study on fresh food safety reliability and temperature control has being a research focus in the fresh food cold distribution optimization study field. On this basis, optimization of transportation routing problem with time windows for fresh food in time-varying road network is studied by considering both economic cost and fresh food safety loss. A calculation method for path division strategy is designed. A food safety value loss measurement function, a metric function of energy and heat conversion a measure function of carbon emission rate are employed by considering time-varying vehicle speeds, fuel consumptions, cost of temperature control, the loss of food safety reliability and carbon emissions from transportation and temperature control. The fresh food cold chain distribution vehicle routing problem model with time windows in time-varying road network is formulated based on the objective of the distribution cost and food safety value loss minimization. According to the characteristics of the model, an adaptive improved ant colony algorithm is designed. Finally, the experimental data show that the model can effectively avoid the congestion period, reasonably control the refrigeration temperature, reduce the distribution cost, and improve food safety."
https://openalex.org/W3044519061,"Japanese firefighting organisations are essentially run as village, town, or city units. The Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995 led to the establishment of emergency support teams to ensure rapid action in response to disasters beyond the capacities of local fire departments. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake involved both a tsunami and a radiation disaster caused by a nuclear reactor meltdown, underscoring the need for responses in complex disasters. This study aimed to assess Nagasaki Prefecture firefighters’ preparedness for, awareness of, and anxiety regarding radiation disaster response with the aim of elucidating the factors affecting individuals’ decisions to accept or reject assignment to a radiation disaster response team. A questionnaire survey was carried out with 1,122 firefighters in three firefighting departments in Nagasaki Prefecture, which does not have nuclear power plants. In total, 920 questionnaires were returned, and the 784 that were valid were analysed. Among the participants, 39% replied that they would have no difficulty accepting assignment to a radiation disaster response team; most of them were under 30 years old and unmarried. This group also included significantly higher percentages of participants who were confident about radiation disaster response or, if anxious, believed things would turn out fine, as well as those who replied that they were able to use the necessary equipment. Furthermore, this group had significantly higher percentages of participants who replied that they would definitely participate in seminars and those who replied that their level of preparedness for radiation disasters was sufficient. The willingness to be assigned to a radiation disaster response team was linked to confidence about radiation disaster response and about handling materials and/or equipment. Therefore, it is considered that measures to increase firefighters’ confidence regarding response to radiation disasters will be linked to more proactive measures if and when such disasters occur."
https://openalex.org/W3045561505,"Florida strawberry growers frequently relay-crop (RC) vegetables with strawberry to offset high input costs. Relay-cropping consists of planting two crops at different times on the same raised bed which helps growers’ lower risk due to diversification and maximize economic returns. Four separate experiments on relay cropping strawberry with jalapeño pepper and cantaloupe were conducted at Balm, Florida, in 2016–17 and 2017–18. The objective was to a) determine the effects of relay-cropping on crop yields, b) optimize pepper and cantaloupe planting date, and c) optimize the strawberry termination date when relay cropping with vegetables. Strawberry yields were unaffected by the presence of vegetables. Pepper yields were unaffected by the presence of strawberries, but cantaloupes yields were significantly (p = 0.0250) lower when planted with strawberry. Early January to early-February were the optimum dates to transplant pepper with strawberries transplanted in October but date of planting did not affect cantaloupe yield. Early January to early-February transplant dates for pepper resulted in net profits of around $23000-38000/ha in 2016–17 compared to the baseline treatment (strawberries alone). However, in 2017–18 all of the planting dates of pepper with strawberry except January 4 resulted in losses of $2000-18000/ha. In 2016–17, cantaloupes planted in late January and early February resulted in profits of $2986.3 and 2705.1/ha, respectively. All other planting dates resulted in loses compared to baseline treatment. In 2017–18, all the planting dates resulted in net profits of around $6700-14500/ha. In conclusion, cantaloupe and jalapeño pepper can be relay cropped with strawberry with no negative effects on strawberry yield. However, early planting dates tend to maximize economic return."
https://openalex.org/W3046048779,"Driving accidents due to hypovigilance are common but the role of hypnotics is unclear in patients suffering from sleep disorders. Our study examined factors influencing accidents and near miss accidents attributed to sleepiness at the wheel (ANMAS). Using data from an online questionnaire aimed at patients with sleep disorders, we analysed the associations between ANMAS, sociodemographic data, symptoms of sleep disorders, severity of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)) symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale with depression (HADD) and anxiety (HADA) subscales), chronic sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale ESS), hypnotic use and information about sleep habits. Hypnotics were hierarchically grouped into Z-drugs, sedative medication, melatonin and over the counter (OTC) alternative treatments. Of 10802 participants; 9.1% reported ANMAS (Men 11.1% women 8.3%) and 24.4% took hypnotics (Z-drugs 8.5%, sedative medication 8%, melatonin 5.6% and alternative treatments 2.5%). Logistic regression analysis identified the following risk factors for ANMAS: moderate (OR 2.4; CI: 2.10–2.79) and severe sleepiness (ESS OR 5.66; CI: 4.74–6.77), depression (HADD OR 1.2; CI: 1.03–1.47), anxiety (HADA OR 1.2;CI: 1.01–1.47), and insufficient sleep (OR1.4; CI: 1.2–1.7). Hypnotics were not associated with an increased risk of ANMAS in patients suffering from insomnia. Risk factors varied according to sex: in females, sex (OR 0.; CI: 0.55–0.74), mild insomnia (OR 0.5; CI: 0.3–0.8) and use of alternative treatments (OR 0.455, CI:0.23–0.89) were protective factors and risk was increased by sleepiness, sleep debt, social jetlag, caffeine use, anxiety and depression. In men no protective factors were identified: sleepiness, sleep debt, and severe insomnia were associated with an increased risk of ANMAS. In clinical practice, all patients with daytime sleepiness and men with severe insomnia should be counselled concerning driving risk and encouraged to avoid sleep debt."
https://openalex.org/W3046114401,"A significant relationship exists between elevated uric acid concentration and both prevalent and incident hypertension; however, data regarding the influence of higher uric acid concentration at baseline on blood pressure control by antihypertensive drugs is scarce. Thus, a prospective cohort study was performed. The study outcome was the non-attainment of optimal blood pressure (NOBP). NOBP level was defined according to the Japanese hypertension guideline. This study enrolled a Japanese community-based cohort (N = 8,664; age 65.5 ± 6.4 years; women, 55.0%) who were not using antihypertensive drugs on the first visit for a health check-up program but started using antihypertensive drug(s) on the next-year visit. The participants were classified into quartiles based basic uric acid concentration. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for NOBP as the primary outcome measure. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that quartile 4 was significantly associated with NOBP when quartile 1 was set as the reference (OR (95% confidence interval), 1.36 (1.16–1.59), p<0.01), adjusted for potential confounders, such as age, sex, body mass index, presence of diabetes/dyslipidemia/chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of cardiovascular disease, daily drinking, and current smoking. In the subgroup analysis of female participants and participants with diabetes and CKD, a significant association was observed between +1 mg/dL of uric acid and NOBP. Higher uric acid concentration at baseline was significantly associated with NOBP on the first use of antihypertensive drug(s)."
https://openalex.org/W3044125846,"To assess left ventricular hypertrophy, actual left ventricular mass (LVM) normalized for body size has to be compared to the LVM normative data. However, only some published normative echocardiographic data have been produced separately for girls and boys; numerous normative data for the pediatric population are not sex-specific. Thus, this study aimed to assess whether the LVM normative data should be developed separately for girls and boys practicing sports.Left ventricular mass was computed for 331 girls and 490 boys, 5-19 years old, based on echocardiography. The effect of sex on the relationship between LVM and body size was evaluated using a linear regression model. Seven sets of the LVM normative data were developed, using different methodologies, to test concordance between sex-specific and non-specific normative data. Every set consisted of normative data that was sex-specific and non-specific. Upon these normative data, for every study participant, seven pairs of LVM z-scores were calculated based on her/his actual LVM. Each pair consisted of z-scores computed based on sex-specific and non-specific normative data from the same set.The regression lines fitted to the data points corresponding to LVM of boys had a higher slope than of girls, indicating that sex affects the relationship between LVM and body size. The mean differences between the paired LVM z-scores differed significantly from 0. The percentage of discordant indications, depending on the normalization method, ranged from 66.7% to 100% in girls and from 35.4% to 50% in boys. Application of the LVM normative data that were not sex-specific made relative LVM underestimated in girls and overestimated in boys.The LVM normative data should be developed separately for girls and boys practicing sports. Application of normative data that are not sex-specific results in an underestimation of relative LVM in girls and overestimation in boys."
