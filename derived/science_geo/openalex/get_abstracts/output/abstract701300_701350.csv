https://openalex.org/W4297243353,"Plant intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) detect pathogen effectors to trigger immune responses1. Indirect recognition of a pathogen effector by the dicotyledonous Arabidopsis thaliana coiled-coil domain containing NLR (CNL) ZAR1 induces the formation of a large hetero-oligomeric protein complex, termed the ZAR1 resistosome, which functions as a calcium channel required for ZAR1-mediated immunity2-4. Whether the resistosome and channel activities are conserved among plant CNLs remains unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the wheat CNL Sr355 in complex with the effector AvrSr356 of the wheat stem rust pathogen. Direct effector binding to the leucine-rich repeats of Sr35 results in the formation of a pentameric Sr35-AvrSr35 complex, which we term the Sr35 resistosome. Wheat Sr35 and Arabidopsis ZAR1 resistosomes bear striking structural similarities, including an arginine cluster in the leucine-rich repeats domain not previously recognized as conserved, which co-occurs and forms intramolecular interactions with the 'EDVID' motif in the coiled-coil domain. Electrophysiological measurements show that the Sr35 resistosome exhibits non-selective cation channel activity. These structural insights allowed us to generate new variants of closely related wheat and barley orphan NLRs that recognize AvrSr35. Our data support the evolutionary conservation of CNL resistosomes in plants and demonstrate proof of principle for structure-based engineering of NLRs for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W4297242811,"Exploring the subsurface structure and stratification of Mars advances our understanding of Martian geology, hydrological evolution and palaeoclimatic changes, and has been a main task for past and continuing Mars exploration missions1-10. Utopia Planitia, the smooth plains of volcanic and sedimentary strata that infilled the Utopia impact crater, has been a prime target for such exploration as it is inferred to have hosted an ancient ocean on Mars11-13. However, 45 years have passed since Viking-2 provided ground-based detection results. Here we report an in situ ground-penetrating radar survey of Martian subsurface structure in a southern marginal area of Utopia Planitia conducted by the Zhurong rover of the Tianwen-1 mission. A detailed subsurface image profile is constructed along the roughly 1,171 m traverse of the rover, showing an approximately 70-m-thick, multi-layered structure below a less than 10-m-thick regolith. Although alternative models deserve further scrutiny, the new radar image suggests the occurrence of episodic hydraulic flooding sedimentation that is interpreted to represent the basin infilling of Utopia Planitia during the Late Hesperian to Amazonian. While no direct evidence for the existence of liquid water was found within the radar detection depth range, we cannot rule out the presence of saline ice in the subsurface of the landing area."
https://openalex.org/W4297241365,The CRISPR prime editor PE2 consists of a Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nickase (nSpCas9) fused at its C-terminus to a Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT). Here we show that separated nSpCas9 and MMLV-RT proteins function as efficiently as intact PE2 in human cells. We use this Split-PE system to rapidly identify and engineer more compact prime editor architectures that also broaden the types of RTs used for prime editing.

https://openalex.org/W4297243218,"Abstract A fundamental challenge in fluorescence microscopy is the photon shot noise arising from the inevitable stochasticity of photon detection. Noise increases measurement uncertainty and limits imaging resolution, speed and sensitivity. To achieve high-sensitivity fluorescence imaging beyond the shot-noise limit, we present DeepCAD-RT, a self-supervised deep learning method for real-time noise suppression. Based on our previous framework DeepCAD, we reduced the number of network parameters by 94%, memory consumption by 27-fold and processing time by a factor of 20, allowing real-time processing on a two-photon microscope. A high imaging signal-to-noise ratio can be acquired with tenfold fewer photons than in standard imaging approaches. We demonstrate the utility of DeepCAD-RT in a series of photon-limited experiments, including in vivo calcium imaging of mice, zebrafish larva and fruit flies, recording of three-dimensional (3D) migration of neutrophils after acute brain injury and imaging of 3D dynamics of cortical ATP release. DeepCAD-RT will facilitate the morphological and functional interrogation of biological dynamics with a minimal photon budget."
https://openalex.org/W4297242736,"Accurate somatic mutation detection from single-cell DNA sequencing is challenging due to amplification-related artifacts. To reduce this artifact burden, an improved amplification technique, primary template-directed amplification (PTA), was recently introduced. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 52 PTA-amplified single neurons using SCAN2, a new genotyper we developed to leverage mutation signatures and allele balance in identifying somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in PTA data. Our analysis confirms an increase in nonclonal somatic mutation in single neurons with age, but revises the estimated rate of this accumulation to 16 SNVs per year. We also identify artifacts in other amplification methods. Most importantly, we show that somatic indels increase by at least three per year per neuron and are enriched in functional regions of the genome such as enhancers and promoters. Our data suggest that indels in gene-regulatory elements have a considerable effect on genome integrity in human neurons. Single-cell DNA sequencing data are generated from human neurons using primary template-directed amplification and analyzed using SCAN2, an improved genotyping tool. Indels are enriched in neuronal regulatory elements and may be deleterious."
https://openalex.org/W4297241257,"Movement and posture depend on sensory feedback that is regulated by specialized GABAergic neurons (GAD2+) that form axo-axonic contacts onto myelinated proprioceptive sensory axons and are thought to be inhibitory. However, we report here that activating GAD2+ neurons directly with optogenetics or indirectly by cutaneous stimulation actually facilitates sensory feedback to motor neurons in rodents and humans. GABAA receptors located at or near nodes of Ranvier of sensory axons cause this facilitation by preventing spike propagation failure at the many axon branch points, which is otherwise common without GABA. In contrast, GABAA receptors are generally lacking from axon terminals and so cannot inhibit transmitter release onto motor neurons, unlike GABAB receptors that cause presynaptic inhibition. GABAergic innervation near nodes and branch points allows individual branches to function autonomously, with GAD2+ neurons regulating which branches conduct, adding a computational layer to the neuronal networks generating movement and likely generalizing to other central nervous system axons."
https://openalex.org/W4297242940,"Abstract Although cyclophilins are attractive targets for probing biology and therapeutic intervention, no subtype-selective cyclophilin inhibitors have been described. We discovered novel cyclophilin inhibitors from the in vitro selection of a DNA-templated library of 256,000 drug-like macrocycles for cyclophilin D (CypD) affinity. Iterated macrocycle engineering guided by ten X-ray co-crystal structures yielded potent and selective inhibitors (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) = 10 nM) that bind the active site of CypD and also make novel interactions with non-conserved residues in the S2 pocket, an adjacent exo-site. The resulting macrocycles inhibit CypD activity with 21- to &gt;10,000-fold selectivity over other cyclophilins and inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening in isolated mitochondria. We further exploited S2 pocket interactions to develop the first cyclophilin E (CypE)-selective inhibitor, which forms a reversible covalent bond with a CypE S2 pocket lysine, and exhibits 30- to &gt;4,000-fold selectivity over other cyclophilins. These findings reveal a strategy to generate isoform-selective small-molecule cyclophilin modulators, advancing their suitability as targets for biological investigation and therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W4297242151,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are highly heritable neurodevelopmental conditions, with considerable overlap in their genetic etiology. We dissected their shared and distinct genetic etiology by cross-disorder analyses of large datasets. We identified seven loci shared by the disorders and five loci differentiating them. All five differentiating loci showed opposite allelic directions in the two disorders and significant associations with other traits, including educational attainment, neuroticism and regional brain volume. Integration with brain transcriptome data enabled us to identify and prioritize several significantly associated genes. The shared genomic fraction contributing to both disorders was strongly correlated with other psychiatric phenotypes, whereas the differentiating portion was correlated most strongly with cognitive traits. Additional analyses revealed that individuals diagnosed with both ASD and ADHD were double-loaded with genetic predispositions for both disorders and showed distinctive patterns of genetic association with other traits compared with the ASD-only and ADHD-only subgroups. These results provide insights into the biological foundation of the development of one or both conditions and of the factors driving psychopathology discriminatively toward either ADHD or ASD."
https://openalex.org/W4297242385,"Identification of risk variants for neuropsychiatric diseases within enhancers underscores the importance of understanding population-level variation in enhancer function in the human brain. Besides regulating tissue-specific and cell-type-specific transcription of target genes, enhancers themselves can be transcribed. By jointly analyzing large-scale cell-type-specific transcriptome and regulome data, we cataloged 30,795 neuronal and 23,265 non-neuronal candidate transcribed enhancers. Examination of the transcriptome in 1,382 brain samples identified robust expression of transcribed enhancers. We explored gene-enhancer coordination and found that enhancer-linked genes are strongly implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for both genes and enhancers and found that enhancer eQTLs mediate a substantial fraction of neuropsychiatric trait heritability. Inclusion of enhancer eQTLs in transcriptome-wide association studies enhanced functional interpretation of disease loci. Overall, our study characterizes the gene-enhancer regulome and genetic mechanisms in the human cortex in both healthy and diseased states."
https://openalex.org/W4296817128,"Rad6, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme conserved from yeast to humans, functions in transcription, genome maintenance, and proteostasis. The contributions of many conserved secondary structures of Rad6 and its human homologs UBE2A and UBE2B to their biological functions are not understood. A mutant RAD6 allele with a missense substitution at alanine-126 (A126) of helix-3 that causes defects in telomeric gene silencing, DNA repair, and protein degradation was reported over 2 decades ago. Here, using a combination of genetics, biochemical, biophysical, and computational approaches, we discovered that helix-3 A126 mutations compromise the ability of Rad6 to ubiquitinate target proteins without disrupting interactions with partner E3 ubiquitin-ligases that are required for their various biological functions in vivo. Explaining the defective in vitro or in vivo ubiquitination activities, molecular dynamics simulations and NMR showed that helix-3 A126 mutations cause local disorder of the catalytic pocket of Rad6 in addition to disorganizing the global structure of the protein to decrease its stability in vivo. We also show that helix-3 A126 mutations deform the structures of UBE2A and UBE2B, the human Rad6 homologs, and compromise the in vitro ubiquitination activity and folding of UBE2B. Providing insights into their ubiquitination defects, we determined helix-3 A126 mutations impair the initial ubiquitin charging and the final discharging steps during substrate ubiquitination by Rad6. In summary, our studies reveal that the conserved helix-3 is a crucial structural constituent that controls the organization of catalytic pockets, enzymatic activities, and biological functions of the Rad6-family E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.

In summary, our studies reveal that the conserved helix-3 is a crucial structural constituent that controls the organization of catalytic pockets, enzymatic activities, and biological functions of the Rad6-family E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Ubiquitination, the covalent posttranslational modification of proteins by the highly conserved 76 amino-acid protein ubiquitin (Ub), controls many aspects of cellular function (1Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Google Scholar, 2Damgaard R.B. The ubiquitin system: from cell signalling to disease biology and new therapeutic opportunities.Cell Death Differ. 2021; 28: 423-426Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a three-step process: first, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme uses ATP to activate ubiquitin. Second, the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme attaches the ubiquitin onto the active-site cysteine of an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (henceforth referred to as an E2 enzyme) (1Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Google Scholar, 3Ciechanover A. The unravelling of the ubiquitin system.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 322-324Google Scholar). Third, an E3 ubiquitin-ligase (henceforth referred to as E3 ligase) and the ubiquitin-charged E2 enzyme target a substrate protein to catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and a nucleophile, which is typically a lysine side chain on the substrate protein (4Zheng N. Shabek N. Ubiquitin ligases: structure, function, and regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 129-157Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination or addition of just one ubiquitin moiety is important during transcription and DNA repair (5Hicke L. Protein regulation by monoubiquitin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Google Scholar, 6Sewduth R.N. Baietti M.F. Sablina A.A. Cracking the monoubiquitin code of genetic diseases.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 3036Google Scholar, 7Sigismund S. Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Signaling through monoubiquitination.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 286: 149-185Google Scholar). Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues, which are targeted for cycles of ubiquitin addition to form polyubiquitin chains. Polyubiquitination through ubiquitin lysine-48 (K48) generally targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, whereas K63-linked ubiquitin chains regulate signal transduction and endocytosis (1Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Google Scholar, 8Kliza K. Husnjak K. Resolving the complexity of ubiquitin networks.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2020; 7: 21Google Scholar). Misregulation of ubiquitination is associated with numerous diseases ranging from neurological disorders to cancers (9Jiang Y.H. Beaudet A.L. Human disorders of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2004; 16: 419-426Google Scholar, 10Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L.

Cells. 2018; 41: 168-178Google Scholar). E2 enzymes are central players in protein ubiquitination (15Stewart M.D. Ritterhoff T. Klevit R.E. Brzovic P.S. E2 enzymes: more than just middle men.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 423-440Google Scholar, 16Ye Y. Rape M. Building ubiquitin chains: E2 enzymes at work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 755-764Google Scholar). Humans express ∼35 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or budding yeast expresses 12 E2 enzymes. The E2 enzymes contain a distinctive core catalytic domain of about 150 amino acids called the UBC fold (17Burroughs A.M. Jaffee M. Iyer L.M. Aravind L. Anatomy of the E2 ligase fold: implications for enzymology and evolution of ubiquitin/Ub-like protein conjugation.J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 162: 205-218Google Scholar), which is comprised of four α-helices, four β-sheets (also called a β-meander), and a conserved active-site cysteine (18Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutation of cysteine-88 in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 protein abolishes its ubiquitin-conjugating activity and its various biological functions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2695-2699Google Scholar). Additional residues also have roles in the catalytic functions of E2 enzymes: one is a conserved asparagine in a ‘flap’ or loop region present close to the active-site cysteine, which is part of the H x N triad that is proposed to aid in localizing the target lysine (19Sadowski M. Suryadinata R. Lai X. Heierhorst J. Sarcevic B. Molecular basis for lysine specificity in the yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2316-2329Google Scholar) or the active site (20Berndsen C.E. Wiener R. Yu I.W. Ringel A.E. Wolberger C. A conserved asparagine has a structural role in ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 154-156Google Scholar) and in stabilizing the oxyanion formed in the reaction intermediate during the nucleophilic attack (21Wu P.Y. Hanlon M. Eddins M. Tsui C. Rogers R.S. Jensen J.P. et al.A conserved catalytic residue in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5241-5250Google Scholar). Another is the “gateway residue”, which is a conserved serine or aspartate present in a loop that forms the opening of the E2 active-site cleft and implicated in the regulation of E2 activity (15Stewart M.D. Ritterhoff T. Klevit R.E. Brzovic P.S. E2 enzymes: more than just middle men.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 423-440Google Scholar, 22Valimberti I. Tiberti M. Lambrughi M. Sarcevic B. Papaleo E. E2 superfamily of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes: constitutively active or activated through phosphorylation in the catalytic cleft.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 14849Google Scholar). Some E2 enzymes also contain internal and/or N- or C-terminal extensions to the UBC fold that have regulatory functions (14Hormaechea-Agulla D. Kim Y. Song M.S. Song S.J. New insights into the role of E2s in the pathogenesis of diseases: lessons learned from UBE2O.Mol. Cells. 2018; 41: 168-178Google Scholar). Functions for various secondary structures within the UBC domain of E2 enzymes have also been reported (15Stewart M.D. Ritterhoff T. Klevit R.E. Brzovic P.S. E2 enzymes: more than just middle men.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 423-440Google Scholar, 23Wenzel D.M. Stoll K.E. Klevit R.E. E2s: structurally economical and functionally replete.Biochem. J. 2011; 433: 31-42Google Scholar): the N-terminal helix-1 in some E2s is an E1- or E3-binding surface. Loops in the front face close to the catalytic pocket of E2s are functionally important in binding the RING domain of E3 ligases. The vast majority of the noncovalent interactions of E2 enzymes with ubiquitin, partner E3 ubiquitin-ligases, or other regulatory factors involve a so-called “backside” surface that is located on the face opposite from the catalytic pocket and made up of residues of the four β-sheets, the C-terminal end of helix-1, the intervening loops, and the C-terminal end of helix-4 (23Wenzel D.M.

Despite these many structure-function studies, the roles for other regions within E2 enzymes, such as helix-3, remain not known. Rad6 (Radiation sensitive 6) is an E2 enzyme in budding yeast that has well-established functions in transcription, DNA repair, and protein homeostasis that are accomplished through its interactions with different partner E3 ligases (Fig. 1A): Rad6 interacts with the Rad18 E3 ligase to monoubiquitinate PCNA and activate translesion DNA repair following DNA damage (28Hoege C.

During transcription and other nuclear processes, Rad6 interacts with the Bre1 E3 ligase and the adapter protein Lge1 to monoubiquitinate histone H2B at K123 (H2BK123) (30Wood A. Krogan N.J. Dover J.

Rad6 partners with the E3 ligase Ubr2 and the adapter protein Mub1 to polyubiquitinate phosphorylated Sml1, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, resulting in its proteasomal degradation upon recovery from DNA damage (38Andreson B.L.

The extremely conserved amino terminus of RAD6 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme is essential for amino-end rule-dependent protein degradation.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 250-261Google Scholar).

J. 2012; 445: 167-174Google Scholar), the active-site C88, S120 in the active-site cleft or gate, and H78 and N80 in the HPN motif together constitute the catalytic pocket of Rad6 (Fig. 1B). Low-affinity noncovalent interactions of ubiquitin with the backside of Rad6 were reported to influence its processivity (24Kumar P. Magala P. Geiger-Schuller K.R. Majumdar A. Tolman J.R. Wolberger C. Role of a non-canonical surface of Rad6 in ubiquitin conjugating activity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 9039-9050Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies have defined the role(s) of various residues and secondary structures within Rad6 to its protein–protein interactions and enzymatic functions; however, the contributions of other regions of the UBC domain to overall structure and enzymatic functions are not fully understood. Nearly 2 decades ago, Liebman et al. reported the isolation and initial characterization of a missense threonine substitution at alanine (A) 126 in helix-3 of yeast Rad6. This mutant was defective in telomeric gene silencing and other functions of Rad6 (53Freiberg G. Mesecar A.D. Huang H. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Characterization of novel rad6/ubc2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme mutants in yeast.Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 221-233Google Scholar). Here, using a multidisciplinary approach, we examined the contributions of A126 in helix-3 to the biological functions of Rad6. Mutations at A126 adversely affected the Rad6-mediated monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of substrate proteins that regulate telomeric gene silencing, DNA repair, and protein degradation. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and NMR, we show that mutations in A126 cause disorganization of local structure of the catalytic pockets as well as global structure of Rad6 that inhibit enzymatic activity and/or compromise protein stability in an E3 ligase-independent fashion. Our investigations further show that A126 mutation(s) in helix-3 also disrupt the structure and enzymatic activity of human Rad6 homologs. Overall, our studies reveal that the conserved helix-3 is a crucial structural constituent of yeast and human Rad6 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. A screen for RAD6 alleles that cause defects in telomeric gene silencing identified a mutant with a threonine substitution at A126 of Rad6 (53Freiberg G. Mesecar A.D. Huang H. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Characterization of novel rad6/ubc2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme mutants in yeast.Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 221-233Google Scholar). The rad6-A126T allele also conferred sensitivity to UV irradiation, indicating impaired DNA repair function, and was also shown to be defective in N-end rule protein degradation (53Freiberg G. Mesecar A.D. Huang H. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Characterization of novel rad6/ubc2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme mutants in yeast.Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 221-233Google Scholar). A126 is in helix-3 of Rad6, close to the catalytic pocket (Fig. 1B). To investigate how mutations in A126 residue influence the biological functions of Rad6 in telomeric gene silencing, DNA repair, and protein degradation, we created yeast constructs for expression of the rad6-A126T mutant and of a Rad6 protein with a bulkier phenylalanine (F) substitution (rad6-A126F). To test the effect of these mutations on telomeric gene silencing, we transformed the constructs into a rad6 null mutant yeast strain (rad6Δ) that harbors a silencing reporter gene (URA3) integrated near the left end of chromosome VII. As controls, either the empty vector or a plasmid for the expression of WT Rad6 was transformed into this reporter strain. Transcriptional repression of the telomere-proximal URA3 reporter occurred in the presence of WT Rad6, which allowed yeast cells to survive on a media containing the counterselection agent 5-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA) (54Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. 5-Fluoroorotic acid as a selective agent in yeast molecular genetics.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Google Scholar), whereas the absence of Rad6 resulted in the transcriptional activation and production of the URA3 enzyme, which converts 5FOA to toxic 5-fluorouracil, inhibiting growth (Fig. 1C, top panels). Consistent with the previous report (53Freiberg G. Mesecar A.D. Huang H. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Characterization of novel rad6/ubc2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme mutants in yeast.Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 221-233Google Scholar), expression of the rad6-A126T mutant resulted in slower growth on 5FOA medium than the control strain that expressed WT Rad6 (Fig. 1C), indicating activation of the URA3 reporter and a telomeric silencing defect. The rad6-A126F mutant showed a more drastic growth retardation on 5FOA medium than the rad6-A126T mutant strain (Fig. 1C), revealing that this mutation causes a severe telomeric gene silencing defect. Next, we examined the growth of Rad6 A126 mutant strains following exposure to DNA damaging agents: UV or the radiomimetic drug bleomycin (55Povirk L.F. DNA damage and mutagenesis by radiomimetic DNA-cleaving agents: bleomycin, neocarzinostatin and other enediynes.Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Google Scholar). While the rad6-A126T mutant showed a subtle slow growth defect, the rad6-A126F mutant had a more severe growth retardation upon UV irradiation or bleomycin treatment than the control strain that expresses WT Rad6 (Fig. 1C, middle and lower panels). These results suggest that mutations in A126 residue impair the DNA repair functions of Rad6. Proteins with N-terminal arginine are degraded by the N-end-rule pathway, where polyubiquitination by Rad6 precedes proteasome-mediated proteolysis (56Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway and regulation by proteolysis.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 1298-1345Google Scholar). To measure the N-end rule activity, extracts were prepared for enzyme assays from strains expressing either WT or mutant Rad6 along with the reporter beta-galactosidase protein with arginine as the N-terminal amino acid (R-β-Gal) (57Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. In vivo half-life of a protein is a function of its amino-terminal residue.Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Google Scholar). Low or no activity was obtained for R-β-Gal in extracts prepared from the strain with WT Rad6 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, extracts prepared from strains lacking Rad6 (rad6Δ) or expressing the catalytic-dead mutant (rad6-C88A) yielded very high activity compared to the control strain with WT Rad6 (Fig. 1D), indicating stabilization of R-β-Gal levels and a defect in the N-end-rule degradation. Extracts prepared from rad6-A126T and rad6-A126F mutant strains showed higher galactosidase activity than the control strain with WT Rad6 (Fig. 1D), indicating that these mutants are also defective in the N-end rule protein degradation process. Collectively, our results showed that mutations at A126 compromise Rad6’s functions in telomeric gene silencing, DNA repair, and targeted proteolysis. Next, we asked whether Rad6 A126 mutations disrupt ubiquitination of substrate proteins histone H2B and PCNA or Sml1, which are involved in telomeric gene silencing and DNA repair, respectively (28Hoege C.

Therefore, we measured the steady-state levels of H2Bub1 and H3K4me in rad6-A126T and rad6-A126F strains using immunoblotting. When expressed in the rad6Δ strain, both rad6-A126T and rad6-A126F mutants caused an apparent complete loss of H2Bub1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–4). In yeast, steady-state H2Bub1 levels are a net result of two opposing enzymatic activities: Rad6-Bre1-Lge1–mediated ubiquitin conjugation and subsequent removal by deubiquitinases Ubp8 and Ubp10 (60Daniel J.A.

https://openalex.org/W4296817116,"Many pathogens synthesize inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) as the major sphingolipid (SL), differing from the mammalian host where sphingomyelin (SM) or more complex SLs predominate. The divergence between IPC synthase and mammalian SL synthases has prompted interest as a potential drug target. However, in the trypanosomatid protozoan Leishmania, cultured insect stage promastigotes lack de novo SL synthesis (Δspt2-) and SLs survive and remain virulent, as infective amastigotes salvage host SLs and continue to produce IPC. To further understand the role of IPC, we generated null IPCS mutants in Leishmania major (Δipcs-). Unexpectedly and unlike fungi where IPCS is essential, Δipcs- was remarkably normal in culture and highly virulent in mouse infections. Both IPCS activity and IPC were absent in Δipcs- promastigotes and amastigotes, arguing against an alternative route of IPC synthesis. Notably, salvaged mammalian SM was highly abundant in purified amastigotes from both WT and Δipcs-, and salvaged SLs could be further metabolized into IPC. SM was about 7-fold more abundant than IPC in WT amastigotes, establishing that SM is the dominant amastigote SL, thereby rendering IPC partially redundant. These data suggest that SM salvage likely plays key roles in the survival and virulence of both WT and Δipcs- parasites in the infected host, confirmation of which will require the development of methods or mutants deficient in host SL/SM uptake in the future. Our findings call into question the suitability of IPCS as a target for chemotherapy, instead suggesting that approaches targeting SM/SL uptake or catabolism may warrant further emphasis."

Identifying the factors driving glycaemic control is essential for better management. There is lack of data on factors associated with poor glycaemic control and targeted interventions in the DRC. This study aims to determine the factors associated with type 2 diabetes control and develop an appropriate intervention package in Kinshasa. The study will comprise of three sub-studies as follows: the first sub-study being a concurrent parallel mixed-methods cross-sectional study to determine factors driving poor glycaemic control among patients in Kinshasa. A total of 614 patients will be invited to participate in a cross-sectional study and respond to standardized questionnaires. A minimum of 20 purposively selected patients will participate in the qualitative study that will involve in-depth interviews about their perspectives on glycaemic control. In the quantitative study, multivariable logistic regression will be performed to determine factors associated with glycaemic control, after identifying the confounding factors. In the qualitative study, thematic analysis will be performed. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative studies on factors that are associated with glycaemic control will be triangulated. And allow to conduct the second sub-study, a qualitative inquiry with a minimum of 20 healthcare providers and 20 patients, selected purposively, to explore their perspectives about potential interventions to improve glycaemic control. At the last, the findings of both sub-studies will be subjected to an anonymous electronic three-round process Delphi study involving 25 stakeholders on the intervention package to develop a framework to optimise glycaemic control in Kinshasa. The implementation of the intervention package will occur after the completion of this study with expected substantial impact on the patients, healthcare providers, and health system."

A unified model for the function of YTHDF proteins in regulating m6A-modified mRNA.Cell. 2020; 181: 1582-1595.e1518Google Scholar). Considering m6A marks several thousand transcripts in a typical cell type, the scope for pleiotropic effects from these knockdowns/KOs is large. Hence, to reveal the specific functions of m6A on individual transcripts, there is a need to specifically modulate m6A on single or multiple transcripts.

A catalytic-dead Cas13a was generated (dCas13a), which when guided by a crRNA, can function as an RNA sequence–specific binding protein that can deliver dCas13a-fused proteins to specific RNAs (47Abudayyeh O.O.

Thus, catalytic-dead dCas13a, fused to RNA-modifying enzymes, cotransfected with specific crRNAs can potentially modulate information on single transcripts.

Here, we generated dCas13a fused with full-length METTL3 or the core m6A methyltransferase domain (MTD) containing the methylation domain and two core zinc finger domains of METTL3 (62Huang J.

The dCas13a fusions are available in vectors compatible with liposomal transfection or lentiviral vectors suitable for hard-to-transfect cells. The system works in human and mouse cells. We show that our CRISPR/dCas13a-associated RNA m6A-editing system can be specifically navigated by crRNAs to modulate m6A on individual coding or noncoding RNAs. We demonstrate the efficacy of this system to modulate circular RNA translational efficiency and RNA transcript half-life. In addition, by taking advantage of the intrinsic capability for Cas13a to mature pre-crRNA, we show how the dCas13a fusions can process a programmable crRNA array containing multiple crRNAs to target several transcripts simultaneously for m6A editing. Finally, we utilize this system to edit m6A on the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) XIST (X-inactive specific transcript), resulting in the reactivation of XIST-repressed genes, or active silencing in METTL3 knockdown cells. This work describes a series of tools that can edit m6A in multiple mammalian cellular contexts on specific RNAs to explore the effect of m6A on transcript activity. m6A RNA methylation is catalyzed by several protein complexes containing multiple protein subunits, for example, METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, and so on (32Yang Y.

Hence, we selected human METTL3 full-length protein, or a truncated methylation domain (MTD), containing the methylation domain and two core zinc finger domains, as m6A writers, and FTO as an m6A eraser. To construct an m6A-editing system, we fused the catalytically inactivated LwaCas13a (dCas13a) (47Abudayyeh O.O. Gootenberg J.S. Essletzbichler P. Han S. Joung J. Belanto J.J. et al.RNA targeting with CRISPR–Cas13.Nature. 2017; 550: 280-284Google Scholar, 48East-Seletsky A. O'Connell M.R. Knight S.C. Burstein D. Cate J.H.

As controls, we constructed catalytic-dead mutants of METTL3D395A (63Wang X. Feng J. Xue Y. Guan Z. Zhang D. Liu Z. et al.Structural basis of N(6)-adenosine methylation by the METTL3-METTL14 complex.Nature. 2016; 534: 575-578Google Scholar, 65Wang P. Doxtader Katelyn A. Nam Y. Structural basis for cooperative function of Mettl3 and Mettl14 methyltransferases.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63: 306-317Google Scholar) and FTOY108A (67Han Z. Niu T. Chang J. Lei X. Zhao M. Wang Q. et al.Crystal structure of the FTO protein reveals basis for its substrate specificity.Nature. 2010; 464: 1205-1209Google Scholar) fused to dCas13a (Fig. S1A). All these fusion systems contain an N-terminal dCas13a, followed by a 13 amino acid GGS linker, a hemagglutinin tag, three nuclear localization signals, and a P2A (self-cleaving peptide sequence) fused with mCherry to report transfection efficiency (Fig. S1A). The crRNA is contained on a second U6-promoter–containing vector, which is cotransfected along with the fusion protein (Fig. S1A). After transfection of the editing systems into 293T cells, mCherry fluorescence was detected and transfection efficiency was estimated as 62% (Fig. S1, B–E). Importantly, transfection of dCas13a-METTL3 or dCas13a-FTO did neither substantially alter the cell cycle nor increase the proportion of dead cells (Fig. S1, F–H), indicating the transgenes were not inducing cellular toxicity. Together, these vectors make up an m6A-editing system that can be targeted by the crRNA to a specific transcript. To explore the activity of the dCas13a fusions, we initially constructed a reporter system to indirectly measure the m6A levels of a specific RNA. To this end, we exploited the ability of m6A to promote protein translation efficiency from circular RNAs in human cells (72Liang D. Wilusz J.E. Short intronic repeat sequences facilitate circular RNA production.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2233-2247Google Scholar, 73Wang Y. Wang Z.

Zhang Y. et al.Extensive translation of circular RNAs driven by N(6)-methyladenosine.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 626-641Google Scholar). To determine if our system can modify specific m6A sites on RNA, we generated a circular RNA expression system to serve as an indirect readout of m6A (Fig. S2A) (72Liang D. Wilusz J.E. Short intronic repeat sequences facilitate circular RNA production.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2233-2247Google Scholar, 74Yang Y. Fan X. Mao M. Song X. Wu P. Zhang Y. et al.Extensive translation of circular RNAs driven by N(6)-methyladenosine.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 626-641Google Scholar). We generated an artificial circular RNA expression system where the coding sequence of GFP was separated linearly into two parts between an IRES (internal ribosome entry site) to form an “FP-IRES-(ATG)G” linear sequence that would back-splice to form a complete circular IRES-GFP coding sequence (Fig. S2A). Based on several reports (4Meyer K.D. Saletore Y. Zumbo P. Elemento O. Mason C.E. Jaffrey S.R.

Hence, we generated a series of reporters that include 2, 1, and 0 GGACU sequences or no A nucleotides (Fig. S2C). In the endogenous METTL3–METTL14 complex, METTL14 targets METTL3 to DRACH motifs (4Meyer K.D. Saletore Y. Zumbo P. Elemento O. Mason C.E. Jaffrey S.R. Comprehensive analysis of mRNA methylation reveals enrichment in 3' UTRs and near stop codons.Cell. 2012; 149: 1635-1646Google Scholar, 5Dominissini D. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Schwartz S.

Consequently, we used the no DRACH (low levels of translation) and the 2-DRACH (high levels of translation) circular reporters as an indirect readout for changes in m6A levels (Fig. S2, B and C). Several sites were selected as targets for a crRNA, including locations just outside the IRES region, and before or after the start codon (defined as position 1) of the GFP. crRNAs were constructed targeting specific sequences (Fig. S2D and Table S1). We then cotransfected a crRNA with dCas13a-METTL3 with the no-DRACH reporter. In a separate experiment, we used dCas13a-FTO cotransfected w"

https://openalex.org/W4297242186,"Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins are encoded by phages to inactivate CRISPR-Cas systems of bacteria and archaea and are used to enhance the CRISPR toolbox for genome editing. Here we report the structure and mechanism of AcrIF24, an Acr protein that inhibits the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AcrIF24 is a homodimer that associates with two copies of the surveillance complex (Csy) and prevents the hybridization between CRISPR RNA and target DNA. Furthermore, AcrIF24 functions as an anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca) protein to repress the transcription of the acrIF23-acrIF24 operon. Alone or in complex with Csy, AcrIF24 is capable of binding to the acrIF23-acrIF24 promoter DNA with nanomolar affinity. The structure of a Csy-AcrIF24-promoter DNA complex at 2.7 Å reveals the mechanism for transcriptional suppression. Our results reveal that AcrIF24 functions as an Acr-Aca fusion protein, and they extend understanding of the diverse mechanisms used by Acr proteins."

A risk-adjusted analysis of in-hospital outcomes was performed between the pre-pandemic and pandemic cohort. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing COVID-19 positive vs. negative patients during the pandemic.There was a 15.2% reduction in overall PCI volume from the pre-pandemic (n = 25,737) to the pandemic cohort (n = 21,822), which was more pronounced for stable angina and non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS) presentations, and between February and May 2020. Patients in the two cohorts had similar clinical and procedural characteristics. Monthly mortality rates for primary PCI were generally higher in the pandemic period. There were no significant system delays in care between the cohorts. Risk-adjusted mortality was higher in the pandemic cohort (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07-1.47, p = 0.005), a finding that was only partially explained by worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients and was more pronounced in subjects with ACS. During the pandemic, COVID-19 positive patients suffered higher risk-adjusted mortality (aOR 5.69, 95% CI 2.54-12.74, p<0.001) compared with COVID negative patients.During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a reduction in PCI volumes and higher risk-adjusted mortality.

https://openalex.org/W4297259960,"Current diagnostic methods for wooden breast and white striping, common breast muscle myopathies of modern commercial broiler chickens, rely on subjective examinations of the pectoralis major muscle, time-consuming microscopy, or expensive imaging technologies. Further research on these disorders would benefit from more quantitative and objective measures of disease severity that can be used in live birds. To this end, we utilized untargeted metabolomics alongside two statistical approaches to evaluate plasma metabolites associated with wooden breast and white striping in 250 male commercial broiler chickens. First, mixed linear modeling was employed to identify metabolites with a significant association with these muscle disorders and found 98 metabolites associated with wooden breast and 44 metabolites associated with white striping (q-value &lt; 0.05). Second, a support vector machine was constructed using stepwise feature selection to determine the smallest subset of metabolites with the highest categorization accuracy for wooden breast. The final support vector machine achieved 94% accuracy using only 6 metabolites. The metabolite 3-methylhistidine, which is often used as an index of myofibrillar breakdown in skeletal muscle, was the top metabolite for both wooden breast and white striping in our mixed linear model and was also the metabolite with highest marginal prediction accuracy (82%) for wooden breast in our support vector machine. Overall, this study identified a candidate set of metabolites for an objective measure of wooden breast or white striping severity in live birds and expanded our understanding of these muscle disorders."

This paper refers to a novel method as short and safe Q-learning to alleviate the short and safe path planning task of mobile robots. To solve the slow convergence of Q-learning, the artificial potential field is utilized to avoid random exploration and provides a priori knowledge of the environment for mobile robots. Furthermore, to speed up the convergence of the Q-learning and reduce the computing time, a dynamic reward is proposed to facilitate the mobile robot towards the target point. The experiments are divided into two parts: short and safe path planning. The mobile robot can reach the target with the optimal path length in short path planning, and away from obstacles in safe path planning. Experiments compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach. Concluded, the path length, computing time and turning angle of SSQL is increased by 2.83%, 23.98% and 7.98% in short path planning, 3.64%, 23.42% and 12.61% in safe path planning compared with classical Q-learning. Furthermore, the SSQL outperforms other optimization algorithms with shorter path length and smaller turning angles."

However, its intrinsic function that is independent of interaction with CX3CR1 remains to be fully understood. We demonstrate that the intracellular domain of CX3CL1 (CX3CL1-ICD), generated upon sequential cleavages by α-/β-secretase and γ-secretase, initiates a back signaling activity, which mediates direct signal transmission to gene expression in the nucleus. To study this, we fused a synthetic peptide derived from CX3CL1-ICD, named Tet34, with a 13-amino acid tetanus sequence at the N terminus to facilitate translocation into neuronal cells. We show that treatment of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2A cells with Tet34, but not its scrambled control (Tet34s), induced cell proliferation, as manifested by changes in protein levels of transcription factors and progrowth molecules cyclin D1, PCNA, Sox5, and Cdk2. Further biochemical assays reveal elevation of phosphorylated insulin receptor β subunit, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor β subunit, and insulin receptor substrates as well as activation of proliferation-linked kinase AKT. In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing membrane-anchored C-terminal CX3CL1 also exhibited activation of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor signaling. Remarkably, we found that this Tet34 peptide, but not Tet34s, protected against endoplasmic reticulum stress and cellular apoptosis when Neuro-2A cells were challenged with toxic oligomers of β-amyloid peptide or hydrogen peroxide. Taken together, our results suggest that CX3CL1-ICD may have translational potential for neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s disease and for disorders resulting from insulin resistance.

The type-1 transmembrane chemokine CX3CL1, also known as fractalkine, is known to exert its signaling function by binding to its cognate receptor CX3CR1 (1Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W.

In the brain, CX3CL1 is largely expressed by neurons, whereas its receptor CX3CR1 is predominantly expressed by microglia (3Hatori K. Nagai A. Heisel R. Ryu J.K. Kim S.U. Fractalkine and fractalkine receptors in human neurons and glial cells.J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); this ligand–receptor interaction in the brain triggers neuron–microglia crosstalk by altering neuroinflammatory responses and causing neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects depending on various neurological diseases (4Finneran D.J. Nash K.R. Neuroinflammation and fractalkine signaling in Alzheimer's disease.J. Neuroinflammation. 2019; 16: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Limatola C. Ransohoff R.M. Modulating neurotoxicity through CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 229Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, we have revealed an intrinsic back-signaling activity of CX3CL1, resulting from its intracellular domain (CX3CL1-ICD), which is generated after sequential cleavage of membrane-bound CX3CL1 by α-, β-, and γ-secretases. Like Notch intracellular domain, CX3CL1-ICD can also translocate into the cell nucleus to alter expression of many genes (6Fan Q. Gayen M. Singh N. Gao F. He W. Hu X. et al.The intracellular domain of CX3CL1 regulates adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's amyloid pathology.J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This signaling event is independent of CX3CL1–CX3CR1 interactions and has its own signaling properties. When transgenic mice overexpress the C terminus of CX3CL1 in neurons (Tg-CX3CL1-ct mice), enhanced neurogenesis in both the subventricular and subgranular zones (SGZs) is observed (7Benoit M.R. Gayen M. Yan R. CX3CL1 intracellular domain and adult neurogenesis.Aging (Albany NY). 2019; 11: 10783-10785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Importantly, this enhanced neurogenesis mitigates neuronal loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mice such as 5xFAD mice, which exhibit neurodegeneration because of excessive amyloid deposition resulting from overexpressed mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 (6Fan Q. Gayen M. Singh N. Gao F. He W. Hu X. et al.The intracellular domain of CX3CL1 regulates adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's amyloid pathology.J. Exp.

Anticholinergics boost the pathological process of neurodegeneration with increased inflammation in a tauopathy mouse model.Neurobiol. Dis. 2012; 45: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). While this observation is intriguing, how C-terminal CX3CL1 exerts its effects on neuroprotection in these two AD mouse models remains to be fully understood. Here, we asked whether a peptide derived from CX3CL1-ICD would be sufficient to enhance signaling functions and to have a translational potential by utilizing cultured cells. To address these unmet questions, we first designed a synthetic peptide, named Tet34, which was tagged with a 13-amino acid tetanus sequence at the N terminus to facilitate its specific binding to GT1b ganglioside receptors, which are expressed on the surface of neuronal cells (11Liu J.K. Teng Q. Garrity-Moses M. Federici T. Tanase D. Imperiale M.J. et al.A novel peptide defined through phage display for therapeutic protein and vector neuronal targeting.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 19: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We found that this Tet34 peptide was effectively uptaken by neuroblastoma Neuro-2A (N2A) cells and primary hippocampal neurons and that it entered the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. Remarkably, N2A cells treated with Tet34 showed activation of not only the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway as described previously but also the insulin receptor β (InsRβ) and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1β signaling pathways. In addition, we examined downstream signaling molecules in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathways and found significantly elevated phosphorylation of Foxo-3. Foxo proteins, a subgroup of the Forkhead family of transcription factors characterized by a conserved forkhead helix loop DNA-binding domain (FOX), have diverse cellular functions and are known to have roles in stress, aging, apoptosis, and cell-cycle regulation (12Calissi G. Lam E.W. Link W. Therapeutic strategies targeting FOXO transcription factors.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2021; 20: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Webb A.E. Brunet A. FOXO transcription factors: key regulators of cellular quality control.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 14Zanella F. Link W. Carnero A. Understanding FOXO, new views on old transcription factors.Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2010; 10: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We indeed observed suppression of apoptotic marker proteins as well as upregulation of multiple cellular proliferation markers, consistent with the observed cell proliferation in N2A cells treated with Tet34. The activation of insulin/IGF-1/Foxo signaling was further validated in Tg-CX3CL1-ct/tTA mice, in which transgene was induced in the early adult stage. Thus, our studies demonstrate that the synthetic peptide retains the inherent signaling induction properties of CX3CL1-ICD. This small peptide should be further explored for therapeutic application to counteract neuronal loss in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A synthetic peptide was designed from the sequence of CX3CL1-ICD and fused with a 13-amino acid Tet sequence derived from tetanus toxin at the N terminus to improve its specific uptake by neurons and neural stem cells (NSCs; Fig. 1A, illustration of peptide sequences). This peptide, named as Tet34, and the control peptide, Tet34s, which has the scramble order of sequence within the CX3CL1-ICD region, were tested for their ability to penetrate into neuronal cells. Since CX3CL1 C-terminal antibody would only recognize Tet34 but not Tet34s, a batch of these peptides were also tagged with Alexa 488 (Alexa488-Tet34 or Alexa488-Tet34s) for monitoring neuronal cell uptake. We showed that Alexa488-Tet34 was more effective in penetration into mouse neuroblastomas N2A cells than Alexa488-Tet34s at concentrations of 125 nM to 200 nM (Fig. 1B). During the monition between 12 and 72 h, clear uptake of Alexa488-Tet34 was seen at 24 h and peaked around 48 h. We also examined uptake of Alexa488-Tet34 in primary neurons cultured from E16.5 mouse hippocampus at varying concentrations and time points. Alexa488-Tet34 and Alexa488-Tet34s were added at concentrations of 50, 500, and 1000 nM at 7 days in vitro (DIV) to primary neuron cultures. After treatment for 12 and 24 h, cells were fixed and stained with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). Alexa488-Tet34 signal was robustly detected in neuronal cell bodies after 12 h at a concentration of 1000 nM (Fig. 1C). At the same concentration, Alexa488-Tet34s was not easily detected, suggesting that the sequence of CX3CL1-ICD facilities the uptake of Tet34, although slightly different uptake kinetics between primary hippocampal neurons and N2A cells. To determine if Alexa488-Tet34 uptake was specific to neurons, we waited until 12 DIV without treatment of AraC to allow proliferation of glial cells. After treatment for 12 h, we began to observe uptake of Alexa488-Tet34 by MAP2-marked neuron, but much less by astrocytes, labeled by GPAP antibody or Iba1-labeled microglia or Olig1-labeled oligodendrocytes (Fig. S1). Again, uptake of Alexa488-Tet34s by neurons or astrocytes was weak. We could not exclude the possibility that a fraction of Alexa488 peptides were phagocytosed and degraded by glial cells. Based on our observations, we conclude that peptide Alexa488-Tet34 is primarily uptaken by neurons. The CX3CL1-ICD sequence appears to facilitate cellular and nuclear uptake when comparing the neuronal uptake by Alexa488-Tet34 and Alexa488-Tet34s. During the cellular assay, we noted that N2A cells, when treated with Alexa488-Tet34, grew more densely. Therefore, N2A cells were treated with nonfluorescent Tet34 peptides at the concentrations of 1 μM for 12, 24, and 36 h to monitor cell proliferation by EdU incorporation assay. Cells treated with Tet34 had significantly increased EdU incorporation at 24 and 36 h compared with untreated controls or Tet34s-treated cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that Tet34 likely has a role in upregulation of cellular proliferation. To determine how Tet34 upregulates cell proliferation, we first examined whether this fusion Tet34 peptide retains the activity of inducing TGFβ signaling, similar to the expression of CX3CL1-ct in mice (6Fan Q. Gayen M. Singh N. Gao F. He W. Hu X. et al.The intracellular domain of CX3CL1 regulates adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's amyloid pathology.J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of N2A cells with 2 μM of Tet34 for 24 and 48 h significantly increased TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 expression, whereas TGFβ1 levels were elevated only at 48 h, as compared with Tet34s treatment (Fig. S2, A and B), indicating that Tet34 has a desired signaling activity. Elevated TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 expression induced a significant increase in phosphorylated Smad1 and Smad2 levels at 48 h but not total Smad expression levels (Fig. S2, A and B). Thus, we demonstrated that fusion of Tet sequence to CX3CL1-ICD retains the activation of the TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway. Our further biochemical exploration revealed that Tet34 treatment of N2A cells significantly upregulated expression of InsRβ subunit, which is phosphorylated when activated by insulin (15Akhtar A. Sah S.P. Insulin signaling pathway and related molecules: role in neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease.Neurochem. Int. 2020; 135104707Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Saltiel A.R. Insulin signaling in health and disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131e142241Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17van der Heide L.P. Ramakers G.M. Smidt M.P. Insulin signaling in the central nervous system: learning to survive.Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 79: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), when compared with Tet34s or mock treatment (Fig. 2A). A corresponding increase in the level of phosphorylated InsRβ was more evident. This increase of phosphorylated InsRβ likely induced activation of its downstream molecules insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 (IRS1 and IRS2; Fig. 2A); the increase was visibly more at the 48 h treatment. Phosphorylated IRS1 was significantly increased and confirmed by quantification (Fig. 2B). We also noted an increase in the levels of insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), detected by the antibody specific to the β-subunit (IGF-1Rβ). Levels of pIGF-1Rβ were notably increased as well (Fig. 2, A and B). We then further examined downstream molecules and detected activation of PDK1 and Akt, as demonstrated by an increase in their phosphorylated levels but not total PDK1 or Akt (Fig. 2, A and B). Akt phosphorylation is known to be one of the key regulators of Forkhead transcription factors (Foxos) (13Webb A.E. Brunet A. FOXO transcription factors: key regulators of cellular quality control.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The activities of Foxos are dependent upon their subcellular localization and phosphorylation status. Nuclear Foxos actively bind to their transcriptional targets, whereas phosphorylated Foxos are shuttled out into cytoplasm, where they undergo either dephosphorylation or degradation (18Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. The ins and outs of FoxO shuttling: mechanisms of FoxO translocation and transcriptional regulation.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 19Vogt P.K. Jiang H. Aoki M. Triple layer control: phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination of FOXO proteins.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Tet34 treatment led to a significant increase in phosphorylation of Foxo3 with no changes in total Foxo3 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Phosphorylation of Foxo1 was moderate but significantly increased as well, indicating downregulation of Foxo1 and Foxo3 activity. We also repeated the same set of experiment by including pharmacological inhibition of Akt activation with compound MK2206 (20Iida M. Brand T.M. Campbell D.A. Starr M.M. Luthar N. Traynor A.M. et al.Targeting AKT with the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in non-small cell lung cancer cells with acquired resistance to cetuximab.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2013; 14: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in order to probe the effect of Akt activation on Foxo activity in N2A cells, which were treated with 2 μM of Tet34 or Tet-34s for 24 h. It appeared that inhibition of Akt phosphorylation would diminish phosphorylation of GSK3β and Foxo3 (Fig. S3), indicating a critical role of Akt activity in the Akt/Foxo pathway. Tg-CX3CL1-ct were generated by utilizing the tetracycline-inducible promoter as described previously (6Fan Q. Gayen M. Singh N. Gao F. He W. Hu X. et al.The intracellular domain of CX3CL1 regulates adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's amyloid pathology.J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This previous study in this model focused on developmental neurogenesis; increased neuron numbers in hippocampal and cortical regions have been demonstrated. To determine whether expression of CX3CL1-ct transgene in adult Tg-CX3CL1-ct/tTA mice would have insulin/IGF-1 signaling functions, we first treated Tg-CX3CL1-ct/tTA mice and their control litters with doxycycline in the drinking water, starting from the mating stage to suppress transgene expression, and doxycycline was removed at the age of postnatal day 45 to turn on CX3CL1-ct expression. After 1 month of induced expression, mice were sacrificed and protein lysates were prepared from hippocampi for Western blot examination. Since CX3CL1-ct has a hemagglutinin (HA) tag on its C terminus, HA expression was observed only in Tg-CX3CL1-ct/tTA mice. When compared with nontransgene-expressing littermates (WT/CX3CL1-ct, CamKII-tTA mice), we found that induced expression of CX3CL1-ct elevated protein levels of both IGF-1Rβ and InsRβ signaling molecules (Fig. 3A). Increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor was the most prominent, whereas the increase of pIGF-1Rβ was also visible (Fig. 3A). These increases were further confirmed by quantification (Fig. 3B). Their downstream signaling molecules were also examined by the Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 3A, total IRS1 and IRS2 levels were visibly elevated, as was phosphorylated IRS1 levels. While total PDK1 levels were slightly elevated, phosphorylated PDK1 increased significantly (Fig. 3A), indicating a strong activation of PDK1 (quantified in Fig. 3B). While total Akt levels were not changed, elevation in Akt phosphorylation was significant. Activity of the transcription factors Foxo1 and Foxo3 was both repressed, as the levels of both phosphorylated Foxo1 (pFoxo1) and phosphorylated Foxo3 (pFoxo3) were significantly increased with no changes in total Foxo1 and Foxo3 levels (Fig. 3, A and B). Together, these results support that CX3CL1-ICD has a role in the activation of both IGF-1Rβ and InsRβ signaling. Insulin/IGF signaling in brains, specifically in hippocampus, has been shown to regulate spatial learning and memory (21Soto M. Cai W. Konishi M. Kahn C.R. Insulin signaling in the hippocampus and amygdala regulates metabolism and neurobehavior.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and this activation may partially explain the improved cognitive functions seen in AD mice (PS19 mice) upon overexpressing CX3CL1-ICD (9Fan Q. He W. Gayen M. Benoit M.R. Luo X. Hu X. et al.Activated CX3CL1/Smad2 signals prevent neuronal loss and Alzheimer's tau pathology-mediated cognitive dysfunction.J. Neurosci. 2020; 40: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since Foxo proteins are known to regulate cellular proliferation (22Link W. Introduction to FOXO biology.Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1890: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Monsalve M. Olmos Y. The complex biology of FOXO.Curr. Drug Targets. 2011; 12: 1322-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we examined protein levels of transcription factors that control neuronal proliferation in Tg-CX3CL1-ct/tTA mice. We found that proteins important for cell-cycle progression, such as cyclin D1, Cdk2, and PCNA, were significantly elevated (Fig. 4, A and B). This corroborates our previous findings of Tg-CX3CL1-ct/tTA mice exhibiting enhanced neuronal proliferation and maturation in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus (6Fan Q. Gayen M. Singh N. Gao F. He W.

Neurosci. 2020; 40: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our previous bulk RNA-Seq results showed elevation of Sox2 and Sox5, and we indeed observed elevation of these two protein levels including phosphorylated Sox2 in the aforementioned lysates (Fig. 4C). Sox5 is a protein known to control cell cycle progression (24Martinez-Morales P.L. Quiroga A.C. Barbas J.A. Morales A.V. SOX5 controls cell cycle progression in neural progenitors by interfering with the WNT-beta-catenin pathway.EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas Sox2 activation is known to play a critical role in the maintenance and differentiation of NSCs (25Amador-Arjona A. Cimadamore F. Huang C.T. Wright R. Lewis S. Gage F.H. et al.SOX2 primes the epigenetic landscape in neural precursors enabling proper gene activation during hippocampal neurogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: E1936-E1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sox9 expression was significantly increased, whereas expression of Sox8 was moderately elevated (Fig. 4, C and D); Sox9 is shown to promote both basal progenitor proliferation and gliogenesis in developing neocortex (26Güven A. Kalebic N. Long K.R. Florio M. Vaid S. Brandl H. et al.Extracellular matrix-inducing Sox9 promotes both basal progenitor proliferation and gliogenesis in developing neocortex.Elife. 2020; 9e49808Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In our cellular assays, we showed that the levels of Sox2 and phosphorylated Sox2, Sox5, Sox8, and Sox9 were elevated even after 24 h treatment in N2A cells (Fig. 4, E and F). Unlike results in Tg-CX3CL1-ct/tTA mice, elevation of PCNA levels was the most obvious, whereas Cdk2, cyclin D1 levels were significantly increased. Together, these results show that Tet34 treatment has a potent signaling activity, which promotes cellular proliferation, in addition to neural differentiation. Foxos are known to be regulators of apoptotic signaling pathways in response to stress (13Webb A.E. Brunet A. FOXO transcription factors: key regulators of cellular quality control.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 27Eijkelenboom A. Burgering B.M. FOXOs: signalling integrators for homeostasis maintenance.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). N2Acells treated with Tet34 or Tet34s in 2% serum conditions were assayed for the expression of proapoptotic marker proteins, such as p53, Bax, and Bim; these three genes are transcriptionally regulated by Foxos (28Lu H. Huang H. FOXO1: a potential target for human diseases.Curr. Drug Targets. 2011; 12: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We showed that Tet34 treatment significantly reduced expression of these apoptotic markers in comparison to scrambled Tet34s treatment or mock-treated cells (Fig. 5, A and B). We showed that while the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 were significantly reduced (Fig. 5, A and B), consistent with the report that p21 and p27 are transcriptionally regulated by Foxos (28Lu H. Huang H. FOXO1: a potential target for human diseases.Curr. Drug Targets. 2011; 12: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Significant reduction of these molecules indicates a reduction in cellular apoptosis. Reduction of neuronal apoptosis is intriguing. SGZ of dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ) are active neurogenic niches in the murine brain. Majority of the newborn cells in the SGZ and SVZ undergoes apoptosis in different stages of neuronal differentiation and maturation into neurons (29Ryu J.R. Hong C.J. Kim J.Y. Kim E.K. Sun W. Yu S.W. Control of adult neurogenesis by programmed cell death in the mammalian brain.Mol. Brain. 2016; 9: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In line with our previous findings of enhanced neurogenesis (NeuN-positive cells) in the SGZ and SVZ of Tg-CX3CL1-tTA, we found reduction of apoptotic markers in Tg-CX3CL1-tTA mouse hippocampi (Fig. S4). Hence, CX3CL1-ICD may also promote neuronal survival by attenuating apoptosis. A previous study showed that Aβ treatment of N2A cells induces cellular stress and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (30Iatrou A. Clark E.M. Wang Y. Nuclear dynamics and stress responses in Alzheimer's disease.Mol. Neurodegener. 2021; 16: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Manzoni C. Colombo L. Bigini P. Diana V. Cagnotto A. Messa M. et al.The molecular assembly of amyloid aβ controls its neurotoxicity and binding to cellular proteins.PLoS One. 2011; 6e24909Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether CX3CL1-ICD would exert a neuroprotective effect, we addressed this question in cultured N2A cells. N2A cells were treated with 2 μM of Tet34 and Tet34s for 24 h in 2% serum conditions prior to incubation with 1 μM of oligomeric Aβ1–42 (briefed as Aβ thereafter) for 12 h. We showed that Akt protein levels, and its kinase activity, were decreased by Aβ treatment. Correspondingly, less phosphorylation of its substrate, Foxo3, was detected (Fig. 6A). N2A cells treated with Tet34 along with Aβ showed clear resilience to Aβ-mediated reduction of pAkt and pFoxo3 levels, which were confirmed by quantification (Fig. 6B). We also noted that Aβ treatment of N2A cells predominantly activated p53, Bad, and Bim, which were elevated when comparing with and without Aβ treatment in N2A cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Changes in Bax were less obvious. Tet34-treated N2A cells appeared to protect cellular apoptosis as levels of p53, Bad, and Bim were significantly lowered when comparing with Tet34s or mock-treated conditions with or without Aβ challenges. Relatively, Tet34 had less of an attenuating effect on Aβ-mediated Bax activation (p = 0.0437) (Fig. 6, C and D). Reduction of cytochrome c release by Tet34 treatment was substantial when comparing Tet34 treated with two control groups (Fig. 6, C and D); Aβ induced increase in cytochrome c release, and this toxic effect was clearly mitigated. These results are in line with the antiapoptotic effects exerted by Tet34. We further confirmed the antiapoptotic effects of Tet34 peptides on N2A cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. Tet34 attenuated the upregulation of various apoptotic markers in both 2% serum conditions as well as in hydrogen peroxide–treated groups (Figs. S5 and S6). In addition, Aβ is known to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in neurons (32Querfurth H. Lee H.K. Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes in neurodegeneration.Mol. Neurodegener. 2021; 16: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether Aβ treatment in N2A cells would also induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and be protected by Tet34 treatment. We found significant increase in the levels of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α, and activating transcription factor 4 proteins in cells treated with Aβ (Fig. 6, E and F). The expression of these markers was lessened by Tet34 treatment in N2A cells. The 2% serum growth condition by itself also induces low level of stress, and such a low level of stress could also be alleviated by Tet34 treatment. Thus, these results demonstrate that Tet34 exerts protective effects against Aβ-mediated cellular stress and apoptosis. With the increase in median life expectancy, the onset of age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases has become more prevalent, which has resulted in one of the major social and economic burdens in modern society (33Guo T.

We have recently found that proteins incubated with oxidized vitamin C (dehydroascorbate) gain a new function as a histone-binding ligand. This finding led us to predict that antioxidants, through conversion to their oxidized forms, may generally have similar functions. In the present study, we identified several natural polyphenols as a source of histone ligands and characterized the mechanism for the interaction of protein-bound polyphenols with histone. Through screening of 25 plant-derived polyphenols by assessing their ability to convert bovine serum albumin into histone ligands, we identified seven polyphenols, including (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG). Additionally, we found that the histone tail domain, which is a highly charged and conformationally flexible region, is involved in the interaction with the polyphenol-modified proteins. Further mechanistic studies showed the involvement of a complex heterogeneous group of the polyphenol-derived compounds bound to proteins as histone-binding elements. We also determined that the interaction of polyphenol-modified proteins with histones formed aggregates and exerted a protective effect against histone-mediated cytotoxicity toward endothelial cells. These findings demonstrated that histones are one of the major targets of polyphenol-modified proteins and provide important insights into the chemoprotective functions of dietary polyphenols."

https://openalex.org/W4297254410,"Gut microbiota regulate physiological functions in various hosts, such as energy metabolism and immunity. Lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus plantarum, have a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid saturation metabolism that generates multiple fatty acid species, such as hydroxy fatty acids, oxo fatty acids, conjugated fatty acids, and trans-fatty acids. How these bacterial metabolites impact host physiology is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the ligand activity of lactic acid bacteria-produced fatty acids in relation to nuclear hormone receptors expressed in the small intestine. Our reporter assays revealed two bacterial metabolites of γ-linolenic acid (GLA), 13-hydroxy-cis-6,cis-9-octadecadienoic acid (γHYD), and 13-oxo-cis-6,cis-9-octadecadienoic acid (γKetoD) activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) more potently than GLA. We demonstrate that both γHYD and γKetoD bound directly to the ligand-binding domain of human PPARδ. A docking simulation indicated that four polar residues (T289, H323, H449, and Y473) of PPARδ donate hydrogen bonds to these fatty acids. Interestingly, T289 does not donate a hydrogen bond to GLA, suggesting that bacterial modification of GLA introducing hydroxy and oxo group determines ligand selectivity. In human intestinal organoids, we determined γHYD and γKetoD increased the expression of PPARδ target genes, enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation, and reduced intracellular triglyceride accumulation. These findings suggest that γHYD and γKetoD, which gut lactic acid bacteria could generate, are naturally occurring PPARδ ligands in the intestinal tract and may improve lipid metabolism in the human intestine."

ATP11A and ATP11C, type IV P-Type ATPases in plasma membranes, flip PtdSer from the outer to the inner leaflet, but involvement of other P4-ATPases is unclear. We herein demonstrated that once PtdSer was exposed on the cell surface of ATP11A−/−ATP11C−/− mouse T cell line (W3), its internalization to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes was negligible at 15 °C.

In addition to ATP11A and 11C, W3 cells expressed ATP8A1, 8B2, 8B4, 9A, 9B, and 11B, with ATP8A1 and ATP11B being present at recycling endosomes. Cells deficient in four P4-ATPases (ATP8A1, 11A, 11B, and 11C) (QKO) did not constitutively expose PtdSer on the cell surface but lost the ability to re-establish PtdSer asymmetry within 1 hour, even at 37 °C. The expression of ATP11A or ATP11C conferred QKO cells with the ability to rapidly re-establish PtdSer asymmetry at 15 °C and 37 °C, while cells expressing ATP8A1 or ATP11B required a temperature of 37 °C to achieve this function, and a dynamin inhibitor blocked this process. These results revealed that mammalian cells are equipped with two independent mechanisms to re-establish its asymmetry: the first is a rapid process involving plasma membrane flippases, ATP11A and ATP11C, while the other is mediated by ATP8A1 and ATP11B, which require an endocytosis process.

Major glycerophospholipids in the plasma membranes of mammalian cells are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), and phosphatidic acid (1Harayama T.

Phospholipid subcellular localization and dynamics.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 6230-6240Google Scholar). In addition, sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol are abundantly present in the plasma membrane. These lipids are asymmetrically distributed between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membranes. PtdSer, PtdEtn, and phosphatidylinositol are confined to the inner leaflet, whereas PtdCho and SM are enriched in the outer leaflet (3van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W.

The distribution of phospholipids in the lipid bilayer is regulated by flippases and scramblases (9Nagata S. Sakuragi T. Segawa K. Flippase and scramblase for phosphatidylserine exposure.Curr. Opin.

Acta. 2016; 1861: 767-783Google Scholar). Flippases translocate phospholipids from the outer to the cytoplasmic side of the lipid bilayer in an ATP-dependent manner, while scramblases bi-directionally pass phospholipids across the membrane in an energy-independent manner. Members of the transmembrane (TMEM)16 and XK-related family function as Ca2+- and caspase-activated scramblases, respectively (18Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S.

Xk-related protein 8 and CED-8 promote phosphatidylserine exposure in apoptotic cells.Science. 2013; 341: 403-406Google Scholar). Type IV P-type (P4-) ATPases have been proposed to function as flippases (20Andersen J.P. Vestergaard A.L. Mikkelsen S.A. Mogensen L.S. Chalat M. Molday R.S.

Biochem. 2011; 149: 131-143Google Scholar). They carry 10 transmembrane segments and a large cytoplasmic ATPase domain. There are 14 and 15 members for human and mouse P4-ATPases, respectively, that localize at the plasma membrane, endosomes, Golgi, and lysosomes. Most of them require CDC50A as an essential subunit for their correct folding and exit from the ER. Six human P4-ATPases (ATP8A1, 8A2, 8B1, 11A, 11B, and 11C) were previously shown to exhibit PtdSer-dependent ATPase activity with purified proteins or flippase activity using a proteoliposome system (22Lee S.

We and others demonstrated using cell-based assays that ATP8A2, 11A, and 11C localized at the plasma membrane and exhibited the ability to flip PtdSer (26Segawa K. Kurata S. Nagata S.

Takatsu H. et al.The N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of P4-ATPases determine their cellular localization.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2020; 31: 2115-2124Google Scholar), it currently remains unclear whether these intracellular P4-ATPases contribute to the asymmetrical distribution of PtdSer at the plasma membrane. ATP11A and ATP11C are ubiquitously expressed in various cell types, while the expression of ATP8A2 is limited to the brain or testis (23Wang J. Molday L.L. Hii T. Coleman J.A. Wen T. Andersen J.P. et al.Proteomic analysis and functional Characterization of P4-ATPase phospholipid flippases from Murine tissues.Sci. Rep. 2018; 810795Google Scholar, 26Segawa K. Kurata S. Nagata S. Human type IV P-type ATPases that work as plasma membrane phospholipid flippases and their regulation by caspase and calcium.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 762-772Google Scholar). We previously reported that flippase activity at the plasma membrane of the ATP11A−/−ATP11C−/− double flippase-deficient (DKO) mouse W3 cell line was negligible (30Segawa K. Yanagihashi Y. Yamada K. Suzuki C. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Phospholipid flippases enable precursor B cells to flee engulfment by macrophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115: 12212-12217Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that after the transient exposure of PtdSer, DKO cells re-established the asymmetrical distribution of PtdSer at the plasma membrane at 37 °C, but not at 15 °C. This re-establishment activity at 37 °C was compromised by a dynamin inhibitor that blocked a clathrin-mediated endocytosis and membrane trafficking (31McCluskey A. Daniel J.A. Hadzic G. Chau N. Clayton E.L. Mariana A. et al.Building a better dynasore: the dyngo compounds potently inhibit dynamin and endocytosis.Traffic. 2013; 14: 1272-1289Google Scholar). When the ATP8A1 and ATP11B genes were additionally deleted, ATP8A1−/−ATP11A−/−ATP11B−/−ATP11C−/− quadruple- deficient (QKO) cells lost the ability to re-establish PtdSer asymmetry at the plasma membrane. PtdSer asymmetry was rapidly re-established in QKO cells expressing ATP11A or ATP11C, but slowly and in a temperature-dependent manner in QKO cells expressing ATP8A1 or ATP11B, and that was blocked by a dynamin inhibitor. QKO cells eventually, or within 12 h, regained plasma membrane PtdSer asymmetry at 37 °C following its exposure. This observation suggests that progression through the cell cycle allows the PtdSer asymmetry re-establishment by an unknown process that is independent of the four flippases. Accordingly, QKO cells under steady-state conditions maintained the PtdSer asymmetry in the plasma membrane. Based on these results, we concluded that mammalian cells are equipped with two types of PtdSer flippases located at the plasma membrane or endosomes that repair PtdSer asymmetry in the plasma membrane after its transient exposure. We previously reported that W3 cells, a mouse T-lymphoma cell line, expressed eight P4-ATPases (ATP8A1, 8B2, 8B4, 9A, 9B, 11A, 11B, and 11C) (32Segawa K. Kurata S. Yanagihashi Y. Brummelkamp T.R. Matsuda F. Nagata S. Caspase-mediated cleavage of phospholipid flippase for apoptotic phosphatidylserine exposure.Science. 2014; 344: 1164-1168Google Scholar), while ATP11A-ATP11C DKO cells lost PtdSer flippase activity at the plasma membrane (26Segawa K. Kurata S. Nagata S. Human type IV P-type ATPases that work as plasma membrane phospholipid flippases and their regulation by caspase and calcium.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 762-772Google Scholar, 30Segawa K. Yanagihashi Y. Yamada K. Suzuki C. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Phospholipid flippases enable precursor B cells to flee engulfment by macrophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2018; 115: 12212-12217Google Scholar). Plasma membrane flippases can be assessed using the fluorescent-labeled PtdSer analog, 1-oleoyl-2-{6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl}-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (NBD-PS) (see Experimental procedures). We initially investigated the time course and effects of temperature on flippase activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, WT-W3 cells efficiently flipped NBD-PS into the inner leaflet at 15 °C, and its median fluorescence intensity (MFI) increased at least for 6 min. PtdSer-flipping kinetics were accelerated at 37 °C, reaching a plateau by 3 min. In contrast, a time-dependent increase in MFI was not observed in DKO cells at 15 °C or 37 °C, indicating that PtdSer flippase activity on the cell surface of DKO cells was negligible. We then examined endogenous PtdSer distribution on the cell surface with annexin V, a PtdSer-binding protein, and found that they did not expose PtdSer despite the loss of PtdSer flippase activity (Fig. 1B). By contrast, when W3 and DKO cells were treated with a calcium ionophore A23187, they exposed PtdSer on the cell surface within 5 min through the activation of the calcium-dependent scramblase, TMEM16F (18Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Google Scholar). This result indicated that the asymmetrical distribution of PtdSer on the cell surface was established without plasma membrane flippases or was mediated by intracellular mechanisms. We then investigated the process to re-establish the asymmetrical distribution of endogenous PtdSer after the transient exposure of PtdSer caused by A23187 treatment. Once the ionophore was removed from the culture medium, W3 cells rapidly flipped exposed PtdSer into the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane at both 15 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). Within 4 min (t1/2, 4 min), half of the population internalized PtdSer. In contrast, DKO cells lost the ability to flip exposed PtdSer at 15 °C, keeping it on the cell surface (Fig. 2A). This result indicated that ATP11A and ATP11C are essential for re-establishing PtdSer asymmetry at 15 °C. However, following an increase in temperature to 37 °C, DKO cells slowly internalized PtdSer from the surface (t1/2, 15 min), and PtdSer on DKO cells disappeared within 40 min, re-establishing PtdSer asymmetry (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that DKO cells exhibit a temperature-dependent activity to re-establish the asymmetrical distribution of PtdSer. Endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking are active at 37 °C and blocked at 15 °C (33Sullivan P.C. Ferris A.L. Storrie B. Effects of temperature, pH elevators, and energy production inhibitors on horseradish peroxidase transport through endocytic vesicles.J. Cell Physiol. 1987; 131: 58-63Google Scholar, 34Kuismanen E. Saraste J. Low temperature-induced transport blocks as tools to manipulate membrane traffic.Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 257-274Google Scholar). Accordingly, when W3 cells were treated with pH-sensitive fluorescent-conjugated transferrin (pHrodo-Transferrin) at 37 °C, it was quickly incorporated into cells and showed intracellular puncta signals (Fig. S1, A and B). This process was blocked at 15 °C or by Dyngo-4a, a dynamin inhibitor, that blocks the clathrin-mediated endocytosis or membrane trafficking (31McCluskey A. Daniel J.A. Hadzic G. Chau N. Clayton E.L. Mariana A. et al.Building a better dynasore: the dyngo compounds potently inhibit dynamin and endocytosis.Traffic. 2013; 14: 1272-1289Google Scholar) (Fig. S1, B and C), confirming that W3 cells have normal endocytosis and membrane trafficking systems. We speculated that intracellular P4-ATPases support the re-establishment of the asymmetrical distribution of PtdSer at the plasma membrane through temperature-dependent membrane trafficking systems. Accordingly, Dyngo-4a inhibited DKO cell’s activity to re-establish PtdSer asymmetry at 37 °C in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 2C and S1D). Six mammalian P4-ATPases have been shown to exhibit PtdSer flippase activity (22Lee S. Uchida Y. Wang J. Matsudaira T. Nakagawa T.

Chem. 2014; 289: 33543-33556Google Scholar), and ATP8A1 and ATP11B localize at endosomes or the trans-Golgi network. Therefore, we examined the effects of ATP8A1 and ATP11B on the re-establishment of the asymmetrical distribution of PtdSer in DKO cells. The ATP8A1 and/or ATP11B genes on DKO cells were knocked out using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Fig. S2), establishing ATP11A-ATP11C-ATP8A1 (DKO-ATP8A1−/−: TKO1) and ATP11A-ATP11C-ATP11B (DKO-ATP11B−/−: TKO2) triple flippase-deficient, and ATP11A-ATP11C-ATP8A1-ATP11B QKO cells. QKO cells grew as well as WT cells and did not exhibit abnormalities under steady-state conditions (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, PtdSer flippase activity using NBD-PS at the plasma membrane did not substantially differ between DKO and QKO cells at 15 °C or 37 °C, indicating that ATP8A1 and ATP11B did not contribute to this process. In contrast, the re-establishment of PtdSer asymmetry by these cells at 37 °C after the transient exposure of PtdSer was totally different. As shown in Fig. 3C, the half time required for this process increased from 22 min with DKO cells to 33 and 52 min with TKO1 and TKO2 cells, respectively, and the re-establishment activity of DKO cells was abolished entirely in QKO cells. Gene deletion of ATP11B impacted stronger on the re-establishment activity than ATP8A1, which may be consistent with abundant mRNA expressions of ATP11B in W3 cells (32Segawa K. Kurata S.

The robust exposure of PtdSer on QKO cells was maintained at 37 °C for 60 min. These results indicated that the four P4-ATPases (ATP8A1, ATP11A, ATP11B, and ATP11C) were involved in re-establishing PtdSer asymmetry in W3 cells. To examine how each member contributes to the process, they were tagged with EGFP and individually expressed in QKO cells and observed with confocal microscopy or analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP Ab. As shown in Figs. 4A and S3, EGFP-ATP11A and ATP11C were exclusively merged with PlasMem Bright that specifically stains the plasma membrane (35Takahashi M. Seino R. Ezoe T. Ishiyama M. Ueno Y. Amphipathic fluorescent dyes for sensitive and long-term Monitoring of plasma membranes.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.379206Google Scholar). On the other hand, consistent with previous findings (22Lee S. Uchida Y. Wang J. Matsudaira T. Nakagawa T. Kishimoto T. et al.Transport through recycling endosomes requires EHD1 recruitment by a phosphatidylserine translocase.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 669-688Google Scholar, 28Takatsu H. Baba K. Shima T. Umino H.

Chem. 2011; 286: 38159-38167Google Scholar), majority of the GFP signals of EGFP-tagged ATP8A1 and ATP11B were merged with pHrodo-Transferrin (Fig. 4B) in recycling endosomes (36Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. Quantification of low density lipoprotein and transferrin endocytic sorting HEp2 cells using confocal microscopy.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Google Scholar) and partly colocalized with PlasMem Bright. The expression of ATP11A and ATP11C conferred rapid activity to re-establish PtdSer asymmetry in QKO cells after the exposure of PtdSer, which was not affected by temperature (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, ATP8A1 and ATP11B internalized PtdSer as efficiently as ATP11A or ATP11C at 37 °C, but less efficiently at 15 °C. Approximately 25% of QKO expressing ATP8A1 cells internalized PtdSer quickly at 15 °C, which may be consistent with the partial localization of ATP8A1 at plasma membranes (Fig. 4A). Although Dyngo-4a did not affect the quick re-establishment of PtdSer asymmetry by ATP11A or ATP11C at 37 °C (Fig. 4D), it interfered in the ATP8A1- or ATP11B-mediated re-establishment processes. Based on these results, we concluded that in contrast to ATP11A and ATP11C, which function at the plasma membrane, the ability of ATP8A1 and ATP11B to re-establish PtdSer asymmetry was dependent on a dynamin-mediated endocytosis or recycling systems between endosomes and plasma membranes. We previously showed that PtdSer triggered the ATPase activity of ATP11A and ATP11C with half-maximum activation constants (Ka) and Vmax of 1.9 μM and 6.5 nmol Pi/μg protein/min, and 1.3 μM and 8.9 nmol Pi/μg protein/min, respectively (26Segawa K. Kurata S. Nagata S. Human type IV P-type ATPases that work as plasma membrane phospholipid flippases and their regulation by caspase and calcium.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 762-772Google Scholar). On the other hand, Wang et al. (23Wang J. Molday L.L. Hii T. Coleman J.A. Wen T. Andersen J.P. et al.Proteomic analysis and functional Characterization of P4-ATPase phospholipid flippases from Murine tissues.Sci. Rep. 2018; 810795Google Scholar) recently reported that the Ka and Vmax of human ATP11B for PtdSer were 178 μM and 17.3 nmol Pi/μg protein/min, respectively. Therefore, we investigated the PtdSer-dependent ATPase activity of the purified ATP8A1-CDC50A and ATP11B-CDC50A flippase complex and compared it with that of ATP11C-CDC50A, a plasma membrane PtdSer-flippase. Human ATP8A1, ATP11B, and ATP11C were tagged with FLAG and expressed in HEK293T cells with their human CDC50A subunit tagged with EGFP. Cells were lysed with 0.5% lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol (LMNG), and the complex was affinity-purified with an anti-FLAG mAb, as previously reported (37Segawa K. Kurata S. Nagata S. The CDC50A extracellular domain is required for forming a functional complex with and chaperoning phospholipid flippases to the plasma membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2172-2182Google Scholar). An analysis by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining indicated that recombinant ATP8A1, ATP11B, and ATP11C in the complex had the expected sizes of Mr, 110K-120K (Fig. 5A). CDC50A was detected in several bands at Mr of approximately 60 to 75K, which may have been due to different degrees of glycosylation. An analysis by Blue Native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) followed by CBB staining or Western blotting with anti-FLAG (P4-ATPase) and anti-GFP (CDC50A) antibodies (Abs) detected a protein complex at approximately 300 to 450 kDa (Fig. 5, B and C). POPS induced the ATPase activity of these complexes in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). The complexes responded weakly to POPE, but not to POPC or SM for ATPase activity (Fig. 5E). POPE induced the ATPase activity of ATP11B and ATP11C with approximately 40% efficiency of POPS, while it activated the ATPase of ATP8A1 with around 13% of POPS, suggesting that ATP11B and ATP11C responded better to PtdEtn than ATP8A1 (Fig. 5F). A Lineweaver–Burk kinetics analysis indicated that Ka for POPS was similar among the three P4-ATPases (ATP8A1, ATP11B, and ATP11C): Ka of 0.4 to 1.5 μM, whereas Vmax of ATP8A1 for POPS was three-times higher than those of ATP11B and ATP11C (11.2, 4.8, and 4.3 nmol Pi/μg protein/min, respectively). These results were consistent with the values we previously reported for the recombinant human ATP11A and ATP11C flippase complexes (26Segawa K. Kurata S. Nagata S. Human type IV P-type ATPases that work as plasma membrane phospholipid flippases and their regulation by caspase and calcium.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 762-772Google Scholar), supporting ATP8A1 and ATP11B functions at endosomes as flippases for PtdSer. On the other hand, Ka values were approximately 100- to 400-fold smaller than those reported by Wang et al. (23Wang J. Molday L.L. Hii T. Coleman J.A. Wen T. Andersen J.P. et al.Proteomic analysis and functional Characterization of P4-ATPase phospholipid flippases from Murine tissues.Sci. Rep. 2018; 810795Google Scholar). Although we do not have a clear explanation for this difference, it may be due to the presence or absence of a high concentration of detergents in the assay (10 mM CHAPS in (23Wang J. Molday L.L.

Cases and controls were COVID-19 confirmed patients with and without severe neurological manifestations. Age, comorbid conditions, vaccination status, Blood Sugar Random (BSR), D-dimers levels, anticoagulation type and dosage were taken as predictors (exposure variables) for developing neurological complications. In the case-only (subgroup) analysis, 28-day mortality were analyzed using the same predictors including admission hypoxemia. Chi square test and regression model were built to calculate OR with 95%CI.Among 383 patients (median age, 56 years [IQR, 24-110]; 49.9% men); 95 had neurological complications (cases) and 288 did not (controls). Development of neurological complications among COVID-19 related hospitalizations was significantly associated with old age >71 yrs. (cases, 23.2%; controls, 13.5%; OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.28-8.55), presence of diabetes mellitus (37.9% vs. 24%; OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1), admission hyperglycemia (BSR 351-600 mg/dl), (29.5% vs. 7.6%; OR, 3.11; 95%CI, 1.54-6.33), raised D-dimer levels 5000-10,000 ng/ml (41% vs. 11.8%; OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 3.02-8.9), prophylactic dose anticoagulation (43.2% vs. 28.1%; OR, 1.9; 95%CI, 1.2-3.1), and unvaccinated status of COVID-19 patients (90.5% vs. 75.6%; OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.44-6.25). Neurological complications with COVID-19 were associated with increased likelihood of death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 (86.3% vs. 45.1%; OR, 7.66; 95% CI, 4.08-14.4). In case-only analysis (median age, 56 years [IQR, 27,110]; 50.5% women), 67 (70.5%) had CVE, 21 (22.1%) had Encephalitis, and 7 (7.4%) had GBS as neurological manifestations. 28-day mortality among these patients was strongly associated with a lower likelihood of vaccination.

In this study, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine whether PBMC miRNAs are reliable biomarkers for Crohn's disease diagnosing and monitoring. 5 Crohn's disease patients and 5 healthy controls were recruited to find differentially expressed miRNAs by next generation sequencing. Candidate PBMC miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR in another cohort consisting of 86 Crohn's disease patients and 39 healthy controls. We found PBMC miR-582-5p could diagnose Crohn's disease with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.701(95%CI 0.606-0.796, p < .001). While PBMC miR-96-5p was significantly higher in active Crohn's disease and correlated with both clinical (ρ = 0.376, p < .001) and endoscopic activity (ρ = 0.512, p = .015). Furthermore, PBMC miR-96-5p had a better performance in recognizing active Crohn's disease with AUROC of 0.727 (95%CI 0.609-0.844, p = .001) than C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fecal calprotectin.

There is concern that the current uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is suboptimal and that this may be contributing to COVID-19 inequities. However, little is known about the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among immigrants in the U.S. Our goal was to gauge COVID-19 vaccine intentions among Brazilian immigrant women living in the U.S.We conducted an online survey between July and August 2020 offered in Portuguese and English languages among a convenience sample of Brazilian immigrant women ages 18 years and older. Women were recruited through online advertisements by community-based organizations and social media groups to complete a survey that assessed intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine, attitudes toward vaccines, and perceptions about the pandemic.Of the total sample (N = 353), most (70.8%) indicated they intended to get a COVID-19 vaccine. In bivariate analyses, vaccine intentions were significantly associated with perceptions about the severity of the pandemic, trusted sources of health information, and the number of years lived in the U.S. Multinomial logistic regression models revealed that those who did not intend to be vaccinated had lived a longer time in the U.S. (OR: -0.12 95% CI: -0.19, -0.05), perceived the pandemic to be a minor issue (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.42), and trusted information from social networks (OR: -1.94, 95% CI: -3.25, -0.63) or private news sources (OR: -1.71, 95% CI: -2.78, -0.63).While most women reported they would get a COVID-19 vaccine, efforts to reach those who may be hesitant should target those who have lived in the U.S. for longer periods of time and do not perceive the pandemic to be a major crisis.

https://openalex.org/W4297253894,"Purpose To evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment 18 F-FDG PET/CT after consolidation therapy of 131 I-rituximab in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who had acquired complete remission after receiving chemotherapy. Methods Patients who were diagnosed with DLBCL via histologic confirmation were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had achieved complete remission after 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisolone) chemotherapy after which they underwent consolidation treatment with 131 I-rituximab. 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed before R-CHOP for initial staging. The largest diameter of tumor, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained from pretreatment 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans. Receiver-operating characteristic curves analysis was introduced for assessing the optimal criteria. Kaplan-Meier curve survival analysis was performed to evaluate both relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Results A total of 15 patients (12 males and 3 females) with a mean age of 56 (range, 30–73) years were enrolled. The median follow-up period of these patients was 73 months (range, 11–108 months). Four (27%) patients relapsed. Of them, three died during follow-up. Median values of the largest tumor size, highest SUVmax, MTV, and TLG were 5.3 cm (range, 2.0–16.4 cm), 20.2 (range, 11.1–67.4), 231.51 (range, 15–38.34), and 1277.95 (range, 238.37–10341.04), respectively. Patients with SUVmax less than or equal to 16.9 showed significantly worse RFS than patients with SUVmax greater than 16.9 (5-year RFS rate: 60% vs. 100%, p = 0.008). Patients with SUVmax less than or equal to 16.9 showed significantly worse OS than patients with SUVmax greater than 16.9 (5-year OS rate: 80% vs. 100% p = 0.042). Conclusion Higher SUVmax at pretreatment 18 F-FDG PET/CT was associated with better relapse free survival and overall survival in DLBCL patients after consolidation therapy with 131 I-rituximab. However, because this study has a small number of patients, a phase 3 study with a larger number of patients is needed for clinical application in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4297254633,"The risk of high-grade gliomas is lower in young females, however, its incidence enhances after menopause, suggesting potential protective roles of female sex hormones. Hormone oscillations after menopause have received attention as a possible risk factor. Little is known about risk factors for adult gliomas. We examined the association of the aging brain after menopause, determining the risk of gliomas with proteomics and the MALDI-MSI experiment. Menopause caused low neurotransmitter levels such as GABA and ACH, high inflammatory factor levels like il-1β, and increased lipid metabolism-related levels like triglycerides in the brain. Upregulated and downregulated proteins after menopause were correlated with differentially expressed glioma genes, such as ACTA2, CAMK2D, FNBPIL, ARL1, HEBP1, CAST, CLIC1, LPCAT4, MAST3, and DOCK9. Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis of monocytes showed that the downregulated gene LPCAT4 could be used as a marker to prevent menopausal gliomas in women. Our findings regarding the association of menopause with the risk of gliomas are consistent with several extensive cohort studies. In view of the available evidence, postmenopausal status is likely to represent a significant risk factor for gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W4297256009,"The propensity of viruses to co-opt host cellular machinery by reprogramming the host's RNA-interference machinery has been a major focus of research, however, regulation of host defense mechanisms by virus-encoded miRNA, is an additional regulatory realm gaining momentum in the arena of host-viral interactions. The Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) miRNAs, regulate many cellular pathways alone or in concordance with HCMV proteins, thereby paving a conducive environment for successful infection in the human host. We show that HCMV miRNA, hcmv-miR-UL148D inhibits staurosporine-induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells. We establish that ERN1 mRNA is a bonafide target of hcmv-miR-UL148D and its encoded protein IRE1α is translationally repressed by the overexpression of hcmv-miR-UL148D resulting in the attenuation of apoptosis. Unlike the host microRNA seed sequence (6-8 nucleotides), hcmv-miR-UL148D has long complementarity to 3' UTR of ERN1 mRNA resulting in mRNA degradation. The repression of IRE1α by the hcmv-miR-UL148D further downregulates Xbp1 splicing and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation thus regulating ER-stress and ER-stress induced apoptotic pathways. Strikingly, depletion of ERN1 attenuates staurosporine-induced apoptosis which further suggests that hcmv-miR-UL148D functions through regulation of its target ERN1. These results uncover a role for hcmv-miR-UL148D and its target ERN1 in regulating ER stress-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4297258918,"Regulation of the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton is achieved through the coordination of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). MAP-Tau, the most abundant MAP in the axon, functions to modulate motor motility, participate in signaling cascades, as well as directly mediate microtubule dynamics. Tau misregulation is associated with a class of neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, including progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Many disease-associated mutations in Tau are found in the C-terminal microtubule-binding domain. These mutations decrease microtubule-binding affinity and are proposed to reduce microtubule stability, leading to disease. N-terminal disease-associated mutations also exist, but the mechanistic details of their downstream effects are not as clear. Here, we investigate the effect of the progressive supranuclear palsy–associated N-terminal R5L mutation on Tau-mediated microtubule dynamics using an in vitro reconstituted system. We show that the R5L mutation does not alter Tau interactions with tubulin by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we determined that the R5L mutation has no effect on microtubule growth rate, catastrophe frequency, or rescue frequency. Rather, the R5L mutation increases microtubule shrinkage rate. We determine this is due to disruption of Tau patches, larger order Tau complexes known to form on the GDP-microtubule lattice. Altogether, these results provide insight into the role of Tau patches in mediating microtubule dynamics and suggesting a novel mechanism by which mutations in the N-terminal projection domain reduce microtubule stability.

At low concentrations, on microtubules stabilized with either paclitaxel (Taxol-microtubules) or guanosine-5′-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphate (GMPCPP) (GMPCPP-microtubules), Tau binds in a dynamic equilibrium between static and diffusive binding states (29Hinrichs M.H.

However, the importance of Tau-binding behavior and patch formation on the ability of Tau to regulate microtubule dynamics is unknown. Tau misregulation and aggregation are linked to a class of neurodegenerative diseases known as ”tauopathies,” which include Alzheimer’s disease, Pick’s disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (36Grundke-Iqbal I.

Many disease-associated mutations in Tau, found within the microtubule-binding region, have been shown to decrease Tau interaction with the microtubule through a decrease in affinity and/or an increased propensity for Tau aggregation (41Goedert M.

Tau avoids the GTP cap at growing microtubule plus-ends.iScience. 2020; 23101782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and we recently discovered the N-terminal disease–associated mutation in Tau, R5L, associated with PSP, does not reduce affinity for either Taxol-microtubules or GMPCPP-microtubules (32Cario A. Savastano A. Wood N.B. Liu Z. Previs M.J. Hendricks A.G. et al.The pathogenic R5L mutation disrupts formation of Tau complexes on the microtubule by altering local N-terminal structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2114215119Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with past studies that show deletion of the N-terminal domain does not alter Tau affinity for the microtubule (21Goode B.L. Denis P.E. Panda D. Radeke M.J. Miller H.P. Wilson L. et al.Functional interactions between the proline-rich and repeat regions of tau enhance microtubule binding and assembly.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Rather, on Taxol-microtubules, the R5L mutation alters Tau microtubule–bound behavior, reducing the occupancy of Tau, and disrupting Tau patches (32Cario A. Savastano A. Wood N.B. Liu Z. Previs M.J. Hendricks A.G. et al.The pathogenic R5L mutation disrupts formation of Tau complexes on the microtubule by altering local N-terminal structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2114215119Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the R5L mutation has been shown to reduce microtubule assembly, but the mechanism remains unclear (45Mutreja Y. Combs B. Gamblin T.C. FTDP-17 mutations alter the aggregation and microtubule stabilization propensity of tau in an isoform-specific fashion.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 742-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 48Poorkaj P. Bird T.D. Wijsman E. Nemens E. Garruto R.M. Anderson L. et al.Tau is a candidate gene for chromosome 17 frontotemporal dementia.Ann. Neurol. 1998; 43: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the R5L mutation reduces microtubule assembly through disruption of Tau patches on dynamic microtubules. To test this hypothesis, we studied the interactions of WT-Tau and R5L-Tau with both dynamic microtubules and free tubulin, using an in vitro reconstituted system. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which the R5L mutation may lead to disease as well as provide the first evidence for the role of Tau-binding behavior in regulation of microtubule dynamics. To study the effect of the R5L mutation on Tau-mediated microtubule assembly, the R5L mutation was cloned into the 3RS isoform of Tau; 3RS is lacking both of the N-terminal splice inserts and contains three of four microtubule-binding repeats. Polymerization of microtubules was monitored at 37 °C via a bulk light scattering assay using 20 μM tubulin and 10 μM Tau (WT-Tau or R5L-Tau). The R5L mutation does not significantly alter the polymerization lag time or the rate of polymerization (Fig. 1A), although there is a slight reduction in the final absorbance. However, turbidity assays are bulk measurements and cannot differentiate effects of microtubule growth or stabilization. Therefore, the effect of the R5L mutation on Tau-mediated microtubule dynamics was determined using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Microtubules were grown at 37 °C from Alexa 647-labeled GMPCPP seeds with 5 μM Alexa 488 tubulin and 750 nM unlabeled Tau (WT-Tau or R5L-Tau) (Fig. 1B), similar to Tau:tubulin ratios used previously, which provide sufficiently long but dynamic microtubules (8Panda D. Samuel J.C. Massie M. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Differential regulation of microtubule dynamics by three- and four-repeat tau: implications for the onset of neurodegenerative disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9548-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 49Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Kinetic stabilization of microtubule dynamics at steady state by tau and microtubule-binding domains of tau.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, under these conditions, microtubules will not polymerize without Tau, and therefore, microtubule growth is a Tau-dependent process. The relative length of microtubules from the seed to both plus and minus ends was measured. These relative lengths from the seed are referred to as plus end and minus end, respectively. Dynamic microtubules plus ends grown in the presence of R5L-Tau are approximately 60% of the length of microtubules grown with WT-Tau (WT-Tau = 1.00 ± 0.48; R5L-Tau = 0.60 ± 0.37) (Fig. 1C). Yet, the R5L mutation has no effect on minus end length (Fig. 1D). Hence, R5L-Tau leads to shorter microtubules relative to WT-Tau because of shorter plus ends. Shorter microtubules could result from any combination of altered interactions with tubulin, the GTP microtubule lattice, and/or the GDP microtubule lattice. To test if the R5L mutation alters Tau binding to tubulin, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to study Tau:tubulin interactions under nonpolymerizing conditions. Diffusion times of 20 nM Alexa 488-labeled Tau (WT-Tau or R5L-Tau) were measured with increasing concentrations of tubulin (0.5–10 μM). The normalized diffusion times of both WT-Tau and R5L-Tau increase by 50% in the presence of saturating concentrations of Tau (Fig. 2A), indicating no difference in the Tau:tubulin binding ratio upon introduction of the R5L mutation. However, in the absence of tubulin, R5L-Tau has a larger diffusion time compared with WT-Tau (WT-Tau = 0.59 ± 0.01 ms; R5L-Tau = 0.67 ± 0.01 ms) (Fig. S1). The change in diffusion time may be due to structural changes within Tau upon introduction of the mutation. Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein but can adopt an ensemble of transient global conformations in solution (25Melo A.M. Coraor J. Alpha-Cobb G. Elbaum-Garfinkle S. Nath A. Rhoades E. A functional role for intrinsic disorder in the tau-tubulin complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 14336-14341Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 50Jeganathan S. von Bergen M. Brutlach H. Steinhoff H.J. Mandelkow E. Global hairpin folding of tau in solution.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, single-molecule FRET (smFRET) was used to investigate the possible effects of the R5L mutation on the conformation of Tau. Differences in FRET efficiencies (efficiency of energy transfer [ETeff]), calculated from the ratio of intensity of the acceptor over the sum of the intensities of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, indicate relative changes in distance between regions within Tau, which can provide insight into the global conformation of the protein. Amino acids were mutated to cysteine residues to conjugate fluorophores via maleimide chemistry, and the numbering used is relative to the longest Tau isoform. The R5L mutation has no effect on the FRET efficiency within the N-terminal projection domain (C17–C149) of Tau (WT-Tau = 0.67 ± 0.04; R5L-Tau = 0.67 ± 0.02). Likewise, the R5L mutation does not alter the observed distance between the projection domain and the central proline-rich region (C17–C244) (WT-Tau = 0.40 ± 0.03; R5L-Tau = 0.43 ± 0.02) or between the proline-rich region and the microtubule-binding repeats (C149–C372) (WT-Tau = 0.18 ± 0.01; R5L-Tau = 0.17 ± 0.01) (Fig. 2C). The ETeff values are consistent with our previous work of Tau conformations in solution using FRET (24McKibben K.M. Rhoades E. Independent tubulin binding and polymerization by the proline-rich region of Tau is regulated by Tau's N-terminal domain.J. Biol.

Jakob U. et al.Polyphosphate initiates tau aggregation through intra- and intermolecular scaffolding.Biophys. J. 2019; 117: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, it is possible there are changes below the FRET detection limit for this probe pair at the positions chosen. Therefore, local structural changes near the R5L mutation, which have been previously observed by NMR (32Cario A. Savastano A. Wood N.B. Liu Z. Previs M.J. Hendricks A.G. et al.The pathogenic R5L mutation disrupts formation of Tau complexes on the microtubule by altering local N-terminal structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2114215119Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), could account for the changes in diffusion times. To further understand how the R5L mutation leads to shorter microtubules and altered interaction with the microtubule lattice, microtubule growth rate, shrinkage rate, catastrophe, and rescue frequency were measured in the presence of WT-Tau or R5L-Tau using TIRF microscopy (Movie S1 and S2). Relative to WT-Tau, R5L-Tau has no effect on microtubule growth rate at either the plus end (WT-Tau = 1.00 ± 0.4 μm/min; R5L-Tau = 1.04 ± 0.4 μm/min) or the minus end (WT-Tau = 0.40 ± 0.30 μm/min; R5L-Tau = 0.41 ± 0.37 μm/min) (Fig. 3B). Similarly, there is no difference in the amount of time microtubules are growing or shrinking (Fig. S2). In addition, there is no difference in the catastrophe frequency at the plus end (WT-Tau = 0.002 ± 0.001 events/min; R5L-Tau = 0.002 ± 0.001 events/min) or the minus end (WT-Tau = 0.0007 ± 0.0002 events/min; R5L-Tau 0.0009 ± 0.0092 events/min) (Fig. 3D). Similarly, there is no difference in the rescue frequency at the plus end (WT-Tau = 0.002 ± 0.001 events/min; R5L-Tau = 0.001 ± 0.001 events/min) or the minus end (WT-Tau = 0.0007 ± 0.0002 events/min; R5L-Tau = 0.0009 ± 0.0092 events/min) (Fig. 3E). However, compared with WT-Tau, R5L-Tau increases the Tau-mediated microtubule shrinkage rate at the plus end (WT-Tau = 7.55 ± 3.65 μm/min; R5L-Tau = 11.02 ± 5.39 μm/min) and the minus end (WT-Tau = 7.12 ± 2.60 μm/min; R5L-Tau = 10.37 ± 4.53 μm/min) (Fig. 3C)."
https://openalex.org/W4297259618,"Experimental literature has found that risk attitudes are not robust to different elicitation techniques. However, most comparisons across elicitation methods involve different rewards and framings simultaneously. Our experimental design helps to disentangle the effect of these two factors. We consider two different personal rewards (money domain and grade domain) and two different scenarios while keeping the reward constant (lottery framing and exam framing). We find no differences in elicited risk aversion between the two domains. However, framing matters: elicited risk aversion is lower in the exam framing."
https://openalex.org/W4297265398,"α-synucleinopathy is driven by an imbalance of synthesis and degradation of α-synuclein (αSyn), causing a build up of αSyn aggregates and post-translationally modified species, which not only interfere with normal cellular metabolism but also by their secretion propagates the disease. Therefore, a better understanding of αSyn degradation pathways is needed to address α-synucleinopathy. Here, we used the nerve growth factor-differentiated catecholaminergic PC12 neuronal cell line, which was conferred α-synucleinopathy by inducible expression of αSyn and tubulin polymerization-promoting protein p25α. p25α aggregates αSyn, and imposes a partial autophagosome-lysosome block to mimic aspects of lysosomal deficiency common in neurodegenerative disease. Under basal conditions, αSyn was degraded by multiple pathways but most prominently by macroautophagy and Nedd4/Ndfip1-mediated degradation. We found that expression of p25α induced strong p38MAPK activity. Remarkably, when opposed by inhibitor SB203580 or p38MAPK shRNA knockdown, endolysosomal localization and degradation of αSyn increased, and αSyn secretion and cytotoxicity decreased. This effect was specifically dependent on Hsc70 and the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery, but different from classical microautophagy, as the αSyn Hsc70 binding motif was unnecessary. Furthermore, in a primary neuronal (h)-αSyn seeding model, p38MAPK inhibition decreased pathological accumulation of phosphorylated serine-129-αSyn and cytotoxicity. In conclusion, p38MAPK inhibition shifts αSyn degradation from various forms of autophagy to an endosomal sorting complex required for transport-dependent uptake mechanism, resulting in increased αSyn turnover and cell viability in p25α-expressing cells. More generally, our results suggest that under conditions of autophagolysosomal malfunction, the uninterrupted endosomal pathway offers a possibility to achieve disease-associated protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W4296886893,"The centromere is an essential chromosomal structure for faithful chromosome segregation during cell division. No protein-coding genes exist at the centromeres, but centromeric DNA is actively transcribed into noncoding RNA (ncRNA). This centromeric transcription and its ncRNA products play important roles in centromere functions. We previously reported that the transcriptional regulator ZFAT (zinc-finger protein with AT hook) plays a pivotal role in ncRNA transcription at the centromere; however, it was unclear how ZFAT involvement was regulated. Here, we show that the death domain–associated protein (DAXX) promotes centromeric localization of ZFAT to regulate ncRNA transcription at the centromere. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous proteins clearly reveals that DAXX interacts with ZFAT. In addition, we show that ectopic coexpression of ZFAT with DAXX increases the centromeric levels of both ZFAT and ncRNA, compared with ectopic expression of ZFAT alone. On the other hand, we found that siRNA-mediated depletion of DAXX decreases the centromeric levels of both ZFAT and ncRNA in cells ectopically expressing ZFAT. These results suggest that DAXX promotes the centromeric localization of ZFAT and ZFAT-regulated centromeric ncRNA transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of endogenous DAXX protein is sufficient to cause a decrease in the ncRNA levels at the centromeres of chromosomes 17 and X in which ZFAT regulates the transcription, indicating a physiological significance of DAXX in ZFAT-regulated centromeric ncRNA transcription. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DAXX regulates centromeric ncRNA transcription through ZFAT.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that DAXX regulates centromeric ncRNA transcription through ZFAT. The kinetochore attaches chromosomes to spindle microtubules in mitosis to segregate each sister chromatid into daughter cells. The centromere is an essential chromosomal structure, in which kinetochore protein complex is assembled, to ensure accurate chromosome segregation (1McKinley K.L. Cheeseman I.M. The molecular basis for centromere identity and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 16-29Google Scholar). The eukaryotic centromeres that lack protein-coding genes had long been thought to be transcriptionally silent regions. However, recent many studies have demonstrated that transcription into noncoding RNA (ncRNA) occurs at the centromeres although the centromeric transcription levels are low (2Bouzinba-Segard H.

Centromeric transcription and its ncRNA products have been shown to play crucial roles in centromere functions and kinetochore assembly (7Chen Y. Zhang Q. Liu H.

The role of human centromeric RNA in chromosome stability.Front Mol. Biosci. 2021; 8642732Google Scholar). However, there is limited understanding regarding molecular properties of centromeric ncRNA, including nucleotide sequences and transcription regulation. We have previously reported that the nuclear protein ZFAT (zinc-finger protein with AT hook) plays a pivotal role in ncRNA transcription at the centromere (11Ishikura S. Yoshida K. Hashimoto S.

Yoneyama M. Tsuda K. Shirouzu M. et al.Solution structures of the DNA-binding domains of immune-related zinc-finger protein ZFAT.J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2015; 16: 55-65Google Scholar). ZFAT specifically induces acetylation of lysine 8 in histone H4 at the centromere by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase KAT2B (12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar). The KAT2B-catalyzed acetylation of lysine 8 in histone H4 at the centromere functions as a binding site for the bromodomain-containing protein BRD4, which stimulates RNA polymerase II–dependent ncRNA transcription (12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar). ZFAT specifically binds to 8-bp DNA sequences at the centromere, named the ZFAT box (12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently reported that the centromeric protein CENP-B interacted with ZFAT to promote the centromeric localization of ZFAT (11Ishikura S. Yoshida K. Hashimoto S. Nakabayashi K. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. CENP-B promotes the centromeric localization of ZFAT to control transcription of noncoding RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297101213Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that ZFAT plays important roles in cell proliferation and survival mainly using mouse (14Tsunoda T. Doi K. Ishikura S. Luo H. Nishi K.

On the other hand, various studies in human have reported that genetic variants of the ZFAT gene are associated with particular human diseases, including autoimmune thyroid diseases (20Inoue N.

Furthermore, mutations and altered expression of the ZFAT gene are also observed in several human cancers (25Catalano C. Paramasivam N. Blocka J. Giangiobbe S. Huhn S.

Ther. 2020; 28: 613-630Google Scholar). For example, a genome-wide association study of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients showed that specific mutations in the ZFAT genes were strongly associated with poorer survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients (31Reddy A. Zhang J. Davis N.S. Moffitt A.B. Love C.L. Waldrop A. et al.Genetic and functional drivers of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.Cell. 2017; 171: 481-494.e15Google Scholar). Thus, dysregulations of ZFAT function and expression are thought to be related to various human diseases although roles of ZFAT-regulated centromeric transcription in pathogenesis of these diseases are still unknown. DAXX (death domain–associated protein) is a multifunctional protein involved in many cellular processes, including apoptosis, protein stability, and transcription regulation (32Mahmud I. Liao D. DAXX in cancer: Phenomena, processes, mechanisms and regulation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7734-7752Google Scholar). DAXX itself does not contain any enzymatic catalytic domains, and, thus, functions in these processes through interaction with various molecules. DAXX regulates gene transcription through interaction with various transcription factors. For example, p53 has been identified as a DAXX-interacting protein, and the p53 transcriptional activity is negatively regulated by DAXX (33Gostissa M. Morelli M. Mantovani F. Guida E. Piazza S. Collavin L. et al.The transcriptional repressor hDaxx potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48013-48023Google Scholar). On the other hand, Pax5, an essential transcription factor for B-cell development, interacts with DAXX, and their interaction leads to transcription activation in B cells (34Emelyanov A.V. Kovac C.R. Sepulveda M.A. Birshtein B.K. The interaction of Pax5 (BSAP) with Daxx can result in transcriptional activation in B cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11156-11164Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that DAXX regulates gene transcription through interaction with histone-modifying enzymes, including the CREB-binding protein (35Kuo H.Y. Chang C.C. Jeng J.C. Hu H.M. Lin D.Y. Maul G.G. et al.SUMO modification negatively modulates the transcriptional activity of CREB-binding protein via the recruitment of Daxx.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16973-16978Google Scholar) and the histone deacetylase 2 (36Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Mientjes E.J. Iyengar R. Grosveld G. Daxx and histone deacetylase II associate with chromatin through an interaction with core histones and the chromatin-associated protein Dek.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Google Scholar). Interestingly, through interaction with the chromatin-remodeling protein ATRX (α-thalassemia and mental retardation X-linked), DAXX functions as a histone chaperone for the deposition of histone H3 variant H3.3, which is also related to transcription activation (37Drane P. Ouararhni K. Depaux A. Shuaib M. Hamiche A. The death-associated protein DAXX is a novel histone chaperone involved in the replication-independent deposition of H3.3.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1253-1265Google Scholar). Thus, the dynamic interaction between DAXX and its associated proteins is tightly controlled. Intriguingly, it was previously reported that DAXX was involved in transcription at the centromere through deposition of H3.3 (38Morozov V.M. Gavrilova E.V. Ogryzko V.V. Ishov A.M. Dualistic function of Daxx at centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin in normal and stress conditions.Nucleus. 2012; 3: 276-285Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms by which DAXX regulates centromeric transcription remain elusive. In this study, we show that DAXX interacts with ZFAT to promote centromeric localization of ZFAT, leading to stimulation of ncRNA transcription. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses of endogenous and ectopically expressed proteins clearly reveal that DAXX interacts with ZFAT. Ectopic expression of DAXX increases the centromeric ZFAT levels and stimulates ZFAT-regulated ncRNA transcription at the centromeres. On the other hand, knockdown of DAXX decreases the centromeric levels of ZFAT as well as those of ncRNA. These results indicate that DAXX regulates ncRNA transcription at the centromeres through ZFAT. We previously showed that the centromeric protein CENP-B interacted with ZFAT through its acidic domain (AD) (11Ishikura S. Yoshida K. Hashimoto S. Nakabayashi K. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. CENP-B promotes the centromeric localization of ZFAT to control transcription of noncoding RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297101213Google Scholar). Similar to CENP-B, DAXX is also known as a protein that localizes at the centromeres and contains the AD (32Mahmud I. Liao D. DAXX in cancer: Phenomena, processes, mechanisms and regulation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7734-7752Google Scholar, 39Pluta A.F. Earnshaw W.C. Goldberg I.G. Interphase-specific association of intrinsic centromere protein CENP-C with HDaxx, a death domain-binding protein implicated in Fas-mediated cell death.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2029-2041Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the interaction between DAXX and ZFAT in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) human cells through co-IP analysis using anti-ZFAT and anti-DAXX antibodies. The endogenous ZFAT protein was coimmunoprecipitated with the endogenous DAXX protein using anti-DAXX antibody and vice versa (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that DAXX interacts with ZFAT. To compare an interaction affinity with ZFAT between DAXX and CENP-B, we ectopically expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ZFAT (ZFAT-HA) and FLAG-tagged DAXX (FLAG-DAXX) or FLAG-tagged CENP-B (FLAG-CENP-B) in HEK293 cells and examined their interaction through co-IP analysis using anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. Similar to endogenous proteins, the FLAG-DAXX protein was coimmunoprecipitated with the ZFAT-HA protein using an anti-HA antibody and vice versa (Fig. 1B). The protein levels of ZFAT-HA, which was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-DAXX, were relatively lower than those of ZFAT-HA coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-CENP-B (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the protein levels of FLAG-DAXX, which was coimmunoprecipitated with ZFAT-HA, were relatively lower than those of FLAG-CENP-B coimmunoprecipitated with ZFAT-HA (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we examined the interaction between ZFAT and DAXX after DNase treatment through co-IP analysis (Fig. 1C). Disappearance of the genome DNA by the DNase treatment was confirmed in our previous study (11Ishikura S. Yoshida K. Hashimoto S. Nakabayashi K. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. CENP-B promotes the centromeric localization of ZFAT to control transcription of noncoding RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297101213Google Scholar). The DNase treatment did not affect the interaction between ZFAT and DAXX. Together, these results suggest that DAXX interacts with ZFAT independently of DNA, and that the interaction affinity between ZFAT and DAXX is slightly weaker than that between ZFAT and CENP-B. The DAXX protein is composed of several domains, including two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) at the N and C terminus (SIM1 and SIM2, respectively), four helix bundle domains, histone-binding domain, and AD (Fig. 2A, (32Mahmud I. Liao D. DAXX in cancer: Phenomena, processes, mechanisms and regulation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7734-7752Google Scholar)). To elucidate DAXX domains involved in the interaction with ZFAT, we examined the interaction between ZFAT-HA and the deletion mutants of FLAG-DAXX in HEK293 cells using co-IP analysis. Deletion of SIM2 hardly affected the interaction with ZFAT, whereas loss of SIM1 slightly decreased it (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, deletion of either four helix bundle domain, histone-binding domain, or AD markedly inhibited the interaction of DAXX with ZFAT (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that multiple domains of DAXX are involved in the interaction with ZFAT. The ZFAT protein is composed of 18 zinc-finger (ZF) domains (Fig. 3A, (13Tochio N. Umehara T. Nakabayashi K. Yoneyama M. Tsuda K. Shirouzu M. et al.Solution structures of the DNA-binding domains of immune-related zinc-finger protein ZFAT.J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2015; 16: 55-65Google Scholar)). To determine which ZFAT regions were involved in the interaction with DAXX, we evaluated the interaction between FLAG-DAXX and the deletion mutants of ZFAT-HA in HEK293 cells. While the ZF-ΔN-2 deletion mutant, which was composed of ZF9-18, retained the ability to interact with DAXX, the ZF-ΔC-2 deletion mutant, which was composed of ZF1-8, did not interact with DAXX, suggesting involvement of the C-terminal region of ZFAT in the interaction with DAXX (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the interaction with DAXX was clearly observed in the ZF-ΔN-3 deletion mutant, which had ZF13–18 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the C-terminal region containing ZF13–18 of ZFAT is involved in the interaction with DAXX. To elucidate roles of interaction between DAXX and ZFAT in their centromeric localization, we examined the protein levels of ZFAT and DAXX at the centromeres in HEK293 cells, which transiently expressed ZFAT-HA, FLAG-DAXX, or both, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis that we established previously (11Ishikura S. Yoshida K. Hashimoto S. Nakabayashi K. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. CENP-B promotes the centromeric localization of ZFAT to control transcription of noncoding RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297101213Google Scholar, 12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B). We previously showed that ZFAT was bound to the centromeres of every chromosome but regulated the centromeric ncRNA transcription only at particular chromosomes (12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar). Activation of the centromeric ncRNA transcription by ectopic expression of ZFAT was observed in qRT–PCR analysis using primers for Chr17, and ChrX-a and ChrX-b, but not primers for Chr13/21-a, whereas ZFAT binding at the centromeres was detected in ChIP–qPCR analysis using all these primer sets (12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar). In the ChIP–qPCR analysis in this study, we used primers for Chr17 and Chr13/21-a to examine whether DAXX was involved in the centromeric localization of ZFAT only at chromosomes where ZFAT activated the ncRNA transcription. We clearly observed that ZFAT-HA and FLAG-DAXX were bound to the centromeres of both Chr17 and Chr13/21, but not to regions for the 5S ribosomal RNA gene, which were used as a negative control (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, ectopic coexpression of ZFAT-HA with FLAG-DAXX further increased the protein levels of ZFAT at the centromeres of both Chr17 and Chr13/21, compared with those in cells expressing ZFAT-HA alone. On the other hand, their coexpression did not affect the protein levels of DAXX at the centromeres, compared with those in cells expressing FLAG-DAXX alone. These results suggest that DAXX plays positive roles in the centromeric localization of ZFAT at every chromosome independently of transcription activation by ZFAT, whereas ZFAT is not involved in the centromeric localization of DAXX. Furthermore, ectopic coexpression of FLAG-DAXX with ZFAT-HA did not affect the ZFAT protein levels at the promoter regions of the BRPF1, PDE12, and TELO2 genes to which we previously reported that ZFAT was bound (Fig. 4, B and C, (15Ishikura S. Tsunoda T. Nakabayashi K. Doi K. Koyanagi M. Hayashi K. et al.Molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by the nuclear zinc-finger protein Zfat in T cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1859: 1398-1410Google Scholar)), suggesting that DAXX is involved in the localization of ZFAT specifically at the centromeres but not at the gene promoter regions. To further examine the involvement of DAXX in the centromeric localization of ZFAT, we next evaluated the effect of loss of the endogenous DAXX protein on the centromeric ZFAT levels in HEK293 cells transiently expressing ZFAT-HA (Figs. 5, A and B, and S1A and B). We used two siRNAs (siDAXX-1 and siDAXX-2) targeting distinct sequences of DAXX to deplete the DAXX protein. Transfection of cells with siRNAs for DAXX significantly decreased the expression levels of endogenous DAXX protein but not those of ectopically expressed ZFAT-HA (Figs. 5A and S1A). Loss of DAXX resulted in the significant decrease in the protein levels of ZFAT at the centromeres, compared with a control siRNA (Figs. 5B and S1B). On the other hand, the DAXX siRNAs did not affect the protein levels of ZFAT at the promoter regions of the BRPF1, PDE12, and TELO2 genes (Figs. 5, B and C, and S1B). Together, these results suggest that DAXX promotes the localization of ZFAT specifically at the centromeres. To investigate the involvement of DAXX in ZFAT-regulated centromeric ncRNA transcription, we examined the effects of ectopic expression of ZFAT-HA, FLAG-DAXX, or both on the centromeric ncRNA levels in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). The expression levels of centromeric ncRNA were determined by qRT–PCR analysis, which we established previously (11Ishikura S. Yoshida K. Hashimoto S. Nakabayashi K. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. CENP-B promotes the centromeric localization of ZFAT to control transcription of noncoding RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297101213Google Scholar, 12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar). As previously shown (12Ishikura S. Nakabayashi K. Nagai M. Tsunoda T. Shirasawa S. ZFAT binds to centromeres to control noncoding RNA transcription through the KAT2B-H4K8ac-BRD4 axis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 10848-10866Google Scholar), ectopic expression of ZFAT alone caused a marked increase in the centromeric ncRNA levels but not in the RNA expression levels of the Alu element that was noncentromeric repetitive DNA sequence (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, ectopic coexpression of ZFAT with DAXX resulted in a further increase in the centromeric ncRNA levels, compared with those in cells expressing ZFAT alone (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, DAXX, which was ectopically expressed alone, slightly increased the centromeric ncRNA levels although it was not statistically significant (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that DAXX plays positive roles in ZFAT-regulated centromeric ncRNA transcription. We next evaluated the effects of loss of endogenous DAXX protein on the centromeric ncRNA levels in HEK293 cells transiently expressing ZFAT-HA (Figs. 7, A and B, and S1C). siRNA-mediated knockdown of DAXX significantly decreased the centromeric ncRNA levels in cells expressing ZFAT-HA, compared with a control siRNA (Figs. 7B and S1C). Together, these results suggest that DAXX is involved in ZFAT-regulated ncRNA transcription at the centromeres. To further elucidate the role of DAXX in the ZFAT-regulated ncRNA transcription at the centromeres, we evaluated the effects of DAXX depletion on the centromeric ncRNA levels in HEK293 cells without ectopic expression of ZFAT-HA (Figs. 8, A and B, and S2A and B). An siRNA-mediated knockdown of DAXX had no effects on the expression levels of endogenous ZFAT protein (Figs. 8B and S2B). A depletion of DAXX caused a significant decrease in the ncRNA levels at the centromeres of chromosomes 17 and X in which ZFAT regulated the transcription (Figs. 8A and S2A). These results suggest that DAXX is involved in the ZFAT-regulated centromeric ncRNA transcription at a physiological state. Transcription at the centromeres and its ncRNA products are important for centromere functions in accurate chromosomal segregation. We next examined the effects of DAXX depletion on formation of mitotic spindle using immunofluorescence analysis of α-tubulin (Figs. 8, C and D and S2C and D). In these experiments, we used HT1080 cells, which were near diploid cells, instead of HEK293 cells, because abnormal spindle morphology was frequently observed in HEK293 cells without any treatments. Depletion of DAXX significantly increased the proportion of mitotic cells that had abnormal spindle morphology, compared with cells transfected with a control siRNA (Fig. 8, C and D and S2C and D). Together, these results suggest that DAXX is involved in the accurate chromosome segregation probably through the ZFAT-regulated centromeric ncRNA transcription. DAXX was previously reported to localize at the centromeres in human cells (39Pluta A.F. Earnshaw W.C. Goldberg I.G.

It was presumed that the aerosols exhaled through the tubes while playing would be ejected over larger distances and spread into the room due to jet stream effects. In particular, the soprano recorder is widely used as an instrument in school classes, for beginners of all age groups in their musical education, in the context of leisure activities and in professional concert performances. Understanding the aerosol impulse dispersion characteristics of playing the soprano recorder could assist with the establishment of concepts for safe music-making.Five adult professionally trained soprano recorder players (4 female, 1 male) played four bars of the main theme of L. van Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" in low and in high octaves, as well as with 3 different potential protection devices in the high octave. For comparison they spoke the corresponding text by F. Schiller. Before each task, they inhaled .5 L of vapor from an e-cigarette filled with base liquid. The vapor cloud escaping during speaking or playing was recorded by cameras and its spread was measured as a function of time in the three spatial dimensions. The potential safety devices were rated for practicability with a questionnaire, and their influence on the sound was compared, generating a long-term average spectrum from the audio data.When playing in the high octave, at the end of the task the clouds showed a median distance of 1.06 m to the front and .57 m diameter laterally (maxima: x: 1.35 m and y: .97 m). It was found that the clouds' expansion values in playing the recorder with and without safety measures are mostly lower when compared to the ordinary, raised speaking voice of the same subjects. The safety devices which covered the instrument did not show clear advantages and were rated as unpractical by the subjects. The most effective reduction of the cloud was reached when playing into a suction funnel.The aerosol dispersion characteristics of soprano recorders seem comparable to clarinets. The tested safety devices which covered holes of the instrument did not show clear benefits."

Among these, ocular amyloid angiopathy has attracted attention because of its direct link to visual impairment and its correlation with systemic severity. We hypothesized that optical coherence tomography angiographic parameters would be useful biomarkers of amyloidosis systemic severity and investigated their correlation with the systemic severity score. The primary outcome was the correlation between the systemic severity score and choriocapillaris flow deficit percentage. Secondary outcomes were the correlations between the systemic severity score and retinal optical coherence tomography angiographic parameters, including foveal avascular zone size and circularity and superficial/deep/total retinal perfusion and vessel densities. The choroidal and retinal vasculature was quantified in 36 eyes from 36 patients (age, 51.8±12.1 years; disease duration, 13.4±6.2 years). Ten eyes had a history of vitrectomy for vitreous opacity. Choriocapillaris flow deficit percentage was not significantly correlated with the systemic severity score (Spearman's rank correlation: r = 2.96×10-2, p = 0.863). Similarly, foveal avascular zone size and circularity, and superficial/deep/total retinal perfusion and vessel densities were not significantly correlated with the systemic severity score. These results may indicate that optical coherence tomography angiographic parameters are not sufficient to predict amyloidosis severity."
https://openalex.org/W4297256592,"Background Spin—the misrepresentation of a study’s actual results—has the potential to alter a clinician’s interpretation of the study’s findings and therefore could affect patient care. Studies have shown spin frequently occurs in abstracts of systematic reviews from a variety of other medical disorders and specialties. Aims Our primary aim was to evaluate whether the nine most severe types of spin occurred in systematic review abstracts’ concerning diabetic neuropathy treatments. Secondly, we aimed to determine whether spin presence was associated with the methodological quality of a systematic review. Methods A search of MEDLINE and Embase collected 1297 articles focused on diabetic neuropathy treatments, of which we included 114 systematic reviews for spin assessment. Each included study was evaluated for the nine most severe types of spin as defined by Yachitz et al. The methodological quality of a systematic review was determined by using the AMSTAR-2 instrument. All screening and data extraction were conducted in a masked, duplicate fashion. Since the final sample size of 114 was not sufficiently powered to do multivariable logistic regression, we calculated unadjusted odds ratios which evaluated relationships between spin presence within abstracts and study characteristics. Results From the 114 articles reviewed, spin was present in 7.9% of the studies (9/114), with spin type 5: “conclusion claims the beneficial effect of the experimental treatment despite the high risk of bias in the included primary studies” as the most frequent in our study. Spin types 1, 2, 6, and 8 were not identified. No association was observed between the study characteristics and spin presence, including the methodological quality of a systematic review. Conclusions Overall, spin is infrequently observed in abstracts of systematic reviews covering diabetic neuropathy treatments. When comparing our results to other fields of medicine, the field of diabetic neuropathy research publishes systematic reviews whose abstracts mostly portray the findings of the review’s full-text to reflect the results adequately."
https://openalex.org/W4297260278,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat occurs commonly in irrigation regions of South Africa and less frequently in dryland regions. Previous surveys of Fusarium species causing FHB identified isolates using morphological characters only. This study reports on a comprehensive characterisation of FHB pathogens conducted in 2008 and 2009. Symptomatic wheat heads were collected from the Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Bushveld and eastern Free State (irrigation regions), and from one field in the Western Cape (dryland region). Fusarium isolates were identified with species-specific primers or analysis of partial EF-1α sequences. A representative subset of isolates was characterized morphologically. In total, 1047 Fusarium isolates were collected, comprising 24 species from seven broad species complexes. The F. sambucinum (FSAMSC) and F. incarnatum-equiseti species complexes (FIESC) were most common (83.5% and 13.3% of isolates, respectively). The F. chlamydosporum (FCSC), F. fujikuroi (FFSC), F. oxysporum (FOSC), F. solani (FSSC), and F. tricinctum species complexes (FTSC) were also observed. Within the FSAMSC, 90.7% of isolates belonged to the F. graminearum species complex (FGSC), accounting for 75.7% of isolates. The FGSC was the dominant Fusaria in all four irrigation regions. F. pseudograminearum dominated at the dryland field in the Western Cape. The Northern Cape had the highest species diversity (16 Fusarium species from all seven species complexes). The type B trichothecene chemotype of FGSC and related species was inferred with PCR. Chemotype diversity was limited (15-ADON = 90.1%) and highly structured in relation to species differences. These results expand the known species diversity associated with FHB in South Africa and include first reports of F. acuminatum, F. armeniacum, F. avenaceum, F. temperatum, and F. pseudograminearum from wheat heads in South Africa, and of F. brachygibbosum, F. lunulosporum and F. transvaalense from wheat globally. Potentially novel species were identified within the FCSC, FFSC, FOSC, FSAMSC, FIESC and FTSC."

We show that MqsR preferentially binds substrates that contain purines in the −2 and −1 position relative to the MqsR consensus cleavage sequence and that two residues of MqsR, Tyr81, and Lys56 are strictly required for mRNA cleavage. We also show that MqsA inhibits MqsR activity by sterically blocking mRNA substrates from binding while leaving the active site fully accessible to mononucleotides.

This includes the existence of distinct gene pairs known as toxin:antitoxin (TA) systems, small mobile genetic elements composed of a toxin, which causes growth arrest by interfering with an essential cellular process, and a cognate antitoxin, which neutralizes the toxin activity during normal growth conditions (5Page R. Peti W. Toxin-antitoxin systems in bacterial growth arrest and persistence.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Although the environmental conditions that activate distinct TA systems are still poorly understood, the result is an excess of toxin, whose activity leads to rapid growth arrest and dormancy (6Keren I.

Type II TA systems are the largest and best-studied class of TA system, with many type II TA loci identified in most free-living bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (7Pandey D.P. Gerdes K.

Biol. 2016; 12: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Typically, type II antitoxins have two domains, a DNA-binding domain (to bind the promoters of their own operon to repress transcription (9Afif H. Allali N. Couturier M. Van Melderen L.

These classifications are consistent with recent RNAseq studies that defined elements of their cleavage specificities, with ribosome-dependent RNases exhibiting a strong bias for cleaving mRNAs at the 5′ end of coding regions and ribosome-independent RNases lacking this bias (22Culviner P.H.

Despite these advances, we still lack an understanding of the additional substrate elements that contribute to toxin binding and antitoxin-mediated inhibition of toxin activity. One toxin whose mechanisms of mRNA cleavage and inhibition by its cognate antitoxin are not fully defined is that of MqsR, an E. coli RNase (MqsA is its cognate antitoxin). MqsR adopts a RelE-like fold (21Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K. et al.Three dimensional structure of the MqsR:MqsA complex: a novel TA pair comprised of a toxin homologous to RelE and an antitoxin with unique properties.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000706Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and, like RelE, has a moderate preference for cleaving transcripts near the 5′ end (22Culviner P.H. Nocedal I. Fortune S.M. Laub M.T. Global analysis of the specificities and targets of endoribonucleases from Escherichia coli toxin-antitoxin systems.mBio. 2021; 12e0201221Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, unlike RelE, it does not require the ribosome for activity (19Brown B.L. Lord D.M. Grigoriu S. Peti W. Page R.

Conversely, unlike most known ribosome-independent RNases and their microbial RNase homologs, MqsR also does not have a conserved histidine and glutamic acid that function as a catalytic acid and base, respectively (26Yang W. Nucleases: diversity of structure, function and mechanism.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 44: 1-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, while it is established that MqsR targets a broad range of mRNA transcripts containing the consensus sequence 5′-GC(U/A)-3′ or 5′-GC-3′ (20Christensen-Dalsgaard M. Jørgensen M.G. Gerdes K. Three new RelE-homologous mRNA interferases of Escherichia coli differentially induced by environmental stresses.Mol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 28746-28753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), additional substrate elements that enhance MqsR-mediated degradation are still undefined. Finally, the structure of the MqsR–MqsA complex defined the location of the MqsA interaction site on MqsR, revealing that the putative MqsR active site is solvent accessible in the complex (21Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K. et al.Three dimensional structure of the MqsR:MqsA complex: a novel TA pair comprised of a toxin homologous to RelE and an antitoxin with unique properties.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000706Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, a molecular understanding of how MqsA prevents MqsR-mediated cleavage of mRNA substrates has remained elusive. Here, we used biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, coupled with mRNA cleavage assays, to answer these outstanding questions. NMR-based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) measurements using both mononucleotides and mRNA/DNA hybrid substrate analogs showed that MqsR preferentially binds longer substrates that include purines at the −2 and −1 position relative to the consensus cleavage sequence. Further, the data also showed that multiple MqsR residues contribute to substrate binding. To distinguish the role of these MqsR residues in substrate recruitment and for the catalytic mechanism of MqsR, we performed mutagenesis coupled with RNase cleavage assays. These data identified multiple residues important for MqsR-mediated mRNA cleavage, with two, Lys56 and Tyr81, being essential for catalysis. Finally, using CSP data, we showed that MqsA inhibits MqsR activity not by binding and/or distorting the active site but instead by blocking substrate binding to the active site. Together, this work provides a molecular understanding of how MqsR, a noncanonical microbial RNase toxin, cleaves its mRNA substrates and how this activity is potently neutralized by its cognate antitoxin MqsA. The 2D [1H,15N] heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of MqsR (98 residues, 11.2 kDa, Fig. 1A) is consistent with a well-folded protein, as expected from the MqsR structure that was determined by X-ray crystallography (21Brown B.L.

To probe the interaction of MqsR with substrates and proteins in solution, we completed the MqsR sequence-specific backbone assignment. Secondary structure propensity of Cα and Cβ chemical shifts (28Marsh J.A. Singh V.K. Jia Z. Forman-Kay J.D.

Ninety NH cross peaks (of 96 possible) were assigned (94%). MqsR residues Ser62, His64, and Thr65, which belong to the β2 and β3 connecting loop, were not assigned (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, neighboring residues Tyr61, Glu63, and Ile66 have weak cross-peak intensities in the 2D [1H,15N] HSQC spectrum of MqsR, suggesting that the missing loop residues are broadened beyond detection as a result of sampling multiple conformations at a μs/ms intermediate timescale. MqsR cleaves single stranded 5′-GC(U/A)-3′ mRNA sequences (27Yamaguchi Y. Park J.-H. Inouye M.

Furthermore, recent transcriptome sequence experiments refined the MqsR specificity cleavage sequence to 5′-GC-3′ (22Culviner P.H. Nocedal I. Fortune S.M. Laub M.T.

We confirmed this using in vitro cleavage assays with purified MqsR and distinct mRNA substrates, including wt-MqsA mRNA and variants which lack all 5′-GCU-3′ or 5′-GC-3′ sequences (Fig. 2A and Table S1). In vitro cleavage assays using three RNA/DNA oligos containing a single cleavable ribonucleotide showed that MqsR targets G nucleosides for cleavage (Fig. 2B). To identify MqsR residues that mediate 5′-GC-3′ sequence binding and cleavage, we titrated GMP into 15N-labeled MqsR and followed the resulting CSPs using 2D [1H,15N] HSQC spectra. CSPs report on a change of the local environment of the HN reporter, either via a direct binding interaction with the titrant and/or an indirect conformational change (high ratios of MqsR:GMP [1:1600] were required for these titrations due to its mM binding affinity; Fig. 2C, Table 1) (31Göbl C.

Spectrosc. 2014; 80: 26-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Significant CSPs were determined by calculating the SD of all CSPs (σ), excluding any CSPs greater than 3σ above the average, recalculating σ as a corrected σ0, and then iteratively removing CSPs above 3σ0 until no more CSPs could be removed. CSPs above ≥1σ0 were then selected as the threshold (32Williamson M.P. Using chemical shift perturbation to characterise ligand binding.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 73: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 33Schumann F.H. Riepl H. Maurer T. Gronwald W. Neidig K.-P. Kalbitzer H.R. Combined chemical shift changes and amino acid specific chemical shift mapping of protein–protein interactions.J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 39: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These CSPs were observed for 13 MqsR residues: Ser27, Tyr61, Asp63, Qln68, Arg72, Gln79, Tyr81, Thr85, Val93, Ser94, Phe95, Lys96, and Lys98 (Fig. 2D; 1H aromatic NMR signals of GMP at high concentrations interfered with MqsR signals). Mapping these residues onto MqsR (Fig. 2E) identified the interface used for mononucleotide binding. Most MqsR residues that exhibited CSPs were clustered on the central MqsR β-sheet, a location consistent with the active sites of other homologous RNases (Fig. S1). Two additional residues in the β2/β3 loop, Tyr61 and Asp63, also exhibit CSPs, suggesting that this loop region may also be involved in binding mRNA substrates. To determine if specific MqsR residues are necessary for guanosine binding, we also titrated UMP into MqsR (Fig. S2). MqsR also showed CSPs with UMP; however even higher MqsR:UMP ratios were required, indicating that the interaction is weaker. Five MqsR residues (Ser27, Tyr61, Tyr81, Phe95, and Lys98) exhibited CSPs with both UMP and GMP, suggesting these residues define the core binding pocket of MqsR. Using the CSPs ≥ 1σ0 (for GMP and UMP, respectively) to calculate residue specific and global average binding affinities (KD; Table S2), we determined that GMP binds MqsR ∼2-fold stronger than UMP (GMP KD: 30 ± 18 mM; UMP KD: 54 ± 30 mM; Table 1) (32Williamson M.P.

All sequences contained the invariant 5′-dGCUA-3′ sequence yet differed in length (5- to 7-mers) and nucleotide identity outside the invariant sequence (Table 1), allowing the effects of substrate length and sequence on MqsR binding to be determined. We first titrated increasing ratios of 5′-AdGCUA-3′ into 15N-labeled MqsR and followed the resulting CSPs using 2D [1H,15N] HSQC spectra. Fourteen peaks showed significant CSPs (≥1σ0), including residues His7, Ser27, Lys56, Tyr61, Ile66, Arg72, Tyr81, Leu82, Thr85, Val86, Ser94, Lys96, Glu97, and Lys98 (Fig. 3, A–C; Table S3). Four of the five residues that we identified as nondiscriminate interactors (Ser27, Tyr61, Tyr81, and Lys98) in the GMP/UMP experiments exhibited large CSPs. Analyzing all peaks with CSPs ≥1σ0 results in a global average KD of 1.5 ± 1.0 mM, ∼20-fold tighter than GMP (Table 1). Next, we tested if extending the noncleavable substrate in the 5′ direction, 5′-AAdGCUA-3′, influences MqsR binding (Fig. 3, D–F). As expected, a common core set of residues (His7, Ser27, Lys56, Tyr61, Arg72, Tyr81, Leu82, Val86, Ser94, and Lys98) interact with both 5′-AdGCUA-3′ (Oligo-A) and 5′-AAdGCUA-3′ (Oligo-AA) (Table S3) demonstrating that these substrates bind the same interface of MqsR. However, the CSPs of these residues are far larger for the 6-mer than the 5-mer, demonstrating that the addition of a nucleotide at the −2 position enhances the substrate interaction with those residues of MqsR. Consistent with this, the global KD also decreased by ∼7-fold to 0.22 ± 0.06 mM (Table 1). In contrast, extending the substrate by another nucleotide (5′-AAAdGCUA-3′, Oligo-AAA; Fig. 2, G–I) resulted in a nearly identical KD (0.15 ± 0.05 mM), demonstrating that an additional nucleotide at the -3 position does not significantly enhance binding. These data show that substrate engagement is enhanced by nucleotides outside the GCU recognition sequence and, particularly, that a nucleotide located upstream (5′) at the −2 position of this sequence facilitates MqsR binding. We next used NMR-based CSP studies to determine if the observed enhancement of binding is sequence specific or, alternatively, if the addition of any nucleotide upstream of the consensus sequence enhances affinity. Thus, we tested the interaction of substrates that differed in the nucleotide identity at the −2 position relative to the consensus GCU sequence (i.e., Oligo-AA; 5′-GAdGCUA-3′, Oligo-GA; 5′-UAdGCUA-3′, Oligo-UA; or 5′-CAdGCUA-3′, Oligo-CA). The data show that purines in the −2 position (Oligo-GA and Oligo-AA) bind MqsR ∼5- to 10-fold more tightly than pyrimidines (Oligo-UA and Oligo-CA; Table 1 and Fig. S3), despite binding essentially the same MqsR residues. We also tested if the identity of the nucleotide immediately 5′ of the GCU sequence (the −1 position) also affected substrate binding (substrates, Oligo-AA; 5′-AGdGCUA-3′, Oligo-AG; 5′-ACdGCUA-3′, Oligo-AC; 5′-AUdGCUA-3′, Oligo-AU). NMR-based CSP analysis showed that the identity of the nucleotide at the −1 position is less important for the interaction with MqsR (Table 1 and Fig. S4) but that purines (Oligo-AA and Oligo-AG) are still slightly preferred over pyrimidines (Oligo-AC and Oligo-AU). However, the differences in the KD values between the substrates was much smaller than for the −2 position (∼3-fold versus ∼10-fold). Together, these data demonstrate that MqsR prefers the nucleotides in the order A > G >>> U > C in both the −2 and −1 nucleotide position relative to the consensus GCU sequence. In addition to classifying the extent to which different substrates bind MqsR, our NMR CSP titration data also identified which MqsR residues interact most strongly and most often with substrates, allowing us to determine which residues contribute to substrate affinity. Eighteen residues exhibited a CSP ≥ 2σ0 in at least one of the 11 NMR titrations performed (Fig. 4, A and B and Table S4). Ten of these residues experienced a significant CSP in six or fewer titrations, indicating that these residues are likely not the primary contributors to substrate binding (for example, while Ala32 exhibits significant CSPs in two titrations, it is completely solvent inaccessible indicating that the Ala32 CSPs are the result of indirect effects instead of a direct substrate interaction). In contrast, the remaining eight residues had significant CSPs in eight or more titrations and thus are likely important for substrate binding. These substrate-binding residues can be broadly grouped into four distinct elements. The largest cluster of MqsR residues is centered on Tyr81 and Lys98 (two residues that exhibited the largest CSPs in nearly all titrations) and includes MqsR residues Lys56, Arg72, and Leu82. This cluster lies along the β-sheet of MqsR and overlaps closely with the positions of catalytic His/Glu motif residues in homologous RNases (Fig. S1), suggesting this cluster of residues defines the active site of MqsR. Outside of this active site region, the remaining three residues are found on separate elements, including Tyr61 which is part of the β2-β3 loop, Ser27 on the α2 helix, and His7 in the MqsR N-terminus. Our CSP experiments identified eight MqsR residues that are critical for mRNA binding (Table S3; residues that experienced CSPs with all substrates). To determine if they also are critical for MqsR-mediated mRNA cleavage, we used mutagenesis coupled with mRNA cleavage assays. First, for each of the eight MqsR residues, we created an Ala variant (for Leu82, whose sidechain is buried in the hydrophobic core (34Loverix S. Winqvist A. Strömberg R. Steyaert J. Mechanism of RNase T1: concerted triester-like phosphoryl transfer via a catalytic three-centered hydrogen bond.Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 651-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we generated L82I and L82V variants) and confirmed their folding status using differential scanning fluorimetry assays (Table S5). Only MqsRS27A did not refold properly and was thus excluded from further study. The remaining eight MqsR variants were stable and well folded. In vitro mRNA cleavage assays were then performed with the purified MqsR mutants using an MqsA substrate with a single 5′-AAGCUA-3′ cleavage site (assays were performed at both 37 °C, Figs. 4C and S5 and 25 °C, Fig. S6; cleavage results at both temperatures were essentially relatively identical). As expected from our NMR data, all MqsR variants exhibited reduced activity compared to wt MqsR (Fig. 4D). However, the extent of activity loss differed for each variant, with three variants exhibiting moderate cleavage (H7A, L82V, L82I), three variants exhibiting weak cleavage (K98A, Y61A, and R72A), and two resulting in no cleavage (K56A and Y81A). Importantly, MqsR variants K56A and Y81A are catalytically inactive (st"
https://openalex.org/W4297265714,"Mitochondrial morphology and dynamics maintain mitochondrial integrity by regulating its size, shape, distribution, and connectivity, thereby modulating various cellular processes. Several studies have established a functional link between mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and cell death, but further investigation is needed to identify specific proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics. Any alteration in the integrity of mitochondria has severe ramifications that include disorders like cancer and neurodegeneration. In this study, we used budding yeast as a model organism and found that Pil1, the major component of the eisosome complex, also localizes to the periphery of mitochondria. Interestingly, the absence of Pil1 causes the branched tubular morphology of mitochondria to be abnormally fused or aggregated, whereas its overexpression leads to mitochondrial fragmentation. Most importantly, pil1Δ cells are defective in mitophagy and bulk autophagy, resulting in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and protein aggregates. In addition, we show that pil1Δ cells are more prone to cell death. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitations show the interaction of Pil1 with two major proteins in mitochondrial fission, Fis1 and Dnm1. Additionally, our data suggest that the role of Pil1 in maintaining mitochondrial shape is dependent on Fis1 and Dnm1, but it functions independently in mitophagy and cell death pathways. Together, our data suggest that Pil1, an eisosome protein, is a novel regulator of mitochondrial morphology, mitophagy, and cell death."
