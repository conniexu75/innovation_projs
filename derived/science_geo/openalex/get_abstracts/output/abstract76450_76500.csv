A notable example is clomiphene, 1-(p-diethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenyl-2-chloro-ethylene (citrate)4, which has the unexpected property of stimulating ovulation in women with ovulatory failure of certain types5,6."

https://openalex.org/W2016968709,"SINCE the discovery of the so-called “newer” oestrogens by Marrian et al. and by Gallagher and Fishman et al.1, much work has been directed towards an explanation of their intermediary metabolism in human liver tissue2. In contrast, little information is available on the metabolism of the three “classical” oestrogens—oestrone, oestradiol-17β and oestriol—in human liver in vitro. Thus, Ryan and Engel3 found a reversible transmutation of oestrone and oestradiol-17β in human liver tissue slices; Engel et al.4 reported the formation of oestriol, 16-epi-oestriol and oestrone after incubation of oestradiol-17β by human foetal liver, and Breuer et al.5, using a similar system, identified 6-hydroxyoestradiol-17β and oestriol as metabolites of oestradiol-17β. In view of the significance of oestrone and oestradiol-17β as precursors of the “newer” oestrogens, it seemed that a more intensive search for the metabolites of the two oestrogens in human liver tissue was justified. Accordingly, the present investigation was undertaken."

Using chick parabionts, it should be possible to make an assessment of the role of cellular immigration in the development of the lymphoid organs of this species."

https://openalex.org/W2015738131,"RECENT findings have thrown doubt on the validity of the generalization that it is easier to recognize than to recall. Davis et al.1, using a list of fifteen two-digit numbers as stimuli, found that if all ninety possible numbers are presented in a recognition test, performance is no better than recall when both are tested immediately after the presentation."

https://openalex.org/W2152131395,"THE report by Holsten et al.1 on the direct and indirect effects of radiation on plant cells has produced many comments in both popular and specialist scientific journals. These comments, however, were not brought about by the results reported, as similar data were published earlier (see work referred to in ref. 1). Instead, they arose owing to the statement “The work has other and obvious implications for the radiation sterilization of food …”."

https://openalex.org/W2043568732,"SINCE Moinat's1 investigations of haemagglutination antibody titres to insulin, it has been assumed that there is no relationship between insulin requirements and antibody titres except in some cases of insulin resistance. These observations were partly supported by Berson and Yalow2, although these authors did find insulin binding capacities ranging from 50 to 500 units/litre in insulin-resistant patients. Recent investigations in this laboratory3 on variations in insulin requirements in human subjects with differing species of insulin suggested that antibodies to insulin play a significant role in determining insulin requirements even in non-resistant subjects. It was important, therefore, to re-investigate the haemagglutination studies in order to determine whether they reflected a true picture of insulin antibody titres or whether they might be IgM antibody dependent4,5."

https://openalex.org/W2051901786,"PRECIPITATION has been collected monthly at seventeen stations in Finland since 1961. Until the end of 1963 the rain-water samples were collected with stainless steel funnels which drained into ion-exchange columns. The columns were placed in boxes fitted with a thermostat, and in winter the funnels were heated. Comparison of the results obtained from samples collected by ion-exchange and from those collected directly into polythene bottles, however, indicated that the former method of sampling does not work satisfactorily in cold regions. In poorly stabilized conditions, caesium, especially, seemed to run through the resin. For this reason, dry and wet deposits have been collected since 1964 with the funnels draining directly into polythene bottles."

https://openalex.org/W2070231031,"GOODCHILD1 described experiments in which adult bladder-flukes, Gorgodera amplicava and Gorgoderina attenuata, were successfully transplanted from one species of Rana to another. Healthy transplanted flukes were capable of attaching themselves to the bladder of their new host, and they survived for periods of up to 3 weeks, which was as long as the experiment lasted. Furthermore, Goodchild2 successfully transplanted individuals of the same two species into the bladders of painted turtles, Chrysemys picta, and newts, Triturus viridescens; these parasites survived in their new habitats for periods of up to a week. In contrast to these results, Goodchild found that the same adult trematodes were incapable of survival when transplanted into the rectum or into the abdominal coelom of Rana pipiens. The flukes in the rectum were unable to grip the mucosa and were soon eliminated with the faeces. Those in the abdominal coelom were encapsulated by host cells and died within 24–72 h."
