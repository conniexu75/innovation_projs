https://openalex.org/W2014264692,"Large volumes of oil will remain in U.S. oil reservoirs when standard recovery methods have been completed. Supercritical carbon dioxide can be used to recover part of that remaining oil. If carbon dioxide is dense enough, it extracts hydrocarbons from the oil to make a mixture miscible with crude oil. Such a mixture can recover 95 percent of the oil in controlled laboratory flow settings. Heterogeneity of reservoir rocks and the low viscosity of carbon dioxide reduce the fraction of oil recovered in projects to lower but still significant levels. With the construction of three pipelines to carry naturally occurring carbon dioxide from Colorado and New Mexico to Permian basin oil fields, large-scale implementation of enhanced oil recovery by carbon dioxide flooding is now beginning."
https://openalex.org/W1993229848,The scyphomedusa Aurelia aurita consumes large amounts of yolk-sac herring larvae in Kiel Fjord. The decline of the larval herring population in late spring coincides with a major population growth of the jellyfish. The size of the larval herring population seems to be more significantly affected by the size of the predator stock than by the size of the parental herring stock.

https://openalex.org/W2077091672,Pronounced increases in total gaseous mercury (TGM) in the near surface marine atmosphere were found in the equatorial region (4 degrees N to 10 degrees S) of the Pacific Ocean at 160 degrees W. The atmospheric enhancement of TGM corresponded closely to sea-surface manifestations of equatorial upwelling as reflected in measured changes of temperature and nutrient concentrations as well as to variations of reactive mercury in surface seawater. The elevated atmospheric TGM levels most probably result from oceanic mercury evasion associated with upwelling and increased biological production that occurs in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.This evidence of sea-to-air mercury transfer supports model predictions of an oceanic source of atmospheric mercury and suggests that marine-derived mercury emissions should occur in other biologically productive regimes.
https://openalex.org/W1970435427,"The sulfidation of materials upon exposure to the atmosphere has traditionally been attributed entirely to reactions with sulfur-containing gases and water vapor. New laboratory results demonstrate that the sulfidation of polycrystalline copper can be markedly enhanced both by solar radiation and by the ubiquitous atmospheric ozone, thus indicating that the high rates of corrosion in urban areas are a result of a complex sequence of multicomponent photochemical processes."
