https://openalex.org/W2067856703,"The genesis of new cells, including neurons, in the adult human brain has not yet been demonstrated. This study was undertaken to investigate whether neurogenesis occurs in the adult human brain, in regions previously identified as neurogenic in adult rodents and monkeys. Human brain tissue was obtained postmortem from patients who had been treated with the thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), that labels DNA during the S phase. Using immunofluorescent labeling for BrdU and for one of the neuronal markers, NeuN, calbindin or neuron specific enolase (NSE), we demonstrate that new neurons, as defined by these markers, are generated from dividing progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of adult humans. Our results further indicate that the human hippocampus retains its ability to generate neurons throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W2121678235,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and surface-based representations of brain activity were used to compare the functional anatomy of two tasks, one involving covert shifts of attention to peripheral visual stimuli, the other involving both attentional and saccadic shifts to the same stimuli. Overlapping regional networks in parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes were active in both tasks. This anatomical overlap is consistent with the hypothesis that attentional and oculomotor processes are tightly integrated at the neural level."
https://openalex.org/W1986625112,"Two mutations in the gene encoding α-synuclein have been linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease1,2,3 (PD). α-Synuclein is a component of Lewy bodies, the fibrous cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of nigral dopaminergic neurons in the PD brain4. This connection between genetics and pathology suggests that the α-synuclein mutations may promote PD pathogenesis by accelerating Lewy body formation. To test this, we studied α-synuclein folding and aggregation in vitro, in the absence of other Lewy body-associated molecules. We demonstrate here that both mutant forms of α-synuclein (A53T and A30P) are, like wild-type α-synuclein5 (WT), disordered in dilute solution. However, at higher concentrations, Lewy body-like fibrils and discrete spherical assemblies are formed; most rapidly by A53T. Thus, mutation-induced acceleration of α-synuclein fibril formation may contribute to the early onset of familial PD."

https://openalex.org/W2045441934,"Although Ca2+-stimulated cAMP response element binding protein- (CREB-) dependent transcription has been implicated in growth, differentiation, and neuroplasticity, mechanisms for Ca2+-activated transcription have not been defined. Here, we report that extracellular signal-related protein kinase (ERK) signaling is obligatory for Ca2+-stimulated transcription in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. The sequential activation of ERK and Rsk2 by Ca2+ leads to the phosphorylation and transactivation of CREB. Interestingly, the Ca2+-induced nuclear translocation of ERK and Rsk2 to the nucleus requires protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This may explain why PKA activity is required for Ca2+-stimulated CREB-dependent transcription. Furthermore, the full expression of the late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) and L-LTP-associated CRE-mediated transcription requires ERK activation, suggesting that the activation of CREB by ERK plays a critical role in the formation of long lasting neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2164762131,"Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) activate PI turnover and thereby trigger intracellular calcium release. Previously, we demonstrated that mGluRs form natural complexes with members of a family of Homer-related synaptic proteins. Here, we present evidence that Homer proteins form a physical tether linking mGluRs with the inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R). A novel proline-rich “Homer ligand” (PPXXFr) is identified in group 1 mGluRs and IP3R, and these receptors coimmunoprecipitate as a complex with Homer from brain. Expression of the IEG form of Homer, which lacks the ability to cross-link, modulates mGluR-induced intracellular calcium release. These studies identify a novel mechanism in calcium signaling and provide evidence that an IEG, whose expression is driven by synaptic activity, can directly modify a specific synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W1983532821,"The E6-AP ubiquitin ligase (human/mouse gene UBE3A/Ube3a) promotes the degradation of p53 in association with papilloma E6 protein, and maternal deficiency causes human Angelman syndrome (AS). Ube3a is imprinted with silencing of the paternal allele in hippocampus and cerebellum in mice. We found that the phenotype of mice with maternal deficiency (m-/p+) for Ube3a resembles human AS with motor dysfunction, inducible seizures, and a context-dependent learning deficit. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely impaired in m-/p+ mice despite normal baseline synaptic transmission and neuroanatomy, indicating that ubiquitination may play a role in mammalian LTP and that LTP may be abnormal in AS. The cytoplasmic abundance of p53 was increased in postmitotic neurons in m-/p+ mice and in AS, providing a potential biochemical basis for the phenotype through failure to ubiquitinate and degrade various effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2165092209,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor stimulus-selective responses of the human fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA) during binocular rivalry in which a face and a house stimulus were presented to different eyes. Though retinal stimulation remained constant, subjects perceived changes from house to face that were accompanied by increasing FFA and decreasing PPA activity; perceived changes from face to house led to the opposite pattern of responses. These responses during rivalry were equal in magnitude to those evoked by nonrivalrous stimulus alternation, suggesting that activity in the FFA and PPA reflects the perceived rather than the retinal stimulus, and that neural competition during binocular rivalry has been resolved by these stages of visual processing."
https://openalex.org/W2160769038,"Polyribosomal complexes beneath postsynaptic sites on dendrites provide a substrate for local translation of particular mRNAs, but the signals that target mRNAs to synapses remain to be defined. Here, we report that high frequency activation of the perforant path projections to the dentate gyrus causes newly synthesized mRNA for the immediate-early gene (IEG) Arc to localize selectively in activated dendritic segments. Newly synthesized Arc protein also accumulates in the portion of the dendrite that had been synaptically activated. The targeting of Arc mRNA was not disrupted by locally inhibiting protein synthesis, indicating that the signals for mRNA localization reside in the mRNA itself. This novel mechanism through which newly synthesized mRNA is precisely targeted to activated synapses is well suited to play a role in the enduring forms of activity-dependent synaptic modification that require protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2062904839,"Homer is a neuronal immediate early gene (IEG) that is enriched at excitatory synapses and binds group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Here, we characterize a family of Homer-related proteins derived from three distinct genes. Like Homer IEG (now termed Homer 1a), all new members bind group 1 mGluRs. In contrast to Homer 1a, new members are constitutively expressed and encode a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain that mediates self-multimerization. CC-Homers form natural complexes that cross-link mGluRs and are enriched at the postsynaptic density. Homer 1a does not multimerize and blocks the association of mGluRs with CC-Homer complexes. These observations support a model in which the dynamic expression of Homer 1a competes with constitutively expressed CC-Homers to modify synaptic mGluR properties."

https://openalex.org/W2164591831,"Here, we describe a novel mechanism for the rapid regulation of surface levels of the neurotrophin receptor TrkB. Unlike nodose ganglion neurons, both retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and spinal motor neurons (SMNs) in culture display only low levels of surface TrkB, though high levels are present intracellularly. Within minutes of depolarization or cAMP elevation, surface TrkB levels increase by nearly 4-fold, and this increase is not blocked by cycloheximide. These findings suggest that activity and cAMP elevation rapidly recruit TrkB to the plasma membrane by translocation from intracellular stores. We propose that a fundamental difference between peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) neurons is the activity dependence of CNS neurons for responsiveness to their peptide trophic factors and that differences in membrane compartmentalization of the receptors underlie this difference."
https://openalex.org/W2069586712,"Male zebra finches display two song behaviors: directed and undirected singing. The two differ little in the vocalizations produced but greatly in how song is delivered. “Directed” song is usually accompanied by a courtship dance and is addressed almost exclusively to females. “Undirected” song is not accompanied by the dance and is produced when the male is in the presence of other males, alone, or outside a nest occupied by its mate. Here, we show that the anterior forebrain vocal pathway contains medial and lateral “cortical–basal ganglia” subdivisions that have differential ZENK gene activation depending on whether the bird sings female-directed or undirected song. Differences also occur in the vocal output nucleus, RA. Thus, although these two vocal behaviors are very similar, their brain activation patterns are dramatically different."

https://openalex.org/W1983277257,"The expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is increased during activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity. We have found that inhibitors of tPA inhibit the late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) induced by either forskolin or tetanic stimulation in the hippocampal mossy fiber and Schaffer collateral pathways. Moreover, application of tPA enhances L-LTP induced by a single tetanus. Exposure of granule cells in culture to forskolin results in secretion of tPA, elongation of mossy fiber axons, and formation of new, active presynaptic varicosities contiguous to dendritic clusters of the glutamate receptor R1. These structural changes are blocked by tPA inhibitors and induced by application of tPA. Thus, tPA may be critically involved in the production of L-LTP and specifically in synaptic growth."

https://openalex.org/W2019895529,"HER-2 oncogene encodes a transmembrane growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in 25–30% of patients with primary breast and ovarian cancer. A murine monoclonal antibody, 4D5, to the extracellular domain of HER-2 receptor elicits cytostatic growth inhibition of tumor cells overexpressing HER-2 protein, but clinical use of this antibody is limited by genesis of human anti-mouse antibodies. To avoid this problem, a recombinant humanized 4D5 monoclonal antibody (rhuMAb HER-2) was developed and tested using a human tumor xenograft model. Human breast and ovarian cancer cells which overexpress HER-2 were inhibited in vivo by the rhuMAb HER-2 antibody. Tumor growth relative to control was reduced at all doses of antibody tested, and the magnitude of growth inhibition was directly related to dose of rhuMAb HER-2. Tumor growth resumed on termination of antibody therapy, indicating a cytostatic effect. To elicit a cytotoxic response, human breast tumor xenografts were treated with a combination of antibody and antitumor drugs, cisplatin or doxorubicin. The combination of antibody with either cisplatin or doxorubicin resulted in significantly greater growth inhibition, with the cisplatin combination demonstrating a greater response. In addition, therapy with cisplatin and antireceptor antibody elicited complete tumor remissions after 2–3 cycles of therapy. The schedule of administration of antireceptor antibody and cisplatin was critical for occurrence of antibody-induced potentiation in cisplatin cytotoxicity. Enhanced killing of tumor cells was found only if antibody and drug were given in close temporal proximity. Since interference with DNA repair pathways may contribute to this receptor-enhanced chemosensitivity, repair of cisplatin-damaged reporter DNA (pCMV-β) was determined in human breast cells. As in studies of antibody-enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in vivo, treatment with rhuMAb HER-2 blocked the repair of cisplatin-damaged DNA only if the antibody was administered in close temporal proximity to transfection of the drug-exposed reporter DNA. An alternative measure of DNA repair, unscheduled DNA synthesis, was also assessed. Treatment with either cisplatin or doxorubicin led to an increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis that was reduced by combined therapy with antireceptor antibody specific to HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Using a direct measure of DNA repair, therapy of HER-2-overexpressing cells with rhuMAb HER-2 also blocked the removal of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts. Expression of p21/WAF1, an important mediator of DNA repair, was disrupted in breast cancer cells with HER-2 overexpression, but not in control cells, after treatment with HER-2 antibody, thus suggesting cross-communication between the HER-2 signaling and DNA repair pathways. These data demonstrate an in vivo antiproliferative effect of rhuMAb HER-2 on tumors that overexpress HER-2 receptor and a therapeutic advantage in the administration of the antireceptor antibody in combination with chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1965522673,"Polypeptide neurotoxins alter ion channel gating by binding to extracellular receptor sites, even though the voltage sensors are in their S4 transmembrane segments. By analysis of sodium channel chimeras, a beta-scorpion toxin is shown here to negatively shift voltage dependence of activation and enhance closed state inactivation by binding to a receptor site that requires glycine 845 (Gly-845) in the S3-S4 loop at the extracellular end of the S4 segment in domain II of the alpha subunit. Toxin action requires prior depolarization to drive the S4 voltage sensors outward, but these effects are lost in the mutant G845N. The results reveal a voltage sensor-trapping model of toxin action in which the IIS4 voltage sensor is trapped in its outward, activated position by toxin binding."

https://openalex.org/W1973760919,"Sympathetic neurons undergoing programmed cell death after nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation are shown to exhibit a protein synthesis-dependent, BAX-dependent loss of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. However, cytoplasmic microinjection of cytochrome c was insufficient to induce cell death in NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons. In contrast, microinjection of cytochrome c rapidly induced a caspase-dependent death in NGF-deprived, Bax-deficient or NGF-deprived, cycloheximide-treated neurons. Cells needed to be deprived of NGF for 15-20 hr before they acquired competence to die with injection of cytochrome c. These data suggest that NGF deprivation induced the translocation of cytochrome c and another event, which we term as competence-to-die, that was independent of macromolecular synthesis and BAX function. Both these processes were required for neurons to undergo apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1987414255,"The mechanism of kainate receptor targeting and clustering is still unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that members of the SAP90/PSD-95 family colocalize and associate with kainate receptors. SAP90 and SAP102 coimmunoprecipitate with both KA2 and GluR6, but only SAP97 coimmunoprecipitates with GluR6. Similar to NMDA receptors, GluR6 clustering is mediated by the interaction of its C-terminal amino acid sequence, ETMA, with the PDZ1 domain of SAP90. In contrast, the KA2 C-terminal region binds to, and is clustered by, the SH3 and GK domains of SAP90. Finally, we show that SAP90 coexpressed with GluR6 or GluR6/KA2 receptors alters receptor function by reducing desensitization. These studies suggest that the organization and electrophysiological properties of synaptic kainate receptors are modified by association with members of the SAP90/PSD-95 family."
https://openalex.org/W2031071883,"Modulation of the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool has recently come under scrutiny as a candidate for the regulation of synaptic strength. Using electrophysiological and optical measurement techniques, we show that phorbol esters increase the size of the readily releasable pool at glutamatergic hippocampal synapses in culture through a protein kinase C (PKC)–dependent mechanism. Phorbol ester activation of PKC also increases the rate at which the pool refills. These results identify two powerful ways that activation of the PKC pathway may regulate synaptic strength by modulating the readily releasable pool of vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W2034899304,"The ability of perisynaptic glial cells to modulate transmitter release and synaptic depression was studied at the frog neuromuscular junction (nmj). Injection of GTPgammaS in perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at this synapse, induced a reduction in the amplitude of nerve-evoked synaptic responses but had no effect on the frequency, the amplitude, or the duration of the miniature endplate currents (MEPCs). Also, paired pulse facilitation was not affected. The reduction in transmitter release was mediated by pertussis toxin-(PTX) sensitive and insensitive G proteins. Blockade of G proteins in PSCs with GDPbetaS reduced synaptic depression induced by high frequency trains of stimuli, whereas activation of G proteins occluded it. Hence, the activation by endogenous neurotransmitters of G proteins in PSCs induced a profound depression in neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2171390108,"Long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) in excitatory synapses can coexist, the former being triggered by stimuli that produce strong postsynaptic excitation and the latter by stimuli that produce weaker postsynaptic excitation. It has not been determined whether these properties also apply to LTP and LTD in the inhibitory synapses between Purkinje neurons and the neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), a site that has been implicated in certain types of motor learning. DCN cells exhibit a prominent rebound depolarization (RD) and associated spike burst upon release from hyperpolarization. In these cells, LTP can be elicited by short, high-frequency trains of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), which reliably evoke an RD. LTD is induced if the same protocol is applied with conditions where the amount of postsynaptic excitation is reduced. The polarity of the change in synaptic strength is correlated with the amount of RD-evoked spike firing during the induction protocol. Thus, some important computational principles that govern the induction of use-dependent change in excitatory synaptic efficacy also apply to inhibitory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2006606811,"Desensitization of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors is thought to shape the synaptic response and act as a neuroprotective mechanism at central synapses, but the molecular mechanism underlying desensitization is poorly understood. We found that replacing the glutamate binding domain S1 of GluR3 (an AMPA receptor) with S1 of GluR6 (a kainate receptor) resulted in a fully active but completely nondesensitizing receptor. Smaller substitutions within S1 identified, besides two additional modulatory regions, a single exchange, L507Y, as is required and sufficient for the block of desensitization. This phenotype was specific for AMPA receptors and required an aromatic residue at this position. L507 lies between two residues (T504 and R509) that form part of the glutamate binding site. The physical proximity of these residues, which are involved in binding and gating, suggests they may form part of the link between these two events."
https://openalex.org/W2004306212,"We report the in vivo characterization of the Drosophila CLOCK protein (dCLOCK), a transcription factor that is required for the expression of the circadian clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim). dCLOCK undergoes circadian fluctuations in abundance, is phosphorylated throughout a daily cycle, and interacts with PER, TIM, and/or the PER–TIM complex during the night but not during most of the day. Our results suggest that PER and TIM participate in transcriptional autoinhibition by physically interacting with dCLOCK or a dCLOCK-containing complex. Nevertheless, in the absence of PER or TIM, the levels of dCLOCK are constitutively low, indicating that PER and TIM also act as positive elements in the feedback loop by stimulating the production of dCLOCK."
https://openalex.org/W1991321447,"We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a novel protein of 22 kDa that is a human counterpart of the rat oncoprotein PTTG. We show that the corresponding gene (hpttg) is overexpressed in Jurkat cells (a human T lymphoma cell line) and in samples from patients with different kinds of hematopoietic malignancies. Analysis of the sequence showed that hPTTG has an amino-terminal basic domain and a carboxyl-terminal acidic domain, and that it is a proline-rich protein with several putative SH3-binding sites. Subcellular fractionation studies show that, although hPTTG is mainly a cytosolic protein, it is partially localized in the nucleus. In addition we demonstrate that the acidic carboxyl-terminal region of hPTTG acts as a transactivation domain when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, both in yeast and in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065034289,"Mossy fiber synapses on hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, in addition to expressing an NMDA receptor-independent form of long-term potentiation (LTP), have recently been shown to express a novel presynaptic form of long-term depression (LTD). We have studied the mechanisms underlying mossy fiber LTD and present evidence that it is triggered, at least in part, by a metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity, which leads to a decrease in the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and a reversal of the presynaptic processes responsible for mossy fiber LTP. The bidirectional control of synaptic strength at mossy fiber synapses by activity therefore appears to be due to modulation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in mossy fiber boutons."

https://openalex.org/W2330005549,"Schwannomas are peripheral nerve tumors that typically have mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. We compared cultured schwannoma cells with Schwann cells from normal human peripheral nerves (NHSC). Both cell types expressed specific antigenic markers, interacted with neurons, and proliferated in response to glial growth factor, confirming their identity as Schwann cells. Schwannoma cells frequently had elevated basal proliferation compared to NHSC. Schwannoma cells also showed spread areas 5-7-fold greater than NHSC, aberrant membrane ruffling and numerous, frequently disorganized stress fibers. Dominant negative Rac inhibited schwannoma cell ruffling but had no apparent effect on NHSC. Schwannoma cell stress fibers were inhibited by C3 transferase, tyrphostin A25, or dominant negative RhoA. These data suggest that the Rho and Rac pathways are abnormally activated in schwannoma cells. Levels of ezrin and moesin, proteins related to the NF2 gene product, merlin, were unchanged in schwannoma cells compared to NHSC. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that cell proliferation and actin organization are aberrant in schwannoma cells. Because NF2 is mutant in most or all human schwannomas, we postulate that loss of NF2 contributes to the cell growth and cytoskeletal dysfunction reported here."
https://openalex.org/W2081188469,"Modifying bacterial virulence genes to probe the nature of host immunity is mostly unexplored. Here we investigate whether host immune responses can be regulated by modification of bacterial virulence genes. In mice, attenuated Salmonella mutant strains with clinical relevance elicited differential host immune responses. Oral administration of a mutant strain with a PhoP-null phenotype promoted potent innate immune responses of macrophages that were sufficient for host defense. In contrast, administration of an Aro – mutant strain elicited stronger specific antibody and T-helper (Th)-cell responses, wherein Th1-type cells were required for clearance. Thus, genetic manipulation of bacteria may be used to broadly alter immune mechanisms that regulate attenuation within the host and to tailor host immunity to specific bacterial pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2086521820,"Progression of cells into S phase is controlled by the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and relies on the functional inactivation of this tumour suppressor in late G1 via protein phosphorylation. We provide evidence here that, besides controlling entry of cells into S phase, pRB can operate to inhibit S phase completion. Differential arrays of phosphorylation appear to regulate these different events, suggesting that cycle progression at these two stages of the cell cycle may be achieved via activation of distinct downstream pRB effector pathways. In agreement with this hypothesis, pRB's ability to prevent S phase entry, but not its ability to inhibit S phase completion, correlates with repression of E2F-regulated promoters. Furthermore, ectopic expression of E2F or the E2F-regulated cyclin E gene promote S phase entry in cells expressing phosphorylation-defective pRB but neither is sufficient to trigger completion of S phase. Our findings raise the possibility that pRB, in addition to its well-established role in controlling a checkpoint in late G1, could be involved in the control of a further checkpoint operating during S phase and that implementation of this checkpoint relies on an as yet unidentified pRB effector distinct from E2F."
https://openalex.org/W2040239567,"Disruption of apoptotic pathways is a major factor in the multistep process of tumorigenesis, whereas induction of apoptosis can be important for tumor suppression and cancer therapy. The adenovirus type 5 E1A gene provides a useful tool to study the function of tumor suppression and apoptosis. E1A has been shown to induce apoptosis in different systems in vitro. However, this activity has not been well characterized in vivo. Therefore, the effect of this activity and the link to the in vivo biological function are not clear. To answer these questions, we introduced E1A into murine melanoma cells and characterized the biological features both in vitro and in vivo. Expression of the E1A gene does not affect the proliferation rate of tumor cells in vitro, but inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The in vitro analysis indicated that the E1A-expressing tumor cells are sensitive to serum depletion-induced apoptosis. Importantly, E1A-mediated apoptosis was also identified in vivo, suggesting this activity contributed to the tumor suppressive function. The in vivo apoptotic pattern was unique: most of the apoptotic cells were around the periphery of the tumors, implicating the interaction of these cells with stress stimuli in vivo. In addition, E1A also rendered the tumor cells susceptible to the cytotoxicity of other anticancer agents, a feature useful for improving the efficacy of cancer therapy. The results provide a functional link between in vitro activity and in vivo effects."
https://openalex.org/W2109326765,"The detection of interaural time differences (ITDs) for sound localization critically depends on the similarity between the left and right ear signals (interaural correlation). We show that, like humans, owls can localize phantom sound sources well until the correlation declines to a very low value, below which their performance rapidly deteriorates. Decreasing interaural correlation also causes the response of the owl's tectal auditory neurons to decline nonlinearly, with a rapid drop followed by a more gradual reduction. A detection-theoretic analysis of the statistical properties of neuronal responses could account for the variance of behavioral responses as interaural correlation is decreased. Finally, cross-correlation analysis suggests that low interaural correlations cause misalignment of cross-correlation peaks across different frequencies, contributing heavily to the nonlinear decline in neural and ultimately behavioral performance."

Spiral computed tomography scanning revealed multiple internal features including putative blood vessels, connective tissue-like arrays, and a prominent symmetrical density consistent with the putative brain or its cast. The evidence suggests that this organism’s neurobiology resembled closely that of modern crocodylian species and should be included for consideration when examining ideas of Allosaurus evolution, behavior, and eventual extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1965602055,"Cyclic GMP (cGMP) is a crucial intracellular messenger in neuronal, muscle, and endocrine cells. The intracellular concentration of cGMP is regulated by various neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine (ACh) and nitric oxide (NO). While much is known about the biochemical steps leading to cGMP synthesis, little is known about cGMP kinetics in intact cells. Here, we use ""patch-cramming,"" in which an excised, inside-out membrane patch containing cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels is used as a biosensor, to obtain the first real-time measurements of cGMP in intact cells. Patch-cramming experiments on neuroblastoma cells show that both muscarinic agonists and NO rapidly elevate cGMP. NO elicits cGMP responses repeatedly without decrement, whereas responses to muscarinic agonists exhibit a profound and prolonged desensitization. Remarkably, muscarinic agonists also cause long-term (>30 min) suppression (LTS) of cGMP responses elicited by NO. Biochemical measurements reveal that rat sympathetic neurons also exhibit LTS of cGMP, suggesting that LTS is a widespread mechanism that may contribute to synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2322374102,"The SH2/SH3 adapters Nck, Grb2 and Crk promote the assembly of signaling complexes by binding to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins using their SH2 domains and to proline-rich sequences on effector molecules using their SH3 domains. FGF, which activates a receptor tyrosine kinase, induces mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos through activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway. We present evidence that dominant-negative mutants of Nck and Grb2, but not Crk1, can inhibit mesoderm-specific gene induction by eFGF in Xenopus animal cap explants. We also show that dominant-negative mutants of Grb2 and Nck can inhibit eFGF-induced Erk1 activation in Xenopus animal caps, and that targeting the first two SH3 domains of Nck to the membrane can activate Erk1 in the absence of eFGF. Furthermore, combinations of the dominant-negative Grb2 mutants with the inhibitory Nck mutant synergistically inhibited Erk1 activation by eFGF in Xenopus animal caps, suggesting that the dominant-negative Nck and Grb2 mutants inhibit Erk1 activation by binding to different proteins. By contrast only Grb2 mutants could inhibit eFGF-induced Erk1 activation in human 293 cells, demonstrating diversity in the specific mechanisms of signaling from FGF to MAP kinases in different cells."

Biol. Chem. 269, 32155-32161, 1994). We found decreased phosphorylation of a low molecular weight protein (pp23) in the variant cells and by co-migration on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, phosphopeptide mapping, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, we showed that pp23 was one of three post-translationally modified forms of Rap 1A expressed in HL-60 cells. Using an in vitro transcription/translation system, we studied each of the posttranslational processing steps of Rap 1A and we showed that pp23 represented fully processed Rap 1A. By immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and 35S-methionine/cysteine incorporation, we showed that the variant cells were deficient in pp23, and thus in fully processed Rap 1A, but that these cells did express normal amounts of completely unprocessed Rap 1A and geranylgeranylated Rap 1A; the lack of Rap 1A processing beyond geranylgeranylation in the variant cells was not secondary to a change in Rap 1A's amino acid sequence. The variant cells had normal carboxyl methyltransferase activity suggesting they are deficient in proteolytic cleavage of Rap 1A. The deficient post-translational processing of Rap 1A had no effect on Rap 1A's subcellular distribution and we found no evidence for altered post-translational processing of H-Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2057137577,"Although the visual system occupies nearly half of the mammalian brain, we still do not completely understand its first synaptic stage. One reason is that the dendrites postsynaptic to photoreceptors comprise such a maze of fine processes that doubt remains whether all the second order circuits have been identified—even after 4 decades of electron microscopy. Now advanced functional methods applied to a mammalian rod pathway suggest a circuit previously unsuspected from anatomy. The standard model for two rod circuits is shown in the diagram. The rod terminal contacts a single type of dedicated bipolar cell (left) and also forms an electrical junction with the cone terminal. The rod-to-bipolar circuit is thought to serve starlight, which is so dim that over minutes no rod transduces more than one photon. This single-photon signal requires huge amplification, which renders the circuit vulnerable to saturation in brighter light. The rod-to-cone circuit is thought to serve twilight, which is bright enough that over one second a rod tranduces tens to hundreds of photons. This multi-photon signal can thus “piggyback” onto the cone bipolar circuit (8Smith R.G. Freed M.A. Sterling P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3505-3517PubMed Google Scholar). Now9Soucy E. Wang Y.

The retina, except for the absence of cones and cone-driven responses, looks essentially normal. Bipolar cells that normally collect from cones remain intact, which is somewhat surprising, because neurons commonly degenerate when deprived of their primary input. But most surprising is that the multi-photon rod signal still reaches ganglion cells. Since this signal cannot take the expected route, from rod via gap junctions to cone, the rod must excite an unknown type of bipolar cell. The simplest experiment conceptually would have been to monitor the output of many bipolar cells, one at a time, by intracellular recording. This is technically difficult and extremely tedious. But bipolar cells excite ganglion cells, many of whose individual spike trains can be recorded simultaneously in a multi-electrode dish (2Meister M. Pine J. Baylor D.A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). So, the experiment actually monitored ganglion cells and blocked the single-photon circuit through the rod bipolar cell with the agonist APB, which also blocks ON cone bipolar cells (7Slaughter M.M. Miller R.F. Science. 1981; 211: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 3Müller F. Wässle H. Voigt T. J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 59: 1657-1672PubMed Google Scholar). With these circuits blocked, the multi-photon rod stimulus excited OFF ganglion cells. In a coneless retina, this implies a synapse from rod to OFF cone bipolar cells (see figure, indicated in red). In a normal retina, similarly blocked, the multi-photon rod response was also present in OFF ganglion cells. In this case, the electrical pathway could not be ruled out. However, the responses in coneless and normal were virtually identical in amplitude and time course, which would be surprising if their circuits differed. This functional evidence that a normal mouse retina transmits a multi-photon rod signal via an OFF bipolar cell will certainly trigger a search for the anatomical substrate. The diagram suggests a cone bipolar cell that also collects from rods, as reported briefly for gray squirrel (12West R.W. Vision Res. 1978; 18: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such a connection might explain how a human “achromat,” born essentially coneless, nevertheless possesses a functional multi-photon rod pathway (11Stockman A. Sharpe L.T. Rüther K. Nordby K. Vis. Neurosci. 1995; 12: 951-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present results do not contradict the standard version of the “twilight circuit” that routes the multi-photon rod signal via an electrical synapse to the cone. This signal, identified by its rod action spectrum and time course, is recorded in cat and monkey directly from cones (4Nelson R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1977; 172: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 6Schneeweis D.M. Schnapf J.L. Science. 1995; 268: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since 20 rods couple to each cone, this twilight signal would represent thousands of photons, comparable to what the cone itself supplies in daylight (8Smith R.G. Freed M.A. Sterling P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3505-3517PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, where a synaptic terminal transmits a multi-photon response via a chemical synapse, it tends first to average the signal by coupling to neighbors (10Sterling, P. (1998). In The Synaptic Organization of the Brain, Fourth Edition, G.M. Shepherd, ed. (New York: Oxford University Press), pp. 205–253.Google Scholar). This coupling is true for cones in mammals, but in cat and primate it is not the case for rods (5Raviola E. Gilula N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1973; 70: 1677-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 1Kolb H. J. Neurocytol. 1977; 6: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Smith R.G. Freed M.A. Sterling P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3505-3517PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if rods in normal mouse do transmit a multi-photon signal to the OFF bipolar cell, they should also form gap junctions with other rods."
