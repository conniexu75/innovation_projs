https://openalex.org/W3195051481,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health systems and economies throughout the world during 2020 and was particularly devastating for the United States, which experienced the highest numbers of reported cases and deaths during 20201-3. Many of the epidemiological features responsible for observed rates of morbidity and mortality have been reported4-8; however, the overall burden and characteristics of COVID-19 in the United States have not been comprehensively quantified. Here we use a data-driven model-inference approach to simulate the pandemic at county-scale in the United States during 2020 and estimate critical, time-varying epidemiological properties underpinning the dynamics of the virus. The pandemic in the United States during 2020 was characterized by national ascertainment rates that increased from 11.3% (95% credible interval (CI): 8.3-15.9%) in March to 24.5% (18.6-32.3%) during December. Population susceptibility at the end of the year was 69.0% (63.6-75.4%), indicating that about one third of the US population had been infected. Community infectious rates, the percentage of people harbouring a contagious infection, increased above 0.8% (0.6-1.0%) before the end of the year, and were as high as 2.4% in some major metropolitan areas. By contrast, the infection fatality rate fell to 0.3% by year's end."

Elevation of D-dimer is a potential biomarker for poor prognosis in COVID-19, though optimal cutoff value for D-dimer to predict mortality has not yet been established. This study aims to assess the accuracy of admission D-dimer in the prognosis of COVID-19 and to establish the optimal cutoff D-dimer value to predict hospital mortality. Methods Clinical and laboratory parameters and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to four hospitals in Kathmandu were retrospectively analyzed. Admitted COVID-19 cases with recorded D-dimer and definitive outcomes were included consecutively. D-dimer was measured using immunofluorescence assay and reported in Fibrinogen Equivalent Unit (μg/ml). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the accuracy of D-dimer in predicting mortality, and to calculate the optimal cutoff value, based on which patients were divided into two groups and predictive value of D-dimer for mortality was measured. Results 182 patients were included in the study out of which 34(18.7%) died during the hospital stay. The mean admission D-dimer among surviving patients was 1.067 μg/ml (±1.705 μg/ml), whereas that among patients who died was 3.208 μg/ml (±2.613 μg/ml). ROC curve for D-dimer and mortality gave an area under the curve of 0.807 (95% CI 0.728–0.886, p&lt;0.001). Optimal cutoff value for D-dimer was 1.5 μg/ml (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 78.4%). On Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the unadjusted hazard ratio for high D-dimer was 6.809 (95% CI 3.249–14.268, p&lt;0.001), and 5.862 (95% CI 2.751–12.489, p&lt;0.001) when adjusted for age. Conclusion D-dimer value on admission is an accurate biomarker for predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. 1.5 μg/ml is the optimal cutoff value of admission D-dimer for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients."

However, whether such pathogen encounters can shape the long-term trajectory of the offspring’s immune system remains unclear. Lim et al . infected pregnant mice with the common food-borne pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (YopM) (see the Perspective by Amir and Zeng). Although the infection was maternally restricted and short-lived, the offspring harbored greater numbers of intestinal T helper 17 cells into adulthood. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediated this tissue-restricted effect by acting on fetal intestinal epithelium during development. Although offspring from mothers infected with YopM or injected with IL-6 showed enhanced resistance to oral infection with Salmonella Typhimurium, they also exhibited higher susceptibility toward enteric inflammatory disease. —STS"
https://openalex.org/W3193291636,"Type III CRISPR-Cas immunity is widespread in prokaryotes and is generally mediated by multisubunit effector complexes. These complexes recognize complementary viral transcripts and can activate ancillary immune proteins. Here, we describe a type III-E effector from Candidatus “Scalindua brodae” (Sb-gRAMP), which is natively encoded by a single gene with several type III domains fused together. This effector uses CRISPR RNA to guide target RNA recognition and cleaves single-stranded RNA at two defined positions six nucleotides apart. Sb-gRAMP physically combines with the caspase-like TPR-CHAT peptidase to form the CRISPR-guided caspase (Craspase) complex, suggesting a potential mechanism of target RNA–induced protease activity to gain viral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3193760358,"The interaction between free electrons and light stands at the base of both classical and quantum physics, with applications in free-electron acceleration, radiation sources, and electron microscopy. Yet to this day, all experiments involving free-electron–light interactions are fully explained by describing the light as a classical wave. We observed quantum statistics effects of photons on free-electron–light interactions. We demonstrate interactions that pass continuously from Poissonian to super-Poissonian and up to thermal statistics, revealing a transition from quantum walk to classical random walk on the free-electron energy ladder. The electron walker serves as the probe in nondestructive quantum detection, measuring the second-order photon-correlation g(2)(0) and higher-orders g(n)(0). Unlike conventional quantum-optical detectors, the electron can perform both quantum weak measurements and projective measurements by evolving into an entangled joint state with the photons. These findings inspire hitherto inaccessible concepts in quantum optics, including free-electron–based ultrafast quantum tomography of light."

Early detection of cancer boosts increasing the survival chance up to 8%. Primarily, breast images emanating from mammograms, X-Rays or MRI are analyzed by radiologists to detect abnormalities. However, even experienced radiologists face problems in identifying features like micro-calcifications, lumps and masses, leading to high false positive and high false negative. Recent advancement in image processing and deep learning create some hopes in devising more enhanced applications that can be used for the early detection of breast cancer. In this work, we have developed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to segment and classify the various types of breast abnormalities, such as calcifications, masses, asymmetry and carcinomas, unlike existing research work, which mainly classified the cancer into benign and malignant, leading to improved disease management. Firstly, a transfer learning was carried out on our dataset using the pre-trained model ResNet50. Along similar lines, we have developed an enhanced deep learning model, in which learning rate is considered as one of the most important attributes while training the neural network. The learning rate is set adaptively in our proposed model based on changes in error curves during the learning process involved. The proposed deep learning model has achieved a performance of 88% in the classification of these four types of breast cancer abnormalities such as, masses, calcifications, carcinomas and asymmetry mammograms."

In this study, we investigated the regulatory basis of mouse cerebellum development from early neurogenesis to adulthood. By acquiring snATAC-seq (single-nucleus assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing) profiles for ~90,000 cells spanning 11 stages, we mapped cerebellar cell types and identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We detected extensive spatiotemporal heterogeneity among progenitor cells and a gradual divergence in the regulatory programs of cerebellar neurons during differentiation. Comparisons to vertebrate genomes and snATAC-seq profiles for ∼20,000 cerebellar cells from the marsupial opossum revealed a shared decrease in CRE conservation during development and differentiation as well as differences in constraint between cell types. Our work delineates the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation in cerebellar cells and provides insights into mammalian organ development."
https://openalex.org/W3194935175,"Mass gathering events (MGEs) are associated with the transmission of COVID-19. Between 6 and 10 March 2020, several MGEs related to the Falles festival took place in Borriana, a municipality in the province of Castellon (Spain). The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 and its association with these MGEs, and to quantify the potential risk factors of its occurrence.During May and June 2020, a population-based retrospective cohort study was carried out by the Public Health Center of Castelló and the Hospital de la Plana in Vila-real. Participants were obtained from a representative sample of 1663 people with potential exposure at six MGEs. A questionnaire survey was carried out to obtain information about attendance at MGEs and COVID-19 disease. In addition, a serologic survey of antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 was implemented. Inverse probability weighted regression was used in the statistical analysis.A total of 1338 subjects participated in the questionnaire survey (80.5%), 997 of whom undertook the serologic survey. Five hundred and seventy cases were observed with an attack rate (AR) of 42.6%; average age was 36 years, 62.3% were female, 536 cases were confirmed by laboratory tests, and 514 cases were found with SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Considering MGE exposure, AR was 39.2% (496/1264). A dose-response relationship was found between MGE attendance and the disease, (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 4.11 95% confidence interval [CI]3.25-5.19). Two MGEs with a dinner and dance in the same building had higher risks. Associated risk factors with the incidence were older age, obesity, and upper and middle class versus lower class; current smoking was protective.The study suggests the significance of MGEs in the COVID-19 transmission that could explain the subsequent outbreak in Borriana."
https://openalex.org/W3195801428,"In Arabidopsis, de novo organogenesis of lateral roots is patterned by an oscillatory mechanism called the root clock, which is dependent on unidentified metabolites. To determine whether retinoids regulate the root clock, we used a chemical reporter for retinaldehyde (retinal)–binding proteins. We found that retinal binding precedes the root clock and predicts sites of lateral root organogenesis. Application of retinal increased root clock oscillations and promoted lateral root formation. Expression of an Arabidopsis protein with homology to vertebrate retinoid-binding proteins, TEMPERATURE INDUCED LIPOCALIN (TIL), oscillates in the region of retinal binding to the reporter, confers retinal-binding activity in a heterologous system, and, when mutated, decreases retinal sensitivity. These results demonstrate a role for retinal and its binding partner in lateral root organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3194951073,"Coupling Bose-Einstein condensates to optical cavities has enabled the study of many-body states with long-range interactions. However, equivalent experiments with ultracold Fermi gases have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report an experimental realization of a superradiant quantum phase transition of a degenerate Fermi gas in a transversely pumped optical cavity. The self-ordering checkerboard density pattern of Fermi gases and superradiant transitions of the cavity field spontaneously emerge by increasing the pumping intensity above a threshold value. The effects of Fermi statistics are manifested by an inverse square root scaling of the threshold with atom number and the slow dynamics of low–atomic momentum states. Our work provides an ideal platform for studying nonequilibirium dynamics of many-body states for long-range interacting Fermi gases."

https://openalex.org/W3194342664,"Witchweed, or Striga hermonthica, is a parasitic weed that destroys billions of dollars' worth of crops globally every year. Its germination is stimulated by strigolactones exuded by its host plants. Despite high sequence, structure, and ligand-binding site conservation across different plant species, one strigolactone receptor in witchweed, ShHTL7, uniquely exhibits a picomolar EC50 for downstream signaling. Previous biochemical and structural analyses have hypothesized that this unique ligand sensitivity can be attributed to a large binding pocket volume in ShHTL7 resulting in enhanced ability to bind substrates, but additional structural details of the substrate-binding process would help explain its role in modulating the ligand selectivity. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that mutations at the entrance of the binding pocket facilitate a more direct ligand-binding pathway to ShHTL7, whereas hydrophobicity at the binding pocket entrance results in a stable ""anchored"" state. We also demonstrate that several residues on the D-loop of AtD14 stabilize catalytically inactive conformations. Finally, we show that strigolactone selectivity is not modulated by binding pocket volume. Our results indicate that while ligand binding is not the sole modulator of strigolactone receptor selectivity, it is a significant contributing factor. These results can be used to inform the design of selective antagonists for strigolactone receptors in witchweed."
https://openalex.org/W3194665693,"Dendritic spine dynamics are thought to be substrates for motor learning and memory, and altered spine dynamics often lead to impaired performance. Here, we describe an exception to this rule by studying mice lacking paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PirB−/−). Pyramidal neuron dendrites in PirB−/− mice have increased spine formation rates and density. Surprisingly, PirB−/− mice learn a skilled reaching task faster than wild-type (WT) littermates. Furthermore, stabilization of learning-induced spines is elevated in PirB−/− mice. Mechanistically, single-spine uncaging experiments suggest that PirB is required for NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent spine shrinkage. The degree of survival of newly formed spines correlates with performance, suggesting that increased spine stability is advantageous for learning. Acute inhibition of PirB function in M1 of adult WT mice increases the survival of learning-induced spines and enhances motor learning. These results demonstrate that there are limits on motor learning that can be lifted by manipulating PirB, even in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W3195454480,"Free-living amoeba (FLA) is widely distributed in the natural environment. Since these amoebae are widely found in various waters, they pose an important public health problem. The aim of this study was to detect the presence of Acanthamoeba, B. mandrillaris, and N. fowleri in various water resources by qPCR in Izmir, Turkey. A total of (n = 27) 18.24% Acanthamoeba and (n = 4) 2.7% N. fowleri positives were detected in six different water sources using qPCR with ITS regions (ITS1) specific primers. The resulting concentrations varied in various water samples for Acanthamoeba in the range of 3.2x105-1.4x102 plasmid copies/l and for N. fowleri in the range of 8x103-11x102 plasmid copies/l. The highest concentration of Acanthamoeba and N. fowleri was found in seawater and damp samples respectively. All 27 Acanthamoeba isolates were identified in genotype level based on the 18S rRNA gene as T4 (51.85%), T5 (22.22%), T2 (14.81%) and T15 (11.11%). The four positive N. fowleri isolate was confirmed by sequencing the ITS1, ITS2 and 5.8S rRNA regions using specific primers. Four N. fowleri isolates were genotyped (three isolate as type 2 and one isolate as type 5) and detected for the first time from water sources in Turkey. Acanthamoeba and N. fowleri genotypes found in many natural environments are straightly related to human populations to have pathogenic potentials that may pose a risk to human health. Public health professionals should raise awareness on this issue, and public awareness education should be provided by the assistance of civil authorities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the quantitative detection and distribution of Acanthamoeba and N. fowleri genotypes in various water sources in Turkey."

Evolutionarily conserved complexes such as the mitochondrial sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) mediate the assembly of β-OMPs. We investigated the SAM-mediated assembly of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) core complex. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of SAM–fully folded Tom40 and the SAM-Tom40/Tom5/Tom6 complexes at ~3-angstrom resolution reveal that Sam37 stabilizes the mature Tom40 mainly through electrostatic interactions, thus facilitating subsequent TOM assembly. These results support the β barrel switching model and provide structural insights into the assembly and release of β barrel complexes."
https://openalex.org/W3135845488,"The huge amount of data made available by the massive usage of social media has opened up the unprecedented possibility to carry out a data-driven study of political processes. While particular attention has been paid to phenomena like elite and mass polarization during online debates and echo-chambers formation, the interplay between online partisanship and framing practices, jointly sustaining adversarial dynamics, still remains overlooked. With the present paper, we carry out a socio-semantic analysis of the debate about migration policies observed on the Italian Twittersphere, across the period May-November 2019. As regards the social analysis, our methodology allows us to extract relevant information about the political orientation of the communities of users-hereby called partisan communities-without resorting upon any external information. Remarkably, our community detection technique is sensitive enough to clearly highlight the dynamics characterizing the relationship among different political forces. As regards the semantic analysis, our networks of hashtags display a mesoscale structure organized in a core-periphery fashion, across the entire observation period. Taken altogether, our results point at different, yet overlapping, trajectories of conflict played out using migration issues as a backdrop. A first line opposes communities discussing substantively of migration to communities approaching this issue just to fuel hostility against political opponents; within the second line, a mechanism of distancing between partisan communities reflects shifting political alliances within the governmental coalition. Ultimately, our results contribute to shed light on the complexity of the Italian political context characterized by multiple poles of partisan alignment."
https://openalex.org/W3194151850,"The antiquity and nature of coastal resource procurement is central to understanding human evolution and adaptations to complex environments. It has become increasingly apparent in global archaeological studies that the timing, characteristics, and trajectories of coastal resource use are highly variable. Within Africa, discussions of these issues have largely been based on the archaeological record from the south and northeast of the continent, with little evidence from eastern coastal areas leaving significant spatial and temporal gaps in our knowledge. Here, we present data from Panga ya Saidi, a limestone cave complex located 15 km from the modern Kenyan coast, which represents the first long-term sequence of coastal engagement from eastern Africa. Rather than attempting to distinguish between coastal resource use and coastal adaptations, we focus on coastal engagement as a means of characterising human relationships with marine environments and resources from this inland location. We use aquatic mollusc data spanning the past 67,000 years to document shifts in the acquisition, transportation, and discard of these materials, to better understand long-term trends in coastal engagement. Our results show pulses of coastal engagement beginning with low-intensity symbolism, and culminating in the consistent low-level transport of marine and freshwater food resources, emphasising a diverse relationship through time. Panga ya Saidi has the oldest stratified evidence of marine engagement in eastern Africa, and is the only site in Africa which documents coastal resources from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene, highlighting the potential archaeological importance of peri-coastal sites to debates about marine resource relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3195787505,"Young refugees resettled to the U.S. from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region face significant acculturative stressors, including language barriers, unfamiliar norms and practices, new institutional environments, and discrimination. While schools may ease newcomer adjustment and inclusion, they also risk exacerbating acculturative stress and social exclusion. This study seeks to understand the opportunities and challenges that schoolwide social and emotional learning (SEL) efforts may present for supporting refugee incorporation, belonging, and wellbeing. We completed semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 40 educators and other service providers in Austin, Texas, Harrisonburg, Virginia, and Detroit Metropolitan Area, Michigan as part of the SALaMA project. We conducted a thematic analysis with transcripts from these interviews guided by the framework of culturally responsive pedagogy. The findings revealed that students and providers struggled with acculturative stressors and structural barriers to meaningful engagement. Schoolwide SEL also provided several mechanisms through which schools could facilitate newcomer adjustment and belonging, which included promoting adult SEL competencies that center equity and inclusion, cultivating more meaningfully inclusive school climates, and engaging families through school liaisons from the newcomer community. We discuss the implications of these findings for systemwide efforts to deliver culturally responsive SEL, emphasize the importance of distinguishing between cultural and structural sources of inequality, and consider how these lessons extend across sectors and disciplinary traditions."
https://openalex.org/W3195862857,"Evidence for an association between uterine leiomyoma and increased risk of endometriosis is limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up periods. We assessed this association in a large nationwide sample with 14 years of data.Data were sourced from Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000).We identified 31,239 women aged ≥20 years diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma (International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 218) between Jan 1, 2000 and Dec 31, 2012, who were matched with 124,956 controls (1:4) by 5-year age groups and year of diagnosis. Follow-up was from the date of LHID2000 entry to the first occurrence of endometriosis, loss to follow-up, insurance termination, or until December 31, 2013, whichever was earlier.In Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for endometriosis in women with uterine leiomyoma was 6.44 (95% CI, 6.18, 6.72) compared with controls. The risk of endometriosis was significantly increased in women with uterine leiomyoma and comorbidities of tube-ovarian infection (aHR 2.86; 95% CI, 1.28, 6.36), endometritis (1.14; 1.06, 1.24), infertility (1.26; 1.16, 1.37), or allergic diseases (1.11; 1.05, 1.17). Having both uterine leiomyoma and endometritis significantly increased the risk of endometriosis (aHR 6.73; 95% CI, 6.07, 7.45) versus having only uterine leiomyoma (6.61; 6.33, 6.91) or endometritis (1.49; 1.31, 1.69). Similarly, having both uterine leiomyoma and infertility significantly increased the risk of endometriosis (aHR 6.95; 95% CI, 6.21, 7.78) versus having only uterine leiomyoma (6.66; 6.38, 6.96) or infertility (1.78; 1.57, 2.02).A diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma appears to increase the risk of endometriosis. Patients presenting with uterine fibroids should be encouraged to give informed consent for possible simultaneous surgical treatment of endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W3195996559,"Women are underrepresented at higher levels of promotion or leadership despite the increasing number of women physicians. In surgery, this has been compounded by historical underrepresentation. With a nation-wide focus on the importance of diversity, our aim was to provide a current snapshot of gender representation in Canadian universities.This cross-sectional online website review assessed the current faculty listings for 17 university-affiliated academic surgical training departments across Canada in the 2019/2020 academic year. Gender diversity of academic surgical faculty was assessed across surgical disciplines. Additionally, gender diversity in career advancement, as described by published leadership roles, promotion and faculty appointment, was analyzed.Women surgeons are underrepresented across Canadian surgical specialties (totals: 2,689 men versus 531 women). There are significant differences in the gender representation of surgeons between specialties and between universities, regardless of specialty. Women surgeons had a much lower likelihood of being at the highest levels of promotion (OR: 0.269, 95% CI: 0.179-0.405). Men surgeons were statistically more likely to hold academic leadership positions than women (p = 0.0002). Women surgeons had a much lower likelihood of being at the highest levels of leadership (OR: 0.372, 95% CI: 0.216-0.641).This study demonstrates that women surgeons are significantly underrepresented at the highest levels of academic promotion and leadership in Canada. Our findings allow for a direct comparison between Canadian surgical subspecialties and universities. Individual institutions can use these data to critically appraise diversity policies already in place, assess their workforce and apply a metric from which change can be measured."
https://openalex.org/W3193762338,"Sarcopenia and obesity are reportedly associated with risk of cognitive decline, and sarcopenic obesity (SO) heightens the risk, but the evidence is sparse and inconclusive. This study aimed to examine the association between SO and cognitive impairment.A total of 542 community-dwelling adults aged between 21 and 90 years were recruited. All participants were assessed for body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), handgrip strength (HGS), gait speed (GS), and cognitive function (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status). Sarcopenia was defined by the presence of low appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and low HGS or low GS according to the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria, and obesity was defined based on the upper two quintiles of fat mass index (FMI).Sarcopenia alone or in combination with obesity were not significantly associated with cognitive impairment after controlling for confounding variables. Obesity on its own was significantly associated with greater odds of impaired attention (OR: 2.05, 95%CI 1.12-3.82). Low ALMI was not associated, but low HGS, slow GS, and high FMI were individually associated with cognitive impairment: low HGS and immediate memory (OR: 1.91, 95% CI 1.04-3.49); low GS and immediate memory (OR: 2.17, 95% CI 1.26-3.72); high FMI and attention (OR: 2.06, 95% CI 1.22-3.51). Co-occurring high FMI with either low HGS or slow GS exacerbated the observed odds of global and domain-specific (attention, visuospatial) cognitive impairment.Lean mass is not relevant, whereas muscle strength and physical performance or adiposity are relevant in defining sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity in terms of their cognitive impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3195326910,"Pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction is a major pathophysiology observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ghrelin, a key regulator of metabolism, has been shown to play protective roles in the respiratory system. However, its effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier injury are unknown. In this study, the effects of ghrelin on LPS-induced ARDS and endothelial cell injury were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, mice treated with LPS (3 mg/kg intranasal application) were used to establish the ARDS model. Annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis assay, scratch-wound assay, tube formation assay, transwell permeability assay, and Western blotting experiment were performed to reveal in vitro effects and underlying mechanisms of ghrelin on endothelial barrier function. Our results showed that ghrelin had protective effects on LPS-induced ARDS and endothelial barrier disruption by inhibiting apoptosis, promoting cell migration and tube formation, and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, ghrelin stabilized LPS-induced endothelial barrier function by decreasing endothelial permeability and increasing the expression of the intercellular junction protein vascular endothelial cadherin. LY294002, a specific inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, reversed the protective effects of ghrelin on the endothelial cell barrier. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ghrelin protected against LPS-induced ARDS by impairing the pulmonary endothelial barrier partly through activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, ghrelin may be a valuable therapeutic strategy for the prevention or treatment of ARDS."

Li et al . created roundworm animal models carrying hyperactive ciliary kinases that disrupt cilia. Their genetic suppressor screens revealed that loss of an RNA adenosine deaminase, which catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, rescued ciliary abnormalities. They found that kinase hyperactivation caused this RNA adenosine deaminase to edit kinase RNA and impair kinase RNA splicing and translation, thereby downregulating ciliary kinases from nuclei. These results suggest that ciliopathies may be treated by targeting the pathways outside of cilia. —DJ"
https://openalex.org/W3160872147,"Parent-child conversations are important for children’s cognitive development, children’s ability to cope with stressful events, and can shape children’s beliefs about the causes of illness. In the context of a global pandemic, families have faced a multitude of challenges, including changes to their routines, that they need to convey to their children. Thus, parent-child conversations about the coronavirus pandemic might convey information about the causes of illness, but also about how and why it is necessary for children to modify their behaviors to comply with new social norms and medical guidance. The main goal of this study was to examine the questions children ask about the COVID-19 pandemic and how parents answer them. This survey included responses from a national sample of 349 predominantly white parents of children between the ages of 3 and 12 recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in United States. Parents reported that although children asked about COVID-19 and its causes (17.3%), children asked primarily about lifestyle changes that occurred as a result of the pandemic (24.0%) and safety (18.4%). Parents reported answering these questions by emphasizing that the purpose of different preventative measures was to protect the child (11.8%) or the family (42.7%) and providing reassurance (13.3%). Many parents discussed how it was their social responsibility to slow the spread of the virus (38.4%). Parents of younger children tended to shield them from information about COVID-19 (p = .038), while parents with more knowledge were more likely to provide explanations (p &lt; .001). Our analysis shows that families not only discuss information about the virus but also information about changes to their lifestyle, preventative measures, and social norms."
https://openalex.org/W3194256033,"Interprofessional Education (IPE) is one approach to improving communication and collaborative practice between professions, which are essential for the optimal delivery of healthcare. Common barriers include negative attitudes, professional stereotypes, professional cultures and power differentials between professional groups. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore how professional hierarchies and power differentials shape interprofessional interactions between preregistration pharmacy and medicine students. Data were gathered via semi-structured interviews and subject to thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: Reproducing traditional hierarchies; Social norms around respect; Hierarchies in care values and goals; and Challenging the narrative is possible. Students' interactions with and views of the other profession largely reflected traditional stereotypes and power differentials. Hierarchy was evident in how respect was accorded and in how care values and goals were managed. Despite this, students overwhelmingly perceived and reported a sense of agency in changing the status quo. Emerging professional identity and conceptualisation of future roles is heavily influenced by the hierarchical relationship between the professions and can pose a significant barrier to collaborative practice. Greater support for collaborative interprofessional practice is needed at the level of policy and accreditation in health education and healthcare to ensure greater commitment to change."
https://openalex.org/W3196020523,"Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI), a downregulator of Rho family GTPases, prevents nucleotide exchange and membrane association. It is responsible for the activation of Rho GTPases, which regulate a variety of cellular processes, such as migration. Although RhoGDI2 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene involved in cellular migration and invasion, little is known about its role in vascular endothelial cell (EC) migration. CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1) is a CR6/GADD45-interacting protein with important mitochondrial functions and regulation of cell growth. We examined the expression of RhoGDI2 in CRIF1-deficient human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and its role in cell migration. Expression of RhoGDI2 was found to be considerably higher in CRIF1-deficient HUVECs along with suppression of cell migration. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of Akt and CREB were decreased in CRIF1-silenced cells. The Akt-CREB signaling pathway was implicated in the changes in endothelial cell migration caused by CRIF1 downregulation. In addition to RhoGDI2, we identified another factor that promotes migration and invasion of ECs. Adrenomedullin2 (ADM2) is an autocrine/paracrine factor that regulates vascular tone and other vascular functions. Endogenous ADM2 levels were elevated in CRIF1-silenced HUVECs with no effect on cell migration. However, siRNA-mediated depletion of RhoGDI2 or exogenous ADM2 administration significantly restored cell migration via the Akt-CREB signaling pathway. In conclusion, RhoGDI2 and ADM2 play important roles in the migration of CRIF1-deficient endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3193812450,"Patients vary in their preferences regarding involvement in medical decision-making. Current research does not provide complete explanation for this observed variation. Patient involvement in medical decision-making has been found to be influenced by various mechanisms, one of which could be patients' trust in physicians. The aim of this study was to examine whether trust in physicians fosters or impairs patient involvement in medical decision-making. This study also aimed to determine to what extent the relationship between trust and preferences regarding decision-making roles was influenced by the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients. We hypothesised that trust can both foster and impair patient involvement in medical decision-making.A survey was sent out to members of the Nivel Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel in February 2016 (response rate = 47%, N = 703). The Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale was used to measure trust. Patient involvement was measured using two items based on the study published by Flynn and colleagues in 2006. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse the relationship between trust and patient involvement.We found a negative relationship between trust and patient involvement in medical decision-making in men. Women with high trust reported to be more involved in medical decision-making compared to men with high trust.The results suggest that trust impairs involvement in medical decision-making for men but not for women. Further research could provide a more comprehensive explanation of the variation in patient preferences regarding involvement in medical decision-making to further elucidate which underlying mechanisms could enhance patient participation."

https://openalex.org/W3194683871,"The surveillance of human salmonellosis in Belgium is dependent on the referral of human Salmonella isolates to the National Reference Center (NRC). Knowledge of current diagnostic practices and the coverage of the national Salmonella surveillance system are important to correctly interpret surveillance data and trends over time, to estimate the true burden of salmonellosis in Belgium, and to evaluate the appropriateness of implementing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at this central level.The coverage of the NRC was defined as the proportion of all diagnosed human Salmonella cases in Belgium reported to the NRC and was assessed for 2019 via a survey among all licensed Belgian medical laboratories in 2019, and for 2016-2020 via a capture-recapture study using the Sentinel Network of Laboratories (SNL) as the external source. In addition, the survey was used to assess the impact of the implementation of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) at the level of peripheral laboratory sites, as a potential threat to national public health surveillance programs.The coverage of the NRC surveillance system was estimated to be 83% and 85%, based on the results of the survey and on the two-source capture-recapture study, respectively. Further, the results of the survey indicated a limited use of CIDTs by peripheral laboratories in 2019.Given the high coverage and the limited impact of CIDTs on the referral of isolates, we may conclude that the NRC can confidently monitor the epidemiological situation and identify outbreaks throughout the country. These findings may guide the decision to implement WGS at the level of the NRC and may improve estimates of the true burden of salmonellosis in Belgium."
https://openalex.org/W3195642974,"The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex maintains correct Golgi structure and function during retrograde trafficking. Glycine max has 2 paralogs of each COG gene, with one paralog of each gene family having a defense function to the parasitic nematode Heterodera glycines. Experiments presented here show G. max COG paralogs functioning in defense are expressed specifically in the root cells (syncytia) undergoing the defense response. The expressed defense COG gene COG7-2-b is an alternate splice variant, indicating specific COG variants are important to defense. Transcriptomic experiments examining RNA isolated from COG overexpressing and RNAi roots show some COG genes co-regulate the expression of other COG complex genes. Examining signaling events responsible for COG expression, transcriptomic experiments probing MAPK overexpressing roots show their expression influences the relative transcript abundance of COG genes as compared to controls. COG complex paralogs are shown to be found in plants that are agriculturally relevant on a world-wide scale including Manihot esculenta, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare, Sorghum bicolor, Brassica rapa, Elaes guineensis and Saccharum officinalis and in additional crops significant to U.S. agriculture including Beta vulgaris, Solanum tuberosum, Solanum lycopersicum and Gossypium hirsutum. The analyses provide basic information on COG complex biology, including the coregulation of some COG genes and that MAPKs functioning in defense influence their expression. Furthermore, it appears in G. max and likely other crops that some level of neofunctionalization of the duplicated genes is occurring. The analysis has identified important avenues for future research broadly in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3193409565,"The brain continuously produces internal activity in the absence of afferently salient sensory input. Spontaneous neural activity is intrinsically defined by circuit structures and associated with the mode of information processing and behavioral responses. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous activity in the visual cortices of behaving animals remain almost elusive. Using a custom-made electrode array, we recorded 32-site electrocorticograms in the primary and secondary visual cortex of freely behaving rats and determined the propagation patterns of spontaneous neural activity. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering revealed multiple discrete states of the activity patterns. The activity remained stable in one state and suddenly jumped to another state. The diversity and dynamics of the internally switching cortical states would imply flexibility of neural responses to various external inputs."
https://openalex.org/W3194408556,"In the past, wild edible alimurgic plants became an important alternative food source when poverty, wars or drought made it difficult to access crops. These plants were considered rich in highly nutritional compounds and also frequently used as food-medicine given their health-promoting properties. With the aim of improving our knowledge on the content of beneficial or detrimental compounds in relation with past local dietary and curative traditions, 12 wild food plant species were collected from two study areas selected for their very different degree of industrialization, urbanization, and conservation of local past traditions among the population: the Bologna province (Northern Italy) and the Middle Agri Valley (Southern Italy). Protein, polyphenol flavonoid and biogenic amine (both free and conjugated) contents and antioxidant activity of raw and boiled wild food plant extracts, and of cooking water were analyzed by means of spectrophotometric and high-performance liquid chromatography methods. The results demonstrated that most of the phenolic compounds were released in the cooking water which also showed the highest antioxidant activity. Seventeen different phenolic compounds were identified, of which the health-related luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside and rutin were the most abundant (e.g., S. pratensis L. and C. intybus L.). On the other hand, biogenic amines were absent or present at very low levels in cooking water of those very same species (e.g., S. pratensis L., T. officinalis Weber, C. vesicaria subsp. taraxacifolia and C. intybus L.) of which traditionally a decoction is used for therapeutic purposes. Free and conjugated spermidine and spermine were generally the most abundant biogenic amines, while none of the known detrimental monoamines (e.g., histamine) was detected. In conclusion, the present results seem to support past local popular traditions which indicated beneficial medical properties of some wild edible plant, as well as of their cooking water."
https://openalex.org/W3194498271,"There are five known general catalytic mechanisms used by enzymes to catalyze carbohydrate epimerization. The amino sugar epimerase N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase (NanE) has been proposed to use a deprotonation-reprotonation mechanism, with an essential catalytic lysine required for both steps. However, the structural determinants of this mechanism are not clearly established. We characterized NanE from Staphylococcus aureus using a new coupled assay to monitor NanE catalysis in real time and found that it has kinetic constants comparable with other species. The crystal structure of NanE from Staphylococcus aureus, which comprises a triosephosphate isomerase barrel fold with an unusual dimeric architecture, was solved with both natural and modified substrates. Using these substrate-bound structures, we identified the following active-site residues lining the cleft at the C-terminal end of the β-strands: Gln11, Arg40, Lys63, Asp124, Glu180, and Arg208, which were individually substituted and assessed in relation to the mechanism. From this, we re-evaluated the central role of Glu180 in this mechanism alongside the catalytic lysine. We observed that the substrate is bound in a conformation that ideally positions the C5 hydroxyl group to be activated by Glu180 and donate a proton to the C2 carbon. Taken together, we propose that NanE uses a novel substrate-assisted proton displacement mechanism to invert the C2 stereocenter of N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate. Our data and mechanistic interpretation may be useful in the development of inhibitors of this enzyme or in enzyme engineering to produce biocatalysts capable of changing the stereochemistry of molecules that are not amenable to synthetic methods."
https://openalex.org/W3193502122,"Genetic variants in microRNAs (miRNAs) can alter the miRNAs expression and/or function, accordingly, affecting the related biological pathways and disease risk. Dysregulation of miR-155 and miR-146a expression levels has been well-described in viral hepatitis B (HBV). In the current study, we aimed to assess rs767649 T/A and rs57095329 A/G polymorphisms in miR-155, and miR-146a genes, respectively, as risk factors for Chronic HBV (CHBV) in the Egyptian population. Also, we aimed to do in silico analysis to investigate the molecules that primarily target these miRNAs. One hundred patients diagnosed as CHBV and one hundred age and sex-matched controls with evidence of past HBV infection were genotyped for miR-155 (rs767649) and miR-146a (rs57095329) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The rs767649 AT and AA genotypes in CHBV patients confer four folds and ten folds risk respectively, as compared to control subjects [(AOR = 4.245 (95%CI 2.009-8.970), p<0.0001) and AOR = 10.583 (95%CI 4.012-27.919), p<0.0001, respectively)]. The rs767649 A allele was associated with an increased risk of developing CHBV (AOR = 2.777 (95%CI 1.847-4.175), p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in the frequency of rs57095329 AG and GG genotypes in CHBV patients compared to controls. AG and GG genotypes showed an increase in the risk of developing CHBV by about three and six folds respectively [AOR = 2.610 (95%CI 1.362-5.000), p = 0.004] and [AOR = 5.604 (95%CI 2.157-14.563), p<0.0001].We concluded that rs57095329 and rs767649 SNPs can act as potential risk factors for the development of CHBV in the Egyptian population."
https://openalex.org/W3193636555,"Predator-prey interactions play a key life history role, as animals cope with changing predation risk and opportunities to hunt prey. It has recently been shown that the hunting success of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) targeting fish larvae is dependent on both the size of the prey and the prior exposure of its species to stickleback predation. The purpose of the current study was to identify the behavioural predator-prey interactions explaining the success or failure of sticklebacks hunting larvae of three potential prey species [roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and whitefish (Coregonus wartmannii)] in a 3D environment. Trials were carried out for each prey species at four different size classes in a standardised laboratory setup and were recorded using a slow motion, stereo camera setup. 75 predator-prey interactions including both failed and successful hunts were subject to the analysis. 3D track analysis indicated that sticklebacks applied different strategies. Prey with less complex predator escape responses, i.e. whitefish larvae, were hunted using a direct but stealthy approach ending in a lunge, while the behaviourally more complex roach and perch larvae were hunted with a faster approach. A multivariate logistic regression identified that slow average speed and acceleration of the prey in the initial stages of the hunt increased the probability of stickleback success. Furthermore, predators adjusted their swimming direction more often when hunting larger whitefish compared to smaller whitefish. The results suggest that appropriate and adequately timed avoidance behaviours, which vary between prey species and ontogenetic stages, significantly increase the chances of outmanoeuvring and escaping stickleback predation. Small whitefish larvae can reach similar levels of swimming performance compared to older conspecifics, but display ineffective anti-predator behaviours, resulting in higher hunting success for sticklebacks. Thus, the development of appropriate anti-predator behaviours depending on size appears to be the crucial factor to escaping predation."

ALD_RP9 are two novel bacterial isolates from mangrove sediment and a moderately hypersaline pool on the Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. The isolates represent two novel species were characterised physiologically and genomically. Pontibacillus sp. ALD_SL1 is a facultatively anaerobic yellow, motile, rod-shaped Gram-positive, which grows optimally at a NaCl concentration of 11%, pH 7 and 28°C. It is the third facultatively anaerobic member of the genus Pontibacillus. The organism gains energy through the fermentation of pyruvate to acetate and ethanol under anaerobic conditions. The genome is the first among Pontibacillus that harbours a megaplasmid. Psychroflexus sp. ALD_RP9 is an aerobic heterotroph, which can generate energy by employing bacteriorhodopsins. It forms Gram-negative, orange, non-motile rods. The strain grows optimally at NaCl concentrations of 10%, pH 6.5-8 and 20°C. The Psychroflexus isolate tolerated pH conditions up to 10.5, which is the highest pH tolerance currently recorded for the genus. Psychroflexus sp. ALD_RP9 taxonomically belongs to the clade with the smallest genomes. Both isolates show extensive adaptations to their saline environments yet utilise different mechanisms to ensure survival."

Despite ongoing implementation of the WHO multimodal Hand Hygiene (HH) Improvement Strategy, healthcare-associated infection rate continues to be twofold higher in low- than in high-income countries. This study focused on continued evaluation of HH compliance and knowledge. The mixed method approach, with inclusion of patients and care-givers, provided insight into challenges and facilitators of the WHO HH Improvement Strategy, and highlighted improvement points.An uncontrolled, before-and-after intervention, mixed methods study in Faranah Regional Hospital was conducted from December 2017 to August 2019. The intervention implemented the WHO HH Strategy including HH training for healthcare workers (HCWs), and the relaunch of the local production of alcohol-based handrub (ABHR). A baseline assessment of HH knowledge, perception and compliance of HCWs was done prior to the intervention and compared to two follow-up assessments. The second follow-up assessment was complemented by a qualitative component.Overall compliance six months post-intervention was 45.1% and significantly higher than baseline but significantly lower than in first follow-up. Knowledge showed similar patterns of improvement and waning. The perception survey demonstrated high appreciation of the intervention, such as local production of ABHR. HCW's were concerned about overconsuming of ABHR, however simultaneous quantitative measurements showed that consumption in fact was 36% of the estimated amount needed for sufficient HH compliance. Potential fields for improvement identified by HCWs to enhance sustainability were permanent ABHR availability, having a dedicated person with ownership over continuous simulation HH trainings including simulations to improve technique.The study shows that the WHO multimodal HH strategy has a positive effect on HCW compliance and knowledge. Improvement points identified by local staff like sensitization on appropriate ABHR amount per HH action should be considered for sustainable HH improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3194596897,"Anterior cruciate ligament injuries result in posttraumatic osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee, even after surgical treatment. How the chondrocyte distribution within the articular cartilage changes early in this process is currently unknown. The study objective was to investigate the chondrocyte distribution within the medial femoral condyle after an anterior cruciate ligament transection in a preclinical model. Forty-two adolescent Yucatan minipigs were allocated to receive unilateral anterior cruciate ligament surgery (n = 36) or no surgery (n = 6). Central coronal sections of the medial femoral condyle were obtained at 1- and 4 weeks after surgery, and the chondrocyte distribution was measured via whole slide imaging and a cell counting batch processing tool utilized in ImageJ. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry was performed to identify proliferating cells. Empty lacunae, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, and pyknosis were used to identify areas of irreversible cell injury. The mean area of irreversible cell injury was 0% in the intact controls, 13.4% (95% confidence interval: 6.4, 20.3) at 1-week post-injury and 19.3% (9.7, 28.9) at 4 weeks post-injury (p < .015). These areas occurred closest to the femoral intra-articular notch. The remaining areas containing viable chondrocytes had Ki-67-positive cells (p < .02) and increased cell density in the middle (p < .03) and deep zones (p = .001). For the entire section, the total chondrocyte number did not change significantly post-operatively; however, the density of cells in the peripheral regions of the medial femoral condyle increased significantly at 1- and 4 weeks post-injury relative to the intact control groups (p = .032 and .004, respectively). These data demonstrate a peripheral shift in the viable chondrocyte population of the medial femoral condyle after anterior cruciate ligament injury and further suggest that chondrocytes with the capacity to proliferate are not confined to one particular cartilage layer."
https://openalex.org/W3194795644,"Diversion of prescription opioid medication is a contributor to the opioid epidemic. Safe handling practices can reduce the risk of diversion. We aimed to understand: 1) if orthopaedic patients received instructions on how to safely handle opioids, 2) their typical storage/disposal practices, and 3) their willingness to participate in an opioid disposal program (ODP).Cross-sectional study of adult orthopaedic patients who completed an anonymous survey on current or past prescription opioid use, instruction on handling, storage and disposal practices, presence of children in the household, and willingness to participate in an ODP. Frequencies and percentages of responses were computed, both overall and stratified by possession of unused opioids.569 respondents who reported either current or past prescription opioid use were analyzed. 44% reported receiving storage instructions and 56% reported receiving disposal instructions from a health care provider. Many respondents indicated unsafe handling practices: possessing unused opioids (34%), using unsafe storage methods (90%), and using unsafe disposal methods (34%). Respondents with unused opioids were less likely to report receiving handling instructions or using safe handling methods, and 47% of this group reported having minors or young adults in the household. Respondents who received storage and disposal instructions were more likely to report safe storage and disposal methods. Seventy-four percent of respondents reported that they would participate in an ODP.While many orthopaedic patients report inadequate education on safe opioid handling and using unsafe handling practices, findings suggest targeted education is associated with better behaviours. However, patients are willing to safely dispose of unused medication if provided a convenient option. These findings suggest a need to address patient knowledge and behavior regarding opioid handling to reduce the risk of opioid diversion."
https://openalex.org/W3195346691,"The Halo Effect is a widely studied phenomenon that interests multiple disciplines. The relationship between Aesthetics Appearance and perceived Trustworthiness has especially gathered the attention of social scientists. While experimental works compared the strength of the Halo Effect in different situations (e.g. different genders’ faces), little is known about the stability of the Halo. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been urged to distance ourselves from others. Similar suggestions may alter the relationship between Aesthetic Appearance and Perceived Trustworthiness. Moreover, previous works reported that individuals’ attachment styles affected their emotional responses to the pandemic. Individuals’ attachment styles may influence the magnitude of change of the Halo. Here we investigate how priming (Social Distancing or Contact with others) affects the strength of the Halo Effect, with respect to individuals’ attachment styles. Participants (N = 298) rated the Aesthetics and Perceived Trustworthiness of strangers’ faces (N = 96) presented twice, before and after the presentation of a prime. Results revealed that individuals’ attachment styles affect the strength of the Halo. However, we found no evidence supporting the fact that different attachment styles lead to differences in the magnitude of changes after priming. Results help shed light on how attachment styles influence individuals’ impression formation."
https://openalex.org/W3195683798,"Our own unique character traits make our behavior consistent and define our individuality. Yet, this consistency does not entail that we behave repetitively like machines. Like humans, animals also combine personality traits with spontaneity to produce adaptive behavior: consistent, but not fully predictable. Here, we study an iconically rigid behavioral trait, insect phototaxis, that nevertheless also contains both components of individuality and spontaneity. In a light/dark T-maze, approximately 70% of a group of Drosophila fruit flies choose the bright arm of the T-Maze, while the remaining 30% walk into the dark. Taking the photopositive and the photonegative subgroups and re-testing them reveals the spontaneous component: a similar 70-30 distribution emerges in each of the two subgroups. Increasing the number of choices to ten choices, reveals the individuality component: flies with an extremely negative series of first choices were more likely to show photonegative behavior in subsequent choices and vice versa. General behavioral traits, independent of light/dark preference, contributed to the development of this individuality. The interaction of individuality and spontaneity together explains why group averages, even for such seemingly stereotypical behaviors, are poor predictors of individual choices."
https://openalex.org/W3193795232,"Rational protein design aims at the targeted modification of existing proteins. To reach this goal, software suites like Rosetta propose sequences to introduce the desired properties. Challenging design problems necessitate the representation of a protein by means of a structural ensemble. Thus, Rosetta multi-state design (MSD) protocols have been developed wherein each state represents one protein conformation. Computational demands of MSD protocols are high, because for each of the candidate sequences a costly three-dimensional (3D) model has to be created and assessed for all states. Each of these scores contributes one data point to a complex, design-specific energy landscape. As neural networks (NN) proved well-suited to learn such solution spaces, we integrated one into the framework Rosetta:MSF instead of the so far used genetic algorithm with the aim to reduce computational costs. As its predecessor, Rosetta:MSF:NN administers a set of candidate sequences and their scores and scans sequence space iteratively. During each iteration, the union of all candidate sequences and their Rosetta scores are used to re-train NNs that possess a design-specific architecture. The enormous speed of the NNs allows an extensive assessment of alternative sequences, which are ranked on the scores predicted by the NN. Costly 3D models are computed only for a small fraction of best-scoring sequences; these and the corresponding 3D-based scores replace half of the candidate sequences during each iteration. The analysis of two sets of candidate sequences generated for a specific design problem by means of a genetic algorithm confirmed that the NN predicted 3D-based scores quite well; the Pearson correlation coefficient was at least 0.95. Applying Rosetta:MSF:NN:enzdes to a benchmark consisting of 16 ligand-binding problems showed that this protocol converges ten-times faster than the genetic algorithm and finds sequences with comparable scores."
https://openalex.org/W3194291742,"Si cycling is linked with processes from global carbon sequestration to community composition and is especially important in aquatic ecosystems. Lake Michigan has seen dramatic fluctuations in dissolved silica (dSi) over several decades, which have been examined in the context of planktonic processes (diatom blooms), but the role of benthic organisms (macroalgae and their epiphytes) in Si cycling have not been explored. To assess significance of nearshore benthic algae in Si dynamics, we assembled dSi data from an offshore site sampled since the late 1980's, and sampled off three Milwaukee beaches during 2005-19. Using colorimetric assays and alkaline digestion, we measured dSi, biogenic silica in particulate suspended material (pSi) and biogenic silica in benthic macroalgae (Cladophora) and epiphytic diatoms (bSi). Offshore, dSi increased about 1 μM per year from 25 μM in the late 1980's to nearly 40 μM in 2019. Nearshore dSi fluctuated dramatically annually, from near zero to concentrations similar to offshore. Both Cladophora and its epiphytes contained significant bSi, reaching up to 30% of dry mass (300 mg Si g dry mass-1) of the assemblage in summer. Microscopic analyses including localization with a Si-specific-stain and X-ray microanalysis showed bSi in epiphytic diatom cells walls, but the nature and localization of Si in macroalgae remained unclear. A simple model was developed estimating Si demand of algae using the areal macroalgal biomass, growth rates inferred from P-content, and bSi content, and comparing Si demand with dSi available in the water column. This indicated that 7-70% of the dSi in water overlying nearshore benthic algal beds could be removed per day. Key elements of the Si cycle, including which organisms sequester bSi and how rapidly Si is recycled, remain unclear. This work has implications for coastal marine waters where large macroalgal biomass accumulates but bSi content is virtually unknown."
https://openalex.org/W3194468025,"White adipocytes store energy differently than brown and brite adipocytes which dissipate energy under the form of heat. Studies have shown that adipocytes are able to respond to bacteria thanks to the presence of Toll-like receptors at their surface. Despite this, little is known about the involvement of each class of adipocytes in the infectious response. We treated mice for one week with a β3-adrenergic receptor agonist to induce activation of brown adipose tissue and brite adipocytes within white adipose tissue. Mice were then injected intraperitoneally with E. coli to generate acute infection. The metabolic, infectious and inflammatory parameters of the mice were analysed during 48 hours after infection. Our results shown that in response to bacteria, thermogenic activity promoted a discrete and local anti-inflammatory environment in white adipose tissue characterized by the increase of the IL-1RA secretion. More generally, activation of brown and brite adipocytes did not modify the host response to infection including no additive effect with fever and an equivalent bacteria clearance and inflammatory response. In conclusion, these results suggest an IL-1RA-mediated immunomodulatory activity of thermogenic adipocytes in response to acute bacterial infection and open a way to characterize their effect along more chronic infection as septicaemia."

More research is needed to understand the quantity, frequency, and timing of antenatal alcohol use; and potential impacts on neonates; and to identify services that are acceptable and effective among pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3195583431,"Scientific evidence plays an important role in the therapeutic decision-making process. What happens when physicians are forced to make therapeutic decisions under uncertainty? The absence of scientific guidelines at the beginning of a pandemic due to an unknown virus, such as COVID-19, could influence the perceived legitimacy of the application of non-evidence-based therapeutic approaches. This paper reports on a test of this hypothesis, in which we administered an ad hoc questionnaire to a sample of 64 Italian physicians during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (April 2020). The questionnaire statements regarding the legitimacy of off-label or experimental drugs were framed according to three different scenarios (Normality, Emergency and COVID-19). Furthermore, as the perception of internal bodily sensations (i.e., interoception) modulates the decision-making process, we tested participants’ interoceptive sensibility using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). The results showed that participants were more inclined to legitimate non-evidence-based therapeutic approaches in the COVID-19 and Emergency scenarios than the Normality scenario. We also found that scores on the MAIA Trusting subscale positively predicted this difference. Our findings demonstrate that uncertain medical scenarios, involving a dramatic increase in patient volume and acuity, can increase risk-taking in therapeutic decision-making. Furthermore, individual characteristics of health care providers, such as interoceptive ability, should be taken into account when constructing models to prevent the breakdown of healthcare systems in cases of severe emergency."
https://openalex.org/W3194615693,"Cross talk between different signaling pathways is thought to be important for regulation of homeostasis of, as well as oncogenesis of, the intestinal epithelium. Expression of an active form of K-Ras specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of mice (IEC-RasDA mice) resulted in the development of hyperplasia in the small intestine and colon of mice. IEC-RasDA mice also manifested the increased proliferation of IECs. In addition, the number of goblet cells markedly increased, while that of Paneth cells decreased in IEC-RasDA mice. Development of intestinal organoids was markedly enhanced for IEC-RasDA mice compared with control mice. Whereas, the expression of Wnt target genes was significantly reduced in the in intestinal crypts from IEC-RasDA mice compared with that apparent for the control. Our results thus suggest that K-Ras promotes the proliferation of IECs as well as generation of goblet cells. By contrast, Ras counter-regulates the Wnt signaling and thereby contribute to the proper regulation of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3195869230,"Induction and augmentation of labor is one of the most common obstetrical interventions. However, this intervention is not free of risks and could cause adverse events, such as hyperactive uterine contraction, uterine rupture, and amniotic-fluid embolism. Our previous study using a new animal model showed that labor induced with high-dose oxytocin (OXT) in pregnant mice resulted in massive cell death in selective brain regions, specifically in male offspring. The affected brain regions included the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but a detailed study in the PFC subregions has not been performed. In this study, we induced labor in mice using high-dose OXT and investigated neonatal brain damage in detail in the PFC using light and electron microscopy. We found that TUNEL-positive or pyknotic nuclei and Iba-1-positive microglial cells were detected more abundantly in infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortex of the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) in male pups delivered by OXT-induced labor than in the control male pups. These Iba-1-positive microglial cells were engulfing dying cells. Additionally, we also noticed that in the forceps minor (FMI) of the corpus callosum (CC), the number of TUNEL-positive or pyknotic nuclei and Iba-1-positive microglial cells were largely increased and Iba-1-positive microglial cells phagocytosed massive dying cells in male pups delivered by high-dose OXT-induced labor. In conclusion, IL and PL of the vmPFC and FMI of the CC, were susceptible to brain damage in male neonates after high-dose OXT-induced labor."
