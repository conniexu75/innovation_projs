https://openalex.org/W2061911460,"In the photosynthetic evolution of oxygen, water oxidation occurs at a catalytic site that includes four manganese atoms together with the essential cofactors, the calcium and chlorine ions. A structural model and a determination of the manganese oxidation states based on x-ray absorption spectroscopy are presented. The salient features, in both higher plants and cyanobacteria, are a pair of di-μ-oxo bridged manganese binuclear clusters linked by a mono-μ-oxo bridge, one proximal calcium atom, and one halide. In dark-adapted samples, manganese occurs in oxidation states (III) and (IV). Data from oriented membranes display distinct dichroism, precluding highly symmetrical structures for the manganese complex."

Sequences that flanked the transgenic integration site were cloned and mapped to mouse chromosome 4, between the Tsha and Hxb loci. During early embryonic development, the direction of postimplantation turning, one of the earliest manifestations of left-right asymmetry, was reversed in homozygous transgenic embryos. This insertional mutation identifies a gene that controls embryonic turning and visceral left-right polarity."

https://openalex.org/W2044984503,"Long-finned pilot whales swim in large, extremely cohesive social groups known as pods. Molecular typing revealed that pod members form a single extended family. Mature males neither disperse from nor mate within their natal pods, a situation unusual for mammals. Such behavior could be explained in terms of inclusive fitness benefits gained by adult males helping the large number of female relatives with which they swim."

https://openalex.org/W1972358245,"Condensation of a vapor to a liquid on a cold surface that is not wet completely by this liquid leads to the formation of an array of droplets. If the surface is heterogeneous in its physical properties (especially its interfacial free energy), the patterns of these arrays reflect this heterogeneity. The distribution of droplets of water (condensation figures or CFs) observed by optical microscopy on a surface can be correlated with the molecular structure of that surface. The substrates used to investigate the formation and morphology of the CFs were patterned, self-assembled monolayers of different alkanethiolates on gold and of alkyl siloxanes on glass. Analysis of CFs is a valuable nondestructive technique for characterizing heterogeneities in surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W1992360691,"Sensorineural hearing loss resulting from the loss of auditory hair cells is thought to be irreversible in mammals. This study provides evidence that retinoic acid can stimulate the regeneration in vitro of mammalian auditory hair cells in ototoxic-poisoned organ of Corti explants in the rat. In contrast, treatment with retinoic acid does not stimulate the formation of extra hair cells in control cultures of Corti's organ. Retinoic acid-stimulated hair cell regeneration can be blocked by cytosine arabinoside, which suggests that a period of mitosis is required for the regeneration of auditory hair cells in this system. These results provide hope for a recovery of hearing function in mammals after auditory hair cell damage."

https://openalex.org/W2094197485,"A congenic, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain that contains a segment of chromosome 3 from the diabetes-resistant mouse strain B6.PL-Thy-1a was less susceptible to diabetes than NOD mice. A fully penetrant immunological defect also mapped to this segment, which encodes the high-affinity Fc receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG), Fc gamma RI. The NOD Fcgr1 allele, which results in a deletion of the cytoplasmic tail, caused a 73 percent reduction in the turnover of cell surface receptor-antibody complexes. The development of congenic strains and the characterization of Mendelian traits that are specific to the disease phenotype demonstrate the feasibility of dissecting the pathophysiology of complex, non-Mendelian diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2006296558,"Intermediate filaments are abundant cytoskeletal components whose specific cellular functions are poorly understood. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein MDM1 displays structure and solubility properties that are similar to those of intermediate filament proteins of animal cells. Yeast cells that have a mutant form of MDM1 exhibit temperature-sensitive growth and defective transfer of nuclei and mitochondria to daughter cells during incubation at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 degrees C. The purified, wild-type MDM1 protein readily forms 10-nanometer-wide filaments at either 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C. In contrast, the purified, mutant protein forms filaments at 4 degrees C but fails to form such structures at 37 degrees C. These results suggest that intermediate filament proteins are universal components of eukaryotic cells."
