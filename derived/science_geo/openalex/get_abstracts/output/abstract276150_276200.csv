When they had been prevented from viewing the night sky prior to the autumn migration season, birds tested under planetarium skies were unable to select the normal migration direction. By contrast, when they had been exposed as juveniles to a normal, rotating, planetarium sky, individuals displayed typical southerly directional preferences. The third group was exposed to an incorrect planetarium sky in which the stars rotated about a fictitious axis. When tested during the autumn, these birds took up the ""correct"" migration direction relative to the new axis of rotation. These results fail to support the hypothesis of a ""genetic star map."" They suggest, instead, a maturation process in which stellar cues come to be associated with a directional reference system provided by the axis of celestial rotation."

Previous studies have emphasized the role of volatile inhibitors of plant growth in producing this bare zone. However, there is a concentration of feeding activity by rodents, rabbits, and birds in this zone; if this activity is prevented by means of wire-mesh exclosures, annuals grow in the bare zone. Thus, animal activity is sufficient to produce the bare zone."

For iridium(III) species three types of emission have been observed, each originating from a different and orbitally identifiable excited state. Principles useful for designing new luminescent materials are formulated. They can be used for guiding photochemical research and for designing new analytical methods."

This new phase is metastable and has a sphalerite-like structure."

https://openalex.org/W2020049074,The Apollo helmets are being used to record the dose of heavy particles to which astronauts are exposed on space missions. An improved method for examining and identifying the etched tracks of heavy charged particles consists of replicating tracks and measuring the etching rate as a function of position along the track. Tracks have been observed in Apollo helmets that correspond to ionized atoms heavier than iron.
https://openalex.org/W2135286062,"Venus now has a retrograde and negligible spin, but it very likely started with a typical planetary spin: prograde and with a 10- to 20-hour period. The usually assumed mechanism of solar tidal friction is quite insufficient to remove this angular momentum. Instead, we postulate capture of a moonlike object from an initially retrograde orbit: it would despin Venus and suddenly transform the planet's rotational kinetic energy into internal heat, which would lead to volcanism and the liberation of large amounts of volatiles. The moon would disappear by crashing into the surface of Venus."

https://openalex.org/W2020893546,Speeds as high as 44 centimeters per second were observed 200 meters above the ocean bottom under the Gulf Stream at 70 degrees W longitude and were associated with time-dependent motion that had a speed range of 40 centimeters per second and a time scale of about 30 days. These deep current fluctuations appear to be coupled with fluctuations in the surface position of the Stream and with surface and bottom current fluctuations 200 kilometers to the north.

https://openalex.org/W2046248857,"Two antagonists of ""normal"" proline-hydroxyproline-protein synthesis, 2,2'-dipyridyl and hydroxy-L-proline, induced the same kind of phenovariation in Nowellia curvifolia (Dicks) Mitt. (Cephaloziaceae) as they do in Scapania nemorosa (Scapaniaceae). This finding supports a hypothesized cardinal role for proline-hydroxyproline-protein in modulating aspects of morphogenesis and phylogeny in the leafy liverworts."

Schenek (Science, October 8, pp. 367-372), the last sentence of paragraph 2, page 369, should read: ""Production has been increased from the 1945 level of 4,000,000,000-5,000,000,000 pounds to more than 7,000,000,000 pounds which is about as much as the present fishing area can support."" In the article the pounds were erroneously given in millions instead of billions."
