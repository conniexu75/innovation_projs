https://openalex.org/W3107151174,"Objective In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a retrospective study. Methods Subjects admitted to 11 designated public hospitals in Taiwan between April 1 and May 31, 2020, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by pharyngeal real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, were randomized at a 2:1 ratio and stratified by mild or moderate illness. HCQ (400 mg twice for 1 d or HCQ 200 mg twice daily for 6 days) was administered. Both the study and control group received standard of care (SOC). Pharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected every other day. The proportion and time to negative viral PCR were assessed on day 14. In the retrospective study, medical records were reviewed for patients admitted before March 31, 2020. Results There were 33 and 37 cases in the RCT and retrospective study, respectively. In the RCT, the median times to negative rRT-PCR from randomization to hospital day 14 were 5 days (95% CI; 1, 9 days) and 10 days (95% CI; 2, 12 days) for the HCQ and SOC groups, respectively ( p = 0.40). On day 14, 81.0% (17/21) and 75.0% (9/12) of the subjects in the HCQ and SOC groups, respectively, had undetected virus ( p = 0.36). In the retrospective study, 12 (42.9%) in the HCQ group and 5 (55.6%) in the control group had negative rRT-PCR results on hospital day 14 ( p = 0.70). Conclusions Neither study demonstrated that HCQ shortened viral shedding in mild to moderate COVID-19 subjects."

A handful of databases are used to monitor indicators against global biodiversity goals but there is no openly available consolidated list of global data sets to help managers, especially those in high-biodiversity countries. We therefore conducted an inventory of global databases of potential use in monitoring biodiversity states, pressures and conservation responses at multiple levels. We uncovered 145 global data sources, as well as a selection of global data reports, links to which we will make available on an open-access website. We describe trends in data availability and actions needed to improve data sharing. If the conservation and science community made a greater effort to publicise data sources, and make the data openly and freely available for the people who most need it, we might be able to mainstream biodiversity data into decision-making and help stop biodiversity loss."
https://openalex.org/W3046780478,"Nations struggled to decide when and how to end COVID-19 inspired lockdowns, with sharply divergent views between those arguing for a resumption of economic activity and those arguing for continuing the lockdown in some form. We examine the choice between continuing or ending a full lockdown within a simple optimal control model that encompasses both health and economic outcomes, and pays particular attention to when need for care exceeds hospital capacity. The model shows that very different strategies can perform similarly well and even both be optimal for the same relative valuation on work and life because of the presence of a so-called Skiba threshold. Qualitatively the alternate strategies correspond to trying essentially to eradicate the virus or merely to flatten the curve so fewer people urgently need healthcare when hospitals are already filled to capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3109664769,"The aim of this study was to determine the activity and synergistic mechanisms of resveratrol in combination with chlorhexidine against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. The activity of resveratrol plus antimicrobial agents was determined by checkerboard and time-kill assay against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolated from patients at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Overexpression of efflux pumps that mediates chlorhexidine susceptibility was characterized by the ethidium bromide accumulation assay. The effect of resveratrol on the expression of efflux pump genes (adeB, adeJ, adeG abeS, and aceI) and the two-component regulators, adeR and adeS was determined by RT-qPCR. The combination of resveratrol and chlorhexidine resulted in strong synergistic and bactericidal activity against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Up-regulation of adeB and aceI was induced by chlorhexidine. However, the addition of resveratrol increased chlorhexidine susceptibility with increased intracellular accumulation of ethidium bromide in A. baumannii indicating that resveratrol acts as an efflux pump inhibitor. Expression of adeB was significantly reduced in the combination of resveratrol with chlorhexidine indicating that resveratrol inhibits the AdeB efflux pump and restores chlorhexidine effect on A. baumannii. In conclusion, reduced adeB expression in A. baumannii was mediated by resveratrol suggesting that AdeB efflux pump inhibition contributes to the synergistic mechanism of resveratrol with chlorhexidine. Our finding highlights the potential importance of resveratrol in clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3107247576,"Background Candida auris infections have recently emerged worldwide, and this species is highly capable of colonization and is associated with high levels of mortality. However, strain-dependent differences in colonization capabilities and virulence have not yet been reported. Objectives In the present study, we aimed to clarify the differences between clinically isolated invasive and non-invasive strains of C . auris . Methods We evaluated colonization, dissemination, and survival rates in wild C57BL/6J mice inoculated with invasive or non-invasive strains of C . auris under cortisone acetate immunosuppression, comparing with those of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata infections. We also evaluated the potency of biofilm formation. Results Stool fungal burdens were significantly higher in mice inoculated with the invasive strains than in those infected with the non-invasive strain. Along with intestinal colonization, liver and kidney fungal burdens were also significantly higher in mice inoculated with the invasive strains. In addition, histopathological findings revealed greater dissemination and colonization of the invasive strains. Regarding biofilm-forming capability, the invasive strain of C . auris exhibited a significantly higher capacity of producing biofilms. Moreover, inoculation with the invasive strains resulted in significantly greater loss of body weight than that noted following infection with the non-invasive strain. Conclusions Invasive strains showed higher colonization capability and rates of dissemination from gastrointestinal tracts under cortisone acetate immunosuppression than non-invasive strains, although the mortality rates caused by C . auris were lower than those caused by C . albicans ."
https://openalex.org/W3107304363,"In recent years, there has been a veritable boost in next-generation sequencing (NGS) of gene amplicons in biological and medical studies. Huge amounts of data are produced and need to be analyzed adequately. Various online and offline analysis tools are available; however, most of them require extensive expertise in computer science or bioinformatics, and often a Linux-based operating system. Here, we introduce “CoMA–Comparative Microbiome Analysis” as a free and intuitive analysis pipeline for amplicon-sequencing data, compatible with any common operating system. Moreover, the tool offers various useful services including data pre-processing, quality checking, clustering to operational taxonomic units (OTUs), taxonomic assignment, data post-processing, data visualization, and statistical appraisal. The workflow results in highly esthetic and publication-ready graphics, as well as output files in standardized formats (e.g. tab-delimited OTU-table, BIOM, NEWICK tree) that can be used for more sophisticated analyses. The CoMA output was validated by a benchmark test, using three mock communities with different sample characteristics (primer set, amplicon length, diversity). The performance was compared with that of Mothur, QIIME and QIIME2-DADA2, popular packages for NGS data analysis. Furthermore, the functionality of CoMA is demonstrated on a practical example, investigating microbial communities from three different soils (grassland, forest, swamp). All tools performed well in the benchmark test and were able to reveal the majority of all genera in the mock communities. Also for the soil samples, the results of CoMA were congruent to those of the other pipelines, in particular when looking at the key microbial players."
https://openalex.org/W3109735706,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the nervous system. Applying glutamate to outside-out patches containing a single NMDAR, we find that agonist-bound receptors transition to the open state via two conformations, an ""unconstrained pre-active"" state that contributes to fast synaptic events and a ""constrained pre-active"" state that does not. To define how glutamate drives these conformations, we decoupled the ligand-binding domains from specific transmembrane segments for GluN1 and GluN2A. Displacements of the pore-forming M3 segments define the energy of fast opening. However, to enter the unconstrained conformation and contribute to fast signaling, the GluN2 pre-M1 helix must be displaced before the M3 segments move. This pre-M1 displacement is facilitated by the flexibility of the S2-M4 of GluN1 and GluN2A. Thus, outer structures-pre-M1 and S2-M4-work in concert to remove constraints and prime the channel for rapid opening, facilitating fast synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3109501881,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is due to mutations in the CF-transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is its most common co-morbidity, affecting ~50% of all CF patients, significantly influencing pulmonary function and longevity. Yet, the complex pathogenesis of CFRD remains unclear. Two non-mutually exclusive underlying mechanisms have been proposed in CFRD: i) damage of the endocrine cells secondary to the severe exocrine pancreatic pathology and ii) intrinsic β-cell impairment of the secretory response in combination with other factors. The later has proven difficult to determine due to low expression of CFTR in β-cells, which results in the general perception that this Cl-channel does not participate in the modulation of insulin secretion or the development of CFRD. The objective of the present work is to demonstrate CFTR expression at the molecular and functional levels in insulin-secreting β-cells in normal human islets, where it seems to play a role. Towards this end, we have used immunofluorescence confocal and immunofluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, Western blotting, pharmacology, electrophysiology and insulin secretory studies in normal human, rat and mouse islets. Our results demonstrate heterogeneous CFTR expression in human, mouse and rat β-cells and provide evidence that pharmacological inhibition of CFTR influences basal and stimulated insulin secretion in normal mouse islets but not in islets lacking this channel, despite being detected by electrophysiological means in ~30% of β-cells. Therefore, our results demonstrate a potential role for CFTR in the pancreatic β-cell secretory response suggesting that intrinsic β-cell dysfunction may also participate in the pathogenesis of CFRD."
https://openalex.org/W3107963650,"Biofilms are community structures of bacteria enmeshed in a self-produced matrix of exopolysaccharides. The biofilm matrix serves numerous roles, including resilience and persistence, making biofilms a subject of research interest among persistent clinical pathogens of global health importance. Our current understanding of the underlying biochemical pathways responsible for biosynthesis of these exopolysaccharides is largely limited to Gram-negative bacteria. Clostridia are a class of Gram-positive, anaerobic and spore-forming bacteria and include the important human pathogens Clostridium perfringens , Clostridium botulinum and Clostridioides difficile , among numerous others. Several species of Clostridia have been reported to produce a biofilm matrix that contains an acetylated glucan linked to a series of hypothetical genes. Here, we propose a model for the function of these hypothetical genes, which, using homology modelling, we show plausibly encode a synthase complex responsible for polymerization, modification and export of an O -acetylated cellulose exopolysaccharide. Specifically, the cellulose synthase is homologous to that of the known exopolysaccharide synthases in Gram-negative bacteria. The remaining proteins represent a mosaic of evolutionary lineages that differ from the described Gram-negative cellulose exopolysaccharide synthases, but their predicted functions satisfy all criteria required for a functional cellulose synthase operon. Accordingly, we named these hypothetical genes ccsZABHI , for the C lostridial c ellulose s ynthase (Ccs), in keeping with naming conventions for exopolysaccharide synthase subunits and to distinguish it from the Gram-negative Bcs locus with which it shares only a single one-to-one ortholog. To test our model and assess the identity of the exopolysaccharide, we subcloned the putative glycoside hydrolase encoded by ccsZ and solved the X-ray crystal structure of both apo- and product-bound CcsZ, which belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH-5). Although not homologous to the Gram-negative cellulose synthase, which instead encodes the structurally distinct BcsZ belonging to GH-8, we show CcsZ displays specificity for cellulosic materials. This specificity of the synthase-associated glycosyl hydrolase validates our proposal that these hypothetical genes are responsible for biosynthesis of a cellulose exopolysaccharide. The data we present here allowed us to propose a model for Clostridial cellulose synthesis and serves as an entry point to an understanding of cellulose biofilm formation among class Clostridia."
https://openalex.org/W3109901654,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread to more than 160 countries worldwide since 2020. Despite tremendous efforts and resources spent worldwide trying to explore antiviral drugs, there is still no effective clinical treatment for COVID-19 to date. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, and patients with severe pneumonia may die from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection further leads to ARDS, often resulting in irreversible impairment of lung function. If the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily causes an immune response or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it may be possible to mitigate excessive immune responses by modulating the infiltration and activation of specific targets, thereby reducing or preventing severe lung damage. However, the extent to which immune cell subsets are significantly altered in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients remains to be elucidated. This study applied the CIBERSORT-X method to comprehensively evaluate the transcriptional estimated immune infiltration landscape in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients and further compare it with the lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found a variety of immune cell subtypes in the COVID-19 group, especially naïve B cells were highly infiltrated. Comparison of functional transcriptomic analyses revealed that non-differentiated naïve B cells may be the main cause of the over-active humoral immune response. Using several publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to validate the genetic differences in B-cell populations, it was found that the B-cells collected from COVID-19 patients were inclined towards naïve B-cells, whereas those collected from IPF patients were inclined towards memory B-cells. Further differentiation of B cells between COVID-19 mild and severe patients showed that B cells from severe patients tended to be antibody-secreting cells, and gene expression showed that B cells from severe patients were similar to DN2 B cells that trigger extrafollicular response. Moreover, a higher percentage of B-cell infiltration seems associated with poorer clinical outcome. Finally, a comparison of several specific COVID-19 cases treated with targeted B-cell therapy suggests that appropriate suppression of naïve B cells might potentially be a novel strategy to alleviate the severe symptoms of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3106690995,"Subjective well-being has captured the interest of scientists and policy-makers as a way of knowing how individuals and groups evaluate and experience their lives: that is, their sense of meaning, their satisfaction with life, and their everyday moods. One of the more striking findings in this literature is a strong association between age and subjective well-being: in Western countries it has a U-shaped association over the lifespan. Despite many efforts, the reason for the curve is largely unexplained, for example, by traditional demographic variables. In this study we examined twelve social and psychological variables that could account for the U-shaped curve. In an Internet sample of 3,294 adults ranging in age from 40 to 69 we observed the expected steep increase in a measure of subjective well-being, the Cantril Ladder. Regression analyses demonstrated that the social-psychological variables explained about two-thirds of the curve and accounting for them significantly flattened the U-shape. Perceived stress, distress-depression, an open perspective about the future, wisdom, satisfaction with social relationships, and family strain were measures that had pronounced impacts on reducing the curve. These findings advance our understanding of why subjective well-being is associated with age and point the way to future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3108344804,"Background The specific roles of parasite characteristics and immunological factors of the host in Chagas disease progression and prognosis are still under debate. Trypanosoma cruzi genotype may be an important determinant of the clinical chronic Chagas disease form and prognosis. This study aimed to identify the potential association between T . cruzi genotypes and the clinical presentations of chronic Chagas disease. Methodology/principal findings This is a retrospective study using T . cruzi isolated from blood culture samples of 43 patients with chronic Chagas disease. From 43 patients, 42 were born in Brazil, mainly in Southeast and Northeast Brazilian regions, and one patient was born in Bolivia. Their mean age at the time of blood collection was 52.4±13.2 years. The clinical presentation was as follows 51.1% cardiac form, 25.6% indeterminate form, and 23.3% cardiodigestive form. Discrete typing unit (DTU) was determined by multilocus conventional PCR. TcII (n = 40) and TcVI (n = 2) were the DTUs identified. DTU was unidentifiable in one patient. The average follow-up time after blood culture was 5.7±4.4 years. A total of 14 patients (32.5%) died and one patient underwent heart transplantation. The cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest in six patients, heart failure in five patients, not related to Chagas disease in one patient, and ignored in two patients. A total of 8 patients (18.6%) progressed, all of them within the cardiac or cardiodigestive forms. Conclusions/significance TcII was the main T . cruzi DTU identified in chronic Chagas disease Brazilian patients (92.9%) with either cardiac, indeterminate or cardiodigestive forms, born at Southeast and Northeast regions. Other DTU found in much less frequency was TcVI (4.8%). TcII was also associated to patients that evolved with heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest, the two most common and ominous consequences of the cardiac form of Chagas disease."
https://openalex.org/W3110102852,"Introduction Appropriate antenatal care (ANC) utilization has direct, significant effects on perinatal mortality (PM). Georgia has one of the highest PM rates (11.7 per 1000 births) in Europe and launched a more intensive ANC programme in 2018. Aim To evaluate the associations between the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU) index and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and PM in Georgia. Methods The Georgian Birth Registry (GBR), with linkage to the Vital Registration System, was used as the main data source; 148,407 eligible mothers and singleton newborns were identified during the observation period (2017–2019). The main exposure was ANC utilization, measured by the APNCU index, and the hospitalization registry was used to validate NICU admissions. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations between the exposure and outcomes while controlling for potential confounders. Results The overall PM rate was 11.6/1000 births, and the proportion of newborns with a NICU admission was 7.8%. 85% of women initiated ANC before gestational age week 12. According to the APNCU index, 16% of women received inadequate, 10% intermediate, 38% adequate, and 36% intensive care. Women who received intermediate care had the lowest odds of PM (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.70), and newborns of women who received inadequate care had the highest odds of NICU admission (AOR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.09–1.23) and PM (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.02–1.36). Conclusion ANC utilization is significantly associated with newborn asmissions to NICU and PM in Georgia. Women received inadequate care experienced the highest odds of newborn admissions to NICU and PM."
https://openalex.org/W3110592885,"Sex-specific transcription characterizes hundreds of genes in mouse liver, many implicated in sex-differential drug and lipid metabolism and disease susceptibility. While the regulation of liver sex differences by growth hormone-activated STAT5 is well established, little is known about autosomal genetic factors regulating the sex-specific liver transcriptome. Here we show, using genotyping and expression data from a large population of Diversity Outbred mice, that genetic factors work in tandem with growth hormone to control the individual variability of hundreds of sex-biased genes, including many long non-coding RNA genes. Significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and sex-specific gene expression were identified as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), many of which showed strong sex-dependent associations. Remarkably, autosomal genetic modifiers of sex-specific genes were found to account for more than 200 instances of gain or loss of sex-specificity across eight Diversity Outbred mouse founder strains. Sex-biased STAT5 binding sites and open chromatin regions with strain-specific variants were significantly enriched at eQTL regions regulating correspondingly sex-specific genes, supporting the proposed functional regulatory nature of the eQTL regions identified. Binding of the male-biased, growth hormone-regulated repressor BCL6 was most highly enriched at trans -eQTL regions controlling female-specific genes. Co-regulated gene clusters defined by overlapping eQTLs included sets of highly correlated genes from different chromosomes, further supporting trans -eQTL action. These findings elucidate how an unexpectedly large number of autosomal factors work in tandem with growth hormone signaling pathways to regulate the individual variability associated with sex differences in liver metabolism and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3108020151,"Introduction Diarrhea is the leading cause of illness and death among under-five children in low and middle income countries. Through the provision of zinc supplements has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhea, as well as the risk of mortality, the use of zinc for the treatment of diarrhea is still very low in low-income countries. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence and associated factors of zinc utilization among under-five children with diarrhea in East Africa. Methods A secondary data analysis of the recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of East African countries were used to determine the prevalence and associated factors of zinc utilization among under-five children with diarrhea in East Africa. A total weighted samples of 16,875 under-five children with diarrhea were included in the study. A generalized linear mixed model (using Poisson regression with robust error variance) was used. Prevalence Ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for those variables included in the final model. Results The overall prevalence of zinc utilization among under-five children with diarrhea in this study was 21.54% (95% CI = 20.92–22.16). Of East African countries, Uganda had the highest prevalence of zinc utilization (40.51%) whereas Comoros had the lowest (0.44%). Maternal primary education (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio(aPR) = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16–1.44), secondary education (aPR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.19–1.55) and higher education (aPR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.52–2.40), high community women education (aPR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02–1.24), high wealth index (aPR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01–1.24), high community media exposure (aPR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.06–1.29) were associated with a higher prevalence of zinc utilization. Conclusion The prevalence of zinc utilization among under-five children was found to be low in East Africa. Maternal education, wealth index, community women education, and community media exposure were significantly associated with zinc utilization. Increased mass media exposure, maternal education and wealth index is recommended to improve zinc utilization among under-five children with diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W3110349505,"Objectives Studies have shown conflicting characteristic thermographic patterns of the feet in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, to date no studies have compared thermographic patterns of patients with RA in remission and healthy controls. Thus this study aimed to investigate whether the thermal characteristics of the feet of RA patients, in clinical and radiological remission differ to those of healthy controls. Methods Using convenience sampling, RA patients were recruited upon confirmed absence of synovitis by clinical examination and musculoskeletal ultrasound. Thermal images of the feet were taken. Each foot was subdivided into medial, central, lateral, forefoot and heel regions. Subsequently, temperatures in the different regions were analyzed and compared to a cohort of healthy adults. Results Data from 32 RA patients were compared to that of 51 healthy controls. The Independent samples T-Test demonstrated a significant difference in temperatures in all the regions of the forefoot between RA participants versus healthy subjects (Table 1). Using the One-Way ANOVA test, no significant difference was found between all the forefoot regions (p = 0.189) of RA patients. Independent sample T-test found significant differences in all heel regions between the two groups (Table 2). One-Way ANOVA demonstrated no significant differences (p = 0.983) between the different foot regions (n = 192) of RA patients. Conclusion These findings suggest that RA patients in clinical and radiological remission exhibit significantly different feet thermographic patterns compared to healthy controls. This data will provide the basis for future studies to assess whether thermographic patterns change with disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W3110549554,"To best understand the possible negative health and social consequences associated with racial microaggression, in-depth understanding of how people judge these events is needed. People of Color (POC) and White participants ( N = 64) were recruited for a mixed-methods study that incorporated quantitative attitude ratings and focus group interviews. Participants read and discussed their attitudes toward five vignettes that reflected microassault, microinsult, and microinvalidation scenarios. Semantic differential ratings showed that participants judged microassaults to be most unacceptable, followed by microinsults and then microinvalidations. Using a grounded theory approach, our qualitative analysis of interview data revealed five thematic categories. First, participants judged receivers’ psychological harm to be a critical consideration for their attitudes toward microaggression scenarios; they discussed factors associated with individual differences in appraisals, prior exposures to discrimination, and sensitivity to race. Second, participants were less consistent in their opinion about the role of the deliverers’ intent on their judgment of microaggressions; many considered microaggression events to be results of deliverers’ cultural ignorance and racial insensitivity. Third, our analysis revealed the central importance of contexts that shaped participants’ attitudes toward microaggression. Fourth, participants also discussed the notion that receivers of microaggression were racist for calling attention to race issues. Finally, POC participants tended to relate to the vignettes and use their lived experiences to contextualize their opinions about racial microaggression. The current results raise concerns regarding the conceptualization and utility of the word “microaggression,” especially within the broader contexts of racism and major discrimination. Other empirical and practical implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3106641936,"Purpose To investigate the change in axial length (AxL) and choroidal thickness (ChT) in response to continuous and alternating episodes of monocular myopic and hyperopic defocus. Methods The right eye of sixteen young adults was exposed to 60 minute episodes of either continuous or alternating myopic and hyperopic defocus (+3 DS &amp; -3 DS) over six separate days, with the left eye optimally corrected for distance. During alternating defocus conditions, the eye was exposed to either 30 or 15 minute cycles of myopic and hyperopic defocus, with the order of defocus reversed in separate sessions. The AxL and ChT of the right eye were measured before, during and after each defocus condition. Results Significant changes in AxL were observed over time, dependent upon the defocus condition (p &lt; 0.0001). In general, AxL exhibited a greater magnitude of change during continuous than alternating defocus conditions. The maximum AxL elongation was +7 ± 7 μm (p = 0.010) in response to continuous hyperopic defocus and the maximum AxL reduction was -8 ± 10 μm of (p = 0.046) in response to continuous myopic defocus. During both 30 and 15 minute cycles of alternating myopic and hyperopic defocus of equal duration, the effect of opposing blur sessions cancelled each other and the AxL was near baseline levels following the final defocus session (mean change from baseline across all alternating defocus conditions was +2 ± 10 μm, p &gt; 0.05). Similar, but smaller magnitude, changes were observed for ChT. Conclusions The human eye appears capable of temporal averaging of visual cues from alternating myopic and hyperopic defocus. In the short term, this integration appears to be a cancellation of the effects of the preceding defocus condition of opposite sign."
https://openalex.org/W3107404909,"Objectives To investigate the potential of computed tomography (CT)-based texture analysis and elastographic data provided by endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) for differentiating the mediastinal lymphadenopathy by sarcoidosis and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) metastasis. Methods Sixteen patients with sarcoidosis and 14 with SCLC were enrolled. On CT images showing the largest mediastinal lymph node, a fixed region of interest was drawn on the node, and texture features were automatically measured. Among the 30 patients, 19 (12 sarcoidosis and 7 SCLC) underwent endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration, and the fat-to-lesion strain ratio (FLR) was recorded. Texture features and FLRs were compared between the 2 patient groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements. Results Of the 31 texture features, the differences between 11 texture features of CT ROIs in the patients with sarcoidosis versus patients with SCLC were significant. Among them, the grey-level run length matrix with high gray-level run emphasis (GLRLM-HGRE) showed the greatest difference (P&lt;0.01). Differences between FLRs were significant (P&lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis together with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the FLR combined with the GLRLM-HGRE showed a high diagnostic accuracy (100% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 0.988 area under the curve) for discriminating between sarcoidosis and SCLC. Conclusion Texture analysis, particularly combined with the FLR, is useful for discriminating between mediastinal lymphadenopathy caused by sarcoidosis from that caused by metastasis from SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3110144239,"Introduction Maternal nutrition during pregnancy is linked with birth outcomes including fetal growth, birth weight, congenital anomalies and long-term health through intra-uterine programming. However, a woman’s nutritional status before pregnancy is a strong determinant in early embryo-placental development, and subsequently outcomes for both mother and child. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary macronutrient intake in the preconception period with birth weight. Methods We studied a group of 1698 women from the Dutch Perined-Lifelines linked birth cohort with reliable detailed information on preconception dietary macronutrient intake (using a semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire) and data available on birth weight of the offspring. Birth weight was converted into gestational age adjusted z-scores, and macronutrient intake was adjusted for total energy intake using the nutrient residual method. Preconception BMI was converted into cohort-based quintiles. Multivariable linear regression was performed, adjusted for other macronutrients and covariates. Results Mean maternal age was 29.5 years (SD 3.9), preconception BMI: 24.7 kg/m 2 (SD 4.2) and median daily energy intake was 1812 kcal (IQR 1544–2140). Mean birth weight was 3578 grams (SD 472). When adjusted for covariates, a significant association (adjusted z score [95% CI], P) between polysaccharides and birth weight was shown (0.08 [0.01–0.15], 0.03). When linear regression analyses were performed within cohort-based quintiles of maternal BMI, positive significant associations between total protein, animal protein, fat, total carbohydrates, mono-disaccharides and polysaccharides with birth weight were shown in the lowest quintile of BMI independent of energy intake, intake of other macronutrients and covariates. Conclusion Out of all macronutrients studied, polysaccharides showed the strongest association with birth weight, independent of energy intake and other covariates. Our study might suggest that specifically in women with low preconception BMI a larger amount of macronutrient intake was associated with increased birth weight. We recommend that any dietary assessment and advise during preconception should be customized to preconception weight status of the women."
https://openalex.org/W3106968105,"Udder cleft dermatitis (UCD) is a skin condition affecting the fore udder attachment of dairy cows. UCD may be defined as mild (eczematous skin changes) or severe (open wounds, large skin changes). Our aims were to compare the microbiota of mild and severe UCD lesions with the microbiota of healthy skin from the fore udder attachment of control cows, and to investigate whether mastitis-causing pathogens are present in UCD lesions. Samples were obtained from cows in six dairy herds. In total, 36 UCD samples categorized as mild (n = 17) or severe (n = 19) and 13 control samples were sequenced using a shotgun metagenomic approach and the reads were taxonomically classified based on their k -mer content. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the abundance of different taxa between different sample types, as well as to compare the bacterial diversity between samples. A high proportion of bacteria was seen in all samples. Control samples had a higher proportion of archaeal reads, whereas most samples had low proportions of fungi, protozoa and viruses. The bacterial microbiota differed between controls and mild and severe UCD samples in both composition and diversity. Subgroups of UCD samples were visible, characterized by increased proportion of one or a few bacterial genera or species, e.g. Corynebacterium , Staphylococcus , Brevibacterium luteolum , Trueperella pyogenes and Fusobacterium necrophorum . Bifidobacterium spp. were more common in controls compared to UCD samples. The bacterial diversity was higher in controls compared to UCD samples. Bacteria commonly associated with mastitis were uncommon. In conclusion, a dysbiosis of the microbiota of mild and severe UCD samples was seen, characterized by decreased diversity and an increased proportion of certain bacteria. There was no evidence of a specific pathogen causing UCD or that UCD lesions are important reservoirs for mastitis-causing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3108911463,"The current laboratory adsorption study aimed at determination of the values of adsorption distribution coefficient ( K d ) of bentazone in the profiles of Arenosols, Luvisols, and Cambisols, which are the most common arable mineral soils in Poland. The study attempted to identify the soil components that bind bentazone and the principal adsorption mechanisms of this compound as well as create a model capable of predicting its adsorption in soils. The K d values determined in batch experiments after 24 h of shaking were very low, and ranged from 0.05 to 0.30 mL/g for the Ap horizon and 0 to 0.07 mL/g for subsoils. The results indicated that the anionic form of bentazone was adsorbed on organic matter, while in acidic soils the neutral form of bentazone was adsorbed on organic matter and sand. The detailed analyses of mineralogical composition revealed that the principal mineral that was responsible for the adsorption of bentazone was quartz, which content was strongly positively correlated with the sand fraction. In soils with pH &lt; 5 and an organic carbon content of &lt; 0.35%, quartz exhibited much greater affinity for the neutral bentazone form than organic matter. Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy analyses supported by computational methods have shown the most probable mechanisms behind the adsorption of bentazone on quartz. The created model, assuming the adsorption of bentazone on organic matter and on sand and using the spectrophotometrically determined dissociation constant of bentazone, very well explained the K d variance in the 81 examined soils, while correctly predicting the adsorption based on soil properties described in the published data."
https://openalex.org/W3110160215,"Working memory (WM) is a system for maintenance of and access to a limited number of goal-relevant representations in the service of higher cognition. Because of its limited capacity, WM requires interference-control processes, allowing us to avoid being distracted by irrelevant information. Recent research has proposed two interference-control processes, which are conceptually similar: (1) an active, item-wise removal process assumed to remove no-longer relevant information from WM, and (2) an inhibitory process assumed to suppress the activation of distractors against competing, goal-relevant representations. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the tasks used to assess removal and inhibition measure the same interference-control construct. Results showed acceptable to good reliabilities for nearly all measures. Similar to previous studies, a structural equation modeling approach identified a reliable latent variable of removal. However, also similar to some previous studies, no latent variable of inhibition could be established. This was the case even when the correlation matrix used to compute the latent variable of inhibition was disattenuated for imperfect reliability. Critically, the individual measures of inhibition were unrelated to the latent variable of removal. These results provide tentative support for the notion that removal is not related to the interference-control processes assessed in inhibition tasks. This suggests that the removal process should be conceptualized as a process independent of the concept of inhibition, as proposed in computational WM models that implement removal as the “unbinding” of a WM item from the context in which it occurred."
https://openalex.org/W3106626151,"Young triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients are at high risk for developing very aggressive brain metastases associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. Preclinical models that allow follow-up by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for brain metastasis. To date, preclinical brain tumor research has almost exclusively relied on xenograft mouse models. Yet, rats are an ideal model for imaging of brain metastasis as their larger brain offers better relative spatial resolution compared to a mouse brain. For the development of a clinically relevant rat model for TNBC brain metastasis, the MDA-MB-231br/eGFP cancer cell line can be used. However, as a result of species-dependent extracranial features, the propensity of the MDA-MB-231br/eGFP cancer cell line to metastasize exclusively to the brain needs to be enhanced by in vivo selection. In this study, repeated sequential passages of metastatic cancer cells obtained from brain metastases in nude rats were performed. Brain metastasis formation was evaluated using preclinical MRI, while bone metastasis formation was assessed using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F] fluoro-D-glucose ([ 18 F] FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Our results demonstrated that the metastatic tumor burden in the rat brain (number and volume) significantly increased with increasing passage, while the metastatic tumor burden in the skeleton (i.e., number of metastasis-affected bones) significantly decreased with increasing passage. However, bone metastasis development was not reduced to a negligible amount. Consequently, despite in vivo selection, our rat model is not recommended for investigating brain metastasis as a single disease. Our findings highlight the importance of well-reasoned selection of both the preclinical model and the cancer cell line in order to obtain reliable and reproducible scientific results."

The purpose of this study was to identify factors that early predict the progression of COVID-19 from severe to critical illness. Methods This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with severe or critical ill COVID-19 who were consecutively admitted to the Zhongfaxincheng campus of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 8 to 18, 2020. Baseline variables, data at hospital admission and during hospital stay, as well as clinical outcomes were collected from electronic medical records system. The primary endpoint was the development of critical illness. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent factors that were associated with the progression from severe to critical illness. Results A total of 138 patients were included in the analysis; of them 119 were diagnosed as severe cases and 16 as critical ill cases at hospital admission. During hospital stay, 19 more severe cases progressed to critical illness. For all enrolled patients, longer duration from diagnosis to admission (odds ratio [OR] 1.108, 95% CI 1.022–1.202; P = 0.013), pulse oxygen saturation at admission &lt;93% (OR 5.775, 95% CI 1.257–26.535; P = 0.024), higher neutrophil count (OR 1.495, 95% CI 1.177–1.899; P = 0.001) and higher creatine kinase-MB level at admission (OR 2.449, 95% CI 1.089–5.511; P = 0.030) were associated with a higher risk, whereas higher lymphocyte count at admission (OR 0.149, 95% CI 0.026–0.852; P = 0.032) was associated with a lower risk of critical illness development. For the subgroup of severe cases at hospital admission, the above factors except creatine kinase-MB level were also found to have similar correlation with critical illness development. Conclusions Higher neutrophil count and lower lymphocyte count at admission were early independent predictors of progression to critical illness in severe COVID-19 patients."

This study aimed to determine the clinical bleeding patterns, adherence to PALM-COEIN diagnosis guidelines and management of AUB among women in their reproductive age. This was a cross-sectional study among 108 women with AUB aged 18–45 years was conducted at the gynaecology department of Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Western Kenya between April 2018 and April 2019. Their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected using interviewer administered structured questionnaire and chart reviews. Adherence to diagnosis recommendations was assessed using PALM COEIN classification. Descriptive and inferential data analysis was conducted at 95% confidence interval. The median age was 30 (IQR: 22, 41) years with prolonged bleeding as the most predominant pattern at 41.7%. Bleeding patterns were significantly associated with age (p = 0.04). Only 16.7% were diagnosed as per the PALM-COEIN criteria with PALM and COEIN accounting for 60% and 40% respectively. Leiomyoma (44.5%) was the common cause of AUB. Laboratory evaluation included: pregnancy tests, full haemogram, hormonal profile and biopsy. Most (79.6%) of the women had abdominopelvic ultrasound done. Medical management was provided for 78.7% of women. Prolonged bleeding was the most common pattern with medical management preferred. There is need for in-hospital algorithms to ensure adherence to PALM-COEIN guidelines."

Because of favorable agronomic characteristics of C . sativa in a water-limiting environment interest in its production has increased worldwide. In this study the effect of different irrigation regimes (I 0 = three irrigations, I 1 = two irrigations, I 2 = one irrigation and I 3 = one irrigation) on physio-biochemical responses and seed yield attributes of two C . sativa genotypes was explored under semi-arid conditions. Results indicated that maximum physio-biochemical activity, seed yield and oil contents appeared in genotype 7126 with three irrigations (I 0 ). In contrast water deficit stress created by withholding irrigation (I 1 , I 2 and I 3 ) at different growth stages significantly reduced the physio-biochemical activity as well as yield responses in both C . sativa genotypes. Nonetheless the highest reduction in physio-biochemical and yield attributes were observed in genotype 8046 when irrigation was skipped at vegetative and flowering stages of crop (I 3 ). In genotypic comparison, C . sativa genotype 7126 performed better than 8046 under all I 1 , I 2 and I 3 irrigation treatments. Because 7126 exhibited better maintenance of tissue water content, leaf gas exchange traits and chlorophyll pigment production, resulting in better seed yield and oil production. Findings of this study suggest that to achieve maximum yield potential in camelina three irrigations are needed under semi-arid conditions, however application of two irrigations one at flowering and second at silique development stage can ensure an economic seed yield and oil contents. Furthermore, genotype 7126 should be adopted for cultivation under water limited arid and semi-arid regions due to its better adaptability."
https://openalex.org/W2970915116,"Providing for the needs of the vulnerable is a critical component of social and health policy-making. In particular, caring for children and for vulnerable older people is vital to the wellbeing of millions of families throughout the world. In most developed countries, this care is provided through both formal and informal means, and is therefore governed by complex policies that interact in non-obvious ways with other areas of policy-making. In this paper we present an agent-based model of social and child care provision in the UK, in which agents can provide informal care or pay for private care for their relatives. Agents make care decisions based on numerous factors including their health status, employment, financial situation, and social and physical distance to those in need. Simulation results show that the model can produce plausible patterns of care need and availability, and therefore can provide an important aid to this complex area of policy-making. We conclude that the model's use of kinship networks for distributing care and the explicit modelling of interactions between social care and child care will enable policy-makers to develop more informed policy interventions in these critical areas."

https://openalex.org/W3107039169,"Ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) is a beta-agonist approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medicated feed ingredient for cattle during the final days of finishing to improve feed efficiency and growth. Maximum residue limits and U.S. FDA residue tolerances for target tissues have defined management practices around RAC usage in the U.S. However, many countries have adopted zero tolerance policies and testing of off-target tissues, presenting a major challenge for international export. Therefore, the objective this study was to determine the necessary withdrawal time among cattle group-fed RAC to achieve residue concentrations below tolerance levels in muscle and off-target tissues. Specifically, both total and parent RAC residues were quantified in muscle, adipose tissue, rendered tallow, and large intestines from animals group-fed RAC and subjected to withdrawal 2, 4, or 7 days before harvest. Ractopamine (parent and total) residues were below the assay limit of detection (&lt; 0.12 ng/g) in all muscle and adipose tissue samples from animals in control groups (no RAC). However, RAC residues were detectable, but below the limit of quantitation, in 40% of tallow and 17% of large intestine samples from control animals. As expected, mean RAC residue concentrations in muscle, adipose tissue, and large intestine samples decreased ( P &lt; 0.05) as the RAC withdrawal duration (days) was extended. Irrespective of RAC withdrawal duration, mean parent RAC residue concentrations in muscle, adipose tissue, and large intestine ranged from 0.33 to 0.76 ng/g, 0.16 to 0.26 ng/g, 3.97 to 7.44 ng/g, respectively and all tallow samples were &gt; 0.14 ng/g (detectable but below the limit of quantitation). Results of this study provide a baseline for the development of management protocol recommendations associated with withdrawal following group-feeding of RAC to beef cattle in countries that allow RAC use and intend to export to global markets which may be subject to zero tolerance policies and off-target tissue testing."

To obtain quantitative eDNA datasets for individual species, organism-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays are required. Here, we present detailed methodology of qPCR assay design and testing, including in silico , in vitro , and in vivo testing, and comment on the challenges associated with assay design and performance. We use the presented methodology to design assays for three important marine organisms common in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE): humpback whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ), shortbelly rockfish ( Sebastes jordani ), and common murre ( Uria aalge ). All three assays have excellent sensitivity and high efficiencies ranging from 92% to 99%. However, specificities of the assays varied from species-specific in the case of common murre, genus-specific for the shortbelly rockfish assay, and broadly whale-specific for the humpback whale assay, which cross-amplified with other two other whale species, including one in a different family. All assays detected their associated targets in complex environmental water samples."

Disturbance of craniofacial development may be associated with temporal mandibular joint function. Therefore, we examined the possibility of a correlation between unilateral missing teeth and morphologic changes of the spine and posture. We collected eighty-nine patients (38 men and 51 women) with unilateral posterior missing teeth and twenty patients without previous orthodontic treatment or missing posterior teeth by tracing and analyzing their panoramic and cephalometric film. We measured the angulations of articular eminence, cranio-cervical angle, and the percentage of the occlusal plane passing through the first and second cervical vertebrae with other morphologic geometric data. The angle of articular eminence inclination was higher in the non-missing teeth group than the missing teeth group (46.66° and 42.28°, respectively). The cranio-cervical angle was smaller in the missing posterior teeth group than the non-missing posterior teeth group (99.81° and 103.27°, respectively). The missing teeth group also showed fewer occlusal planes passing through the intersection of the first and second cervical vertebrae compared to the non-missing teeth group (28.9% and 65%, respectively). Individuals with unilateral missing teeth had lower articular eminence inclination, smaller cranio-cervical angle, and a lower percentage of the occlusal plane passing through the intersection of the first and second cervical vertebrae."
https://openalex.org/W3109616009,"We evaluate the ocular effects of proton beam therapy (PBT) in a single institution, in Korea, and identify factors contributing to decreasing visual acuity (VA) after PBT. A total of 40 patients who received PBT for choroidal melanoma (2009‒2016) were reviewed. Dose fractionation was 60‒70 cobalt gray equivalents (CGEs) over five fractions. Complete ophthalmic examinations including funduscopy and ultrasonography were performed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after PBT, then annually thereafter. Only patients with at least 12 months follow-up were included. During the follow-up, consecutive best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) changes were determined, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors for VA loss. The median follow-up duration was 32 months (range: 12‒82 months). The final BCVA of nine patients was &gt; 20/40. The main cause of vision loss was intraocular bleeding, such as neovascular glaucoma or retinal hemorrhage. Vision loss was correlated with the tumor size, tumor distance to the optic disc or fovea, maculae receiving 30 CGEs, optic discs receiving 30 CGEs, and retinas receiving 30 CGEs. Approximately one-third of PBT-treated choroidal melanoma patients with good pretreatment BCVA maintained their VA. The patients who finally lost vision (VA &lt; count fingers) usually experienced rapid declines in VA from 6‒12 months after PBT. Tumor size, tumor distance to the optic disc or fovea, volume of the macula, and optic discs or retinas receiving 30 CGEs affected the final VA."

https://openalex.org/W3107175738,"Storm events are a significant source of disturbance in the Middle Atlantic Bight, in the Northwest Atlantic, that cause rapid destratification of the water column during the late summer and early fall. Storm-driven mixing can be considered as a seasonal disturbance regime to demersal communities, characterized by the recurrence of large changes in bottom water temperatures. Black sea bass are a model ubiquitous demersal species in the Middle Atlantic Bight, as their predominantly sedentary behavior makes them ideal for tagging studies while also regularly exposing them to summer storm disturbances and the physiological stresses associated with thermal destratification. To better understand the responsiveness of black sea bass to storm impacts, we coupled biotelemetry with a high-resolution Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). During the summers of 2016–2018, 8–15 black sea bass were released each year with acoustic transponders at three reef sites, which were surrounded by data-logging receivers. Data were analyzed for activity levels and reef departures of black sea bass, and fluctuations in temperature, current velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy. Movement rates were depressed with each consecutive passing storm, and late-season storms were associated with permanent evacuations by a subset of tagged fish. Serial increases in bottom temperature associated with repeated storm events were identified as the primary depressor of local movement. Storm-driven increases in turbulent kinetic energy and current velocity had comparatively smaller, albeit significant, effects. Black sea bass represents both an important fishery resource and an indicator species for the impact of offshore wind development in the United States. Their availability to fisheries surveys and sensitivity to wind turbine impacts will be biased during periods of high storm activity, which is likely to increase with regional climate change."

Methods This retrospective study on 54 PedMS, aged 7–17 years, was performed at the Clinic of Neurology and Psychiatry for Children and Youth in Belgrade, Serbia, a tertiary center for the diagnosis and treatment of children with neurological and psychiatric diseases. Results Female to male ratio was 37 (68.5%): 17 (31.5%). Family history of MS was noted in 9.3% and autoimmune diseases in 24.1% patients. Co-occurring migraine was in 7,4%. Monofocal onset of disease was present in 77.8% patients. The most common initial symptoms were optic neuritis (37%), sensory disturbances (31.5%), motor deficit (24.1%), cerebellar (18.5%) and brainstem lesions (16.7%), pain (9.3%), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis like symptoms (1.9%), and hearing loss (3.7%). Visual evoked potentials were pathological in 75.9% of patients. Oligoclonal bands were positive in 68.5% of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging showed periventricular (94.4%), infratentorial (77.8%), juxtacortical and cortical changes (55.6%) and changes in the cervical spinal cord (33.3%).

Conclusion Our cohort significantly differs from the literature data regarding more frequent occurrence of optic neuritis, hearing loss as a first symptom, the relapsing-remitting course of the disease, higher proportion of early onset of disease, presence of co-occurring migraine and the frequent occurrence of epilepsy and other autoimmune diseases in the family."
https://openalex.org/W3108784446,"Introduction Studies in many countries have documented reductions of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalizations with smokefree policies. However, evidence on the association of cigarette tax with AMI events is unclear. There have been no studies of the associations between these two policies and AMI hospitalizations in Thailand. Methods We used negative binomial time series analyses of AMI hospitalizations (ICD-10 codes I21.0-I21.9), stratified by sex and age groups, from October 2006 to September 2017 to determine whether there was a change in AMI hospitalizations as a result of the changes in cigarette prices and the implementation of a 100% smokefree law. Results Cigarette price increases were associated with a significant 4.7% drop in AMI hospitalizations among adults younger than 45 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.953; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.914–0.993; p = 0.021). Implementation of the 100% smokefree law was followed by a significant 13.1% drop in AMI hospitalizations among adults younger than 45 (IRR, 0.869; 95% CI, 0.801–0.993; P = 0.001). There were not significant associations in older age groups. Conclusions The Thai cigarette tax policy and the smokefree law were associated with reduced AMI hospitalizations among younger adults. To improve effectiveness of the policies, taxes should be high enough to increase cigarette price above inflation rates, making cigarettes less likely to be purchased; smokefree laws should be strictly enforced."
https://openalex.org/W3109130647,"Introduction Acute early vascular complications are rare, but serious complications after kidney transplantation. They often result in graft loss. For this reason, shortening the diagnostic process is crucial. Currently, it is standard procedure to monitor renal graft perfusion using Doppler ultrasound (DU). With respect to acute vascular complications, the main disadvantage of this type of examination is its periodicity. It would be of great benefit if graft blood perfusion could be monitored continuously during the early postoperative period. It appears evident that a well-designed near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring system could prove very useful during the early post-transplantation period. Its role in the immediate diagnosis of vascular complications could result in a significant increase in graft salvage, thus improving the patient’s overall quality of life and lowering morbidity and mortality for renal graft recipients. The aim of this study was to design, construct and test such a monitoring system. Materials and methods We designed a rough NIRS-based system prototype and prepared a two-stage laboratory experiment based on a laboratory pig model. In the first stage, a total of 10 animals were used to verify and optimize the technical aspects and functionality of the prototype sensor by testing it on the animal kidneys in-vivo. As a result of these tests, a more specific prototype was designed. During the second stage, we prepared a unique laboratory model of a pig kidney autotransplantation and tested the system for long-term functionality on a group of 20 animals. Overall sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and a final prototype was prepared and completed with its own analytic software and chassis. Results We designed and constructed a NIRS-based system for kidney graft perfusion monitoring. The measurement system provided reliable performance and 100% sensitivity when detecting acute diminished blood perfusion of the transplanted kidneys in laboratory conditions. Conclusion The system appears to be a useful tool for diagnosing diminished blood perfusion of kidney transplants during the early postoperative period. However, further testing is still required. We believe that applying our method in current human transplantation medicine is feasible, and we are confident that our prototype is ready for human testing."

The use of fire to manage grassland areas in some regions of southern Brazil can help to maintain these areas but can also influence the bird community in different ways. We assessed temporal changes in richness, abundance, and composition of bird communities in areas with different histories of fire disturbance in highland grasslands of southern Brazil, the most extensive remnant of grassland of the Atlantic Forest domain. We censused birds during four breeding seasons (2015–2018), through point counts in areas burned only once in the last ten years (OF, n = 3), areas burned annually (AF, n = 2), and areas without fire in the last ten years (WF, n = 2). In OF the richness, abundance, and species composition changed in the year of the fire, compared to the previous year, and returned to the initial values two years later. In AF and WF we found some differences among the years, but not with an equally clear pattern. Three of the six grassland associated species assessed individually for density responded significantly to temporal habitat modification since the fire. Our results show that two years without fire were enough time for the bird community to recover after a fire, but some responses are species-specific. Therefore, fire can be used as a management tool for grasslands and may help in the conservation of birds of southern Brazil, as long as with a minimum interval between fires in an area is guaranteed."

This study, therefore, aims at examining pharmacy students’ perspectives on the level of cultural awareness and competence of pharmacy educators and learners at Qatar University and the influence of cultural diversity on pharmacy education in Qatar. Methods A convergent mixed-methods design was adopted. The Cultural Awareness Scale (CAS) was utilized in the quantitative phase, which was administered on 122 pharmacy students at Qatar University College of Pharmacy (QU CPH), of whom 70 responded. The qualitative phase comprised four focus groups with a total of 23 students. The quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently, and the results were integrated. Results The findings suggest that the QU CPH is an institution of a culturally diverse community. Educators and students alike are generally culturally aware and sensitive; however, demonstration of a holistic awareness was hindered by a few barriers. This study suggests curricular changes to reinforce cultural competence, cultural inclusiveness, and the preservation of Qatar’s cultural identity and values in the educational environment. Conclusions The internationalization of pharmacy education in Qatar has inspired students and educators alike to achieve new dimensions of cultural awareness. To infuse passion and enthusiasm in learning while maintaining Qatar’s cultural values and identity, healthcare professional educators, researchers, and policymakers are required to collaborate to promote culturally sensitive pharmacy education."

To better understand the immune-mediated component to the HBsAg seroconversion, we investigated the role of B cells in this study. A total of 44 IHCs were given 48 weeks of PEG-IFN. Fifteen cases achieve HBsAg seroconversion (R group), whereas 29 failed (NR group). The proportion of total B cells and plasma B cells were measured before and during treatment. We found that the proportion of total B cells and plasma B cells was no significant between R group and NR group at baseline, but significantly higher in R group than NR group during PEG-IFN treatment, even when the exact age-, sex-, and treatment period-match was made. In conclusion, we demonstrated the increase of total B cell and plasma B cells during PEG-IFN treatment favored HBsAg seroconversion for IHC, and B cells may play a role in HBV seroconversion."

The top quartile of NT-proBNP was associated with increased risk of mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–2.73) after adjustment for covariates including troponins (hs-cTnT HR 1.30 (95% CI 0.90–1.89), hs-cTnI HR 1.32 (95% CI 0.87–2.00) for top category). When biomarker associations were evaluated as continuous variables, only NT-proBNP (HR per log-unit increment 1.34, 95% CI 1.16–1.54) and hs-cTnI (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11–1.72) showed robust results. Elevated cardiac biomarker concentrations predicted an increased risk of long-term mortality and strongest for NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI. These results might help to identify subjects at risk and target preventive efforts early."
https://openalex.org/W3107645868,"Background Despite their importance in population health among children and adolescents, our understanding of how individual items mutually interact within and between pediatric health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and school social capital is limited. Methods We employed network analysis in a general population sample of 7759 children aged 9–15 years to explore the network structure of relations among pediatric HRQOL and school social capital items measured using validated scales. Furthermore, network centrality was examined to identify central items that had stronger and more direct connections with other items in the network than others. Network structure and overall strength of connectivity among items were compared between groups (by sex and age). Results Our analysis revealed that the item related to school/academic functioning and the item related to shared enjoyment among students had the highest strength centrality in the network of HRQOL and school social capital, respectively, underpinning their critical roles in pediatric HRQOL and school social capital. Additionally, the edge connecting “I trust my friends at school” and “trouble getting along with peers” had the strongest negative edge weight among ones connecting school social capital and pediatric HRQOL constructs. Network comparison test revealed stronger overall network connectivity in middle schoolers compared to elementary schoolers but no differences between male and female students. Conclusion The network approach elucidated the complex relationship of mutually influencing items within and between pediatric HRQOL and school social capital. Addressing central items may promote children’s perceived health and school social capital."

However, the fitness landscape of an individual site, i.e., the vector of fitness values corresponding to different variants at this site, can itself change with time due to changes in the environment or substitutions at other epistatically interacting sites. While there exist a number of simulators for modeling different aspects of molecular evolution, very few can accommodate changing landscapes. We present SELVa, the Simulator of Evolution with Landscape Variation, aimed at modeling the substitution process under a changing single-position fitness landscape in a set of evolving lineages that form a phylogeny of arbitrary shape. Written in Java and distributed as an executable jar file, SELVa provides a flexible framework that allows the user to choose from a number of implemented rules governing landscape change."
https://openalex.org/W3107871343,"Background Intramyocardial hemorrhage following reperfusion is strongly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in myocardial infarction (MI) patients; yet the mechanisms contributing to these outcomes are not well understood. Large animal models have been used to investigate intramyocardial hemorrhage, but they are exorbitantly expensive and difficult to use for mechanistic studies. In contrast, rat models are widely used to investigate mechanistic aspects of cardiovascular physiology, but a rat model that consistently recapitulates the characteristics of an hemorrhagic MI does not exist. To bridge this gap, we investigated the physiological conditions of MI that would create intramyocardial hemorrhage in rats so that a reliable model of hemorrhagic MI would become available for basic research. Methods &amp; results Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either a 90-minute (90-min) ischemia and then reperfusion (I/R) (n = 22) or 30-minute (30-min) I/R (n = 18) of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Sham rats (n = 12) were used as controls. 90-min I/R consistently yielded hemorrhagic MI, while 30-min I/R consistently yielded non-hemorrhagic MI. Twenty-four hours post-reperfusion, ex-vivo late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) and T2* cardiac MRI performed on excised hearts from 90-min I/R rats revealed colocalization of iron deposits within the scarred tissue; however, in 30-min I/R rats scar was evident on LGE but no evidence of iron was found on T2* CMR. Histological studies verified tissue damage (H&amp;E) detected on LGE and the presence of iron (Perl’s stain) observed on T2*-CMR. At week 4 post-reperfusion, gene and protein expression of proinflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β and MMP-9) were increased in the 90-min I/R group when compared to 30-min I/R groups. Further, transmission electron microscopy performed on 90-min I/R myocardium that were positive for iron on T2* CMR and Perl’s stain showed accumulation of granular iron particles within the phagosomes. Conclusion Ischemic time prior to reperfusion is a critical factor in determining whether a MI is hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic in rats. Specifically, a period of 90-min of ischemia prior to reperfusion can produce rat models of hemorrhagic MI, while 30-minutes of ischemia prior to reperfusion can ensure that the MIs are non-hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic MIs in rats result in marked increase in iron deposition, proinflammatory burden and adverse left—ventricular remodeling compared to rats with non-hemorrhagic MIs."
https://openalex.org/W3108722216,"Fonsecaea pedrosoi is one of the main agents of chromoblastomycosis, a chronic subcutaneous mycosis. Itraconazole (ITC) is the most used antifungal in its treatment, however, in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests are important to define the best therapy. These tests are standardized by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), but these protocols have limitations such as the high complexity, cost and time to conduct. An alternative to in vitro susceptibility test, which overcomes these limitations, is FTIR. This study determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of itraconazole for F . pedrosoi , using FTIR and chemometrics. The susceptibility to ITC of 36 strains of F . pedrosoi was determined according to CLSI and with the addition of tricyclazole (TCZ), to inhibit 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin biosynthesis. Strains were grown in Sabouraud agar and prepared for Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR)/FTIR. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was performed using leave-one-out cross-validation (by steps of quintuplicates), then tested on an external validation set. A coefficient of determination (R²) higher than 0.99 was obtained for both the MIC-ITC and MIC-ITC+TCZ ATR/PLS models, confirming a high correlation of the reference values with the ones predicted using the FTIR spectra. This is the first study to propose the use of FTIR and chemometric analyses according to the M38-A2 CLSI protocol to predict ITC MICs of F . pedrosoi . Considering the limitations of the conventional methods to test in vitro susceptibility, this is a promising methodology to be used for other microorganisms and drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3110117876,"The hybrid electromagnetic and elastic foil gas bearing is explored based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network in this study so as to improve its stabilization in work. The related principles and structure of hybrid electromagnetic and elastic foil gas bearings is introduced firstly. Then, the proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) bearing controller is introduced and improved into two controllers: IPD and CPID. The controllers and hybrid bearing system are controlled based on the RBF neural network based on deep learning. The characteristics of the hybrid bearing system are explored at the end of this study, and the control simulation research is developed based on the Simulink simulation platform. The effects of the PID, IPD, and CIPD controllers based on the RBF neural network are compared, and they are also compared based on the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results show that the thickness, spread angle, and rotation speed of the elastic foil have great impacts on the bearing system. The proposed CIPD bearing control method based on RBF neural network has the shortest response time and the best control effect. The controller parameter tuning optimization starts to converge after one generation, which is the fastest iteration. It proves that RBF neural network control based on deep learning has high feasibility in hybrid bearing system. Therefore, the results provide an important reference for the application of deep learning in rotating machinery."
https://openalex.org/W3109678425,"Measuring event concentration often involves identifying clusters of events at various scales of resolution and across different regions. In the context of a city, for example, clusters may be characterized by the proximity of events in the metric space. However, events may also occur over urban structures such as public transportation and infrastructure systems, which are naturally represented as networks. Our work provides a theoretical framework to determine whether events distributed over a set of interconnected nodes are concentrated on a particular subset. Our main analysis shows how the proposed or any other measure of event concentration on a network must explicitly take into account its degree distribution. We apply the framework to measure event concentration (i) on a street network (i.e., approximated as a regular network where events represent criminal activities); and (ii) on a social network (i.e., a power law network where events represent users who are dissatisfied after purchasing the same product)."
