Competition at the phosphorylation level plus accumulation of mannose-6-phosphate can fully account for the toxicity of mannose in honey bees."

https://openalex.org/W2050135295,A modification of the self-stimulation technique of Olds enabled rats to regulate and maintain at a preferred level the amount of brain-stimulating current they received as reinforcement for lever pressing. The method used two levers to deliver brief brain shocks: each response at one lever increased the current intensity a small step and each response at the other lowered it one step.

He and his fellow-workers, in particular Sikharulidze2, are of the opinion that the lens fibres are derived from cells which are neural in origin, and which require for the initiation of fibre production the products of the cytolysis of epidermal elements."

https://openalex.org/W1996144625,"INFECTIOUS ribonucleic acid has been prepared from several virus-infected tissues and from purified animal viruses1–4 using the phenol extraction method of Gierer and Schramm5. Assuming that the tick-borne encephalitis virus contains a nucleic acid of ribose type, we have succeeded in preparing by the same method infectious ribonucleic acid from mouse brains infected with the Hypr strain of tick-borne virus isolated in Czechoslovakia. The infectivity of such preparations was about 103–105 times lower than that of virus. To be sure that the infectivity of ribonucleic acid was not caused by contamination with virus particles, the acid and virus were titrated after different treatment. The titrations were carried out in white mice by intracerebral injection of 0.03 ml. using serial ten-fold dilutions. Clarified 10 per cnet (w/v) suspension of infected brains was designated as undiluted virus for convenience in comparing the infectivities of virus and ribonucleic acid. The results are shown in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2012932448,"IN connexion with our work on the chemistry of cellulose and related carbohydrates, it was found desirable to investigate certain properties of algal polysaccharides. In seeking a source of these materials we noted that Australian species of brown algæ appear to have received little chemical study, although the carbohydrates of Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida and Bifurcaria brassicaeformis of South Africa have been investigated1. The northern hemisphere species, especially of the genus Laminaria, have been studied in considerable detail2,3: large seasonal variations occur in the contents of laminarin (0–30 per cent), alginic acid (10–30 per cent) and mannitol (0–30 per cent); the fucoidin content is low and less variable3,4"

https://openalex.org/W1991286545,"DURING recent years there has been considerable interest in the use of chelating agents to remove certain radioelements deposited in the body. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid has been investigated extensively, and more recently there have been reports that diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid is more effective than ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid for the removal of deposited plutonium1, and that it also increases the excretion of thorium from the body2. We have studied the effect of these two chelating agents on the removal of americium-241 from the rat. Preliminary experiments showed that both reagents significantly increased the excretion of this nuclide and that diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid was approximately twice as effective as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1978831218,"THE part played by the thyroid gland in teleost metabolism has been investigated by many workers. In cold-blooded vertebrates it appears to be concerned more with growth than with general metabolism1. However, there is a great deal of controversy on practically every aspect of thyroid physiology. In higher vertebrates, the parathyroid plays an important part in the mineral metabolism. Fishes have, so far as known, no parathyroid. It has been suggested2 that the ultimobranchial body in the teleost is the homologue of the parathyroid but as yet nothing positive has been established regarding this hypothesis. Fishes are able to control mineral metabolism within narrow limits; but there is scarcely any information concerning the role of the endocrines in this regulation. Radioisotopes are being used to carry out experiments to find out whether the thyroid gland has any influence on mineral metabolism in fishes."
