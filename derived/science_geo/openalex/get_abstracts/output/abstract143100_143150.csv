https://openalex.org/W2063511140,"Doublecortin (DCX) is required for normal migration of neurons into the cerebral cortex, since mutations in the human gene cause a disruption of cortical neuronal migration. To date, little is known about the distribution of DCX protein or its function. Here, we demonstrate that DCX is expressed in migrating neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous system during embryonic and postnatal development. DCX protein localization overlaps with microtubules in cultured primary cortical neurons, and this overlapping expression is disrupted by microtubule depolymerization. DCX coassembles with brain microtubules, and recombinant DCX stimulates the polymerization of purified tubulin. Finally, overexpression of DCX in heterologous cells leads to a dramatic microtubule phenotype that is resistant to depolymerization. Therefore, DCX likely directs neuronal migration by regulating the organization and stability of microtubules."

Injured tissue that was depleted of GFAP-positive astrocytes exhibited (1) a prolonged 25-fold increase in infiltration of CD45-positive leukocytes, including ultrastructurally identified monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, (2) failure of blood-brain barrier (BBB) repair, (3) substantial neuronal degeneration that could be attenuated by chronic glutamate receptor blockade, and (4) a pronounced increase in local neurite outgrowth. These findings show that genetic targeting can be used to ablate scar-forming astrocytes and demonstrate roles for astrocytes in regulating leukocyte trafficking, repairing the BBB, protecting neurons, and restricting nerve fiber growth after injury in the adult central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2088745158,"Recently, we and others reported that the doublecortin gene is responsible for X-linked lissencephaly and subcortical laminar heterotopia. Here, we show that Doublecortin is expressed in the brain throughout the period of corticogenesis in migrating and differentiating neurons. Immunohistochemical studies show its localization in the soma and leading processes of tangentially migrating neurons, and a strong axonal labeling is observed in differentiating neurons. In cultured neurons, Doublecortin expression is highest in the distal parts of developing processes. We demonstrate by sedimentation and microscopy studies that Doublecortin is associated with microtubules (MTs) and postulate that it is a novel MAP. Our data suggest that the cortical dysgeneses associated with the loss of Doublecortin function might result from abnormal cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal cell development."
https://openalex.org/W2010905290,"The size of a pool of readily releasable vesicles at a giant brainstem synapse, the calyx of Held, was probed with three independent approaches. Using simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic whole-cell recordings, two forms of presynaptic Ca2+ stimuli were applied in rapid succession: uncaging of Ca2+ by flash photolysis and the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The ensuing transmitter release showed a nearly complete cross-inhibition between the two stimuli, indicating the depletion of a limited pool of about 700 transmitter quanta. The pool size was confirmed in experiments using enhanced extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, as well as short, high-frequency stimulus trains. The results reveal a surprisingly large pool of functionally available vesicles, of which a fraction of about 0.2 is released by a single presynaptic action potential under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2045611996,"Aquaporin-5 (AQP5) is a water-selective transporting protein expressed in epithelial cells of serous acini in salivary gland. We generated AQP5 null mice by targeted gene disruption. The genotype distribution from intercross of founder AQP5 heterozygous mice was 70:69:29 wild-type:heterozygote:knockout, indicating impaired prenatal survival of the null mice. The knockout mice had grossly normal appearance, but grew ∼20% slower than litter-matched wild-type mice when placed on solid food after weaning. Pilocarpine-stimulated saliva production was reduced by more than 60% in AQP5 knockout mice. Compared with the saliva from wild-type mice, the saliva from knockout mice was hypertonic (420 mosm) and dramatically more viscous. Amylase and protein secretion, functions of salivary mucous cells, were not affected by AQP5 deletion. Water channels AQP1 and AQP4 have also been localized to salivary gland; however, pilocarpine stimulation studies showed no defect in the volume or composition of saliva in AQP1 and AQP4 knockout mice. These results implicate a key role for AQP5 in saliva fluid secretion and provide direct evidence that high epithelial cell membrane water permeability is required for active, near-isosmolar fluid transport.

The family of molecular water channels (aquaporins) numbers 10 in mammals and many more in plants and lower organisms. There has been considerable recent interest in the role of aquaporins in mammalian physiology and disease mechanisms.

Recent phenotype characterization of transgenic knockout mice lacking AQP1 and AQP4 has been very informative in defining the roles of these water channels in the urinary concentrating mechanism, lung fluid transport, and gastrointestinal physiology (2Ma T.

Immunocytochemical studies from several laboratories showed AQP5 expression in the apical membranes of serous acinar cells in salivary and lacrimal glands, type I alveolar epithelial cells, and surface corneal epithelial cells (8Hamann S.

AQP5 appears to function as an unregulated water-selective channel with comparable intrinsic water permeability to AQP1 (12Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The human AQP5 gene contains 4 exons with exon-intron boundaries at identical locations to those several other aquaporins (13Lee M.D. Bhakta K.Y. Raina S. Yonescu R. Griffin C.A. Copeland N.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8599-8604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); the genes for AQP5, AQP2, and AQP6 are clustered in a small 27-kb region at chromosome locus 12q13 (14Ma T. Yang B. Kuo W.L. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1996; 35: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was proposed that AQP5 plays an important role in glandular secretions of saliva and tears and that abnormalities in AQP5 might occur in some forms of Sjogren's syndrome (15Delporte C. O'Connell B.C. He X. Lancaster H.E. O'Connell A.C. Agre P. Baum R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3268-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Delporte C. Hoque A.T.

Aquaporin gene delivery to salivary gland has been proposed to increase fluid secretion (15Delporte C. O'Connell B.C. He X. Lancaster H.E. O'Connell A.C. Agre P. Baum R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3268-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, these possibilities are based on the unproven assumption that AQP5 is a major pathway for water movement in salivary gland and that active near-isosmolar fluid secretion across acinar cells requires a high apical cell membrane water permeability. The purpose of this study was to define the involvement of AQP5 in saliva secretion, as well as that of AQP1 and AQP4, water channels expressed in salivary gland capillaries and ducts (17Li J. Nielsen S. Dai Y. Lazowski K.W. Christensen E.I. Tabak L.A. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Frigeri A. Gropper M. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotype studies were done on AQP5 null mice generated by targeted gene disruption, as well as on AQP1 and AQP4 null mice. The principal finding was that AQP5 deletion is associated with production of a low volume hypertonic viscous saliva, providing direct evidence for a role of AQP5 in near-isosmolar fluid secretion in salivary gland. The cDNA encoding mouse AQP5 was isolated from salivary gland cDNA by PCR based on homology to rat AQP5. The structure of the mouse AQP5 gene was analyzed by PCR amplification of exon-intron-exon fragments using C57BL6/J mouse genomic DNA as template. A targeting vector was constructed using a 1.4-kb fragment of genomic DNA containing partial exon 1, intron 1, and partial exon 2 (left arm) and a 4.2-kb fragment containing exon 4 and downstream genomic DNA (right arm). The left and right genomic fragments (flanking a 1.8-kb PolIIneobpA cassette) were PCR-amplified, and a PGK-tk cassette was inserted upstream for negative selection. The vector was linearized at a unique downstream NotI site and electroporated into CB1–4 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Transfected ES cells were selected with G418 and FIAU for 7 days, yielding seven targeted clones out of 286 doubly resistant colonies upon PCR screening using a neo-specific antisense primer and an AQP5 gene-specific sense primer located 30 base pairs upstream of the targeting region. Homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern hybridization in which 10 μg of genomic DNAs were digested withXbaI, electrophoresed, transferred to a Nylon+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a 0.7-kb genomic fragment as indicated in Fig. 1 A. ES cells were injected into PC 2.5 day 8 cell morula stage CD1 zygotes, cultured overnight to blastocysts, and transferred to pseudopregnant B6D2 females. Offspring from breeding of chimeras and wild-type mice were genotyped by PCR followed by Southern blot analysis as described above. Heterozygous founder mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous AQP5 knockout mice. RNA from submandibular gland was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNAs (10 μg/lane) were resolved on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose denaturing gel, transferred to a Nylon+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized at high stringency with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the mouse AQP5 cDNA coding sequence. A polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide (NH2-CEEDEDHREERKK-COOH) corresponding to the predicted C terminus of mouse AQP5. Immunoperoxidase localization of AQP5 protein in fixed frozen section of salivary gland was done using a 1:500 dilution of serum as described previously (18Frigeri A. Gropper M. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal nembutol (50 mg/kg). Saliva production was stimulated by subcutaneous injection of pilocarpine (80 mg/kg) as described previously (19Marmary Y. Fox P.C. Baum B.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 88A: 307-310Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Salivation generally occurred in less than 20 s. Saliva was collected in two 5-min intervals using a preweighed suction apparatus. Mice were positioned on their side with head slightly down to facilitate suctioning every 15–30 s. The mice were sacrificed after saliva collection, and tissues were harvested as needed. The investigator was blinded to mouse genotype for saliva collections. At the end of saliva collection, the pH was determined using pH paper and the total amount of saliva by gravimetry. Saliva osmolality, and concentrations of sodium, potassium, and chloride were determined by the University of California San Francisco clinical chemistry laboratory. Analysis of the mouse AQP5 gene indicated 4 exons separated by 3 introns (lengths 1.3, 0.6, and 0.8 kb) in the coding region. Exon-intron boundaries were located at residues 122, 176, and 204 in the AQP5 coding sequence, as was reported for the human AQP5 gene (13Lee M.D. Bhakta K.Y. Raina S. Yonescu R. Griffin C.A.

Ma T. Xu Z. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1999; 57: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and AQP6 (21Ma T. Yang B. Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1997; 43: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) genes. Genomic Southern blot analysis showed a single copy mouse AQP5 gene per haploid genome. Fig.1 A shows the targeting vector for targeted AQP5 gene deletion. Part of exon 2, exon 3, part of exon 4, and introns 1 and 2 were replaced by a neo cassette to prevent the expression of functional AQP5 in the null mice. Fig. 1 B shows Southern blot analysis of liver DNA from a wild-type, heterozygote, and AQP5 knockout mice. The band at 21 kb corresponds to the modified gene locus. Fig. 1 C shows a Northern blot analysis of salivary gland mRNA. A single transcript of ∼1.6 kb was observed in wild-type and heterozygous mice. No full-length transcript was seen in the AQP5 knockout mice. By immunocytochemistry, AQP5 was localized at the apical pole of acinar cells in the salivary gland of wild-type mice (Fig. 1 D,left), in agreement with results in rat (10Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Funaki H. Yamamoto F.H. Koyama Y. Kondo D. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Kobayashi H. Sawaguchi S. Abe H.

Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), with no detectable AQP5 protein in the knockout mice (Fig. 1 D,right). The AQP5 null mice were grossly normal in appearance and general activity, except for mild growth retardation seen within the first weeks after weaning (Fig. 2 A). We believe that slowed growth of AQP5 null mice when placed on solid food is a consequence of defective saliva production (see below), because no differences in growth were found when mice were placed on a Peptamine liquid diet after weaning. Genotype analysis of 168 offspring from intercross of founder AQP5 heterozygotes showed a 70:69:29 distribution of wild-type:heterozygote:knockout mice, indicating decreased prenatal survival of AQP5 null mice. For comparison, an ∼1:2:1 genotype ratio was found for intercross of AQP4 heterozygous mice (2Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), whereas significantly fewer mice of the AQP1 null genotype were found from intercross of AQP1 heterozygous mice (3Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). A method was developed to reproducibly measure total saliva secretion, which contains contributions from submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands, each of which expresses AQP5 in serous acinar cells (22Matsuzaki T. Suzuki T. Koyama H. Tanaka S. Takata K. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Saliva secretion was induced in anesthetized mice by pilocarpine and collected using a mini-suction apparatus based on a recent design (23Wolff A. Begleiter A. Moskona D. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice, marked salivation was observed within 20 s after pilocarpine injection, and substantial amounts of clear, nonviscous fluid were collected. The amount of collected fluid was reproducible: mean and S.D. values were 228 ± 21 mg and 154 ± 17 mg for the first and second 5 min periods after pilocarpine injection, respectively. Less than 5 mg of fluid could be collected over 5 min in anesthetized mice that did not receive pilocarpine. The saliva collected from every pilocarpine-stimulated AQP5 null mouse was remarkably viscous and tenacious and of lower volume than that collected from wild-type and heterozygous mice (Fig. 2 C). Fig. 3 A summarizes the amount of saliva collected in the first and second 5-min periods from wild-type mice, AQP5 heterozygous and null mice, and AQP1 and AQP4 null mice. The reduced production of saliva in AQP5 null mice indicates defective serous cell function. Surprisingly, deletion of AQP1 in the salivary microvascular endothelia did not affect saliva production, which contrasts with the marked effects found when AQP1 is deleted in lung and renal microvessels (3Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 6Bai C. Fukuda N. Song Y. Ma T. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The collected saliva from wild-type and AQP5 null mice was analyzed for osmolality, electrolyte composition, protein content, amylase activity, and pH. Fig. 3 B shows that the saliva from AQP5 null mice was hypertonic, with significantly higher osmolality than saliva from the wild-type mice and the AQP1 and AQP4 null mice. The concentrations of Na+, K+, and Cl− were also higher. Total protein secretion and amylase activity were not affected by deletion of AQP5, AQP1, or AQP4 (Fig. 3 C). Saliva pH measured immediately after collection (before HCO3 loss) was in the range 9.0–10.0 for all mice. The abnormal saliva volume, osmolality, and electrolyte content in AQP5 null mice implicates the involvement of AQP5 in transcellular fluid secretion across serous-type acinar cells. Serous acinar cells contain multiple salt-transporting proteins for fluid secretion, whereas mucous cells secrete proteinaceous materials, including amylase (24Nauntofte B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G823-G837PubMed Google Scholar). The “primary saliva” produced by serous cells is modified during its transit through the salivary duct, where it is thought that salts are absorbed across a relatively water-impermeable ductal epithelium. The normal protein and amylase content of saliva from AQP5 null mice is consistent with the absence of AQP5 in mucous cells. Primary saliva should be near-isotonic, becoming progressively hypotonic during its passage through the salivary duct. The hypertonic saliva from AQP5 null mice suggests that active acinar cell salt secretion into the gland lumen occurs without adequate amounts of water. The decreased salivary gland fluid secretion in AQP5 null mice supports the paradigm that high epithelial cell membrane water permeability facilitates active near-isosmolar fluid secretion and absorption (reviewed in Ref. 25Spring K.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the small osmotic gradients produced by active salt pumping are able to drive water across highly water permeable cell membranes. Schnermann et al. (4Schnermann J. Chou C.L. Ma T. Traynor T. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) showed that AQP1 deletion in proximal tubule is associated with defective near-isosmolar fluid reabsorption. The data here show that high water permeability is needed for efficient near-isosmolar fluid transport in salivary gland. From the data of Schnermann et al. (4Schnermann J. Chou C.L. Ma T. Traynor T. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), ∼0.5 μl/min of fluid are actively absorbed per cm2 of proximal tubule surface (assuming a smooth surface); in the pilocarpine-stimulated mouse salivary gland, ∼50 μl/min of saliva are secreted across an estimated 5 cm2 of serous acinar cell apical membrane surface area (based on values given in Ref. 26Cook D.I. Young J.A. Schultz S.G. Forte J.G. Rauner B.B. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, 1989: 1-21Google Scholar and assuming smooth surface), giving a high secretion rate of ∼10 μl/min/cm2. Water channels are thus likely to be required in tissues having rapid rates of active fluid transport, such as choroid plexus, ciliary body, and pancreatic acini. The AQP5 null mice should have utility in defining the mechanisms of near-isosmolar fluid absorption in lung, tear secretion in lacrimal gland, and corneal transparency in eye. The mice are also a suitable host for delivery of aquaporin genes to increase saliva production. Last, the finding of salivary gland dysfunction in AQP5-deficient mice mandates the search for disease-causing mutations in human AQP5, as well as pharmacological modulators of AQP5, expression and function."
https://openalex.org/W2064751454,"Narp (neuronal activity–regulated pentraxin) is a secreted immediate-early gene (IEG) regulated by synaptic activity in brain. In this study, we demonstrate that Narp possesses several properties that make it likely to play a key role in excitatory synaptogenesis. Narp is shown to be selectively enriched at excitatory synapses on neurons from both the hippocampus and spinal cord. Overexpression of recombinant Narp increases the number of excitatory but not inhibitory synapses in cultured spinal neurons. In transfected HEK 293T cells, Narp interacts with itself, forming large surface clusters that coaggregate AMPA receptor subunits. Moreover, Narp-expressing HEK 293T cells can induce the aggregation of neuronal AMPA receptors. These studies support a model in which Narp functions as an extracellular aggregating factor for AMPA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2165671016,"Segmentation of the vertebrate brain is most obvious in the hindbrain, where successive segments contain repeated neuronal types. One such set of three repeated reticulospinal neurons—the Mauthner cell, MiD2cm, and MiD3cm—is thought to produce different forms of the escape response that fish use to avoid predators. We used laser ablations in larval zebrafish to test the hypothesis that these segmental hindbrain cells form a functional group. Killing all three cells eliminated short-latency, high-performance escape responses to both head- and tail-directed stimuli. Killing just the Mauthner cell affected escapes from taildirected but not from head-directed stimuli. These results reveal the contributions of one set of reticulospinal neurons to behavior and support the idea that serially repeated hindbrain neurons form functional groups."
https://openalex.org/W2075455339,"Particle-mediated gene transfer and two-photon microscopy were used to monitor the behavior of dendrites of individual cortical pyramidal neurons coexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). While the dendrites and spines of neurons expressing GFP alone grew modestly over 24–48 hr, coexpressing BDNF elicited dramatic sprouting of basal dendrites, accompanied by a regression of dendritic spines. Compared to GFP-transfected controls, the newly formed dendrites and spines were highly unstable. Experiments utilizing Trk receptor bodies, K252a, and overexpression of nerve growth factor (NGF) demonstrated that these effects were mediated by secreted BDNF interacting with extracellular TrkB receptors. Thus, BDNF induces structural instability in dendrites and spines, which, when restricted to particular portions of a dendritic arbor, may help translate activity patterns into specific morphological changes."
https://openalex.org/W2089769736,"Thalamocortical (TC) synapses carry information into the neocortex, but they are far outnumbered by excitatory intracortical (IC) synapses. We measured the synaptic properties that determine the efficacy of TC and IC axons converging onto spiny neurons of layer 4 in the mouse somatosensory cortex. Quantal events from TC and IC synapses were indistinguishable. However, TC axons had, on average, about 3 times more release sites than IC axons, and the mean release probability at TC synapses was about 1.5 times higher than that at IC synapses. Differences of innervation ratio and release probability make the average TC connection several times more effective than the average IC connection, and may allow small numbers of TC axons to dominate the activity of cortical layer 4 cells during sensory inflow."

Motor and sensory axons are severely defasciculated and aberrantly projected within their final target tissues. Schwann cells are completely absent in the peripheral nerves. Schwann cell precursors are present within the DRG and proliferate normally, but their ability to migrate is decreased. Acetylcholine receptors cluster within the central band of the mutant diaphragm muscle. However, these clusters are dispersed and morphologically different from those in control muscle.

https://openalex.org/W2010816636,"Here, we show that disruption of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein– (NSF–) GluR2 interaction by infusion into cultured hippocampal neurons of a blocking peptide (pep2m) caused a rapid decrease in the frequency but no change in the amplitude of AMPA receptor–mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor–mediated mEPSCs were not changed. Viral expression of pep2m reduced the surface expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors, whereas NMDA receptor surface expression in the same living cells was unchanged. In permeabilized neurons, the total amount of GluR2 immunoreactivity was unchanged, and a punctate distribution of GluR2 was observed throughout the dendritic tree. These data suggest that the NSF–GluR2 interaction is required for the surface expression of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors and that disruption of the interaction leads to the functional elimination of AMPA receptors at synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2086680916,"The Na+/H+exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) is the key member of a family of exchangers that regulates intracellular pH and cell volume. Activation of NHE-1 by growth factors is rapid, correlates with increased NHE-1 phosphorylation and cell alkalinization, and plays a role in cell cycle progression. By two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping of immunoprecipitated NHE-1, we identify serine 703 as the major serum-stimulated amino acid. Mutation of serine 703 to alanine had no effect on acid-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange but completely prevented the growth factor-mediated increase in NHE-1 affinity for H+. In addition, we show that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) is a key NHE-1 kinase since p90RSK phosphorylates NHE-1 serine 703 stoichiometricallyin vitro, and transfection with kinase-inactive p90RSK inhibits serum-induced phosphorylation of NHE-1 serine 703 in transfected 293 cells. These findings establish p90RSK as a serum-stimulated NHE-1 kinase and a mediator of increased Na+/H+ exchange in vivo.

Among these proteins, Na+/H+ exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) is ubiquitous (1Noel J. Pouysségur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

NHE-1 is activated by growth factors that alter its affinity for intracellular H+ and thereby cause cell alkalinization (1Noel J. Pouysségur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular alkalinization mediated by NHE-1 (defined by amiloride-sensitive inhibition) is required for cell growth (3Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in NHE-1 function may contribute to disease pathogenesis. In the NHE-1 knockout mouse, seizures develop at age 19 days (4Cox G.A. Lutz C.M. Yang C.L. Biemesderfer D. Bronson R.T. Fu A. Aronson P.S. Noebels J.L. Frankel W.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Increased NHE-1 activity has been demonstrated in cells and tissues of hypertensive humans and animals (5Siffert W. Dusing R. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a genetic model of hypertension, exhibits increased Na+/H+ exchange and increased vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth compared with the normotensive Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY) (6Berk B.C. Vallega G. Muslin A.J. Gordon H.M. Canessa M. Alexander R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In SHR there is no significant change in NHE-1 cDNA sequence (7Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), steady state mRNA levels (8Lucchesi P.A. DeRoux N. Berk B.C.

Hypertens. 1994; 12: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, there is a significant increase in NHE-1 phosphorylation in response to growth factors in VSMC derived from the SHR compared with WKY (10Siczkowski M. Davies J.E. Ng L.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that alterations in NHE-1 phosphorylation (and the responsible kinases) contribute to the SHR phenotype. intracellular pH Na+/H+ exchanger isoform-1 spontaneously hypertensive rat vascular smooth muscle cell Wistar Kyoto rat mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase glutathioneS-transferase acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 wild type NHE-1 has been shown to be constitutively phosphorylated in growth-arrested cells. In response to growth factors, multiple sites show increased phosphorylation based on two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps (11Goss G.G. Woodside M. Wakabayashi S. Pouysségur J. Waddell T. Downey G.P. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acids phosphorylated by growth factors are located in the carboxyl-terminal 300 amino acids of the exchanger (12Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because changes in NHE-1 phosphorylation may regulate Na+/H+ exchange, these findings suggest that increased Na+/H+ exchange in the SHR is caused by an alteration in the activity of kinases that phosphorylate NHE-1. Thus, identification of growth factor-stimulated kinases that phosphorylate NHE-1 may provide insight into the pathogenesis of hypertension. Several protein kinases have been proposed to regulate NHE-1, including Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinases (13Fliegel L. Walsh M.P. Singh D. Wong C. Barr A. Biochem.

Data implicating a key role for ERK1/2 are strongest, since pharmacological inhibition of the MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway with PD98059 (18Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl.

Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.): I-46Google Scholar) dramatically decreased growth factor-stimulated Na+/H+exchange. It is not clear that ERK1/2 directly phosphorylate NHE-1, and it is possible that other kinase(s) downstream of ERK1/2 are responsible for NHE-1 phosphorylation. We proposed previously that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), a downstream substrate of ERK1/2 (22Sturgill T.W. Ray B.L. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), was a physiologically relevant NHE-1 kinase (23Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Phan V. Kusuhara M. Lucchesi P.A. Berk B.C. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based on the following findings: 1) a 90-kDa kinase exhibited increased activity toward an NHE-1-GST fusion protein in lysates from SHR VSMC compared with WKY VSMC (24Phan V. Kusuhara M. Lucchesi P.A. Berk B.C. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); 2) immunodepletion of p90RSKdecreased the activity of the 90-kDa kinase; 3) PD98059 blocked growth factor-mediated activation of p90RSK and decreased NHE-1 phosphorylation; 4) p90RSK immunoprecipitated from angiotensin II stimulated VSMC-phosphorylated recombinant NHE-1in vitro; 5) the time courses for stimulation of p90RSK and Na+/H+ exchange activity by angiotensin II were also similar (23Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed experiments with mutated NHE-1 and p90RSKproteins to assess their effects on growth factor-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange. The results indicate that p90RSK phosphorylates serine 703 of NHE-1, and this phosphorylation is required for growth factor stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange. Anti-NHE-1 antiserum (G116) was a gift from Dr. L. L. Ng (Leicester Royal Infirmary, UK); anti-p90RSK2antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). NHE-1 synthetic peptides EP-1 (RRRARIGSDPLA) and EP-2 (MARARIGSDPLAYEPK) were from PeptidoGenic Research (Livermore, CA). The plasmid (pcDNA3.1) was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Human NHE-1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. L. Fliegel (University of Alberta, Canada). DN-RSK and WT-RSK have been described (25Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Mol. Cell.

VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of 200–250-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) as described previously. VSMC (passages 5–13) were growth-arrested at 70–80% confluence by incubation in 0.5% calf serum/DMEM for 48 h prior to use. PS127A cells (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts that overexpress human NHE-1) and PS120 cells (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts deficient in NHE-1) were gifts of Dr. J. Pouyssegur (University of Nice, France). PS127A and PS120 cells were maintained in DMEM (pH 7.4–7.6) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% FCS (Summit, Ft. Collins, CO). 293 cells (ATCC, CRL1573) were maintained in DMEM (pH 7.4–7.6) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS. VSMC were harvested using modified Oncogene Science lysis buffer as described previously (23Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PS127A, PS120, and 293 cells were harvested using NHE-1 lysis buffer (14Fafournoux P. Ghysdael J. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9510-9515Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were immediately frozen on ethanol/dry ice, and the cell lysates were then thawed on ice, scraped, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants were used immediately. For immunoprecipitation of p90RSK, cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were incubated with anti-p90RSK (2 μg) antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h on a roller system at 4 °C. The beads were washed two times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, 2 times with 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer (500 mmol/liter LiCl, 100 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol), and two times with 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitated p90RSK was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in 200 μl of kinase reaction buffer (30 μm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 50 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) with various concentrations of EP-1. The reactions were centrifuged for 10 s at 5000 rpm, and 10 μl of the supernatant was collected and applied to 1 × 1-cm P-81 paper. The P-81 paper was washed 4 times for 2 min with 0.1% phosphoric acid and incorporated 32P measured by scintillation counting (26Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Nonspecific phosphorylation was determined by subtraction of the counts from reactions containing the same concentration of EP-1 without p90RSK. For the analysis of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of EP-1, four immunoprecipitates were incubated together at 30 °C in 400 μl of kinase reaction buffer as described above with 10 μmEP-1, and samples were removed at the times indicated. Immunoprecipitated p90RSK was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 100 μm EP-2. The reaction was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected and digested with 2 μg of trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The pH was adjusted to 8.4 with ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium hydroxide. Tryptic phosphopeptides were purified on a C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column. The mass and sequence of the peptides were determined using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) as described previously (27Figeys D. Gygi S.P. Zhang Y. Watts J. Gu M. Aebersold R. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated p90RSK from PS127A cells stimulated by 20% FCS for 5 min was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 200 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μg of GST-NHE-1 fusion protein (which contains amino acids 675–725 of human NHE-1 (23Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). PS127A cells, transfected PS120 cells, and transfected 293 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, using previously published protocols (28Grinstein S. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23823-23828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, cells deprived of serum for 8 h were exposed to phosphate-free medium for 15 h and then labeled with 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. Cells were stimulated with 20% FCS for 5 min and were harvested. NHE-1 was immunoprecipitated, washed six times with lysis buffer, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. For phosphopeptide mapping, the immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The phosphorylated NHE-1 was identified by autoradiography, excised, and digested with trypsin following established protocols (29Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were fractionated by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (29Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the peptides were separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis (1,000 V for 1.5 h; 10% acetic acid, 1% pyridine in water, pH 3.3) and in the second dimension by ascending chromatography (37% 1-butanol, 25% pyridine, 9% acetic acid in water, pH 5.0) (30McSwine R.L. Babnigg G. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Villereal M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) for 2 h. The phosphorylated peptides were detected by autoradiography, and the radioactivity was analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To permit comparison of fold change in32P incorporation among different experiments, the following calculation was performed. The normalization constant,k, was determined for each experiment by Equation 1: P1 densitometric volume in 20% FCS sample divided by P1 densitometric value in 0.5% FCS times k = 1.0. The normalized value for each phosphopeptide was then determined by Equation 2: Pxdensitometric volume in 20% FCS sample divided by Pxdensitometric value in 0.5% FCS times k. NHE-1 was immunoprecipitated from a lysate of 500 μg of serum-deprived PS127A cells with the G116 NHE-1 antibody and protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitant was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 0.5 units of active p90RSK2. The reaction was stopped by washing 6 times with the lysis buffer and then subjected to tryptic two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping as described above. Serine 703 was mutated to alanine using polymerase chain reaction with the following primers (the mutated residues is shown in bold): 2090 CTCGGGCCCGCATCGGCGCAGACCCAC 2116. Wild type NHE-1 (NHE-1(WT)) and the S703A mutant NHE-1 (NHE-1(S703A)) were inserted into pcDNA3.1 using HaeIII and XbaI. PS120 cells were seeded at 40% confluence onto 60-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection and transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After 6 h of incubation with the DNA-lipid complexes, the cells were re-fed with serum-containing medium. Two days post-transfection, the transfected cells were trypsinized and seeded onto three 100-mm dishes in medium containing 1000 μg/ml neomycin. After 1 week of selection, cell colonies were picked and expanded into individual cultures. Transfected PS120 cells were maintained in DMEM, 5% FCS with 1000 μg/ml neomycin, and every week cells were subjected to acid selection to maintain high level expression of NHE-1 as described previously (31Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were exposed to 50 mm NH4Cl in TBSS (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 200 mg/dl glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 1 h followed by low NaCl/choline Cl solution buffer (130 mm choline Cl, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 200 mg/dl glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.5) for 1 h. For transient transfection to 293 cells, cells were seeded at 80–90% confluence onto 100-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection and co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pcDNA NHE-1 and 1.5 μg of pcDNA LacZ, pMT2 DN-RSK, or pMT2 WT-RSK using LipofectAMINE Plus method. After 6 h of incubation with the DNA-lipid complexes, the cells were re-fed with serum-containing medium. On the next day, cells were serum-deprived to 0.8% calf serum and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Na+/H+exchange was determined by ethyl isopropyl amiloride-sensitive pHi recovery following acid loading as described previously using the fluorescent pH-sensitive dye, BCECF (32Mitsuka M. Berk B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C562-C569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Berk B.C. Aronow M.S. Brock T.A. Cragoe Jr., E. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5057-5064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent measurements (excitation at 500 and 450 nm with emission at 530 nm) were made with a PTI Delta scan spectrofluorometer. Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with gelatin and growth-arrested at 70–80% confluence by incubation in 0.5% calf serum/DMEM for 24 h prior to use. Cells were loaded with 3 μm BCECF-AM in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min, washed twice, and incubated in a HEPES-Tris balanced salt solution (HBSS, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES buffered to pH 7.4 at 37 °C with Tris base) for 30 min. Cells were acid-loaded with 20 μm nigericin in KCl solution (135 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). After the pHi decreased to 6.5, the solution was changed to TBSS, pH 7.4. The nigericin/high K+ technique was used to calibrate the relationship between excitation ratio (F500/450) and pHi. The rate of pHi recovery was converted to mmol of H+/min/liter cells (J H) by multiplying by the buffering power. Buffering power was determined by stepwise reduction of NH4Cl under conditions in which ion fluxes were completely inhibited (5 mm BaCl2, 30 μm ethyl isopropyl amiloride). The data were then plotted as mmol of H+/min/liter cells (J H) versus pHi . Values presented are means ± S.D. Student's t test was used when appropriate. pvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. It has been shown previously that serum stimulates phosphorylation of NHE-1 and that the majority of the de novo incorporation occurs in a single tryptic peptide of NHE-1 (30McSwine R.L. Babnigg G. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Villereal M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of immunoprecipitated NHE-1 from PS127A fibroblasts that were maintained in 0.5% FCS (Fig. 1 A) or stimulated with 20% FCS for 5 min (Fig. 1 B). Five major phosphopeptides were identified (see scheme in Fig. 1 C). To analyze changes in phosphorylation among different experiments, the intensity change of each spot was normalized to spot P1 using the calculations described under “Experimental Procedures.” This normalization obviated the need to demonstrate that equal quantities of NHE-1 were expressed and immunoprecipitated for different experiments and cell preparations. Unlike previous investigations that showed growth factors increase the phosphorylation of only one peptide (30McSwine R.L. Babnigg G. Musch M.W. Chang E.B. Villereal M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we found two serum-stimulated NHE-1 phosphopeptides (Fig. 1,A and B). These phosphopeptides, termed P4 and P5 (Fig. 1 C), showed 4.2 ± 0.8-fold and 11.3 ± 0.7-fold increases (n = 3, all analyses are mean ± S.D.), respectively, in response to 20% FCS (Fig. 1 D). Based on the magnitude of the serum-stimulated increase in phosphorylation and electrophoretic mobility, we believe that phosphopeptide P5 is the same tryptic peptide described by other investigators. We and others (24Phan V. Kusuhara M. Lucchesi P.A. Berk B.C. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have observed that phosphorylation of NHE-1 in response to serum is inhibited by PD98059 suggesting that at least one NHE-1 kinase is regulated by the MEK1 and ERK1/2 pathway. Because we also found that ERK1/2 did not readily phosphorylate recombinant NHE-1-(625–747) as shown by a stoichiometry of only <0.05 (mol of phosphate/mol of total substrate) in an immune complex kinase reaction (17Kusuhara M. Takahashi E. Peterson T.E. Abe J. Ishida M. Han J. Ulevitch R. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that ERK1/2 are NHE-1 kinases. However, we previously reported that a 90-kDa NHE-1 kinase (with characteristics consistent with p90RSK) was a possible NHE-1 kinase based on the intensity of phosphorylation and immunodepletion experiments. Activation of this 90-kDa kinase by serum was inhibited by PD98059, consistent with reports that p90RSK is activated by the MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway. To identify which NHE-1 phosphopeptides might be substrates for p90RSK, we studied the effect of MEK1 inhibition on serum stimulation of NHE-1 phosphorylation. The concentration of PD98059 required to inhibit p90RSK-dependent phosphorylation of NHE-1 was determined by incubating PS127A cells with PD98059 (10, 50, and 100 μm) for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with 20% FCS for 5 min followed by p90RSK immunoprecipitation. An immune complex kinase assay was then performed using GST-NHE-1-(625–747) as substrate (23Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There was a >10-fold stimulation of p90RSK by 20% FCS measured by GST-NHE-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, 1st and 3rd lanes). PD98059 inhibited p90RSKactivity in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 2 A, 4th to 6th lanes) which was significant (58 ± 7% inhibition, n = 3) at 100 μm (Fig.2 B). To determine the effect of MEK1 inhibition in vivo, PS127A cells were maintained in 0.5% FCS and incubated with 0.2% Me2SO (vehicle) or 100 μm PD98059 for 1 h. The cells were then kept in 0.5% serum (Fig. 2 C) or stimulated with 20% FCS for 5 min. NHE-1 was immunoprecipitated and two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis performed. Phosphorylation of phosphopeptide P5 was significantly inhibited by 100 μm PD98059 (62 ± 7%, n = 3), whereas phosphorylation of P4 was not significantly changed in subsequent experiments (Fig. 2 F). Based on the findings that phosphopeptide P5 showed the greatest increase in phosphorylation in response to serum, was dependent on MEK1, and co-migrated with a serum-stimulated peptide previously reported, subsequent studies focused on this phosphopeptide. Previous results from our laboratory showed that p90RSK specifically phosphorylates serine and/or threonine residues located between amino acids 670 and 714 of NHE-1 in vitro (23Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed a consensus p90RSK phosphorylation motif (RXXS) (34Erikson E. Maller J.L. Second Messengers and Phosphoproteins. 1988; 12: 135-143PubMed Google Scholar) at amino acids 700–703 (Fig. 3A). To characterize this site of NHE-1 as a substrate for p90RSK, an NHE-1 peptide (EP-1, RRRARIGSDPLA) containing a single serine was synthesized (Fig. 3 A). Activated p90RSK was immunoprecipitated from rat VSMC stimulated with 200 nm angiotensin II for 5 min. An in vitrokinase reaction was then performed with activated p90RSKand EP-1. Fig. 3 B depicts the rate of incorporation of32P into EP-1 as a function of substrate concentration. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the data in Fig. 3 B yielded aK m of 8.2 ± 0.4 μm(n = 3, Fig. 3 C). Incubation of 10 μm EP-1 with activated, immunoprecipitated p90RSK for 30 min produced a stoichiometric phosphorylation of EP-1 (Fig. 3 D). The relatively high affinity of p90RSK for the EP-1 peptide and a stoichiometry ∼1.0 suggests that serine 703 of NHE-1 is a physiological site of phosphorylation by p90RSK. To confirm that serine 703 is the amino acid phosphorylated in response to serum, we performed co-migration studies of synthetic and endogenous NHE-1 tryptic phosphopeptides. We designed a synthetic peptide that included serine 703 and the surrounding amino acid sequence of NHE-1 (EP-2, Fig.3 A). Based on this sequence, we predicted that EP-2 would generate the endogenous phosphopeptide P5 when cleaved by trypsin. To generate phosphorylated EP-2, activated p90RSK was immunoprecipitated from rat VSMC stimulated with 200 nmangiotensin II for 5 min. An immune complex kinase reaction was then performed with EP-2 as substrate. The phosphorylated peptide was then cleaved with trypsin, purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Tryptic cleaved, phospho-EP-2 (tryptic pEP-2, sequence, IGpSDPLYEPK, where pS is phosphoserine) was then subjected to two-dimensional peptide mapping and shown to migrate as a single spot (Fig.4 A). The electrophoretic mobility of tryptic pEP-2 was very similar to P5 of endogenous NHE-1 immunoprecipitated from PS127A cells stimulated by 20% FCS (Fig.4 B). To confirm that P5 and tryptic pEP-2 were identical, tryptic pEP-2 (sample in Fig. 4 A) and tryptic endogenous NHE-1 peptides (sample in Fig. 4 B) were mixed and subjected to two-dimensional peptide mapping. Tryptic pEP-2 co-migrated with endogenous phosphopeptide P5 (Fig. 4 C). To show that phosphopeptide P5 is a good substrate for p90RSK, NHE-1 was immunoprecipitated from PS127A cells, and an in vitro kinase reaction was performed with activated p90RSK. Phosphorylated endogenous NHE-1 was then trypsinized and subjected to two-dimensional peptide mapping (Fig.4 D). Only a single phosphopeptide that co-migrated with P5 and tryptic pEP-2 was observed. Thus, only serine 703 appears to be phosphorylated by p90RSK in vitro, despite the fact that NHE-1 has five potential p90RSK phosphorylation sites based on the RXXS motif (RERS (56), RFTS (325), RLRS (648), RIGS (703), and RCLS (796)). To provide additional evidence that serine 703 is phosphorylated in response to serum, we mutated serine 703 to alanine (S703A) in NHE-1. The mutated NHE-1 (NHE-1(S703A)) or wild type NHE-1 (NHE-1(WT)) proteins were then stably expressed in PS120 fibroblast"
https://openalex.org/W2078324180,"In the CNS, glutamate typically mediates excitatory transmission via local actions at synaptic contacts. In the olfactory bulb, mitral cell dendrites release glutamate at synapses formed only onto the dendrites of inhibitory granule cells. Here, I show excitatory transmission mediated solely by transmitter spillover between mitral cells in olfactory bulb slices. Dendritic glutamate release from individual mitral cells causes self-excitation via local activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Paired recordings reveal that glutamate release from one cell generates NMDA receptor-mediated responses in neighboring mitral cells that are enhanced by blockade of glutamate uptake. Furthermore, spillover generates spontaneous NMDA receptor-mediated population responses. This simultaneous activation of neighboring mitral cells by a diffuse action of glutamate provides a mechanism for synchronizing olfactory principal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2135486647,"Although the linkage of polyglutamine (poly-Q) repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) to Kennedy's disease (X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy) was a major step forward, the detailed molecular mechanism of how the change in poly-Q length contributes to the disease remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a nuclear G-protein, Ras-related nuclear protein/ARA24, as the first AR coactivator that can bind differentially with different lengths of poly-Q within AR. In the yeast and mammalian reciprocal interacting assays, our data suggested the interaction of AR N-terminal domain with ARA24 diminishes as the poly-Q length increases. The coactivation of ARA24 also diminishes with the poly-Q expansion within AR. Deletion of the acidic hexapeptide (DEDDDL) at the C terminus of ARA24 further enhances its AR coactivation. Together, our data suggest that poor interaction and weaker coactivation of ARA24 to the longer poly-Q AR in the X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophied AR could contribute to the weaker transactivation of AR. The consequence of poor interaction and weak coactivation may eventually lead to the partial androgen insensitivity during the development of Kennedy's disease.

Alter M. Sung J.H. Neurology. 1968; 18: 671-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over 50% of the affected males may also have gynecomastia and reduced fertility, suggesting a defect in AR function (2Nagashima T. Seko K. Hirose K. Mannen T. Yoshimura R. Arima R. Nagashima K. Morimatsu Y. J. Neurol. Sci. 1988; 87: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was confirmed by finding an expansion of poly-Q in SBMA AR (3La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H. Nature. 1991; 352: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how changes in poly-Q length within AR contribute to the disease. 1) SBMA AR may reduce binding affinity to androgen (4MacLean H.E. Choi W.T. Rekaris G. Warne G.L. Zajac J.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 508-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) SBMA AR may become more unstable and can degrade to small toxic AR (5Choong C.S. Kemppainen J.A. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1527-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar); and 3) SBMA AR may aggregate in cytoplasm by cross-linking with itself or other proteins (6Merry D.E. Kobayashi Y. Bailey C.K. Taye A.A. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The last hypothesis inspired us to find the potential AR-associated proteins that may contribute to this disease. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we were able to find an AR coactivator, ARA24, that can differentially activate the AR with different poly-Q lengths within AR. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that this AR coactivator has an identical sequence with Ran (7Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Genetic results have identified that Ran/ARA24 is involved in nuclear transport of proteins and RNA, cell cycle progression, and nuclear structure in mitotic regulation, as well as RNA and DNA synthesis (8Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ran/ARA24 was purified as a complex with a chromatin-associated DNA-binding protein, RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1). RCC1 was first identified as the product of a gene mutated in the tsBN2 (temperature-sensitive baby hamster kidney) cell line (9Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Yamashita K. Iida H. Pines J. Yasudo H. Shibata Y. Hunter T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). RCC1 has been shown to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor on Ran/ARA24 by increasing its rate ∼5 × 105 times. On the other hand, Ran GTPase-activating protein can also increase the GTPase activity ∼1 × 105 times (10Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). During biochemical identification of Ran-associated protein, previous reports mainly revealed its functions in nuclear transport (8Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Ran/ARA24 can also interact with the AR N-terminal poly-Q region and enhance the AR transactivation.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies concerning the transactivation activity of AR with different poly-Q lengths have consistently shown their inverse relationship (21Yeh S. Lin H. Kang H.-Y. Lin M. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 96: 5458-5463Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 25Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that ARA24 interacts with the AR poly-Q region and functions as an AR coactivator. The interaction between AR and ARA24 decreases with the expansion of AR poly-Q, as well as the coactivation of cotransfected ARA24 to the SBMA AR. These results provide a potential mechanism for the partial androgen-insensitive syndrome in Kennedy's disease.It is well documented that a continual cycling of binding and hydrolyzing GTP from ARA24 is required in multiple cellular processes (reviewed in Ref. 8Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Yeast mutations prp20 andrna1, which are homologues of mammalian Ran-guanine nucleotide exchange factor and Ran-GTPase-activating protein, respectively, have been shown to exhibit the phenotype of reduced accuracy in positioning the correct transcription initiation site (26Forrester W. Stutz F. Rosbash M. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1914-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are readily explained by either a change in chromatin structure or by certain defects in the transcription regulation. The ability to enhance AR transactivation by ARA24 may therefore provide a bridge for ARA24 to link to the transcriptional regulation.As shown in Fig. 1 B, AR forms complexes with ARA24 regardless of the bound guanine nucleotide, which seems different from what has been observed for a GTPase effector protein that exhibits selective binding to either a GTPase-GTP or a GTPase-GDP. Upon inactivation of RCC1, ARA24 was shown dispersed in the nucleus and cytosol, suggesting that GTP-bound ARA24 is the major form in the nucleus (27Ren M.G. Drivas P. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It seems that the AR-ARA24 interaction is not regulated by the guanine binding status of ARA24 in vitro. It is not clear whether the guanine binding status of ARA24 plays any role when mediating AR transactivation in cells.ARA24 is a very abundant cellular protein. It is estimated that HeLa cells contain about 107 ARA24 molecules per cell (7Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This high abundance does cause great difficulty when attempting to show its biochemical function by the addition of exogenous ARA24. This is probably the reason we need to use a relatively high dose of exogenous ARA24 to show its coactivator activity (Fig. 2 A). Nevertheless, the ratios of receptor to coactivator we used here (1:10 or 1:30) are close to the ratios of other steroid receptors to their coactivators. For example, full-length SRC-1 requires the addition ratio of 1:20 or 1:40 to see the coactivator effects (28Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cotransfection of ARA24as to decrease the cellular ARA24 protein level can also repress the AR transactivation. As shown in Fig.2 B, deleting the six amino acid residues of the acidic C terminus in ARA24 results in a dominant positive AR coactivator. A lower (500 ng) level of ARA24 C-del is enough to exert a coactivation effect to AR compared with 1500 ng of WT ARA24. Moreover, increasing ARA24 C-del to a higher dose (1500 ng) further enhances DHT-induced AR transactivation from 4-fold to 18-fold. As the C-terminal hexapeptide sequence of ARA24 is conserved across species, it is likely that a repressor-like factor may bind to the conserved hexapeptide sequence, and deletion of this hexapeptide may therefore allow ARA24 C-del to function more efficiently as a coactivator to enhance AR transactivation.The AR coactivator effects of ARA24 and ARA160 are not only enhancement of AR transactivation at the normal physiological concentration of DHT but also at the low DHT level (10−10–10−11m) that is found in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen ablation therapy. The increase of androgen sensitivity by the non-androgen factors could be one of the reasons why the patients' prostate-specific antigen level might increase again even though the patients' serum testosterone is low (10−10m). Our findings that either ARA24 or ARA160 can increase androgen sensitivity so that 10−10m DHT can still efficiently stimulate androgen target genes, including prostate-specific antigen, may provide one molecular mechanism to explain the failure of androgen ablation therapy.The polymorphic poly-Q stretch of AR has been specially recognized for being clinically associated with Kennedy's disease. Subsequentin vitro studies also show that the longer poly-Q stretch may result in weaker AR transactivation (21Yeh S. Lin H. Kang H.-Y. Lin M. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 96: 5458-5463Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 25Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recently, pathological statistics have further correlated the shorter poly-Q AR with higher prostate cancer risk and a higher chance of developing distant metastasis (24Stanford J.L. Just J.J. Gibbs M. Wicklund K.G. Neal C.L. Blumenstein B.A. Ostrander E.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar, 29Giovannucci E. Stampfer M.J. Krithivas K. Brown M. Dahl D. Brufsky A. Talcott J. Hennekens C.H. Kantoff P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Our results showed that ARA24 can interact differentially with different lengths of poly-Q within AR, and its ability to enhance AR transactivation also decreases with expansion of poly-Q length in AR. A very interesting question to pursue in the future might be whether expression of ARA24 or its ability to interact with the AR poly-Q region could become an indicator to predict prostate cancer risk.As ARA24 is also involved in nuclear transportation that can promote the nuclear localization of proteins, it is possible that the weaker interaction of ARA24 to longer poly-Q AR (SBMA AR) may result in aggregation of SBMA AR in cytoplasm, instead of translocation into the nucleus to function as a transcriptional activator. A detailed analysis of subcellular distribution of ARA24 and SBMA AR in Kennedy's disease cells should be able to answer such an interesting question.In summary, our results suggested that ARA24 is the first identified AR N-terminal associated coactivator that can interact differentially with AR bearing different poly-Q lengths. This finding may help us to further understand the potential roles of AR function in Kennedy's disease and progression of prostate cancer.

RCC1 has been shown to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor on Ran/ARA24 by increasing its rate ∼5 × 105 times. On the other hand, Ran GTPase-activating protein can also increase the GTPase activity ∼1 × 105 times (10Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A.

DISCUSSIONPrevious studies concerning the transactivation activity of AR with different poly-Q lengths have consistently shown their inverse relationship (21Yeh S. Lin H. Kang H.-Y. Lin M. Chang C.

Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that ARA24 interacts with the AR poly-Q region and functions as an AR coactivator. The interaction between AR and ARA24 decreases with the expansion of AR poly-Q, as well as the coactivation of cotransfected ARA24 to the SBMA AR. These results provide a potential mechanism for the partial androgen-insensitive syndrome in Kennedy's disease.It is well documented that a continual cycling of binding and hydrolyzing GTP from ARA24 is required in multiple cellular processes (reviewed in Ref. 8Rush M.G.

It is not clear whether the guanine binding status of ARA24 plays any role when mediating AR transactivation in cells.ARA24 is a very abundant cellular protein.

This high abundance does cause great difficulty when attempting to show its biochemical function by the addition of exogenous ARA24. This is probably the reason we need to use a relatively high dose of exogenous ARA24 to show its coactivator activity (Fig. 2 A). Nevertheless, the ratios of receptor to coactivator we used here (1:10 or 1:30) are close to the ratios of other steroid receptors to their coactivators. For example, full-length SRC-1 requires the addition ratio of 1:20 or 1:40 to see the coactivator effects (28Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

On the other hand, cotransfection of ARA24as to decrease the cellular ARA24 protein level can also repress the AR transactivation. As shown in Fig.2 B, deleting the six amino acid residues of the acidic C terminus in ARA24 results in a dominant positive AR coactivator. A lower (500 ng) level of ARA24 C-del is enough to exert a coactivation effect to AR compared with 1500 ng of WT ARA24. Moreover, increasing ARA24 C-del to a higher dose (1500 ng) further enhances DHT-induced AR transactivation from 4-fold to 18-fold. As the C-terminal hexapeptide sequence of ARA24 is conserved across species, it is likely that a repressor-like factor may bind to the conserved hexapeptide sequence, and deletion of this hexapeptide may therefore allow ARA24 C-del to function more efficiently as a coactivator to enhance AR transactivation.The AR coactivator effects of ARA24 and ARA160 are not only enhancement of AR transactivation at the normal physiological concentration of DHT but also at the low DHT level (10−10–10−11m) that is found in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen ablation therapy. The increase of androgen sensitivity by the non-androgen factors could be one of the reasons why the patients' prostate-specific antigen level might increase again even though the patients' serum testosterone is low (10−10m). Our findings that either ARA24 or ARA160 can increase androgen sensitivity so that 10−10m DHT can still efficiently stimulate androgen target genes, including prostate-specific antigen, may provide one molecular mechanism to explain the failure of androgen ablation therapy.The polymorphic poly-Q stretch of AR has been specially recognized for being clinically associated with Kennedy's disease. Subsequentin vitro studies also show that the longer poly-Q stretch may result in weaker AR transactivation (21Yeh S. Lin H. Kang H.-Y. Lin M. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 96: 5458-5463Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 25Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recently, pathological statistics have further correlated the shorter poly-Q AR with higher prostate cancer risk and a higher chance of developing distant metastasis (24Stanford J.L. Just J.J.

Our results showed that ARA24 can interact differentially with different lengths of poly-Q within AR, and its ability to enhance AR transactivation also decreases with expansion of poly-Q length in AR. A very interesting question to pursue in the future might be whether expression of ARA24 or its ability to interact with the AR poly-Q region could become an indicator to predict prostate cancer risk.As ARA24 is also involved in nuclear transportation that can promote the nuclear localization of proteins, it is possible that the weaker interaction of ARA24 to longer poly-Q AR (SBMA AR) may result in aggregation of SBMA AR in cytoplasm, instead of translocation into the nucleus to function as a transcriptional activator. A detailed analysis of subcellular distribution of ARA24 and SBMA AR in Kennedy's disease cells should be able to answer such an interesting question.In summary, our results suggested that ARA24 is the first identified AR N-terminal associated coactivator that can interact differentially with AR bearing different poly-Q lengths. This finding may help us to further understand the potential roles of AR function in Kennedy's disease and progression of prostate cancer. Previous studies concerning the transactivation activity of AR with different poly-Q lengths have consistently shown their inverse relationship (21Yeh S. Lin H. Kang H.-Y. Lin M. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 96: 5458-5463Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 25Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that ARA24 interacts with the AR poly-Q region and functions as an AR coactivator. The interaction between AR and ARA24 decreases with the expansion of AR poly-Q, as well as the coactivation of cotransfected ARA24 to the SBMA AR. These results provide a potential mechanism for the partial androgen-insensitive syndrome in Kennedy's disease. It is well documented that a continual cycling of binding and hydrolyzing GTP from ARA24 is required in multiple cellular processes (reviewed in Ref. 8Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Yeast mutations prp20 andrna1, which are homologues of mammalian Ran-guanine nucleotide exchange factor and Ran-GTPase-activating protein, respectively, have been shown to exhibit the phenotype of reduced accuracy in positioning the correct transcription initiation site (26Forrester W. Stutz F. Rosbash M. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1914-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are readily explained by either a change in chromatin structure or by certain defects in the transcription regulation. The ability to enhance AR transactivation by ARA24 may therefore provide a bridge for ARA24 to link to the transcriptional regulation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, AR forms complexes with ARA24 regardless of the bound guanine nucleotide, which seems different from what has been observed for a GTPase effector protein that exhibits selective binding to either a GTPase-GTP or a GTPase-GDP. Upon inactivation of RCC1, ARA24 was shown dispersed in the nucleus and cytosol, suggesting that GTP-bound ARA24 is the major form in the nucleus (27Ren M.G. Drivas P. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It seems that the AR-ARA24 interaction is not regulated by the guanine binding status of ARA24 in vitro. It is not clear whether the guanine binding status of ARA24 plays any role when mediating AR transactivation in cells. ARA24 is a very abundant cellular protein. It is estimated that HeLa cells contain about 107 ARA24 molecules per cell (7Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This high abundance does cause great difficulty when attempting to show its biochemical function by the addition of exogenous ARA24. This is probably the reason we need to use a relatively high dose of exogenous ARA24 to show its coactivator activity (Fig. 2 A). Nevertheless, the ratios of receptor to coactivator we used here (1:10 or 1:30) are close to the ratios of other steroid receptors to their coactivators. For example, full-length SRC-1 requires the addition ratio of 1:20 or 1:40 to see the coactivator effects (28Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1983894368,"Whereas PNS neurons in culture are intrinsically responsive to peptide trophic factors, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are not unless they are depolarized, or their intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) are elevated. We show here that depolarization increases cAMP in cultured RGCs sufficiently to enhance their responsiveness and that the trophic responsiveness of developing RGCs in intact retinas depends on physiological levels of activity and cAMP elevation. Responsiveness is lost after axotomy but is restored by cAMP elevation. The death of axotomized RGCs can be prevented if they are simultaneously stimulated by several trophic factors together with cAMP elevation. Thus, the death of RGCs after axotomy is not caused solely by the loss of retrograde trophic stimuli but also by a profound loss of trophic responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1983211885,"The sequential binding of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) to a series of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins is critical to its function as a molecular chaperone. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to clarify the structural basis for the binding of hsp90 to the TPR domain of phosphoprotein phosphatase 5 (PP5). This TPR domain was chosen for study because its three-dimensional structure is known. We examined co-immunoprecipitation of hsp90 with wild type and mutant TPR constructs from transfected cells. Only mutations located on one face of the TPR domain affected hsp90 binding. This allowed the identification of a binding groove. Three basic residues that are highly conserved in hsp90-binding TPR proteins extend prominently into this groove. Lys-97 and Arg-101 were absolutely required for hsp90 binding, while mutation of Arg-74 diminished, but did not abrogate, hsp90 binding. Mutation of Lys-32, another conserved basic residue in the binding groove, also blocked hsp90 binding. The TPR domain of PP5 bound specifically to a 12-kDa C-terminal fragment of hsp90. This binding was reduced by mutation of acidic residues in the hsp90 fragment. These data suggest conservation, among hsp90-binding TPR proteins, of a binding groove containing basic residues that interact with acidic residues near the C terminus of hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W2087816557,"The role of intracellular Ca2+ pools in oscillations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) triggered by Ca2+ influx was investigated in mouse pancreatic B-cells. [Ca2+]c oscillations occurring spontaneously during glucose stimulation or repetitively induced by pulses of high K+ (in the presence of diazoxide) were characterized by a descending phase in two components. A rapid decrease in [Ca2+]c coincided with closure of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and was followed by a slower phase independent of Ca2+ influx. Blocking the SERCA pump with thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid accelerated the rising phase of [Ca2+]coscillations and increased their amplitude, which suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) rapidly takes up Ca2+. It also suppressed the slow [Ca2+]c recovery phase, which indicates that this phase corresponds to the slow release of Ca2+ that was taken up by the ER during the upstroke of the [Ca2+]c transient. Glucose promoted the buffering capacity of the ER and amplified the slow [Ca2+]crecovery phase. The slow phase induced by high K+ pulses was not affected by modulators of Ca2+- or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release, did not involve a depolarization-induced Ca2+ release, and was also observed at the end of a rapid rise in [Ca2+]c triggered from caged Ca2+.

The observation that thapsigargin depolarizes the membrane of B-cells supports the proposal that the degree of Ca2+ filling of the ER modulates the membrane potential.

Therefore, [Ca2+]ER oscillations occurring during glucose stimulation are likely to influence the bursting behavior of B-cells and eventually [Ca2+]c oscillations. The physiological response to a stimulus is often transduced by oscillations of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). In electrically nonexcitable cells, [Ca2+]c oscillations are mainly driven by antiparallel changes of the Ca2+ concentration within intracellular Ca2+ stores. In electrically excitable cells, [Ca2+]c oscillations are generally produced by intermittent influx of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. In some of these cells, such as muscle cells and neurons, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores can also contribute to the changes in [Ca2+]c (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. Lond. 1997; 499: 290-306Crossref Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The insulin-secreting pancreatic B-cell is electrically excitable. Its main physiological stimulus, glucose, triggers insulin secretion by increasing [Ca2+]c through the following steps. Acceleration of glucose metabolism increases the ATP/ADP ratio, which closes ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATPchannels) in the plasma membrane (3Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). This closure decreases the K+ conductance, which allows a yet unknown current to depolarize the plasma membrane, leading to opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, stimulation of Ca2+ influx, and eventually a rise in [Ca2+]c. In the presence of 10–15 mmglucose, B-cells display [Ca2+]c oscillations that result mainly from intermittent Ca2+ influx (4Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol.

However, these techniques suffer from drawbacks such as difficult transfection procedures of photoproteins, very low light emission and Ca2+-induced degradation of aequorin, and contamination of the trapped fluorescence of low-affinity Ca2+ indicators by the cytosolic signal, which severely limit their use in intact primary cells. We, therefore, used the classical technique of Ca2+ measurement within the cytosol, which is not invasive and is applicable to single or electrically coupled B-cells. The results demonstrate that [Ca2+]c oscillations occurring spontaneously during stimulation by glucose, or artificially induced by pulses of high K+, are accompanied by cycles of rapid uptake and subsequent slow release of Ca2+ by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA pumps) are responsible for the sequestration process during the upstroke of the [Ca2+]c transient, whereas the subsequent phase of release does not involve depolarization-, Ca2+- or IP3-mediated processes and likely results from leakage from the ER. This suggests that the Ca2+ concentration within the endoplasmic reticulum ([Ca2+]ER) oscillates. As the filling state in Ca2+ of the ER may modulate the membrane potential of B-cells (16Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Mertz R.J. Roe M.W. Dukes I.D. J. Biol.

When the concentration of KCl was increased, that of NaCl was decreased accordingly to keep the osmolarity of the medium unchanged. Ca2+-free solutions were prepared by substituting MgCl2 for CaCl2and were supplemented with 0.5 or 2 mm EGTA as indicated in the legends to Figs. 2, 3, and 5.Figure 2Pulses of 45 mm K+induce [Ca2+]c oscillations with a slow recovery phase that is prevented by SERCA pump inhibition in pancreatic B-cells.

Therefore, KCl was not replaced with NaCl but with choline chloride to keep a similar Na+concentration in all solutions. The low K+ solution contained: 79.8 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 40.2 mm choline chloride, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 24 mmNaHCO3, and 0.01 mm atropine, which prevented activation of muscarinic receptors by choline. The solutions containing higher K+ concentrations were prepared by substituting KCl for choline chloride. All solutions were gassed with O2/CO2 (94:6) to maintain a pH of 7.4 at 37 °C. Except for electrophysiological recordings, they were supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Thapsigargin was obtained from Sigma or from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). Ryanodine was from RBI (Natick, MA) or from Alomone Laboratories, diazoxide was from Schering-Plough Avondale (Rathdrum, Ireland), caffeine was from Merck A.G. (Darmstadt Germany), and ruthenium red was from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. All experiments were performed with tissue from fed female NMRI mice (25–30 g). Pancreatic islets were isolated aseptically after collagenase digestion of the pancreas, and when needed, they were dispersed into cells as described previously (17Miura Y. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. J. Physiol. Lond. 1997; 503: 387-398Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to attach to 22-mm circular coverslips and cultured for 2–3 days. Intact islets were maintained in culture for 1–3 days. When the membrane potential of B-cells was to be measured with an intracellular microelectrode, the islets were allowed to attach to the coverslip by a culture period of at least 2 days. The culture medium was RMPI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultured islets were loaded with 2 μm fura-PE3/AM (Teflabs, Austin, TX) for 90–120 min at 37 °C in a bicarbonate-buffered solution containing 10 mm glucose. Cultured cells were loaded with 1 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min in a similar bicarbonate-buffered medium. The tissue was then transferred into a temperature-controlled (37 °C) perifusion chamber of ∼1 ml (Intracell, Royston, Herts, United Kingdom) with a bottom made of a glass coverslip and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. The flow rate of the perifusion was approximately 2 ml/min. When rapid exchange of solutions was required, a ∼250-μl chamber was used and solutions were changed by Iso-Latch valves (Parker Hannifin, Fairfield, NY). [Ca2+]i was directly measured in cells attached to the coverslip or in islets held in place close to the coverslip by gentle suction with a glass micropipette. In some experiments, cultured cells were pressure-injected with an 5242 Eppendorf microinjector (Hamburg, Germany). The injected solution contained either 6–10 mm fura-2 K+ salt or 10 mmfura-dextran K+ salt (molecular weight, 3000) (Molecular Probes) dissolved in H2O, and it was supplemented or not with test substances. The techniques used to monitor [Ca2+]c have been described previously (4Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clusters of B-cells were incubated with 5 μmnitrophenyl-EGTA AM and 1.5 μm fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) for 60 min at 37 °C. Photolysis of nitrophenyl-EGTA was performed by two or three consecutive 1-ms UV flashes of 240 J (Xenon flashlamp system XF-10, Hi-Tech, Hamburg, Germany). The islets were mounted in a perifusion chamber (7 ml/min at 37 °C) following attachment to glass coverslips. The membrane potential of a single cell within the islet was continuously measured with a high resistance microelectrode. Voltage-clamp experiments were performed on single B-cells using the perforated patch-whole cell configuration and an EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier (List Elektronik, Darmstadt, Germany). The holding potential was −70 mV, and the cells were submitted either to 100-ms depolarizations to 0 mV or to bursts of 100-ms depolarizations (2 Hz) from −50 mV to −10 mV for 12 s. The associated changes in [Ca2+]i were measured using an IonOptix fluorescence imaging system (IonOptix, Inc., Milton, MA). The extracellular solution contained 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 mm glucose. The pipette solution contained 76 mm Cs2SO4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.35 with CsOH). Electrical contact with the cell interior was established by adding 0.24 mg/ml amphotericin B to the pipette solution, and the voltage-clamp was considered satisfactory when the series conductance (Gseries) was >35–40 nano Siemens. All experiments were performed at 33 °C, and the zero-current potential of the pipette was adjusted with the pipette in the bath solution. The experiments are illustrated by recordings that are averaged or representative traces of results obtained with the indicated number of cells or islets from at least three different cultures. The statistical significance of differences between means was assessed by unpaired Student's t test. B-cells within intact islets display a rhythmic electrical activity when perifused with a medium containing an insulin-releasing glucose concentration (10 mm) and 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig.1 A). These bursts of electrical activity consist of sharp depolarizing waves of the membrane potential with superimposed spikes reflecting Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (18Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. Experientia. 1984; 40: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, [Ca2+]c also oscillates, but, in contrast to the fast, monophasic repolarization of the oscillations of membrane potential, the descending phase of each Ca2+ oscillation clearly displays two components (Fig.1 B). Whereas the initial fast one appears to coincide with the closure of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels following rapid repolarization of the plasma membrane, the second, much slower phase appears to occur during the repolarized intervals. Previous experiments have shown that intracellular Ca2+stores of whole islets are efficiently emptied by thapsigargin (TG), a specific inhibitor of the SERCA pump (19Inesi G. Sagara Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but that this emptying requires preincubation of the islets with the drug (17Miura Y. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. J. Physiol. Lond. 1997; 503: 387-398Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In islets pretreated with 1 μm TG, the amplitude of [Ca2+]c oscillations was much larger than in control islets, and the descending phase of each [Ca2+]c oscillation was surprisingly very fast with no slow second phase (Fig. 1 C). This suggests that the slow phase observed in control islets results from a release of Ca2+ from the ER, rather than from a slow Ca2+extrusion from the cytosol. The effect of intracellular Ca2+ store depletion on [Ca2+]c oscillations was also investigated in clusters of islet cells, a preparation in which the SERCA pump can be blocked by an acute addition of TG or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). CPA is an inhibitor structurally unrelated to TG (19Inesi G. Sagara Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and has also been shown to empty the ER of Ca2+ in pancreatic B-cells (20Miura Y. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the presence of 15 mm glucose and 2.5 mmCa2+, [Ca2+]c oscillated slowly and regularly (Fig. 1 D). Addition of 50 μm CPA to the medium accelerated the oscillations, which increased in amplitude and frequency and became sharper mainly because of the disappearance of the slow recovery phase. Similar results were obtained in clusters of islet cells treated by TG (not shown). In this series of experiments, glucose-induced [Ca2+]c oscillations were inhibited by diazoxide, which, by opening KATP channels, clamps the membrane potential at a hyperpolarized level. [Ca2+]c oscillations were then reinduced by rhythmically depolarizing the plasma membrane with high K+. Raising the K+ concentration of the perifusion medium from 4.8 to 45 mm rapidly depolarized the plasma membrane from −70 ± 2 mV to −22 ± 3 mV in control islets (n = 4; Fig. 2 A, dotted line). The amplitude of this depolarization was not affected by TG pretreatment of the islets (−71 ± 3 to −22 ± 3 mV, n = 4). The time required to clamp the plasma membrane at a new, stable potential was also similar in both groups, as follows. Controls: 31 ± 2 s from 4.8 to 45 mmK+ (t 12 = 4 ± 0 s) and 34 ± 1 s from 45 to 4.8 mm K+(t 12 = 5.7 ± 0.5 s), n = 4; TG-treated islets: 31 ± 1 s from 4.8 to 45 mmK+ (t 12 = 4.5 ± 0.3 s) and 34 ± 1 s from 45 to 4.8 mm K+(t 12 = 5.7 ± 0.5 s),n = 4. In control islets, high K+ pulses (for 30 s) induced [Ca2+]c oscillations characterized by a descending phase that displayed an initial fast component concomitant with rapid repolarization of the plasma membrane, followed by a slow decline (Fig. 2 A, solid line). In TG-pretreated islets, [Ca2+]c oscillations were higher than in control islets (467 ± 21 versus 352 ± 11 nm,n = 10, p < 0.01) and devoid of a slow recovery phase. Similar results were obtained after pretreatment of the islets with 50 μm CPA. The effects of TG on voltage-dependent Ca2+current were evaluated in single B-cells using the perforated patch configuration. Under control conditions, a 100-ms voltage-step from −70 to 0 mV elicited a peak Ca2+ current of 52 ± 6 pA (n = 8) that was not significantly affected by a 5-min exposure to 1 μm TG (48 ± 3 pA). The integrated whole-cell Ca2+ current was similarly unaffected by TG (data not shown). This excludes the possibility that the larger rise in [Ca2+]c induced by high K+ in TG-treated islets results from an increased Ca2+current. We also verified that the slow [Ca2+]c recovery is not a peculiarity observed only in a medium containing 10 mm Ca2+. To this end, 30-s pulses of 45 mm K+ were applied in the presence of various concentrations of external Ca2+ (0.5–10 mm) (Fig. 2 B). The amplitude of the resulting [Ca2+]c peaks clearly depended on the Ca2+ concentration of the medium, but a slow decaying phase, prevented by TG pretreatment, was observed at all external Ca2+ concentrations tested. The observation that TG suppresses the slow recovery after [Ca2+]coscillations of various amplitude also excludes the possibility that TG might increase the rate of Ca2+ extrusion from the cytosol due to a high Ca2+ signal. The slow [Ca2+]c recovery phase could be artifactual and reflect changes in the Ca2+ concentration within the ER if fura-PE3 is compartmentalized. To exclude this possibility, single B-cells were microinjected with fura-dextran, a Ca2+ probe that is exclusively localized in the cytosol (21Schlatterer C. Knoll G. Malchow D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar). High K+ pulses induced [Ca2+]coscillations with a slow recovery phase (Fig. 2 C). Addition of TG to the medium induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]c reflecting intracellular Ca2+pool emptying. Subsequent depolarization by pulses of high K+ triggered [Ca2+]c oscillations that were of much larger amplitude than before addition of the SERCA pump inhibitor and that lacked a slow [Ca2+]crecovery phase. These observations strongly support the conclusion that the slow decaying [Ca2+]c phase results from release of Ca2+ from the ER. Application of high K+ pulses every 5 min triggered a train of [Ca2+]coscillations with a slow decaying phase, which indicates that the phenomenon is not a transient one (Fig.3 A). The experiments depicted in Fig. 3 B were designed to explore the temporal requirements for refilling the intracellular Ca2+ stores responsible for the slow decay in [Ca2+]c. The islets were repetitively depolarized by 30-s pulses of high K+. Extracellular Ca2+ (10 mm) was present before and during the depolarization (first and last pulses) or only during the depolarization (second to seventh pulses). The slow recovery phase was present and not attenuated by Ca2+omission during the repolarization phases (compare Fig. 3, Aand B). This shows first that it does not result from Ca2+ influx, and second that Ca2+ entry during depolarization is sufficient to refill the pools from which Ca2+ is slowly released. However, no slow recovery phase was observed when high K+pulses were applied in the continuous presence of acetylcholine (ACh), a potent IP3-producing agent in pancreatic B-cells (Fig.3 C). This is likely due to the fact that Ca2+cannot accumulate into the ER because it immediately exits from the ER into the cytosol through IP3 receptors that are maintained opened by the continuous presence of ACh. The ability of the ER to take up Ca2+ rapidly was next tested (Fig. 3 D). Islets perifused with a Ca2+-free medium were submitted to three pulses of 100 μm ACh applied at 12.5-min intervals. A 30-s pulse of high K+/high Ca2+ was applied between the second and the third pulses of ACh. Whereas the first application of ACh triggered a large [Ca2+]c peak, the second one induced only a small rise in [Ca2+]csuggesting that intracellular Ca2+ stores were nearly completely emptied already by the first application of ACh. However, the third application of ACh in a Ca2+-free medium after the short pulse with high K+/high Ca2+ induced a transient rise in [Ca2+]c that was much larger than that seen after the second application of ACh. This indicates further that intracellular Ca2+ pools rapidly refill during the large [Ca2+]c rises triggered by high K+ pulses. If the slow recovery phase reflects release of Ca2+ from the ER, its characteristics should depend on the filling state of the ER. This was tested by emptying the ER with ACh between two series of 3 pulses of high K+/high Ca2+ of 20 s duration (Fig. 3 E). The first three [Ca2+]c oscillations were all characterized by a slow recovery phase. In contrast, the first two oscillations following intracellular Ca2+ pool depletion by ACh were of lower amplitude and displayed a much smaller slow recovery phase than before ACh application. Because the pulses were of constant duration, the lower amplitude of [Ca2+]c oscillations post-ACh is unlikely to result from a decreased Ca2+ influx. It may rather be explained by a more avid sequestration of Ca2+into an emptied than into a filled ER. Because the first high K+/high Ca2 pulse did not carry enough Ca2+ to fully refill the ER, no slow recovery phase could be seen, and three pulses were needed to refill the ER enough to see a slow recovery phase of an amplitude similar to that observed at the end of the first series of [Ca2+]c oscillations. These data demonstrate that the buffering capacity of the ER permits a rapid control of [Ca2+]c and that its ability to release Ca2+ is affected by its filling state. Comparison of the [Ca2+]c changes induced by a pulse of high K+ in control and TG-treated islets permits estimation of the kinetics of Ca2+ uptake and release from the ER (Fig. 4 A). After normalization of resting [Ca2+]c before each [Ca2+]c oscillation the averaged [Ca2+]c oscillation of TG-treated islets was subtracted from the averaged [Ca2+]c oscillation of control islets (Fig. 4 B). The downward deflection of the curve reflects Ca2+ uptake by the ER, whereas the upward deflection reflects release from the ER. This shows that the uptake is very fast, whereas the release is comparably slow and lasts several minutes. The role of the ER during the whole [Ca2+]coscillation is best demonstrated by the comparison of the rates of [Ca2+]c changes as a function of [Ca2+]c in control and TG-treated islets (Fig.4 C). It clearly shows that the ER strongly buffers the rate of [Ca2+]c changes during the whole [Ca2+]c oscillation, thereby preventing any abrupt large change in [Ca2+]c. The above results suggest that the amount of Ca2+ that is taken up by the ER is directly proportional to [Ca2+]c. This was indirectly verified by measuring the amplitude of the [Ca2+]c peak that occurred upon addition of TG to clusters of cells in which [Ca2+]c was clamped artificially at different levels with various concentrations of K+ (4.8–45 mm). The amplitude of the [Ca2+]cpeak directly depended on the steady-state level of [Ca2+]c before TG addition (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that the Ca2+ loading of the ER is directly proportional to the level of [Ca2+]c. This did not result from a K+ effect, as the amplitude of the rise in [Ca2+]c was similar in clusters perifused with a Ca2+-free medium containing 4.8 or 45 mmK+. The large rise in [Ca2+]cproduced by TG in"

A potential physiological role in hemostasis and platelet aggregation is presented. CD39 was originally identified as a lymphoid activation marker (1Rowe M. Hildreth J.E.K. Rickenson A.B.

Immunol. 1988; 140: 4071-4078PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning revealed that the sequence encoded four regions (termed apyrase conserved regions or ACRs) with significant homologies to apyrases. Human apyrases are enzymes that hydrolyze adenosine tri- and diphosphates as substrates (3Bock P. Cell Tissue Res. 1980; 206: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic domains anchor CD39 to the surface of lymphocytes and endothelial cells, positioning their enzymatic domains outside of the cell. The ecto-enzymatic activity of CD39 has been proposed to regulate a variety of physiological states including cardiac function, hormone secretion, immune responses, neurotransmission, and platelet aggregation (4Chadwick B.P.

CD39 has been proposed to play a role in platelet aggregation because of its ATP diphosphohydrolase activity, which could modulate levels of circulating ADP in the microenvironment of the vascular endothelium (6Marcus A.J. Broekman M.J. Drosopoulos J.H. Islam N. Alyonycheva T.N. Safier L.B. Hajjar K.A. Posnett D.N. Schoenborn M.A. Schooley K.A. Gayle R.B. Maliszewski C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1351-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Platelets adhere to sites of vascular injury, are activated, and release ADP, serotonin, thromboxane A2, and other signaling molecules. As a result, ADP from the releasate promotes activation, recruitment, and aggregation of platelets in the injury microenvironment (8Marcus A.J. Ratnoff O.D. Forbes C.D. Platelets and their Disorders: Disorders of Hemostasis. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1996: 79-137Google Scholar). Interactions between activated platelet surfaces and coagulation proteins result in thrombin generation, further platelet activation, and formation of an insoluble fibrin plug. Therefore, enzymes able to modulate the levels of ADP at such sites could represent key mediators of hemostasis and clot formation. We show that CD39-L4 is not only naturally secreted from mammalian cells and soluble once secreted but that it has a specificity for NDPs over NTPs as substrates. Specifically, the hydrolysis of ADP potentially classes CD39-L4 as a mediator of hemostasis. Expression of CD39-L4 message in macrophages indicates that the protein might be present in blood and have a role in modulating levels of circulating ADP. We propose that platelet activation and aggregation can be attenuated through CD39-L4 expression at sites of vascular injury through the hydrolysis of ADP.

The sense primer (5′-TTAAAGCTTGGGAAAA GAATGGCCACTTC-3′) with aHindIII site and the antisense primer (5′-AGACTCGAG GTGGCCTCAATGGGAGATGCC-3′) with a XhoI site were used to subclone the coding sequences into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence of the insert was found to be identical to that reported for the CD39-L4 cDNA (4Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The coding region was further modified so that it would include a Gly-Ser-His6 epitope tag immediately following Arg24. Briefly, two partially overlapping complementary oligonucleotides (5′-GCGCTGTCTCCCACAGAGGATCGCATCACCATCACCATCACAACCAGCAGACTTGGTT-3′ and 5′-AACCAAGTCTGCTGGTTGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCTGTGGGAGACAGCGC-3′) were used on the CD39-L4 pcDNA3.1 template. The primers were extended in opposite directions around the plasmid using a 12-cycle PCR program (95 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 15 min) (Stratagene). The reaction was treated with DpnI to digest the methylated parental DNA and then transformed into Escherichia coli. Colonies were screened for the insert. COS-7 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Transfections were performed at 75% confluency in 10-cm plates with Fugene-6 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In summary, the cells in 7 ml of medium were incubated with 16 μl of Fugene-6 and 8 μg of DNA for 14–18 h. At the end of the transfection, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing low serum (1% FBS). The cells were then incubated for 24–48 h prior to harvesting. For studies utilizing brefeldin A-treated cells, brefeldin A was dissolved in ethanol and added to the transfected cells 48 h after transfection. Both, control and brefeldin A-treated cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 8 h in medium with none or with varying dosages of brefeldin A. The protein was harvested in some experiments from both cells and medium. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then scraped from plates. Upon centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin. After a brief sonication and centrifugation step to clear the lysate, the samples were then incubated with a Ni-NTA resin at 4 °C for 2–3 h. The histidine-tagged protein complexed to the resin was washed three times with PBS before loading onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for Western blot analysis. The media was centrifuged initially to clear any cell debris, adjusted to pH 8.0 with 20 mm Tris, and incubated at 4 °C for 2–3 h with 100 μl of Ni-NTA resin/10 ml of medium. The Ni-NTA resin was washed three times with assay buffer A (15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 134 mm NaCl, and 5 mm glucose) and resuspended in a 30% suspension in the same buffer. In some experiments, the assay buffer included one or more of the following reagents: 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmCaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2. Nucleotidase activity was determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released from nucleotide substrates using the technique of Daly and Ertingshausen (9Daly J.A. Ertingshausen G. Clin. Chem. 1972; 18: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the complex of inorganic phosphorus with phosphor reagent (ammonium molybdate in the presence of sulfuric acid) produces an unreduced phosphomolybdate compound. The absorbance of this complex at 340 nm is directly proportional to the inorganic phosphorus concentration. The protein still tethered to the resin as a 30% suspension in buffer A was assayed by the addition of the nucleotide to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 volumes of phosphor reagent. The amount of phosphate released from the reaction was quantitated using a calcium/phosphorus combined standard (Sigma). We estimated the amount of CD39-L4 protein used in our assays by comparing the intensity of the CD39-L4 band in Western blots with that of a series of standards of known quantity. Both the CD39-L4-His6 and the standards have the Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 epitope, which is recognized specifically by the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6. The activity was expressed in nmol of phosphate released per mg of CD39-L4 protein per hour. The protein samples were treated with 4-fold loading buffer (250 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue dye) and boiled for 5 min prior to loading onto a 10% Ready-gel (Bio-Rad). The gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using a Trans-blot semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.0375% SDS, and 20% methanol). After blocking, the blot was incubated with a 1:1200 dilution of the anti-Arg-Gly-Ser-His monoclonal antibody at room temperature for 2–3 h. The secondary antibody (anti-mouse Ig HRP conjugate) was diluted 1:1200 and incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected by ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the emitted light was recorded by x-ray film. The expression of CD39-L4 in various tissues was analyzed using a semi-quantitative PCR. Human cDNA libraries were used as sources of expressed genes from tissues of interest (adult brain, adult heart, adult kidney, adult lymph node, adult liver, adult lung, adult ovary, placenta, adult spleen, adult testis, bone marrow, fetal kidney, fetal liver, fetal liver/spleen, fetal skin, fetal brain, leukocyte, and macrophage. The cDNA libraries were diluted to 20 ng/μl, 2 ng/μl, and 0.2 ng/μl. Gene-specific primers (5′-GCTACCTCACTTCCTTTGAG-3′ and 5′-GCAGGTCTCCAAGGAAGTACG-3′) were used to amplify a 646-nucleotide portion of the CD39-L4 sequence. The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 96 °C for 1:30 min followed by 2 cycles of 96 °C for 45s, 60 °C for 45s, and 72 °C for 1:30 min, followed by 29 cycles of 94 °C for 30s, 60 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 1:30 min with a final incubation at 72 °C for 6:00 min. Amplified products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. The deduced amino acid sequence of CD39-L4 encodes a potential amino-terminal leader sequence (4Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M.

To immunologically detect the protein, we inserted a Gly-Ser-His6 epitope immediately after Arg24. To ascertain whether CD39-L4-His6 is secreted, the coding region of the CD39-L4-His6 protein was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. After a 24-h incubation in 10% serum-containing medium, the cell monolayers were shifted to 1% serum-containing media for 24 h. The CD39-L4-His6 protein was concentrated by treating the cell lysates and medium with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with an antibody against the Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 epitope (Fig.1 A). CD39-L4 was detected in both the cell lysate and the medium from cells transfected with the CD39-L4-His6 expression vector, but not from control cells. Although the predicted molecular mass of CD39-L4-His6 is 46 kDa, the immunoreactive protein exhibited a mobility by SDS-PAGE corresponding to a molecular mass of around 51 kDa in the media and around 48 kDa in the cell lysate. This difference may be because of posttranslational modifications in the protein. There are three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-(Ser)(Thr)) in the CD39-L4 predicted amino acid sequence (4Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Secretion of CD39-L4 was also examined by treatment of the transfected cells with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of translocation of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (11Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing dosages of brefeldin A blocked secretion of CD39-L4-His6 and led to massive intracellular accumulation (Fig. 1 B). Together, these results show that CD39-L4 has the characteristics of a secretory protein. Tissue-specific expression of CD39-L4 message was assayed using a PCR-based approach to test for the presence or absence of a product from a series of commercially available cDNA libraries (see “Materials and Methods”). Interestingly, we only detected the band in a macrophage library at the highest concentration of cDNA used (20 ng) (data not shown), suggesting that the protein while present in the circulation may be found at low levels. The high degree of conservation in the apyrase-conserved regions of CD39-L4 suggests similar function to other apyrases. To test this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were transfected with the CD39-L4-His6construct. The medium from transfected cells was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) to capture the His6-tagged protein, the resin was washed with assay buffer, and the protein still tethered to the resin in a suspension was assayed for ADPase activity. CD39-L4 protein from transfected cells displayed a 2.3-fold increase in activity over the cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig.2). When Ca2+ and Mg2+ were added, the activity increased 3.6- and 6-fold, respectively. CD39-L4 protein was assayed for ADPase activity in the presence of different kinds of inhibitors of ATPases. Table I shows that the inhibitors of vacuolar ATPases (N-ethylmaleimide), mitochondrial ATPases (N3−), and Na+,K+-ATPase (oubain) did not significantly inhibit the Ca2+,Mg2+-stimulated activity. Inhibitors of phosphatases (F−) and adenylate kinase (Ap5A) did not inhibit activity. However, metal chelators (EGTA and EDTA) significantly inhibited activity. These results show that the overwhelming majority of the activity in the assays originates from a protein bound to the resin with characteristics of an E-type apyrase (14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J.T. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III, R.B. J.

The assay was started by adding ADP to 1 mm followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. Each inhibitor was assayed in triplicate. The nucleotide specificity of the CD39-L4 protein is shown in TableII. The relative activity of the nucleotide triphosphates varies almost 7-fold, with ATP being the poorest substrate. No released phosphate was detected with AMP. ADP was hydrolyzed at a rate approximately 20-fold higher than that of ATP. Interestingly, the other NDPs were also very efficiently hydrolyzed by CD39-L4. Taken together, these results indicate that CD39-L4 defines a new class of E-type apyrases (12Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 1771-1774Google Scholar) in humans with a specificity for NDPs as enzymatic substrates.Table IISubstrate specificity of CD39-L4Nucleotide% ControlADP100 ± 15ATP5 ± 1AMP0CTP26 ± 2GTP34 ± 1UTP12 ± 4CDP268 ± 11GDP334 ± 38UDP408 ± 14CD39-L4 activity was determined with protein tethered to the Ni-NTA resin as described under “Materials and Methods.” The protein was in buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmCaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2.

Circulating nucleotides are known to be important signaling molecules, potentiating a variety of physiological responses (13Brake A.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, membrane-bound and circulating ecto-enzymes that reduce excess levels of these molecules have important roles in maintaining normal physiology and health. The first human gene reported encoding a protein with ecto-ATP diphosphohydrolase activity was CD39 (14Maliszewski C.R. Delespesse G.J.T. Schoenborn M.A. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Nakajima T. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Poindexter K. Birks C. Alpert A. Friend D. Gimpel S.D. Gayle III, R.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3574-3583PubMed Google Scholar). Expressed on the vascular epithelium, this molecule has been proposed to regulate hemostasis by modulating levels of ADP proximal to the walls of the vasculature (6Marcus A.J. Broekman M.J. Drosopoulos J.H. Islam N. Alyonycheva T.N. Safier L.B. Hajjar K.A. Posnett D.N. Schoenborn M.A. Schooley K.A. Gayle R.B. Maliszewski C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1351-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, because CD39 is membrane-bound, it is difficult to estimate the effects it has on total circulating ADP levels in the blood under normal physiological conditions. CD39 also hydrolyzes ATP as a substrate (15Wang T.-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Vizi E.S. Liang S.D. Sperlagh B. Kittel A. Juranyi Z. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which is not a signal for platelet aggregation. We have demonstrated that CD39-L4 is secreted from mammalian cells through two lines of evidence. First, crude cell fractionation studies found the protein accumulating in the media (Fig. 1 A). Second, we used brefeldin A, a chemical that blocks Golgi functions by inducing a resorption of the Golgi apparatus into the endoplasmic reticulum, and fusion of the trans-Golgi network with the endosomal system (20Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar) to show that the protein is secreted through the traditional mammalian secretory pathway (Fig. 1 B). These two experiments strongly suggest that the amino-terminus hydrophobic domain of CD39-L4 encodes a signal peptide sequence. We also observed that the intracellular pool of CD39-L4 protein has a smaller molecular mass, maybe as a result of underglycosylation. Our expression data showed a very restricted pattern of expression to a macrophage library, suggesting that the protein is present in blood. CD39-L4 clearly hydrolyzes ADP preferentially over ATP, indicating that one of its physiological roles is to reduce levels of circulating ADP and not ATP. We propose a model where macrophages at sites of vascular injury secrete CD39-L4, which degrades excess levels of ADP, attenuating platelet aggregation. In this model, decreased levels of CD39-L4 or its activity in the blood could lead to vascular occlusions, stroke, or other forms of cardiovascular disease. We are currently investigating the validity of this model with a number of different experimental approaches. The ability that CD39-L4 has to hydrolyze NDPs other than ADP has implications outside of the circulatory system. For instance, it has been reported that UDP is the most potent agonist for the human P2Y6 receptor (21Communi D. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This receptor is expressed in several tissues including infiltrating T cells present in inflammatory bowel disease (22Somers G.R. Hammet F.M.A. Trute L. Southey M.C. Venter D.J. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1375-1383PubMed Google Scholar). In this microenvironment, a molecule with the enzymatic properties of CD39-L4 could influence T cell responses by modifying the extracellular half-life of UDP. Another role for CD39-L4 has been suggested by the report that mouse cd39-l4 maps closely to a locus associated with audiogenic brain seizures in mice (4Chadwick B.P. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 1998; 50: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Seyfried T.N. Glaser G.H. Genetics. 1981; 99: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar). This locus known as Asp-1 is thought to be linked or to correspond to a factor that influences Ca2+-ATPase activity (18Neumann P.E. Seyfried T.N. Behav. Genet. 1990; 20: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Alice S. Ho and Dr. Haishan Lin for reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2137868041,"The commissural axons project toward and across the floor plate. They then turn into the longitudinal axis, extending along the contralateral side of the floor plate. F-spondin, a protein produced and secreted by the floor plate, promotes adhesion and neurite extension of commissural neurons in vitro. Injection of purified F-spondin protein into the lumen of the spinal cord of chicken embryos in ovo resulted in longitudinal turning of commissural axons before reaching the floor plate, whereas neutralizing antibody (Ab) injections caused lateral turning at the contralateral floor plate boundary. These combined in vitro and in vivo results suggest that F-spondin is required to prevent the lateral drifting of the commissural axons after having crossed the floor plate."

One factor contributing to the enormous success that insects have exhibited through evolutionary time is their ability to mount a rapid and effective response against invading pathogens. This response includes the rapid production of potent antimicrobial peptides effective against bacteria and fungi; transcriptional activity may be detected within minutes of a stimulus, resulting in 1–100 μm concentrations of specific peptides in the hemolymph within 24 h (1Hetru C. Hoffmann D. Bulet P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 40-66Google Scholar). Since the isolation of cecropin fromHyalophora cecropia by Boman and co-workers (2Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engström A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), approximately 170 immune peptides have been characterized from insects and other invertebrates (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Hetru C. Hoffmann D. Bulet P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 40-66Google Scholar). In insects, these molecules are rapidly synthesized, easily stored, and promptly available after infections. These features, together with the low metabolic cost for the insect and a low specificity (see review in Ref.3Shai Y. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 111-134Google Scholar), make antimicrobial peptides a very versatile component of the insect immune response. In mosquitoes, which serve as obligate vectors for serious debilitating human diseases such as malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and numerous arboviruses, the predominant immune peptide is a member of the insect defensin family (4Lowenberger C.

Antiyeast activity was assessed in yeast complete medium (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose (w/v)), following the same procedure used for antibacterial assays. The control antibiotic peptides MSI-94 and PGLa (linear amphipathic frog antibiotics) were gifts from M. A. Zasloff (Magainin Scientific Institute, Philadelphia, PA). With regard to our previous study on Aedesdefensins (4Lowenberger C. Bulet P. Charlet M. Hetru C. Hodgeman B. Christensen B.M. Hoffmann J.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we focused the present analysis on the fraction, eluted with 40% acetonitrile, that contained the bulk of antibacterial activity. This fraction was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC analysis (Fig. 1, Step 1). A marked antibacterial activity against M. luteus and E. coli was observed in eight consecutive fractions eluted from 25 to 30% acetonitrile. Each individual active fraction (Fig. 1, Step 1, shaded area) was further subjected to a second reversed-phase chromatography. The collected fractions were tested against M. luteus and E. coli, as before. The results obtained are only reported for the three most representative fractions (Fig. 1,A-C). After the antibacterial assays, three individual active peaks were purified from fractions A, B, and C. Two peaks (Fig.1, Step 2, peaks 1 and 2 in dark gray) eluted at 26 and 28% acetonitrile, respectively, were active againstM. luteus and E. coli at high concentrations. At a lower concentration (in regards to the absorbance at 225 nm), an activity was detected only against M. luteus. In contrast, peak 3 (Fig. 1, Step 2, hatched peak) was active only against E. coli. Mass measurements of fractions 1 and 2 by MALDI-TOF MS indicated the presence of compounds with mass values similar to those of the A. aegypti defensins A, B, and C (4Lowenberger C. Bulet P. Charlet M. Hetru C. Hodgeman B. Christensen B.M. Hoffmann J.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Partial N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation confirmed that peak 1 was Aedes defensin C (4155.7 Da) and that peak 2 contains the isoforms A and B, as judged by an additional capillary zone electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). To obtain structural information on the compound present in peak 3, this peak was further purified to homogeneity by an additional chromatography step using the same reversed-phase column as in step 2 (data not shown). After the antibacterial assay against E. coli, only a single active fraction was found. The purity was ascertained by capillary zone electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS. Only a single mass signal at 3391.5 Da was recorded, confirming the purity of the molecule. The peptide then was subjected to Edman degradation and the following 32-amino acid sequence was obtained: GGLKKLGKKLEGAGKRVfnAAEKALPVVAGAK. The calculated molecular mass for this 32-residue peptide (3206.8 Da) was lower than the measured molecular mass (3391.5 Da) by approximately 186 Da, indicating that the obtained sequence was not complete. We used the cDNA sequence obtained (see below and Fig.2) to determine what residues were missing. By Edman degradation, we determined that the N-terminal residue of the mature peptide was a glycine. This residue was found at position 24 in the deduced cDNA sequence. Molecular mass measurement of the mature peptide (3391.5 Da) established that it would end at the leucine residue at position 57 in the deduced cDNA sequence. The calculated average molecular mass of the predicted sequence (3391.1 Da) was in perfect agreement with the measured molecular mass by MALDI-TOF-MS at 3391.5 Da. Thus, the active compound of peak 3 (Fig. 1, Step 2) corresponded to a 34-amino acid peptide with the residues Ala-Leu following the 32-amino acid sequence obtained by Edman degradation (Fig. 2). A search in the SWISS-PROT protein data base showed high homology with cecropins, antibacterial peptides from Lepidoptera and Diptera. We designated the new isolated peptide as A. aegypti cecropin A. The A. aegypti cecropin cDNA contains a deduced open reading frame of 177 nucleotides. The consensus sequence begins with an ATG codon and encodes a protein of 59 residues containing a deduced sequence identical to the 32 amino acid sequence previously established by Edman degradation. The coding region contains a stop codon, a 3′ untranslated region of 38 nucleotides, the putative polyadenylation consensus signal (AATAAA), and 13 additional nucleotides before the poly(A) tail (Fig. 2). The deduced protein sequence contains a putative signal peptide comprising the first 23 residues and the mature cecropin (34 residues), followed by a dipeptide (Arg-Lys). The signal peptide region is highly hydrophobic and is predicted to terminate with an alanine residue (Ala23). This prediction is based on the fact that the mature cecropin peptide found in the hemolymph of immune-challenged mosquitoes started with, and did not contain any of the residues preceding, Gly24. By Northern analysis, we did not detect cecropin mRNA in any immature stage of A. aegypti, nor in naı̈ve adults (Fig.3 A). Expression was found in immune-activated adults: transcription was detected 6 h postinoculation and continued for 7–10 days. Similarly, by RT-PCR we could not detect cecropin in cDNAs isolated from larvae, pupae, or naı̈ve adults of A. aegypti (Fig. 3 B). However, a strong signal for cecropin was detected in immune-activated mosquitoes. After synthesis, HPLC purification, and mass spectrometry measurement to confirm the authenticity of the molecule, 9.3 mg of pure cecropin were obtained (approximate yield, 11.6%). The activity spectrum of A. aegypti cecropin A was compared with Drosophilacecropin A, which presents the typical features of cecropins (presence of a tryptophan residue and a C-terminal amidation). The activity spectra of these two peptides are presented in TableI, compared with two control antibiotics forming α-helices, PGLa and MSI-94. In the antibacterial assays,A. aegypti and Drosophila cecropins were more effective against Gram-negative strains than against Gram-positive bacteria. Among the 11 Gram-negative strains tested, only one bacteria (S. marcescens) was not affected by A. aegyptiand Drosophila cecropins at the highest concentration tested (100 μm). The insect cecropins were more active than the two control antibiotics against the Gram-negative bacteria (Table I), and the Drosophila cecropin was several times more effective than the A. aegypti cecropin. The measured difference factors were (i) 2-fold against E. coli D22 and D31,K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium; (ii) 10-fold against P. aeruginosa, and (iii) 100-fold against E. cloacae. Gram-positive bacteria were affected almost equally by the two cecropins. A. aegypti cecropin A was essentially inactive against three of the four Bacillus species tested (B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. subtilis), as well as against L. monocytogenes andS. aureus, up to a concentration of 100 μm. Against B. subtilis and S. pyogenes, however, the results differed according to the cecropin used: the growth of B. subtilis was not affected by 100 μm of A. aegypti cecropin A but was sensitive to the Drosophilamolecule (MIC, 10–25 μm). In contrast, the growth ofS. pyogenes was not affected by Drosophilacecropin A but was inhibited by the A. aegypti peptide (MIC, 10–25 μm). The two cecropins were less active against Gram-positive bacteria than PGLa and MSI-94. A. aegypti andDrosophila cecropins were generally equally active against the fungi F. culmorum, F. oxysporum, and N. crassa (MIC, 1–2.5, 2.5–5, and 5–10 μm, respectively). A. fumigatus and B. bassiana, however, were insensitive to cecropins. In antiyeast assays, onlyA. aegypti cecropin showed a moderate activity againstC. albicans, C. neoformans (MIC, 25–50 μm), and S. cerevisiae (MIC, 50–100 μm).Table IActivity spectrum of Aedes and Drosophila cecropins compared with two control antibiotics (PGLa and MSI-94)MicroorganismMICAedescecropinDrosophila cecropinPGLaMSI-94μmGram-negative bacteriaE. coli D220.25–0.50.1–0.251–2.51–2.5E. coliD310.25–0.50.1–0.251–2.50.5–1E. coli SBS3630.1–0.250.1–0.251–2.51–2.5E. coli 11060.25–0.50.25–0.51–2.51–2.5Enterobacter cloacae b1250–1000.5–1ND5–10E. carotovora0.25–0.50.5–11–2.51–2.5K. pneumoniae1–2.50.5–110–202.5–5Pseudomonas aeruginosa10–251–2.520–401–2.5S. typhimurium1–2.50.5–110–201–2.5S. marcescensDb11NDNDNDNDX. campestris0.5–10.5–15–100.5–1Gram-positive bacteriaAerococcus viridans2.5–55–100.5–10.5–1Bacillus cereusNDND2.5–51–2.5B. megaterium1–2.51–2.50.5–10.5–1Bacillus subtilisND10–250.5–10.5–1Bacillus thuringiensisNDND5–101–2.5L. monocytogenesNDND1–2.51–2.5M. luteus10–255–100.5–10.5–1Staphylococcus aureusNDND1–2.51–2.5Streptococcus pyogenes10–25ND1–2.51–2.5FungiA. fumigatusNDND10–2020–40B. bassianaNDNDNDNDF. culmorum1–2.51–2.50.5–10.5–1F. oxysporum2.5–51–2.52.5–50.5–1N. crassa5–105–102.5–55–10YeastsC. albicans25–50ND1–2.50.5–1C. glabrataNDNDC. neoformans25–50NDSaccharomyces cerevisiae50–100NDNDNDThe MIC (28Casteels P.

The data presented here established that the cell-free hemolymph of bacteria-challenged adults of A. aegypti contains several antibacterial substances, among them the previously described A. aegypti defensins (4Lowenberger C. Bulet P. Charlet M. Hetru C. Hodgeman B. Christensen B.M. Hoffmann J.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Chalk R. Albuquerque C.M.R. Ham P.J. Townson H. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1995; 261: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Following a detailed study by reversed-phase HPLC of the defensin zone, we have isolated and partially characterized a novel antibacterial peptide belonging to the cecropin family. This is the first report presenting the full primary structure of a mature mosquito cecropin isolated from the insect hemolymph. Previously, the only report in mosquitoes was the cecropin isolated from an A. albopictus cell line (22Sun D. Eccleston E.D. Fallon A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In common with all preprocecropin sequences isolated from Diptera, theA. aegypti preprocecropin ends with an alanine residue (Fig.4). In most of the dipteran cecropins listed in Fig. 4, the terminal region of the signal peptide has a highly conserved consensus sequence (GQSEA). All the sequences deduced from the cDNAs showed conserved residues (MNF) at the translation start site and other highly conserved areas within the preproregion, showing the following overall consensus sequence: MNF-K-FIFVALIAI-GQSE. In contrast to the Diptera, preprocecropin sequences from Lepidoptera all end in a proline residue, preceded by either an alanine or a glutamic acid residue (Fig. 4). With the exception of the Bombyx mori cecropin D (39Hara S. Taniai K. Kato Y. Yamakawa M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 108B: 303-308Google Scholar) and the Trichoplusia ni cecropin A (40Kang D. Liu G. Gunne H. Steiner H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the lepidopteran preprosequences begin with the consensus MNF, suggesting that the cecropin molecules occurred in the insects before the divergence of the Diptera and Lepidoptera. Similar cecropins also have been isolated from tunicates, marine invertebrates belonging to the phylum Chordata (42Zhao C. Liaw L. Lee I.H. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which share many of the residues in the consensus region of dipteran cecropins, suggesting the conservation of these peptides among phyla other than insects. Sequence comparison of A. aegypti mature cecropin A with other dipteran cecropins (Fig. 4) showed similarities of 82.4, 88.2, and 35.3% with the A. albopictus, Anopheles gambiae, 2 and Drosophila cecropins, respectively. Comparison of A. aegypti cecropin with previously characterized dipteran and lepidopteran cecropins revealed several interesting contrasts. Of specific note is the absence of a tryptophan residue in the A. aegypti sequence, because a tryptophan residue has been reported, at amino acid position 1 or 2, in all characterized insect cecropins, except for the other mosquito cecropins (22Sun D. Eccleston E.D. Fallon A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) 2J. Vizioli, P. Bulet, M. Charlet, C. A. Lowenberger, C. Bass, C., H.-M. Muller, G. Dimopoulos, J. Hoffmann, F. C. Kafatos, and A. Richman, submitted for publication. and theB. mori cecropin D (39Hara S. Taniai K. Kato Y. Yamakawa M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 108B: 303-308Google Scholar). A. aegypti cecropin A is not amidated at the C-terminal end, as deduced from the characterization of the full cDNA sequence. This is in contrast to the common feature of a C terminus blocked by an amine group, in all insect cecropins except the A. albopictus cecropin A (22Sun D. Eccleston E.D. Fallon A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The A. aegypti cecropin A has more than 13 amino acids in common with the other representative dipteran cecropins over the 15 first N-terminal amino acids. This high degree of identity (87%) was not observed in the C-terminal region. It is surprising that only two amino acids (one valine and two alanine residues) are common among the 10 last residues of mosquito cecropins and the same C-terminal region of other dipteran cecropins (Fig. 4). A phylogenetic analysis of the insect cecropin family was performed at the amino acid level. The phylogenetic tree of the mature peptides (Fig. 5) shows that mosquito cecropins appear in one branch and all other dipteran and lepidopteran cecropins are grouped in another branch. This suggests an earlier divergence between the cecropins isolated from mosquito species and the other Diptera and Lepidoptera. All dipteran cecropins, except those fromAedes and Anopheles, originate from only one root, whereas the lepidopteran cecropins are separated in two rooted groups. This same pattern of separation is maintained when only the prepro sequences of these cecropins are compared (data not shown). Interestingly, if the phylogenetic analysis is based on a partial amino acid sequence corresponding to the hydrophobic C-terminal half of the cecropins, this pattern is altered; mosquito cecropins are more similar to lepidopteran than to dipteran cecropins and are closest to B. mori cecropin D (data not shown). Transcription for A. aegypti cecropin was restricted to immune-activated individuals (Fig. 3). In contrast with the A. aegypti defensin (25Lowenberger C.A. Smartt C.T. Bulet P. Ferdig M.T. Severson D.W. Hoffmann J.A. Christensen B.M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), there is no detectable transcription in any immature stage of this species. Once immune-activated, transcripts can be detected by 6 h and remain detectable for at least 7 days, which represents a large portion of the life span of a mosquito. Northern blot analysis done with whole body or fat bodies alone produce similar results (data not shown), suggesting that the majority of transcription for cecropin occurs in the fat body. The cecropins isolated from A. aegypti and D. melanogaster were generally effective against the same bacteria and filamentous fungi species tested, but the Aedescecropin was generally less active than the Drosophilapeptide. In addition, only the A. aegypti molecule was active against yeast. These qualitative and quantitative differences between these two peptides could be related to the absence of tryptophan residue and C terminus amidation in A. aegypticecropin A. In H. cecropia, the activity of a synthetic analogue of cecropin was strongly reduced when the tryptophan residue was replaced by a nonaromatic residue (43Andreu D. Merrifield R.B. Steiner H. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6475-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44Andreu D. Merrifield R.B. Steiner H. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and in Sarcophaga peregrina, the amidated cecropin was reported to have an antibacterial activity 3–4-fold higher that the corresponding compound with a free carboxylic group (45Li Z.Q. Merrifield R.B. Boman I.A. Boman H.G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar results were reported forHyalophora cecropins and analogues, in which a marked decrease in activity was observed for the nonamidated forms (43Andreu D. Merrifield R.B. Steiner H. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6475-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 46Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition, Callaway and colleagues (47Callaway J.E. Lai J. Haselbeck B. Baltaian M. Bonnesen S.P. Weickmann J. Wilcox G. Lei S.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1614-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that only the recombinant form with an amidated C terminus had an activity similar to the native cecropin. In B. mori (39Hara S. Taniai K. Kato Y. Yamakawa M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 108B: 303-308Google Scholar), a cecropin D precursor form showed a higher efficiency against bacteria, after a posttranslational C-terminal amidation. In our bioassays, A. aegypti cecropin exhibited a marked activity against fungi and medically important yeasts such asCandida spp. Similar anti-fungal and anti-yeast activities have been reported for Hyphantria andHyalophora cecropins (41Park S.S. Shin S.W. Park D.S. Oh H.W. Boo K.S. Park H.Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 48DeLucca A.J. Bland J.M. Jacks T.J. Grimm C. Cleveland T.E. Walsh T.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 481-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of A. aegypti cecropin is sufficient to affect the growth of certain bacteria strains that are naturally present in mosquito midgut (i.e. Erwinia spp.,Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., andXanthomonas spp.) (29Straif S.C. Mbogo C.N.M. Toure A.M. Walker E.D. Kaufman M. Toure Y.T. Beier J.C. J. Med. Entomol. 1998; 35: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Even if the estimated concentration of the circulating cecropin in A. aegypti (approximately 5 μm) is sufficient to affect the growth of such bacteria, it is difficult to determine the role of this peptide in protecting mosquitoes from eukaryotic pathogens. Several studies already have implicated cecropins or synthetic analogues in limiting the development of parasites (see the Introduction). In addition a possible synergistic interaction between cecropin, defensins, and other immune-induced peptides, could occur in vivo, increasing pathogen mortality. Such an aspect remains to be investigated. The characterization of the cecropin reported here and the identification of novel inducible immune peptides that is in progress will expand our knowledge of mosquito immunity. This will allow us to delve further into the role these peptides may play during insect development and protection of mosquito vectors from pathogens. We are indebted to Dr. S. Uttenweiler-Joseph for mass spectrometry determination and to Dr. J. P. Briand forA. aegypti cecropin synthesis. We thank J. K. Chiles and L. Christensen for mosquito rearing and maintenance.

In this report, we describe an anti-apoptotic property of all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) in mammalian cells. Mesangial cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exhibited shrinkage of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, condensation of nuclei, and DNA fragmentation. Pretreatment with t-RA attenuated the morphologic and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. t-RA also inhibited apoptosis of mesangial cells triggered by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, whereas it did not prevent tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect against H2O2 was similarly observed in NRK49F fibroblasts, but not in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and ECV304 endothelial cells. Mesangial cells exposed to H2O2 undergo apoptosis via the activator protein 1 (AP-1)-dependent pathway. We found that t-RA abrogated the H2O2-induced expression of c-fos/c-jun and activation of AP-1. Furthermore, t-RA inhibited H2O2-triggered activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and dominant-negative inhibition of JNK attenuated the H2O2-induced apoptosis. These data disclosed the novel potential of retinoic acid as an inhibitor of apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic action of t-RA was ascribed, at least in part, to dual suppression of the cell death pathway mediated by JNK and AP-1.

AP-1, mainly composed of either homodimers of c-Jun or heterodimers of c-Jun and c-Fos, binds to the particularcis element, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE), and initiates transcription of target genes (13Curran T. Franza Jr., B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Several reports have shown the importance of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its substrate c-Jun in the signaling pathways to apoptosis. For example, exposure of cells to apoptotic stimuli including ultraviolet light, γ-irradiation, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and ceramide triggers JNK activity (14Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D.

Dominant-negative inactivation of SEK1 (JNK kinase), JNK, or c-Jun prevents certain apoptotic processes (14Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol.

In apoptosis of mesangial cells exposed to H2O2, activation of AP-1 also plays a crucial role. We previously reported that H2O2 induces expression of c-jun and activation of AP-1 (10Ishikawa Y. Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of c-Jun/AP-1 using either a dominant-negative mutant of c-jun, an antisense c-jun, or a pharmacological inhibitor of c-jun attenuated the H2O2-initiated apoptosis (10Ishikawa Y. Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, suppression of c-jun expression and AP-1 activation by flavonoid quercetin and heparin was closely associated with attenuation of H2O2-induced apoptosis in mesangial cells (11Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F206-F212PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 497APubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid (RA) is an active metabolite of vitamin A and regulates a wide range of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis (23De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The action of retinoids, including RA, is mediated by specific nuclear receptors, namely, retinoic acid receptors (RAR-α, -β, -γ) and retinoid X receptors (RXR-α, -β, -γ). RXRs form homodimers and heterodimers with RARs or other nuclear hormone receptors and function as transcriptional regulators. All-trans-RA (t-RA), for example, activates RAR-RXR heterodimers and exerts its biological actions via binding to particular cis response elements, retinoic acid response elements (24Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In certain cell types, RA functions as a potent inhibitor of AP-1 (25Schüle R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that t-RA inhibited serum-induced activation of AP-1 in mesangial cells (26Simonson M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F805-F815PubMed Google Scholar). RA is known to induce apoptosis in various cell types including tumor cells and embryonic cells. In contrast, little is known about its anti-apoptotic potential in mammalian cells. In the present report, we investigate whether and how t-RA modulates apoptosis mediated by AP-1. This study highlights especially the effect of t-RA on the H2O2-triggered apoptosis of mesangial cells in which the AP-1 pathway plays a crucial role. Mesangial cells (SM43) were established from isolated glomeruli of a male Sprague-Dawley rat and identified as being of the mesangial cell phenotype as described before (27Kitamura M. Taylor S. Unwin R. Burton S. Shimizu F. Fine L.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The fibroblast cell line NRK49F, the epithelial cell line MDCK, and the endothelial cell line ECV304 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Medium containing 1% FCS was generally used for experiments. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-inactive mesangial cells were created as follows. SM43 mesangial cells were exposed to diluted retrovirus that introduces a super-repressor mutant of IκBα (IκBαM) and a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (28Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). This retroviral vector was generated by transfection of the helper-free ecotropic packaging line ΩE (29Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) with pLIκBαMSN (28Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Stable infectants were selected in the presence of G418 (750 μg/ml), and SM/IκBαM cells were established. SM/IκBαM cells exhibit blunted activation of NF-κB in response to interleukin-1β and TNF-α, when examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (30Sugiyama H. Savill J. Kitamura M. Zhao L. Stylianou E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19532-19537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells (1 × 105/well for 24-well plates; 5 × 105/well for 6-well plates) were pretreated with or without t-RA (tretinoin; 0.1–7.5 μm, Sigma) for 2 h in the presence of 1% FCS and stimulated by H2O2 (75–100 μm; Sigma), TNF-α (250 units/ml; a gift from Dr. K. Noguchi, Teikyo University, Japan), or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 10–20 μm; Sigma) for up to 24 h. PDTC is supposed to induce apoptosis via activation of pro-apoptotic molecule AP-1 and inactivation of anti-apoptotic molecule NF-κB (31Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F806-F811PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schreck R. Meier B. Mannuel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Compared with mesangial cells, NRK49F cells, MDCK cells, and ECV304 cells were relatively resistant to H2O2-induced injury. The following concentrations of H2O2 were used for individual cell types: NRK49F, 150–200 μm; MDCK, 400 μm; ECV304, 200–400 μm. t-RA at the concentration of 5 μm was generally used for experiments. t-RA at concentrations over 7.5–10 μm impairs morphologic integrity of mesangial cells. 2V. Moreno-Manzano and M. Kitamura, unpublished observation. Morphologic examination was performed using a phase-contrast microscope. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and stained by Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h. Apoptosis was identified using morphological criteria including shrinkage of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation. In contrast to other cell types, MDCK cells undergoing apoptosis easily detach from the substratum. For this cell type, Hoechst analysis was performed using floating cells. To confirm that the major mechanism of cell death induced by H2O2, PDTC, and TNF-α is apoptosis, cells were stained with acridine orange (50 μg/ml) and ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml) for 10 min without fixation. The percentages of apoptosis (condensed/fragmented green nuclei) against total cell death (condensed/fragmented green nuclei + orange nuclei) were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. After the induction of apoptosis, both attached and detached cells (5 × 105cells/sample) were harvested and subjected to ladder detection assay, as described previously (11Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F206-F212PubMed Google Scholar). The final step of apoptosis, secondary necrosis (33Studzinski G.P. Cell Growth and Apoptosis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar), was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. After the induction of apoptosis, both attached and detached cells were gently trypsinized and mixed with the same volume of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma). Percentages of viable cells were evaluated by light microscopy. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. The effect of t-RA on the activity of AP-1 was evaluated by a transient transfection assay as described before (10Ishikawa Y. Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F206-F212PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, mesangial cells cultured in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected with an AP-1 reporter plasmid pTRE-LacZ (0.33 μg/well) (34Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminty M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) or a control plasmid pCI-βGal (0.33 μg/well; a gift from Promega, Madison, WI). pTRE-LacZ introduces a β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) under the control of tandemly repeated TREs. pCI-βGal introduces lacZ under the control of the immediate-early enhancer/promoter of human cytomegalovirus. After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h in 10% FCS in the presence or absence of t-RA (5 μm) and subjected to 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assay to evaluate AP-1 activity. To examine the effect of t-RA on the H2O2-induced activation of AP-1, transfected cells were incubated in 0.5% FCS for 24 h, pretreated with t-RA in 2.5% FCS for 2 h, and then stimulated by H2O2 (100 μm) for 40 h. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. X-Gal assay was performed as described before (35Kitamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7387-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The number of X-gal-positive cells transfected with pTRE-LacZ was counted and normalized by the number of X-gal-positive cells transfected with pCI-βGal. The mean value of 4 wells was used to compare data in different groups. Mesangial cells cultured in 24-well plates were co-transfected with pcDNA3-DN-JNK1 (a gift of Dr. Roger Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School) or an empty plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (0.5 μg/well, respectively) together with pCI-βGal (0.17 μg/well). pcDNA3-DN-JNK1 encodes a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1 (36Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). After incubation overnight, medium was replaced with 1% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12. After 24 h, cells were treated with H2O2 (100–200 μm, 8–12 h) and subjected to X-gal assay. Percentage of shrunk/rounded blue cells against the total number of blue cells was calculated for each well, and the mean value of four wells was used to compare data in different groups (37Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in quadruplicate. Expression of c-fos and c-jun was examined by Northern blot analysis (38Kitamura M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1404-1411PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, confluent mesangial cells cultured in the presence of 1% FCS were pretreated with t-RA (5 μm) for 2 h and stimulated by 75–100 μm H2O2 for 30 min and 2 h. Total RNA was extracted by the single-step method (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) and subjected to analysis. cDNAs for c-Fos (40Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Muller R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), c-Jun (41McDonnell S.E. Kerr L.D. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4284-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (42Hofer G. Grimmer C. Sukhatme V.P. Sterzel R.B. Rupprecht H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28306-29310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were used as probes. Confluent mesangial cells cultured in 6-well plates in the presence of 1% FCS for 24 h were pretreated with t-RA (5 μm) for 2 h and exposed to 100 μmH2O2 for 1 h. Activity of JNK was evaluated by phosphorylation of c-Jun, using the SAPK/JNK Assay Kit (New England Biolabs, Herts, United Kingdom) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test to compare data in different groups. p Value of < 0.05 was used to indicate a statistically significant difference. Rat mesangial cells cultured in the presence of 1% FCS were pretreated with t-RA (5 μm) for 2 h and stimulated by H2O2 (100 μm). In the absence of t-RA, mesangial cells exposed to H2O2 showed shrinkage of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and condensation of nuclei that are typical of apoptosis. The morphological alteration occurred within several hours. Acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining confirmed that the major mechanism of cell death (75.3 ± 3.7%, after 3 h) was apoptosis. Pretreatment with t-RA substantially inhibited these morphologic changes (Fig. 1 A). Staining of the cells with Hoechst 33258 exhibited condensation and fragmentation of nuclei in H2O2-exposed cells, whereas it was dramatically suppressed by the treatment with t-RA (Fig.1 B). Consistently, agarose gel electrophoresis detected DNA ladder formation in H2O2-exposed cells, which was markedly attenuated by treatment with t-RA (Fig.1 C). The apoptotic process is divided into three phases. In the first and second phases, function of cellular membranes is retained intact, but in the third phase, cell membranes are progressively degenerated (33Studzinski G.P. Cell Growth and Apoptosis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). The final step of apoptosis was, therefore, evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. Confluent mesangial cells were pretreated with or without t-RA and stimulated by H2O2 for 16 h. After the induction of apoptosis, both attached and detached cells were gently trypsinized and used for the analysis. When exposed to H2O2, the percentage of viable cells was reduced from 89.5 ± 0.6% to 17.0 ± 3.4% (mean ± S.E.) (Fig. 1 D). Pretreatment with t-RA significantly improved the cell survival to 69.0 ± 2.1% (p < 0.05). The cytoprotective effect of t-RA was dose-dependent. Obvious improvement in cell survival was observed at concentrations higher than 1 μm, and a maximum effect was achieved by 5 μm t-RA (Fig.1 E). The anti-apoptotic potential of t-RA was investigated using different stimuli. PDTC is known to induce apoptosis in certain cell types (43Tsai J.C. Jain M. Hsieh C.M. Lee W.S. Yoshizumi M.

Nobel C.S. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic action of PDTC is supposed to be via activation of AP-1 and/or inactivation of NF-κB (31Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F806-F811PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schreck R. Meier B. Mannuel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were pretreated with t-RA and stimulated by PDTC (10–20 μm) in the presence of 1% FCS. Mesangial cells exposed to PDTC showed shrinkage of the cytoplasm. Acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining confirmed that the major mechanism of cell death (82.0 ± 4.4% after 16 h) was apoptosis. Pretreatment with t-RA reversed the morphologic change (Fig.2 A). Staining of the cells with Hoechst 33258 exhibited condensation and fragmentation of nuclei in PDTC-treated cells. It was suppressed by treatment with t-RA (Fig. 2B, left panel). The relative percentages of apoptotic cells were significantly reduced from 16.8 ± 1.6% (PDTC alone) to 1.0 ± 0.3% (t-RA + PDTC) (versus untreated control, 0.8 ± 0.3%) (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Consistently, agarose gel electrophoresis detected DNA fragmentation in PDTC-exposed cells, and it was attenuated by treatment with t-RA (Fig.2 C). We further tested the effect of t-RA on apoptosis triggered by another apoptosis inducer, TNF-α (46Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). Like other cell types, cultured mesangial cells are resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. It is due to induction of anti-apoptotic proteins by TNF-α via NF-κB-dependent mechanisms (30Sugiyama H. Savill J. Kitamura M. Zhao L. Stylianou E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19532-19537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 47Sonenshein G.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To sensitize mesangial cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, we created NF-κB-inactive mesangial cells, SM/IκBαM, by expression of a super-repressor mutant of IκBα, IκBαM. The established SM/IκBαM cells exhibited substantial susceptibility to TNF-α-induced cellular injury (30Sugiyama H. Savill J. Kitamura M. Zhao L. Stylianou E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19532-19537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining confirmed that the major mechanism of cell death (75.8 ± 2.5% after 16 h) was apoptosis. Using the established cells, the effect of t-RA was tested. Microscopic analysis showed that, in contrast to H2O2- and PDTC-initiated apoptosis, t-RA did not affect morphological changes (shrinkage and round-up of the cells) induced by TNF-α (250 units/ml) (Fig. 2 D). Like in wild-type mesangial cells, H2O2-induced damage was attenuated by t-RA in SM/IκBαM cells. Hoechst staining and agarose gel electrophoresis exhibited consistent results. That is, (i) condensation and fragmentation of nuclei induced by TNF-α was not attenuated by t-RA (percentages of apoptotic cells: 28.2 ± 2.1% by TNF-α alone, and 25.9 ± 2.9% by t-RA + TNF-α, not statistically different) (Fig. 2 E) and (ii) DNA fragmentation induced by TNF-α was unaffected by the pretreatment with t-RA (Fig. 2 F). In contrast, DNA laddering induced by H2O2 was inhibited by t-RA in SM/IκBαM cells. To examine whether the anti-apoptotic effect of t-RA against H2O2 is specific to mesangial cells, NRK49F fibroblasts, MDCK epithelial cells, and ECV304 endothelial cells were tested. Dose-dependent effects of H2O2 on individual cell type was initially examined to determine minimum concentrations required for cellular damage. Compared with mesangial cells, NRK49F, MDCK, and ECV304 cells were found to be relatively resistant to H2O2-induced injury. The minimum concentrations required were 150–200 μm for NRK49F cells, 400 μm for MDCK cells, and 200–400 μm for ECV304 cells (data not shown). Using these concentrations, effects of t-RA on H2O2-induced apoptosis were examined. NRK49F fibroblasts exposed to H2O2 exhibited shrinkage of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and condensation of nuclei. Pretreatment with t-RA substantially inhibited these morphologic changes (Fig. 3 A). Hoechst staining showed condensation and fragmentation of nuclei in H2O2-exposed cells, whereas it was suppressed by treatment with t-RA (Fig. 3 B, left panel). The percentages of apoptotic cells were significantly reduced from 35.0 ± 5.9% (H2O2 alone) to 15.0 ± 1.7% (t-RA + H2O2) (versusuntreated control, 3.7 ± 1.1%) (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Consistently, agarose gel electrophoresis detected DNA ladder formation in H2O2-exposed NRK49F cells, and it was attenuated by treatment with t-RA (Fig. 3 C). In contrast to mesangial cells and NRK49F fibroblasts, t-RA did not diminish H2O2-induced apoptosis of MDCK cells. Morphological analysis, Hoechst staining, and agarose gel electrophoresis showed typical features of apoptosis in H2O2-exposed MDCK cells, and the apoptotic process was not affected by the pretreatment with t-RA (Fig. 3,D-F). The percentages of apoptotic cells were 17.0 ± 0.8% in H2O2 alone and 14.7 ± 1.0% in t-RA + H2O2 (Fig. 3 E, right panel, not statistically different). Similar unresponsiveness to t-RA was observed in ECV304 endothelial cells (data not shown). Activation of AP-1 is a crucial signaling event that mediates H2O2-induced apoptosis in mesangial cells (10Ishikawa Y. Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F206-F212PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of t-RA on the activity of AP-1, especially focusing on expression of AP-1 components and activation of JNK. In the presence of serum (10%), mesangial cells exhibit constitutive AP-1 activity. Reporter assays showed that t-RA (5 μm) significantly suppressed the basal activity of AP-1 (Fig. 4 A). Compared with the untreated control (100 ± 9.5%), the activity of AP-1 was decreased to 48.2 ± 5.4% by the treatment with t-RA. The effect of t-RA on the oxidant-induced activation"
https://openalex.org/W2043091813,"We examined the responses of toad rod photoreceptors to single photons of light. To minimize the effects of variability in the early rising phase, we selected sets of responses that closely matched the rise of the mean single photon response. Responses selected in this way showed substantial variations in kinetics, appearing to peel off from a common time course after different delays. Following incorporation of the calcium buffer BAPTA, the time to peeling off was retarded. Our analysis indicates that it is not necessary to invoke a long series of reaction steps to explain the shutoff of rhodopsin activity. Instead, our results suggest that the observed behavior is explicable by the presently known shutoff reactions of activated rhodopsin, modulated by feedback."

Two representative genes are the aldose reductase enzyme (AR, EC 1.1.1.21), which is responsible for the conversion of glucose to sorbitol, and the betaine transporter (BGT1), which mediates Na+-coupled betaine uptake in response to osmotic stress. We recently reported that the induction of BGT1 mRNA in the renal epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line is inhibited by SB203580, a specific p38 kinase inhibitor. In these studies we report that the hypertonic induction of aldose reductase mRNA in HepG2 cells as well as the osmotic response element (ORE)-driven reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells are both inhibited by SB203580, suggesting that p38 kinase mediates the activation and/or binding of the transcription factor(s) to the ORE. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays with cell extracts prepared from SB203580-treated, hypertonically stressed HepG2 cells further show that the binding of trans-acting factors to the ORE is prevented and is thus also dependent on the activity of p38 kinase. Similarly, treatment of hypertonically stressed cells with PD098059, a mitogen-activated extracellular regulated kinase kinase (MEK1) inhibitor, results in inhibition of the hypertonic induction of aldose reductase mRNA, ORE-driven reporter gene expression, and the binding of trans-acting factors to the ORE. ORE-driven reporter gene expression was not affected by p38 kinase inhibition or MEK1 inhibition in cells incubated in iso-osmotic media. These data indicate that p38 kinase and MEK1 are involved in the regulation of the hyperosmotic stress response.

These data indicate that p38 kinase and MEK1 are involved in the regulation of the hyperosmotic stress response. Many organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals, adapt to sustained hyperosmotic stress by the preferential accumulation of compatible organic osmolytes (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E.

The induction of osmoprotective genes has been shown to be part of the protective response of the kidney medulla tubular cells to exposure to hypertonicity during urinary concentration (2Garcı́a-Pérez A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of a variety of diabetic complications via an increased flux of glucose through the sorbitol pathway during hyperglycemia, i.e. the pathway is driven by increased intracellular glucose availability leading to sorbitol accumulation (8Gabbay K.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1973; 288: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible to accumulate large amounts of intracellular sorbitol at normal blood glucose levels by increasing the transcription of AR upon exposure of cells to hypertonicity. The result is an enzyme-driven intracellular accumulation of sorbitol at normal blood glucose levels, which is one of several redundant mechanisms involved in osmoregulation in the renal medulla (2Garcı́a-Pérez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Hypertonicity increases synthesis of AR mRNA 15-fold in 24 h without a detectable change in the rate of degradation of the AR protein (9Moriyama T. Garcı́a-Pérez A. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AR transcription is regulated by a promoter that contains diverse regulatory elements including an osmotic response element (ORE) present at 1235 bp upstream of the transcription start site, which mediates its induction during hypertonic stress (10Wang K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16052-16058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16431-16437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Studies in the MDCK renal epithelial cell line showed that a specific p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, blocked the induction of BGT1 mRNA in response to hyperosmotic media (13Sheikh-Hamad D. Di Mari J. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts III, B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) suggesting that the p38 kinase pathway is essential for the hypertonicity response. Additional studies in monocytes showed that SB203580 also blocked the hypertonic induction of mRNA of both SMIT and BGT1 (14Denkert C. Warskulat U. Hensel F. Haussinger D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the role of p38 kinase in the hypertonic induction of these genes remains unknown. The current studies were undertaken to define the role of p38 kinase and other signal cascades in the possible activation of transcription factors binding to the ORE, by transfection of ORE plasmid constructs containing reporter genes into HepG2 cells. Gel mobility shift studies were also performed to determine the specificity of responses. Hypertonic induction of AR mRNA in HepG2 cells, the expression of ORE-driven reporter gene products, as well as the binding of trans-acting factors to the ORE are p38 kinase- and MEK1-dependent, yet ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)-independent. These findings indicate that the hypertonicity-induced activation and binding of transcription factors to the ORE are regulated by the p38 kinase- and MEK1-signaling pathways. A 132-bp fragment (GenBankTM accession number L14440, nucleotides 2032–2163) (10Wang K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16052-16058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the osmotic response element (ORE) and its surrounding sequence was excised from the AR promoter construct pARP4.2 and inserted into the pCAT SV40 promoter vector (Promega) usingBamHI/PstI cloning sites as described previously (11Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Introduction of SacI and NheI sites by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-TGGTTTGTCCGAGCTCATCAATGTATCTTATC and 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTAGCACCATGATTACGCCA, respectively, allowed the ligation of this fragment into the pGL3-promoter vector that carries the SV40 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene (Promega). A vector construct containing the minimal 12-bp sequence necessary for ORE enhancer activity (GenBankTM accession number L14440, nucleotides 2110–2121) was prepared by annealing a synthetic oligonucleotide fragment containing the ORE, 5′-gagctcTGGAAAATCACCgctagc and its reverse complement, flanked byNheI and SacI sites, and inserted into the pGL3 promoter vector. Similarly, an insert spanning 1.5 kb of the AR gene (GenBankTM accession number L14440, nucleotides 1801–3300) which includes the ORE enhancer and other identified elements of the AR promoter (10Wang K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16052-16058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting fragment was inserted into the pGL3 basic vector using XhoI and HindIII restriction sites. All constructs were sequenced to verify the sequence and orientation (sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp.). HepG2 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM low glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (0.25 × 106, passages 30–40) were seeded into 24-well plates (16-mm well diameter) and grown for 24 h. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA/well of pCAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) or pGL3 (luciferase) vectors, driven by either the 12- or 132-bp ORE constructs. The 1.5-kb promoter-driven pGL3 basic vector construct was transfected at 4 μg of DNA/well. A control firefly luciferase vector pRSVL (Promega, 0.2 μg of DNA/well) was cotransfected with ORE-pCAT plasmids to correct for transfection efficiency. Similarly, a control plasmid, pRLTK (Promega, 0.2 μg of DNA/well) which expresses the Renilla luciferase, was used as a control for transfection efficiency of the ORE-pGL3 plasmids, which express the firefly luciferase. The two luciferases exhibit luminescence under different conditions in the dual luciferase assay, thus allowing independent quantitation. Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The cells were shocked after 6 h with 15% glycerol and allowed to recover for 24 h in regular media. Hypertonic stress was induced by the addition of 5m NaCl to regular DMEM to make a final concentration of 220 mm NaCl (515 mosmol/kg). Regular DMEM was added to cells exposed to iso-smotic conditions. The kinase inhibitors SB203580 or PD098059 (Calbiochem) were added in 10 μl of Me2SO (Sigma) to achieve the desired concentrations. Me2SO was also added to the controls to ensure that all wells had the same concentration of Me2SO. The cells were harvested after 16 h incubation. In the CAT reporter gene assays, the cells were harvested by scraping in 200 μl of phosphate buffer (0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 7.9) and lysed by 3 freeze-thaw cycles at −80 and 37 °C. The lysate was centrifuged, and 10 μl of the supernatant was analyzed for luciferase activity (15de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD). Extracts (2–50 μl) containing equal luciferase activity were then incubated with [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 mm acetyl-CoA (Sigma) in phosphate buffer. The acetylated chloramphenicol products were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. The bands visualized by autoradiography were then excised from the chromatography plate and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. In the dual luciferase transfections, passive lysis buffer (200 μl) supplied by the manufacturer (Promega) was added to each well, and the plate was shaken on an orbital shaker for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting cell lysate was collected in amber tubes and centrifuged, and 2–5 μl of the supernatant was analyzed forRenilla and firefly luciferase activities in a Monolight 2010 luminometer using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). MAPK activity was determined as described previously (16Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol.

The cells were exposed to hyperosmotic conditions in the presence or absence of inhibitors as described above, scraped into the experimental medium, and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was lysed in Triton Lysis Buffer (TLB) consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Anti-ERK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. NY; the antibody cross-reacts with ERK1 and ERK2) was bound to protein A- and G-agarose. Cell lysate (100 μg of protein) was then added to the agarose beads, and ERK was precipitated by the antibody-agarose complex. The beads were washed 3 times in TLB, followed by 3 additional washes in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate). Myelin basic protein (Sigma) in kinase buffer containing 25 μm [α-32P]dATP was added to the beads and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was stopped by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. ERK1 and -2 activity was determined by the extent of incorporation of 32P in the myelin basic protein substrate. For JNK1, p38, and p38β assays, the above procedure is used except for the following: anti-p38, anti-p38β, or anti-JNK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA) are used for immunoprecipitation, and Pansorbin (Calbiochem, CA) is used to immobilize the antibodies; activated transcription factor 2 is used as substrate for the p38 kinases, whereas the NH2-terminal peptide-(1–79) derived from c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) is used as substrate for JNK1. The reaction supernatant is resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The oligonucleotides 5′-GTGAAGCACCAAATGGAAAATCACCGGCATGGAGT and 5′-GTGACTCCATGCCGGTGATTTTCCATTTGGTGCTT containing the minimal ORE (in bold) were annealed, and the 5′-overhangs were labeled using Klenow polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]dATP (ICN Radiochemicals). The labeled probe was purified using a Select G-25 spin column (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Specific competitor fragments were generated in a similar fashion using non-radioactive α-dCTP and α-dATP. For the nonspecific competitor, a single base (underlined and bold) was changed in the ORE element to yield oligonucleotides 5′-AAGCACCAAATAGAAAATCACCGGCATGGAGT and 5′ACTCCATGCCGGTGATTTTCTATTTGGTGCTT which were annealed and used directly. This single nucleotide mutation was previously shown in transfection studies to abolish the hypertonicity response of the ORE (11Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8624-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells seeded into 10-cm dishes and grown in regular DMEM until they reached 90% confluency. The cells were then exposed to isotonic or hypertonic media containing the appropriate concentrations of kinase inhibitors (10 μm SB203580 or 10 μm PD098059) for 16 h. The plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were scraped and collected in extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm leupeptin, and 100 μm benzamidine in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Aliquots containing 5 μg of total protein were incubated for 30 min in gel shift buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing radiolabeled probe (50,000 cpm), 100 ng of poly(dI/dC) and cold competitor (0, 10, or 50×). The reaction products were then separated on a 4% acrylamide gel at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. HepG2 cells at 90% confluency were exposed to iso-osmotic or hyperosmotic medium (with and without 10 μm SB203580 or PD098059) for 16 h as described above. The cells were scraped and pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Total RNA was isolated from the cell pellet using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Equal amounts of RNA per lane were loaded onto 1% agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde gel. The gel was electrophoresed and transferred to GeneScreen membrane (NEN Life Science Products). Human AR cDNA and introns 6–8 from the human AR gene (6Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human full-length β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for use as probes. Probes were hybridized to the blots overnight at 42 °C in a solution containing 40% formamide, 5× SSC (0.75 m NaCl, 75 mmtrisodium citrate, pH 7), 5× Denhardt's solution (0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.5% (w/v) Ficoll 400), 0.5% SDS, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10% dextran sulfate. The blots were washed under high stringency at 65 °C as follows: twice in 3× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 30 min, and twice in 0.3× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 30 min. The blots were autoradiographed, and relative band intensities were quantitated using Image Tool (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio) software. Relative band intensities were normalized to β-actin. We examined the effects of SB203580, a specific p38 kinase inhibitor, on the hypertonic induction of AR mRNA in HepG2 cells. Fig. 1shows that 16 h of exposure to hypertonicity induces a 15-fold increase in AR mRNA levels in comparison with cells incubated in isotonic media. The increase in mRNA is attenuated in the presence of a 5 μm concentration of the p38 kinase inhibitor. These osmotically stressed cells express two specific AR mRNA species in equal abundance (1.5 and 2.5 kb) as compared with cells incubated in isotonic media, where only the smaller mRNA is detected. Northern blots were hybridized with genomic probes derived from introns 6–8 of the human AR gene (6Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only the larger 2.5-kb mRNA species hybridized to the intron 7 probe but not to introns 6 or 8 probes, suggesting that this band represents incompletely processed mRNA (6Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing intron 7 sequences (data not shown). The hypertonic induction of AR mRNA in HepG2 cells was also attenuated by PD098059, a MEK1 inhibitor, at a 10 μmconcentration (Fig. 1). These data suggest that p38 kinase and MEK1 regulate the hypertonically induced native promoter expression and the level of native AR mRNA in these cells. To determine the specific sites in the AR gene promoter that are under the regulatory control of p38 kinase and MEK1, we examined the expression of ORE-driven CAT or luciferase reporter constructs in hypertonically stressed HepG2 cells in the presence of the p38 kinase inhibitor (SB203580) and MEK1 inhibitor (PD098059). Transfection experiments with a CAT reporter construct driven by a 132-bp sequence that contains the basic ORE and surrounding sequence 2V. Nadkarni, K. H. Gabbay, and K. M. Bohren, and manuscript in preparation. paralleled the mRNA findings (Fig. 2), with ORE-driven CAT reporter gene expression rising 5-fold in hypertonically stressed cells. This response was attenuated in the presence of the p38 kinase inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition at a 25 μm concentration (Fig. 2). Transfection experiments using a luciferase reporter construct driven by the same 132-bp enhancer sequence showed similar results (Fig.3 A), albeit complete inhibition of the hypertonic induction of reporter gene product expression was achieved at a lower concentration of p38 kinase inhibitor (10 μm). Since the results obtained with the luciferase assay confirmed those obtained with the CAT assay, the luciferase assay was used for the remainder of the studies. The effects of MEK1 inhibition on ORE-driven luciferase expression in osmotically stressed cells were also similar (Fig. 3 B). A 5 μm concentration of PD098059 was sufficient to inhibit completely the hypertonic induction response.Figure 3Effect of p38 kinase inhibitor (A) or MEK1 inhibitor (B) on ORE-driven luciferase reporter construct expression.

Hypertonicity increases ORE-driven luciferase reporter expression 5.9-, 4.7-, and 1.6-fold with the 1.5-kb, 132-, and 12-bp ORE sequences, respectively. This induction is attenuated in the presence of either MEK1 or p38 kinase inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition at 10 μm SB203580 or 5 μm PD098059 (TableI). However, the expression of the reporter gene was not affected by either inhibitor under isotonic conditions. Although the magnitude of hypertonic induction of the reporter gene product differed among the various constructs (1.5 kb > 132 bp > 12 bp), the effects of the inhibitors were similar (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2133164252,"Analysis of purified soybean and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) and PA317 cells transfected with human 15-LOX revealed a rapid rate of linoleate-dependent nitric oxide (⋅NO) uptake that coincided with reversible inhibition of product ((13S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid, or (13S)-HPODE) formation. No reaction of ⋅NO (up to 2 μm) with either native (Ered) or ferric LOXs (0.2 μm) metal centers to form nitrosyl complexes occurred at these ⋅NO concentrations. During HPODE-dependent activation of 15-LOX, there was consumption of 2 mol of ⋅NO/mol of 15-LOX. Stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy showed that ⋅NO (2.2 μm) did not alter the rate or extent of (13S)-HPODE-induced tryptophan fluorescence quenching associated with 15-LOX activation. Additionally,⋅NO does not inhibit the anaerobic peroxidase activity of 15-LOX, inferring that the inhibitory actions of ⋅NO are due to reaction with the enzyme-bound lipid peroxyl radical, rather than impairment of (13S)-HPODE-dependent enzyme activation. From this, a mechanism of 15-LOX inhibition by ⋅NO is proposed whereby reaction of ⋅NO with EredLOO⋅ generates Ered and LOONO, which hydrolyzes to (13S)-HPODE and nitrite (NO 2 −). Reactivation of Ered, considerably slower than dioxygenase activity, is then required to complete the catalytic cycle and leads to a net inhibition of rates of (13S)-HPODE formation. This reaction of ⋅NO with 15-LOX inhibited ⋅NO-dependent activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and consequent cGMP production. Since accelerated ⋅NO production, enhanced 15-LOX gene expression, and 15-LOX product formation occurs in diverse inflammatory conditions, these observations indicate that reactions of ⋅NO with lipoxygenase peroxyl radical intermediates will result in modulation of both ⋅NO bioavailability and rates of production of lipid signaling mediators.

The accumulation and oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) lipids by monocytes and the subsequent accumulation of oxidized lipids and foam cells in the vascular intima is a hallmark of early atherogenesis. In vitro studies have shown that macrophage and endothelial cell lipoxygenases readily oxidize externally added LDL and promote metal-dependent lipoprotein oxidation (10Parthasarathy S. Wieland E.

In vivo models show that somatic gene transfer of 15-LOX to vessels and transgenic mice cross-bred with LDL receptor-deficient mice results in increased oxidation of LDL and accumulation of lipid-containing vascular lesions (13Ylä-Herttuala S.

A currently provocative counterpoint to these properties of 15-LOX is the observation that targeted overexpression of rabbit macrophage 15-LOX prevented diet-induced atherosclerosis (15Shen J.

In contrast, diet-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits is inhibited by administration of a 15-LOX inhibitor having limited direct antioxidant properties (16Sendobry S.M. Cornicelli J.A. Welch K.

In aggregate, these observations encourage better understanding of the interactions of 15-LOX, 15-LOX products, and vascular cells with key mediators of vascular function and atherogenesis, in particular ⋅NO.In vitro, ⋅NO can act as a potent antioxidant by scavenging lipid-derived peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals formed in purified or LDL lipids oxidized by Cu2+, azo initiators, peroxynitrite (ONOO−), endothelial cells or macrophages (17Malo-Ranta U.

Inhibition of both plant and mammalian 15-LOX-dependent lipid oxidation by high concentrations of nitric oxide (⋅NO) was ascribed to formation of an enzyme-nitrosyl complex (25Weisner R. Rathmann J.

Nitric oxide can form a nitrosyl complex with the active site of 15-LOX, a single six-coordinate ferrous iron liganded to nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms (28Kuban R.J. Weisner R. Rathman J. Veldink G. Nolting H. Sole V.A. Kühn H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), that is detectable by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The spectrum of the soybean 15-LOX Fe2+-⋅NO complex contains two species, the first attributed to either high spin ferric iron, formed by transfer of an electron from Fe2+ to ⋅NO, or an S = 3/2 system resulting from antiferromagnetic coupling of axial (D > E) high spin ferrous iron to ⋅NO (29Galpin J.R. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 536: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Salerno J.C. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys.

The dissociation constant (K d) for formation of this species is 95 μm for soybean 15-LOX at pH 7 (31Nelson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12137-12142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second component of the EPR spectra has been suggested to be a high spin Fe2+-⋅NO complex and requires ⋅NO concentrations of at least 400 μm for detection (30Salerno J.C. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Three lines of evidence suggested that oxidation of the reduced iron by⋅NO, leading to enzyme activation, might occur following formation of the nitrosyl complex. Addition of ⋅NO to anaerobic ferrous 15-LOX resulted in immediate appearance of a pale yellow color, identical to that of the ferric enzyme found on treating native enzyme with HPODE (29Galpin J.R. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 536: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, EPR and x-ray absorption analysis of rabbit 15-LOX showed that incubation with millimolar concentrations of⋅NO yielded ferric iron species (25Weisner R. Rathmann J. Holzhütter H.G. Stöer R. Mäder K. Nolting H. Kühn H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Importantly, the⋅NO concentrations required for formation of the Fe2+-⋅NO complex significantly exceed those (a) required to inhibit soybean 15-LOX catalytic activity (32Rubbo H. Parthasarathy S. Barnes S. Kirk M. Kalyanaraman B. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and (b) maximal ⋅NO levels typically found in biological systems, typically <1–5 μm (33Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S.

Biomed. Anal. 1999; 19: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that 15-LOX inhibition does not involve Fe2+-⋅NO complex formation. Thus, other mechanisms are likely to be operative in the ⋅NO-mediated inhibition of lipoxygenase-dependent lipid oxidation.In addition to the ferrous iron, several species form during 15-LOX catalysis that could potentially react with ⋅NO and lead to enzyme inhibition. These include enzyme-bound lipid peroxyl, alkoxyl, and carbon-centered radicals. Termination reactions of ⋅NO with non-lipid-derived radicals are fast, occurring at essentially diffusion-limited rates (35Wallington T.J. Dagaut P. Kurylo M.J. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 667-710Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 36Padmaja S. Huie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, kinetic studies indicate that ⋅NO also reacts extremely rapidly with lipid-derived radicals in aqueous systems (18O'Donnell V.B. Chumley P.H. Hogg N. Bloodsworth A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Freeman B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15216-15223Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Joseph J. Struck A. Parthasarathy S.

Since ⋅NO can diffuse into the 15-LOX active site, we hypothesized that enzyme-bound lipid-derived radicals are accessible to ⋅NO during turnover.In biological systems, efficient removal of ⋅NO following its synthesis by nitric oxide synthases is critical in maintaining control of vascular tone. While oxyhemoglobin, present in erythrocytes, reacts with and removes ⋅NO in the vascular space (37Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), little is known regarding the processes that remove ⋅NO in the subendothelial compartment. The half-life of ⋅NO in hemoglobin-free cascade bioassays is only 3–5 s (38Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Byrns R.E. Wood K.S. Chaudhri G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 218-226PubMed Google Scholar), far too short to be accounted for by simple autoxidation, suggesting that cell-dependent⋅NO consumption also occurs. Under pathological conditions⋅NO consumption becomes excessive, with complete loss of the pathways dependent upon activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (39Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). One component of the inhibition of the ⋅NO signaling is the reaction of endothelial-derived relaxation factor with superoxide (O⨪2) to yield peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (39Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar, 40Verbeuren T.J. Jordaens F.H. Van Hove C.E. Van Hoydonck A.E. Herman A.G. Eur. J.

Darley-Usmar V. McAdams M. Berrington W.R. Gore J. Thompson J.A. Parks D.A. Tarpey M.M. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8745-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), other unidentified metabolic pathways that contribute to ⋅NO consumption are inferred. Such an alternative are the free radical intermediates populated during the turnover of enzymes mediating electron transfer reactions. During development of diet-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits, impairment of the vascular response to endothelial-derived relaxation factor or ⋅NO is a consistent finding (40Verbeuren T.J.

Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8745-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Since 15-LOX is known to be present in the subendothelial layer in atherosclerotic lesions and ⋅NO can concentrate in lipophilic milieu (33Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), it was of interest to investigate whether reactions of lipid radicals generated by 15-LOX can proceed at a significant enough rate to alter cellular ⋅NO levels and impact on⋅NO-dependent signaling.Herein, the reactions of soybean and mammalian 15-LOX with ⋅NO at concentrations encompassing those found under physiological and pathological conditions were examined. Our results indicate that there are two distinct sites for ⋅NO reaction during 15-LOX catalysis, and that ⋅NO consumption occurs during inhibition of 15-LOX. It was also observed that, during 15-LOX catalysis of lipid oxidation, lipid radical reactions with ⋅NO in turn inhibited⋅NO-mediated activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and the subsequent formation of cGMP. In aggregate, these observations reveal that lipoxygenase reactions with ⋅NO can inhibit both lipoxygenase catalytic activity and ⋅NO-dependent signal transduction.DISCUSSIONThese results show that the vascular signal transduction actions of both ⋅NO and lipoxygenase products can be interdependent, since ⋅NO inhibits rates of 15-LOX product formation and, in turn, 15-LOX catalytic activity consumes ⋅NO and thus impairs guanylate cyclase activation. These findings may in part explain the anti-atherogenic and anti-cell proliferative actions of ⋅NO that have been observed in animal models following l-arginine feeding, administration of ⋅NO synthase inhibitors, or transfection with nitric-oxide synthase (54Lefer A.M. Ma X.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 55Cayatte A.J. Palacino J.J. Horten K. Cohen R.A. Arterioscler.

The experiments reported herein were designed to model mechanisms of ⋅NO interactions with lipoxygenase-mediated lipid oxidation and to reflect conditions that exist in the vascular compartment. For example, the expression of 15-LOX by cells stably transfected with the human 15-LOX gene is approximately the same as mouse peritoneal macrophages (44Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N.

Chem. 1996; 270: 5191-5197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar); thus, the observed cell 15-LOX -dependent rates of⋅NO consumption are well within those to be expected physiologically (∼0.85 nmol min−1 106cells−1; Fig. 1). Maximal rates of NO2−/ NO3− production in activated rat peritoneal macrophages or murine RAW264.7 macrophages are 0.1 and 0.2 nmol min−1 106 cells−1, respectively (58Ishiropooulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 289: 446-451Crossref Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 59Lewis R.S. Tamir S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29350-29355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), much lower than the rates of ⋅NO consumption observed here. Therefore, it would be expected that the range of 15-LOX expression in normal and diseased vasculature would have a significant effect on ⋅NO available for soluble guanylyl cyclase activation and cell-mediated host defenses. This was confirmed by the observation that ⋅NO-activated soluble guanylate cyclase formation of cGMP was profoundly suppressed during the catalytic oxidation of arachidonate by 15-LOX.To define the mechanism(s) of ⋅NO reaction with and consumption by 15-LOX, studies were carried out using purified rabbit reticulocyte and soybean 15-LOX. For both enzymes, reversible inhibition was observed on addition of 1–6 μm⋅NO (Fig. 2). Inhibition coincided with ⋅NO consumption, and activity was recovered once ⋅NO was depleted. For ⋅NO consumption, addition of linoleate but not (13S)-HPODE was required (Fig.4) and ⋅NO consumption was catalytic. These data suggest that an intermediate or product of the dioxygenase cycle react with ⋅NO to inhibit 15-LOX.The 15-LOX intermediates that may react with ⋅NO are shown in Scheme FS1. Since linoleate was required (Fig. 4), the oxidized enzyme (Eox), containing Fe3+, is unlikely be the site of ⋅NO consumption. Another possible reaction site is EredL⋅. However, since ⋅NO had no effect on anaerobic peroxidase activity (Fig. 5), a role for this species in⋅NO consumption is unlikely. In addition, the low concentrations of ⋅NO used in these experiments are unlikely to compete efficiently with O2, initially present at 240 μm, for reaction with L⋅ bound at the active site. Finally, the observation that (13S)-HPODE was the major product indicated that ⋅NO addition occurs after stereospecific O2 insertion has taken place.Native 15-LOX contains reduced iron and is inactive until oxidized by the product, (13S)-HPODE. During dioxygenase turnover, this results in a characteristic lag phase that can be abolished by prior addition of a small amount of product. At high concentrations of⋅NO, a nitrosyl complex forms with the reduced ferrous iron of 15-LOX (29Galpin J.R. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 536: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Salerno J.C. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Nelson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12137-12142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that ⋅NO could compete with (13S)-HPODE for reaction with reduced 15-LOX iron. However, using stopped flow fluorescence, no effect of ⋅NO on either the rate or extent of 15-LOX intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching was found (Fig. 6) (47Egmond M.R. Finazzi-Agrò A. Fasella P.M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 375: 43-49Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 52Finazzi-Agrò A. Avigliano I. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Additionally, native 15-LOX did not consume ⋅NO (Fig. 7) and the time of ⋅NO inhibition was independent of (13S)-HPODE concentration (Fig. 3). It was recently shown and confirmed herein, that ⋅NO prolongs the lag phase of 15-LOX activity (Fig. 4, Ref. 25Weisner R. Rathmann J. Holzhütter H.G. Stöer R. Mäder K. Nolting H. Kühn H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibition of 15-LOX did not require addition of ⋅NO before substrate, since the length of ⋅NO inhibition is the same, whether ⋅NO was added either before or during enzyme turnover (Fig. 3). This shows that⋅NO is not preventing 15-LOX activation and infers that enzyme inhibition results from reaction with a dioxygenase intermediate.15-LOX did not consume ⋅NO in the absence of (13S)-HPODE, thus nitrosyl complexes with reduced 15-LOX metal centers did not form. This is not unexpected, since previous studies determined a dissociation constant (K d = 95 μm at pH 7.0) for the major EPR species formed between⋅NO and soybean 15-LOX, far in excess of ⋅NO concentrations used in this study and those found biologically. A second species was also observed by EPR previous study of⋅NO-15-LOX reactions (31Nelson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12137-12142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since formation of this signal required at least 400 μm⋅NO, it is also a biologically unlikely explanation of 15-LOX inhibition by⋅NO.Two previous reports suggested that high concentrations of ⋅NO could oxidize native 15-LOX, leading to either activation or formation of a species more susceptible to peroxide activation (25Weisner R. Rathmann J. Holzhütter H.G. Stöer R. Mäder K. Nolting H. Kühn H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Galpin J.R. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 536: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In both studies, electron transfer may have occurred following formation of the iron nitrosyl complex, since it was detectable by EPR spectroscopy. Herein, low concentrations of ⋅NO did not activate 15-LOX. The high K d for formation of the EPR-detectable Fe2+-⋅NO species infers that under physiological conditions, where ⋅NO concentrations will be less than 1 μm, both the formation of ferrous-nitrosyl complexes and activation of 15-LOX by ⋅NO is unlikely. During activation by HPODE, consumption of 2 mol of ⋅NO/mol of 15-LOX was observed. Reduction of ⋅NO to NO− by the ferrous iron-derived electron, followed by secondary reactions of NO− that can consume ⋅NO (e.g. HNO + 2⋅NO → N2O + NO2−,k = 109m−1s−1) may explain these observations.Since ⋅NO had no effect on 15-LOX tryptophan fluorescence quenching, ⋅NO uptake during activation is also unlikely to cause enzyme inhibition (Fig. 6). Therefore, ⋅NO must react at an additional site during dioxygenase turnover. The only intermediate that was not excluded experimentally or theoretically is EredLOO⋅. Reaction of ⋅NO with free LOO⋅ in aqueous solution is extremely fast (k = 1–2 × 109m−1s−1; Refs. 15Shen J. Herderick E. Cornhill J.F. Zsigmond E. Kim H.S. Kühn H. Guevara N.V. Chan L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 98: 2201-2208Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Hayashi K. Noguchi N. Niki E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, and 31Nelson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12137-12142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since ⋅NO can diffuse into the active site of LOX, as well as concentrate in lipophilic milieu, a reaction of ⋅NO with EredLOO⋅ is highly plausible.If ⋅NO reacts with EredLOO⋅ to form LOONO, dissociation of this product from the active site would leave reduced enzyme (Ered) that requires reactivation by HPODE for completion of the catalytic cycle (SchemeFS3). Activation of soybean 15-LOX is approximately 20% of the rate of linoleate dioxygenation (60Egmond M.R. Fasella P.M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), while activation of rabbit 15-LOX is 10% of the rate-limiting step of dioxygenase activity (0.59 s−1 versus 6.4 s−1, Ref. 61Ludwig P. Holzhütter H.G. Colosimo A. Silvestrini M.C. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, promoting formation of the inactive enzyme Ered by ⋅NO reaction with EredLOO⋅ will significantly decrease the overall rate of dioxygenase activity and product yield (Scheme FS3).The product of reaction between ⋅NO and LOO⋅, an organic peroxynitrite (LOONO), has at least two possible fates in aqueous conditions. First, it can hydrolyze, forming LOOH and NO2−. Second, it can decompose (t 1/2 = 0.2–0.6 s, Ref. 36Padmaja S. Huie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) to form the caged radicals, [LO⋅⋅NO2]. These either recombine to form LONO2, an alkyl nitrate, or dissociate to free species, which can react with additional molecules of ⋅NO, forming LONO and NO2−, respectively. The relative contribution of each of these pathways to LOONO decomposition is unknown. Since identical amounts of HPODE were formed either in the presence or absence of ⋅NO a"

While screening for molecules involved in the regulation of death receptor signaling, we identified a novel protein, c-E10. c-E10 contains an amino-terminal caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) and shares a sequence homologous with E10, a viral CARD-containing protein that binds to c-E10. In transfection experiments c-E10 oligomerizes, binds to the cytoplasmic portion of TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4) and coprecipitates with TRADD. Expression of c-E10 under the control of a doxycycline-dependent transcriptional transactivator results in NF-κB activation, which is inhibited by dominant negative forms of TRAF2 and NIK kinase. Thus, our results suggest that c-E10 is an adapter protein that activates NF-κB through a molecular pathway involved in death receptor signaling.

Two distinct signaling cascades, leading either to cellular apoptosis or activation of the transcription factors NF-κB, are elicited by these receptors, and both rely on the association of proteins containing conserved domains, including the death domain (3Tartaglia L.A.

FADD, in turn, binds to caspase-8, thereby connecting death receptors to the caspase proteases (2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Present in the cell as proenzymes, these cysteine proteases are rapidly activated by proteolytic cleavage following death receptor stimulation and, once activated, constitute the effector component of the apoptotic machinery (8Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). Under particular circumstances, however, exposure to TNF results in the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP1 through the recruitment of the IKK complex and the JNKs pathway, which mediate the induction of immunoregulatory genes and exert positive effects on cell survival and proliferation (9Liu Z.G.

TRADD is a TNFR-1-associated signal transducer involved in activating both pathways (14Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). This adapter protein, which is recruited to TNFR-1 upon TNF binding, interacts with FADD to initiate the death cascade and engages several proteins such as TRAF1, TRAF2, and RIP that regulate the activation of noncytotoxic pathways (13Natoli G.

Thus, TRADD is capable of transducing signals that either trigger or suppress cell death. Regulation of molecular interactions in close proximity to the death receptor complex is therefore essential in determining whether a cell dies or survives following TNF stimulation. In this study, we present a novel protein, c-E10, that coprecipitates with TRADD and activates NF-κB through a TRAF 2/NIK-dependent pathway. The two-hybrid screening was conducted using the Matchmaker system (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, yeast strain HF7c, expressing a GAL4-DR4 fusion protein, was transformed with a human peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library cloned into the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH). 2 × 106 clones were analyzed. Transformed yeast were selected on SD/agar plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine for 5 days at 30 °C. Selected colonies were blotted onto filter paper, permeabilized in nitrogen liquid, and placed on another filter soaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 37.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Colonies that developed color were re-streaked on selective plates to allow plasmid segregation and tested again for β-galactosidase activity. The liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. The cDNA insert contained in clone T6 was used to screen a human spleen cDNA library (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequence of a phage clone, as well as the cDNA insert of clone T6, was determined on both strands using a Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA insert contained in clone T6 was also used to probe a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The polypeptides RTSSRKRAGKLLDYLQE and FPDGATNNLSRSNSDESNFSEK were used to generate rabbit polyclonal antisera. The whole rabbit serum was affinity purified on CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with the antigenic peptide. Proteic lysates from human tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. The cDNAs encoding for RIP (amino acids 552–671), Tradd (amino acids 104–312) and Flice (amino acids 1–234) were cloned in pCMV-FLAG expression vector (Eastman Kodak). Full-length c-E10, T6, and c-E10 1–127 (amino acids 1–127) were provided with an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope and cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All plasmid constructs were confirmed by partial sequencing and immunoblot analysis. The vectors encoding for TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF6, NIK DN (NIKΔ2101), TRAF2 DN (amino acids 226–501), TRAF6 DN (amino acids 275–522), and IκB DN (pCDNAHAIκBαSer32–36Ala) have been described (13Natoli G.

Recombinant histidine-tagged proteins were made in Escherichia coli BL21 strain using the pET expression system (Novagen) and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and were transfected by calcium phosphate method. HeLa Tet-On (CLONTECH) clones expressing c-E10 and T6 were established and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tet-On clones and HeLa cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Doxycycline and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. The cDNA encoding for v-E10 was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of l-[4,5-3H]leucine with the TNT-coupled lysate system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. 293 cells were transfected for 7 h in 6-well plates with 5 μg of indicated plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation. 16–24 h after transfection, cells from each well were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). For histidine-tagged protein binding, 50 μl of 293 lysate were mixed with 20 μl of the indicated agarose-bound histidine-tagged protein in 1 ml of modified E1A buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Samples were incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C, washed 8 times by pulse centrifugation with 1 ml of modified E1A buffer, and resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer. 5 μl of the reaction were loaded for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. For coprecipitation experiment, 293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors. HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated cDNAs together with 0.2 μg of CMV β-galactosidase (CLONTECH). 24 h after transfection, β-galactosidase activity was visualized by fixing the cells in 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min followed by staining in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm each K3Fe(CN)6 and K4Fe(CN)6-H2O and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside for 1–3 h at 37 °C. The number of live blue cells and blue cells with apoptotic morphology were counted in at least four fields. Cell viability of HeLa Tet-On clones was determined using CellTiter 96 (Promega). To assess NF-κB activation, HeLa Tet-On clones and HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated cDNAs together with pNF-κB-luc (CLONTECH) in 12-well plates. Tet-inducible clones were treated with 1 mm doxycycline for 24 h or left repressed. Cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was determined with luciferase assay system (Promega). A plasmid expressing β-galactosidase was added to the transfection mixture for normalization of the efficiency of transfection. To identify novel proteins involved in death receptor signaling, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with the intracellular portion of DR4 fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. A plasmid library of fusions between the GAL4 transcription activation domain and cDNAs from peripheral blood leukocytes was screened for interaction in the yeast reporter strain HF7c. One library clone (T6), containing an open reading frame coding for a 119-amino acid polypeptide, was identified that specifically interacted with DR4 and with TNFR-1, but not with related family members (Table I).Table IInteraction of c-E10 with DR4 and TNFR-1 in the yeast two-hybridProtein fused to GAL4 domainβ-galactosidase filter assayLiquid assay (Miller units)DNA-bindingActivatingT6White0.04 ± 0.02VectorT6White0.03 ± 0.01pLAM5T6White0.03 ± 0.01DR4T6Blue0.49 ± 0.08DR5T6White0.05 ± 0.03DR3T6White0.04 ± 0.02TNFR-1T6Blue0.23 ± 0.03FasT6White0.06 ± 0.02Yeast HF7c was transformed with clone T6 fused to GAL4-activating domain together with the indicated cDNAs fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain.

The tissue distribution of clone T6 was examined by Northern blot analysis, and a single ∼3-kilobase transcript was detected in all tissues analyzed (Fig. 1 A). The full-length cDNA, encoding for a 233-amino acidic residue protein, was isolated from a spleen cDNA library (Fig.1 B). A FASTA search showed that this protein shares significant homology with E10, a equine herpesvirus 2 protein of unknown function (19Telford E.A. Watson M.S. Aird H.C. Perry J. Davison A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), therefore we named itcellular-E10 (c-E10) and refer to the viral protein as v-E10. v-E10 contains an amino-terminal CARD motif (20Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), which is conserved in c-E10 (Fig. 1 C). The CARD motif was originally described as a conserved sequence present in some caspases and in several proteins involved in regulation of apoptosis (20Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The recently determined solution structure of the CARD domain (21Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) revealed that it is arranged in a topology similar to the death domain (22Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and, in fact, it contains sequence motifs suggestive of the death domain (20Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The homology between c-E10 and RAIDD, another CARD-containing protein (23Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), is also significant. Two rabbit antisera were raised against polypeptides contained in the c-E10 amino acidic sequence. Immunoblot analysis performed on cell lysates from several human tissues indicates that most of endogenous c-E10 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa, and a fraction of the protein migrates with a molecular mass of 38 kDa (Fig.1 D). Both signals of 38 and 48 kDa were specific because the immunoreactivity was abolished by competition with the corresponding immunogenic peptide (data not shown). Next, c-E10 interactions were analyzed by cotransfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 2 A, whereas the association of c-E10 with DR4 is barely detectable in mammalian cells, full-length c-E10, but not the truncated proteins encoded by T6 and c-E10 1–127, clearly coprecititates with TRADD. In addition, c-E10 oligomerizes via an omophilic association of its CARD region. Conversely, TNFR-1 and proteins involved in TNFR-1 signaling, including TRAF-1, -2, -6, and RIP, did not associate with c-E10 in vivo. The discrepancy of this biochemical data with the two-hybrid result (Table I) may be because of the different sensitivity of the experimental systems. We also examined the interaction of several tagged proteins with immobilized v-E10. Full-length c-E10, but not clone T6, binds to v-E10, suggesting that the CARD regions are required for this interaction (Fig. 2 B). Likewise, 35S-labeled v-E10 binds to c-E10 but not to clone T6 (Fig. 2 C). Given the involvement of CARD-containing molecules in the induction of apoptosis in mammalian cells, we first tested whether overexpression of c-E10 is by itself sufficient in triggering the cell death pathway. To this end, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with c-E10 and scored for apoptotic morphology. As shown in Fig.3 A, overexpression of c-E10 only weakly induces cell death, as compared with overexpression of FADD or RIP, which both result in massive cell death. To better characterize the function of c-E10 in the cell death cascade, we established HeLa cell clones expressing either c-E10 or T6 cDNA under the control of a doxycycline-dependent transcriptional transactivator (24Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Clones showing the highest induction with the lowest background expression were chosen for experimental analysis (Fig. 3 B). In these HeLa clones, the induction of either c-E10 or T6 expression does not result in cell death (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). Also, as shown in Fig. 3 C, expression of neither c-E10 nor T6 polypeptide has a marked effect on apoptosis induced by TNF; similar results were obtained when cell death was evoked by exposure to Fas or TRAIL (data not shown). These results suggest that the efficacy of c-E10 in inducing apoptosis might depend on the level of expression of the protein. To examine a possible role for c-E10 in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the inducible clones were transfected with a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene, and the cells were left repressed or treated with doxycycline to induce c-E10 expression. As shown in Fig. 4, induction of c-E10 expression results in NF-κB activation. In this experimental system, the polypeptide encoded by clone T6 only partially triggers that response. Likewise, activation of NF-κB was readily observed in 293 and Hela cells transiently transfected with c-E10 (Fig.4 B). Expression of c-E10 1–127, which contains the CARD, resulted in a similar or even higher activating response. This result, in light of the nonassociation of c-E10 1–127 with TRADD (Fig.2 A), suggests that c-E10 acts downstream TRADD and that the CARD domain is itself able to recruit downstream effectors leading to NF-κB activation. Thus, TRADD/c-E10 interaction explains only in part the activation of NF-κB mediated by c-E10. Because NF-κB activation by death receptors is in part mediated by the TRAF/NIK pathway, we tested whether dominant negative forms of these proteins inhibited c-E10-dependent NF-κB activation (Fig. 4). As expected, a dominant negative form of IκB efficiently prevents NF-κB activation when coexpressed together with c-E10. Dominant negative versions of TRAF2, but not TRAF6, had the same inhibitory effect. Furthermore, NF-κB activity by c-E10 is strongly inhibited by NIK DN and only partially by ΔMEKK K-M, the dominant negative form of the other immediate upstream activatory kinase of the IKK complex (25Nemoto S. Di Donato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that activation of NF-κB induced by c-E10 is TRAF2/NIK-dependent. The capacity to activate the transcription factor NF-κB is shared by a number of receptors related to TNFR-1, such as Wsl/DR3/Apo-3/TRAMP/LARD (26Kitson J. Raven T. Jiang Y.P. Goeddel D.V. Giles K.M.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic activities of these receptors are modulated by a regulated recruitment of a number of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to the receptor complex. Activation of NF-κB is mediated by association of TRADD with the serine/threonine kinase RIP and TRAF-2 (15Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Transfection experiments have in fact shown that overexpression of TRAF-2 is in itself sufficient to induce NF-κB activation (33Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), and TNFR-1-induced NF-κB activation is reduced and delayed in TRAF-2-deficient mice (34Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D.

In this study, we present a novel CARD-containing protein that, upon overexpression, induces activation of NF-κB via a TRAF-2/NIK-dependent pathway. TRADD-TRAF-2 interactions are also involved in the activation of JNK (9Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Other CARD-containing proteins have been shown to be involved in the activation of NF-κB: RIP2/CARDIAK/RICK, a CARD-containing protein kinase related to RIP, also signals NF-κB activation (36McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 38Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Nunez G. J. Biol.

However, whereas RIP2 interacts with specific members of the TRAF family, c-E10 does not directly recruit TRAFs protein, and its association with TRADD suggests that c-E10 functions upstream of TRAF-2. Despite the fact that a number of proteins containing the CARD motif operate in apoptotic pathways by modulating caspase activity (36McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,37Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), our results indicate that c-E10 only weakly triggers the cell death cascade and, although cloned for this ability to interact with DR4, it does not interfere with FAS, DR4, and TNFR1 induced apoptosis. Thus, the identification of c-E10 provides additional evidence that CARD-containing proteins not only modulate apoptosis by regulating caspase activity but may also be critical mediators of NF-κB activation response. While this work was in preparation, Willis et al. (40Willis T.G. Jadayel D.M. Du M.Q. Peng H. Perry A.R. Abdul-Rauf M. Price H. Karran L. Majekodunmi O. Wlodarska I. Pan L. Crook T. Hamoudi R. Isaacson P.G. Dyer M.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) reported that c-E10, which they named bcl10, is often mutated in MALT lymphomas and in a number of other tumor types, suggesting that this protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies. Particularly, they found that the most recurrent mutations in c-E10 were nucleotidic insertions or deletions distal to the CARD, which resulted in truncated c-E10 protein lacking the carboxyl-terminal domain but still effective in activating NF-κB. In our experiments, the carboxyl-terminal domain of c-E10 is responsible for the binding to DR4 in yeast. The mechanism involving apoptosis induced by DR4 and its ligand TRAIL has recently raised a great deal of attention, because whereas normal cells are resistant, tumoral cells are sensitive to TRAIL-induced cell death (41Wiley S.R.

Therefore, these molecules are extremely interesting for their potential application in cancer therapy and, in fact, repeated treatments with TRAIL effectively suppressed tumor growth in vivo without detectable damage for normal tissues (45Walczak H.

Thus, the participation of c-E10 in signaling pathways shared by death receptors offers an attractive perspective in explaining how mutations in c-E10 result in cellular transformation.

We have studied the interaction of BiP, an Hsp70 family member in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, with the J-domain of Sec63p, a component of the Sec complex involved in post-translational protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In a real-time solid phase binding assay, BiP binds to the immobilized Sec complex or to a fusion protein of the J-domain and glutathione S-transferase in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis. In the final complex, BiP is bound in the ADP form with its peptide binding pocket occupied. An intact peptide binding pocket is required for this interaction. Our experiments suggest that the activation of BiP by the J-domain involves a transient contact between these components, and that in the absence of physiological substrates, J-activated BiP binds even to the J-proteins themselves.

Hsp70s exist in most cellular compartments. They participate in many different processes, including protein folding, assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, and transport of proteins across membranes (for review, see Refs. 1Georgopoulos C.

Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Hsp70s are able to perform these apparently different tasks because of their ability to reversibly bind polypeptides. Hsp70s bind peptides through a peptide binding pocket which is regulated by the NH2-terminal ATPase domain (for review, see Ref. 4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). With ATP bound to the ATPase domain, the peptide binding pocket is open and peptides can rapidly bind and dissociate. In the presence of ADP, the pocket is closed and covered by a lid domain (5Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), and association and dissociation of peptides are much slower (6Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L.

Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).To bind substrates under physiological conditions Hsp70s cooperate with their co-factors, the J-proteins (for review, see Ref. 8Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). J-proteins are a ubiquitous family defined by a conserved domain of about 70 amino acids, the J-domain. In addition, they contain other, nonconserved domains which are responsible for association of the J-proteins with different polypeptide substrates. It is believed that the J-domain interacts with Hsp70 molecules and stimulates their ATPase activity (9Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The ensuing rapid closure of the peptide binding pocket would trap the substrate within the closed pocket of the ADP form of the Hsp70 molecule. The J-domain would thus stimulate peptide binding by Hsp70s (10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Release of the bound Hsp70 molecule from the peptide substrate would occur when exchange of ADP for ATP re-opens the peptide binding pocket (11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Under equilibrium conditions, an isolated Hsp70 has a preference for peptide sequences of at least seven mostly hydrophobic amino acids (12Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 13Blond-Elguindi S. Cwiria S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Activation by the J-domain causes a steady-state situation which allows an Hsp70 to bind even polar peptides (11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Two models have been proposed for how the J-domain interacts with an Hsp70. In one model, the ATP form of the Hsp70 would bind to the J-domain, the nucleotide would be hydrolyzed, and the Hsp70 would be stably bound in its ADP form to the J-domain. This would represent an activated form of the Hsp70 which could subsequently be transferred to a peptide substrate (15Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J.

This mechanism is supported by experiments in which eukaryotic Hsp70s were found to be bound in their ADP form to fusion proteins of a J-domain to glutathioneS-transferase (GST-J) 1The abbreviations GSTglutathioneS-transferaseGST-Jfusion protein containing the J-domain and GSTGSHglutathioneSPRsurface plasmon resonanceRUresponse unitsppαFpre-pro-α-factorEDCN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride 1The abbreviations GSTglutathioneS-transferaseGST-Jfusion protein containing the J-domain and GSTGSHglutathioneSPRsurface plasmon resonanceRUresponse unitsppαFpre-pro-α-factorEDCN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride(16Holstein S.E.H.

Cell Biol. 1997; 173: 1483-1493Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, it was not demonstrated that the GST-J·Hsp70·ADP complex represented a precursor for the Hsp70-peptide substrate interaction. In an alternative model, the interaction of the Hsp70 with the J-domain would be extremely transient, even in the absence of a peptide substrate (see Ref. 4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, and references therein). In the presence of a substrate, the Hsp70 would immediately be transferred from the J-domain to the peptide, resulting in a stable peptide·Hsp70·ADP complex. This view is supported by experiments involving DnaK, the bacterial Hsp70, and its J-partner DnaJ (10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is possible that the different results reflect fundamental differences between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic Hsp70 systems.A well studied system in which an Hsp70 family member plays an essential role is the post-translational transport of proteins across the membrane of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (for review, see Refs.18Corsi A.K.

Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The lumenal Hsp70 family member BiP (Kar2p) is required to transport proteins through a channel in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane formed by the Sec complex (20Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J.

Cell. 1993; 4: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Upon interaction with the J-domain of Sec63p, BiP binds to the translocation substrate and prevents its backwards movement through the channel, thus acting as a molecular ratchet. 2Matlack, K. E. S., Misselwitz, B., Plath, K., and Rapoport, T. A. (1999) Cell 97, 553–564 2Matlack, K. E. S., Misselwitz, B., Plath, K., and Rapoport, T. A. (1999) Cell 97, 553–564 Whether BiP also actively “pulls” on the substrate is unclear (26Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have investigated the binding of yeast BiP to GST-J and to the Sec complex. We demonstrate that, in the absence of added peptides, BiP binds to GST-J as if it was a peptide substrate. BiP appears to interact with the J-domain only very transiently, but this brief interaction is sufficient to induce nucleotide hydrolysis and activate BiP for peptide binding. Thus, BiP does not “wait” for the substrate while bound to the J-domain. Our data indicate that the transient nature of the Hsp70-J interaction is conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.DISCUSSIONOur experiments discriminate between two models proposed for the interaction of an Hsp70 molecule with its J-protein partner. Our data are inconsistent with a model in which, in the absence of a substrate, Hsp70 forms an activated, stable J·Hsp70·ADP complex, from which the bound Hsp70 is subsequently transferred to a peptide (15Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J.

Rather, they suggest that Hsp70 interacts only very transiently with the J-domain and is immediately transferred to a peptide substrate, be it the natural substrate or the J-protein itself (4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although we confirm the generation of a stable J-protein·Hsp70·ADP complex in an ATP-dependent reaction, we demonstrate that the Hsp70 is bound to the J-protein as if it were a peptide substrate. The complex therefore represents the final, rather than an intermediate, state of the peptide binding reaction.The following observations support our conclusion. 1) A hydrophobic peptide in solution competes with GST-J for the formation of the GST-J·BiP·ADP complex. The peptide does not accelerate the dissociation of BiP from GST-J, nor does it prevent the interaction of GST-J with BiP that is required for ATPase stimulation. We therefore conclude that the peptide exerts its inhibitory effect by occupying the same peptide-binding domain to which GST-J is ultimately bound. In addition, in agreement with other results (4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), these data show that peptide and J-domain interact with BiP at different sites. 2) Since the GST-J·BiP·ADP complex binds a hydrophobic peptide much more weakly than BiP·ADP, GST-J must block BiP's peptide binding pocket. 3) The fact that two BiP molecules are bound per GST-J molecule and the biphasic dissociation kinetics argue against the existence of a stable, defined J-domain-BiP interaction. Rather, these data indicate that BiP molecules are bound to at least two distinct regions of GST-J. 4) The kinetics of dissociation of BiP from GST-J resembles that of BiP from peptide substrates. In both cases dissociation is fast in ATP and slow in ADP, as expected from open and closed peptide binding pockets, respectively (7Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 5) Binding of BiP to peptide when co-immobilized with the J-domain (11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) is strikingly similar to BiP's interaction with immobilized GST-J. The kinetics of association and dissociation are very similar, ATP hydrolysis is required for the binding reaction, and the final complex contains ADP. We therefore conclude that formation of the GST-J·BiP·ADP complex involves the activation of BiP by the J-domain. 6) BiP mutants whose peptide binding activity is altered by point mutations or deletions fail to bind GST-J. 7) Similarly to the results with GST-J, BiP can be transferred in a J-domain- and ATP-dependent manner to the Sec complex itself. Limited availability of the purified Sec complex and its dissociation from the surface during subsequent SPR experiments have made it impossible to demonstrate directly that the peptide binding pocket of BiP is involved in this interaction. However, the analogy between GST-J and the Sec complex strongly suggests that BiP binds both in an identical manner.Our results suggest that a J-domain·BiP·ATP complex, which is too short-lived to be detected in conventional binding experiments, is transiently formed. The short half-life is caused by the J-protein inducing rapid ATP hydrolysis by BiP. Upon ATP hydrolysis, BiP binds to peptides in close proximity to the J-domain (11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The final complex contains BiP, ADP, and peptide, but lacks the J-domain. BiP is rather promiscuous following J-activation and can therefore bind to essentially any substrate (11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), including polypeptide parts of the J-protein itself. The peptide motifs in the J-proteins to which BiP is bound are unknown, but they are probably outside the J-domain.Our data argue against a previously proposed model in which BiP in its ADP form would wait for the translocation substrate while bound to the J-domain at the lumenal end of the channel (15Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although we have confirmed that BiP associates with the Sec complex or the Sec62/63p subcomplex in a J- and ATP-dependent manner, this complex is likely not a precursor for peptide interaction. Rather, in the absence of a translocation substrate, BiP appears to bind to polypeptide segments of the Sec complex, as observed with the GST-J protein.During translocation, the translocating polypeptide would emerge from the channel close to the J-domain of Sec63p and J-activated BiP would be transferred to the substrate. Once bound, BiP would prevent backwards movements of the polypeptide chain, thus acting as a molecular ratchet.2 BiP was also proposed to pull on the translocation substrate (26Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, this would require a conformational change of BiP while bound simultaneously to the J-domain and the polypeptide substrate, which seems unlikely given the transient nature of the BiP-J interaction. Simultaneous binding is also rendered unlikely by our finding that more than one BiP molecule could bind to GST-J. Moreover, since the addition of peptide does not stimulate the dissociation of BiP from its complex with GST-J, a complex containing BiP, J-domain, and translocation substrate would be stable, preventing any movement of the polypeptide chain.J-activated binding of BiP to polypeptide segments of the Sec complex in the absence of a translocation substrate may have physiological significance. Mammalian BiP was proposed to seal the lumenal end of the channel to small ions (40Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In an analogous manner, BiP may serve to seal the channel in the post-translational pathway. J-activated BiP would continuously associate with and dissociate from the Sec complex, providing a dynamic lid for the channel, and would switch to binding of a translocation substrate as soon as it emerges from the lumenal end of the channel. “Futile” ATP hydrolysis would not be excessively high because the steady state ATPase activity is only stimulated 5-fold by the J-protein. On the other hand, it is possible that the J-domain is only exposed for BiP interaction once a translocation substrate is bound to the channel.Our results may also have relevance for studies on the import of proteins into mitochondria (26Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 41Schneider H.C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W.

There, a stable complex of mitochondrial Hsp70 with its partner protein of the inner membrane, Tim44p, is formed following ATP hydrolysis (45Schneider H.-C. Westermann B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5796-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In light of our results, it appears questionable whether it represents a precursor for substrate binding.A dimeric complex between Hsp70 and peptide appears to be the general end product in many Hsp70 systems, such as the auxilin-Hsc70 system responsible for the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (16Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 46Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that such complexes only form efficiently in the presence of a J-domain, despite the presence of high concentrations of Hsp70s in the cell. Previously it has been observed that in the presence of ATP the yeast J-protein Ydj1p releases an unfolded protein from the cytosolic Hsp70 homolog Ssa1p (47Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of our data it seems possible that, under these conditions, Ydj1p competes with the unfolded protein for binding of activated Ssa1p, thus apparently stimulating peptide dissociation.In the bacterial system a transient interaction between DnaK and the J-domain of DnaJ has been demonstrated (4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 6224-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The J-domain alone did not stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK, in contrast to either the J-domain plus a following domain (G/F-domain) (49Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the full-length DnaJ, or the J-domain plus a separately added hydrophobic peptide (10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that with the longer J-protein constructs DnaK is targeted to segments COOH-terminal of the J-domain (10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The ATP-dependent formation of a complex between DnaK and DnaJ (33Suh W.C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) is thus likely to be similar to that between GST-J and BiP, with a peptide segment occupying the peptide-binding domain of the Hsp70. Recently, the binding site for the J-domain has been mapped to a region in the ATPase domain of DnaK (33Suh W.C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 15223-15228Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 35Gaessler C.S. Buchberger A. Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Schroeder H. Valencia A. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 15229-15234Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, using NMR a nucleotide-independent interaction between the J-domain of DnaJ and the ATPase domain of DnaK was found (39Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), presumably reflecting the transient interaction that escapes detection in other experiments. Taken together, it appears that the interaction between a J-domain and Hsp70 is highly conserved in evolution. Hsp70s exist in most cellular compartments. They participate in many different processes, including protein folding, assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, and transport of proteins across membranes (for review, see Refs. 1Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 2Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.

Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Hsp70s are able to perform these apparently different tasks because of their ability to reversibly bind polypeptides. Hsp70s bind peptides through a peptide binding pocket which is regulated by the NH2-terminal ATPase domain (for review, see Ref. 4Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). With ATP bound to the ATPase domain, the peptide binding pocket is open and peptides can rapidly bind and dissociate. In the presence of ADP, the pocket is closed and covered by a lid domain (5Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), and association and dissociation of peptides are much slower (6Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). To bind substrates under physiological conditions Hsp70s cooperate with their co-factors, the J-proteins (for review, see Ref. 8Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). J-proteins are a ubiquitous family defined by a conserved domain of about 70 amino acids, the J-domain. In addition, they contain other, nonconserved domains which are responsible for association of the J-proteins with different polypeptide substrates. It is believed that the J-domain interacts with Hsp70 molecules and stimulates their ATPase activity (9Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The ensuing rapid closure of the peptide binding pocket would trap the substrate within the closed pocket of the ADP form of the Hsp70 molecule. The J-domain would thus stimulate peptide binding by Hsp70s (10Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Release of the bound Hsp70 molecule from the peptide substrate would occur when exchange of ADP for ATP re-opens the peptide binding pocket (11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Under equilibrium conditions, an isolated Hsp70 has a preference for peptide sequences of at least seven mostly hydrophobic amino acids (12Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 13Blond-Elguindi S. Cwiria S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Activation by the J-domain causes a steady-state situation which allows an Hsp70 to bind even polar peptides (11Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed for how the J-domain interacts with an Hsp70. In one model, the ATP form of the Hsp70 would bind to the J-domain, the nucleotide would be hydrolyzed, and the Hsp70 would be stably bound in its ADP form to the J-domain. This would represent an activated form of the Hsp70 which could subsequently be transferred to a peptide substrate (15Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J.

This mechanism is supported by experiments in which eukaryotic Hsp70s were found to be bound in their ADP form to fusion proteins of a J-domain to glutathioneS-transferase (GST-J) 1The abbreviations GSTglutathioneS-transferaseGST-Jfusion protein containing the J-domain and GSTGSHglutathioneSPRsurface plasmon resonanceRUresponse unitsppαFpre-pro-α-factorEDCN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride 1The abbreviations GSTglutathioneS-transferaseGST-Jfusion protein containing the J-domain and GSTGSHglutathio"
https://openalex.org/W2029250417,"Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by a variety of stimuli is critical for regulation of many cellular processes including apoptosis. The major inducible heat shock protein Hsp72 has previously been demonstrated to inhibit activation of JNK in cells exposed to heat shock and other protein-damaging agents, thus suppressing apoptosis. Hsp72 can protect proteins from stress-induced damage. To test if this protective function of Hsp72 is involved in JNK suppression, we investigated whether Hsp72 can avert activation of JNK by stimuli that do not cause protein damage. We show that Hsp72 suppresses activation of JNK induced by non-protein-damaging stimuli, interleukin-1 and UV irradiation, as well as by constitutively active components of the JNK signaling cascade Cdc42 and MEKK1. Furthermore, Hsp72 strongly reduced activation of JNK by phosphatase inhibitors. We also demonstrate that an Hsp72 mutant that lacks the ATPase domain is still capable of JNK suppression, thus indicating that the protein refolding activity of Hsp72 is not critical for inhibition of JNK activation. Taken together these data suggest that Hsp72 plays a regulatory role in JNK signaling and that the function of Hsp72 in protein protection or refolding is not involved in JNK regulation.

The pathway of JNK activation by UV and cytokines involves activation of small GTP-binding proteins including Cdc42, Rac, and Ras (11Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) that phosphorylates and activates dual specificity kinase SEK1 (14Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) which, in turn, phosphorylates threonine and tyrosine residues in JNK (15Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), resulting in its activation (16Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T.

In contrast, activation of JNK by heat shock and certain other stressful agents proceeds via a distinct pathway that involves inhibition of a putative JNK phosphatase (17Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).Previously we reported that in cells with elevated levels of the major heat shock protein, Hsp72, activation of JNK by heat shock and ethanol is strongly inhibited (10Meriin A.

There are two alternative hypotheses that explain the Hsp72-mediated suppression of JNK activation by protein-damaging stresses. First, Hsp72, acting as a chaperone, prevents damage or promotes refolding of a critical JNK regulator that is inactivated upon protein-damaging treatments. The alternative hypothesis is that Hsp72 has a special regulatory function in the JNK signaling pathway. To distinguish between these possibilities, we addressed the question of whether Hsp72 can suppress activation of JNK by stimuli that do not cause protein damage. We also investigated whether suppression of JNK activation requires the ATPase activity of Hsp72, which is essential for its protein refolding function. In these experiments we employed a C-terminal fragment of Hsp72, which retains the capability to associate with unfolded proteins but cannot dissociate from such complexes due to the lack of the ATPase domain.DISCUSSIONPreviously we have demonstrated that the heat shock protein Hsp72 at elevated levels suppresses activation of the stress kinase JNK by heat shock and ethanol, treatments known to cause protein damage (18Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Rits S. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18033-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). There are two possible interpretations of these data: first, Hsp72 protects or promotes refolding of a negative regulator of the JNK-signaling pathway damaged by stress, thus reducing the JNK-activating signal; second, that Hsp72 plays a regulatory role in the JNK signaling. The critical test of these alternatives was to study whether Hsp72 is able to suppress JNK activation by stimuli that do not cause protein damage. Here we have observed that elevated levels of either recombinant Hsp72 or endogenous Hsp72 after mild heat pretreatment of cells suppress JNK activation by IL-1 or UV irradiation. Hsp72 also suppresses activation of JNK by constitutively active forms of either Cdc42 or MEKK1. Moreover, Hsp72 strongly reduces activation of JNK induced by phosphatase inhibitors. Since neither of these stimuli cause significant protein damage, the function of Hsp72 in JNK suppression seems to be unrelated to its role in the protection of proteins from damage.We also demonstrate here that deletion of the ATPase domain of Hsp72 does not prevent it from suppressing JNK when induced by constitutively active mutant forms of either MEKK1 or Cdc42. These data indicate that ATPase activity of Hsp72, which is critical for its role in protein refolding, is dispensable for Hsp72-mediated inhibition of JNK. Furthermore, since the peptide binding domain is intact in CTF, this fragment is able to form complexes with target proteins suggesting that association of Hsp72 with a component of the JNK-signaling pathway is critical for JNK regulation, whereas ATP-dependent dissociation of such complex is unnecessary. Taken together these data suggest that Hsp72 is implicated in the regulation of JNK signaling. Analogously, the close homologue of Hsp72, Hsc73, plays a purely regulatory role in the repression of the heat shock transcription factor HSF1 (30Voellmy R. Feige U. Morimoto I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1996: 121-137Crossref Google Scholar, 31Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).How does Hsp72 regulate JNK signaling? In related work we have found that activation of JNK by protein-damaging stresses proceeds via inhibition of JNK phosphatase (17Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that Hsp72 suppresses JNK activation induced by protein-damaging agents via acceleration of JNK dephosphorylation (see Fig.7) (17Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The fact that Hsp72, while suppressing activation of JNK induced by either UV irradiation or MEKK1Δ, fails to suppress activation of SEK1 by these agents (Figs.2 B and 4 C) suggests that Hsp72 works in the pathway downstream of SEK1. This is consistent with a role of Hsp72 in up-regulation of JNK dephosphorylation. (Technically, it was not feasible to test this possibility in direct experiments since the rate of JNK dephosphorylation in UV-irradiated and IL-1-treated cells is high and beyond the resolution of the experiment.) As with Hsp72, it is likely that CTF reduces JNK activation by Cdc42V12 and MEKK1Δ by accelerating JNK phosphatase.Data presented here indicate that expression of Hsp72 controls activation of JNK by a wide variety of stimuli that do not depend on protein damage. Since JNK is critical for apoptosis induced by certain DNA-damaging agents and UV irradiation (6Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar), Hsp72-mediated suppression of JNK activation may explain the long known phenomenon of the resistance of cells to various drugs, which is acquired after mild heat pretreatment of cells (33Ciocca D.R.

Indeed, exposure to mild heat shock protects cells from adriamycin (doxorubicin) (33Ciocca D.R. Fuqua S.A. Lock-Lim S. Toft D.O. Welch W.J. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3648-3654PubMed Google Scholar) and etoposide (35Samali A. Cotter T.G. Exp.

Dermatol. 1995; 105: 160-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on our new findings, we suggest that Hsp72 induced by mild heat shock suppresses activation of JNK by these agents, which ultimately leads to inhibition of apoptosis and enhances cell survival (although it should be noted that Hsp72 may affect apoptotic pathway downstream of JNK as well (38Jaattela M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar)). Therefore, our findings provide evidence for a general role of Hsp72 in control of stress kinases. Mammalian cells respond to various environmental stimuli, such as UV irradiation heat shock, and cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor and IL-1 1The abbreviations IL-1interleukin 1JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCTFC-terminal fragment of Hsp72MEKK1mitogen-activated extracellular regulated kinase kinaseHAhemagglutininGSTglutathioneS-transferase 1The abbreviations IL-1interleukin 1JNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCTFC-terminal fragment of Hsp72MEKK1mitogen-activated extracellular regulated kinase kinaseHAhemagglutininGSTglutathioneS-transferase) by activating the stress kinases JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 (1Kyriakis J.M.

These protein kinases are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, inflammation, immune responses, and other processes (2Karin M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol.

The pathway of JNK activation by UV and cytokines involves activation of small GTP-binding proteins including Cdc42, Rac, and Ras (11Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, activation of JNK by heat shock and certain other stressful agents proceeds via a distinct pathway that involves inhibition of a putative JNK phosphatase (17Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A.

Previously we reported that in cells with elevated levels of the major heat shock protein, Hsp72, activation of JNK by heat shock and ethanol is strongly inhibited (10Meriin A. Gabai V. Yaglom J.

There are two alternative hypotheses that explain the Hsp72-mediated suppression of JNK activation by protein-damaging stresses. First, Hsp72, acting as a chaperone, prevents damage or promotes refolding of a critical JNK regulator that is inactivated upon protein-damaging treatments. The alternative hypothesis is that Hsp72 has a special regulatory function in the JNK signaling pathway. To distinguish between these possibilities, we addressed the question of whether Hsp72 can suppress activation of JNK by stimuli that do not cause protein damage.

Based on our new findings, we suggest that Hsp72 induced by mild heat shock suppresses activation of JNK by these agents, which ultimately leads to inhibition of apoptosis and enhances cell survival (although it should be noted that Hsp72 may affect apoptotic pathway downstream of JNK as well (38Jaattela M.

The two SH3 domains of Grb2 bind to proline-rich residues near the C terminus of Sos, a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Upon stimulation with growth factors, Grb2 binds the autophosphorylated tail of growth factor receptors through its SH2 domain. This leads to translocation of Sos to the plasma membrane where Ras is located, thus increasing the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras (5Chardin P. Camonis J. Gale W.L. Van Alest L. Schlessinger J.

The EGF-mediated JNK activation is thought to be mediated by the small G proteins Ras and Rac as well as through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Indeed, it has been shown that EGF-induced JNK activation can be inhibited by dominant negative Ras (RasN17), dominant negative Rac1 (Rac1N17), and a dominant negative form of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (14Coso O.A.

Shc becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation with a number of growth factors including EGF (18Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F.

When the EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Shc, binding of its PTB domain to the autophosphorylated EGFR appears to play a key role for efficient phosphorylation of Shc (20Bazter A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bazter A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

Then, tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc forms a complex with Grb2-Sos at the phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Tyr239, Tyr240, and Tyr317) via the SH2 domain of Grb2 (24Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G.

Thus, EGFR has two potential routes to activate Ras; one is through the direct binding of the Grb2-Sos complex to the autophosphorylated EGFR at Tyr1068 (7Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J.

However, the relative contribution of these two routes to EGF-mediated Ras activation in vivo still remains unresolved. By utilizing Grb2 and Shc knock-out chicken DT40 B cell lines, we now provide genetic evidence for the two distinct functions of Grb2 and Shc. Grb2 is required for EGF-mediated ERK activation, whereas the JNK activation is dependent on Shc. Wild-type and its derivative mutant DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Various DT40 mutant cells (Grb2-negative, Shc-negative, DT40 expressing RasN17, and DT40 expressing Myc-tagged Rac1N17) have been described already (27Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Human EGFR cDNA was transfected by electroporation (550 V, 25 microfarad) and selected in the presence of 1.7 mg/ml of hygromycin (Wako Pure Chemical). Expression of the transfected EGFR was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Mouse EGF (TOYOBO) was used for the stimulation of human EGFR (19Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Parental chicken DT40 cells did not respond to mouse EGF, judged by activation of ERK2 and JNK. The anti-ERK2 Ab, anti-JNK1 Ab, anti-Myc Ab, and anti-Ras Ab were purchased as previously (27Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The following Abs were purchased: anti-human EGFR from Amersham; anti-Grb2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-Shc and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) from Upstate Biotechnology. Cell surface expression of EGFR was analyzed by FACScan (Becton-Dickinson & Co., Mountain View, CA) using anti-human EGFR mAb and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Cappel). DT40 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, and 2 μg/μl aprotinin). Precleared lysates were sequentially incubated with Abs and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or protein A-agarose (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by appropriate Abs and ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DT40 cells were lysed in 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm NaF, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 10 μg/μl aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. Cleared lysates were precipitated with GST or GST-SH2 (Grb2 SH2 domain: amino acid 50–161 of human Grb2 fused to GST) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl of packed beads, 20 μg of protein). Washed precipitates were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to Western blotting analysis. The assay conditions were described previously (27Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2–5 × 106) stimulated with EGF were lysed in lysis buffer. Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated by 1 μg of anti-ERK2 Ab or 1 μg of anti-JNK1 Ab, followed by incubating with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose. No cross-reactivity of these two Abs was already demonstrated (27Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The ERK2 Ab does not recognize JNK and p38. Similarly, the JNK Ab does not recognize ERK2 and p38. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with washing buffer. Immunoprecipitates were divided, and half of them were used for Western blotting analysis. The remaining half were washed once with kinase assay buffer and resuspended in kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (>3,000 Ci/mmol; NENTM) and 5 μm cold ATP. GST-Elk or GST-c-Jun fusion protein (5 μg each) was added as a substrate for ERK2 or JNK1, respectively. After 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Phosphorylation of the fusion protein bands was quantified using a phosphoimager (Fuji BAS 2,000). Bacterially expressed GST-RBD (Ras-binding domain: amino acid 1–149 of human cRaf-1 fused to GST) pre-bounded glutathione-Sepharose beads (15 μl of packed beads, 20 μg of protein) were prepared as described (28Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Human H-Ras cDNA was transfected into wild-type, Grb2-deficient, and Shc-deficient DT40 cells. Wild-type and mutant cells expressing similar levels of Ras were selected and used for this assay. Stimulated cell lysates in Mg2+-containing lysis buffer (28Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) were incubated with the beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to Western blotting analysis with anti-Ras Ab (Transduction Laboratories). To examine the necessity or redundancy of Grb2 and Shc in ERK and JNK activation upon EGF stimulation, we took a genetic strategy. Human EGFR was transfected into wild-type, Grb2-deficient, and Shc-deficient chicken DT40 cells to obtain stable transformants. Clones expressing similar levels of EGFR in wild-type and these deficient DT40 cells, assessed by flow cytometric analysis using anti-human EGFR mAb, were selected (Fig.1) and further characterized. EGF stimulated the EGFR autophosphorylation, and its phosphorylation extent in Grb2- or Shc-deficient DT40 cells was almost the same as that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1). These observations suggest that EGFR kinase activity is not affected by loss of Grb2 or Shc. We next examined the capacity of EGFR to stimulate phosphorylation of cellular proteins in wild-type, Grb2-deficient, and Shc-deficient cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, comparison of the overall tyrosine phosphorylation between wild-type and Shc-deficient DT40 cells did not exhibit significant changes, except that the band corresponding to Shc itself was absent in the mutant cells. Although the overall tyrosine phosphorylation pattern upon EGF stimulation was not significantly affected by loss of Grb2, phosphorylation of some proteins (indicated by arrows) was inhibited in the mutant cells. Moreover, the tyrosine phosphorylation extent of Shc was decreased by loss of Grb2 (Fig. 2, A andB). These observations suggest that Grb2 modulates tyrosine phosphorylation on some of the cellular substrates, one of which is Shc. To formally demonstrate that Grb2 associates with phosphorylated EGFR via its SH2 domain in DT40 B cells, we examined the associated molecules with Grb2 SH2 domain. As observed in fibroblasts (3Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J.

Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), both autophosphorylated EGFR and phosphorylated Shc were associated with the Grb2 SH2 fusion protein (Fig.3 A). Supporting this observation, the immunoprecipitates with anti-Grb2 Ab contained both of these molecules (Fig. 3 B). After EGF stimulation, DT40 cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK2 Ab. The immunoprecipitates were assayed for in vitro kinase activity by the ability to phosphorylate Elk-1. EGF-induced ERK2 activation in DT40 cells was maximal at 1 min, after which activity declined (Fig.4 A). This ERK2 response was profoundly reduced in Grb2-deficient DT40 cells, whereas Shc-deficient cells showed the normal ERK2 response upon EGF stimulation (Fig.4 A), indicating that Grb2 is required for EGF-induced ERK2 activation. To further demonstrate that the ERK2 defect in Grb2-deficient cells is because of loss of Ras activation, we employed a binding assay developed by Taylor and Shalloway (28Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the observation that Raf protein has high affinity for active Ras-GTP but does not bind the inactive GDP-bound form of Ras. Thus, we used a GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf to selectively precipitate activated Ras. The recovery of activated Ras was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-Ras Ab. As shown in Fig.5, EGF stimulation of wild-type and Shc-deficient cells both resulted in increased Ras-GTP, whereas this increase was completely abolished by loss of Grb2. Since the slight ERK2 activation in Grb2-deficient DT40 cells was observed despite no increased Ras-GTP, this remaining ERK2 activation in the mutant cells could be explained by Ras-independent mechanism. To examine this possibility, we transfected a dominant-negative form of Ras, RasN17, into DT40 cells expressing EGFR. As shown in Fig.6 B, expression of RasN17 inhibited the EGF-induced ERK2 activation, but the residual ERK2 response was still observed like that in Grb2-deficient DT40 cells (Figs. 4 A and 6 B). Thus, these results suggest that Ras-independent pathway, at least to some extent, contributes to full ERK2 activity upon EGF stimulation in DT40 cells. As reported previously, EGF stimulated JNK activity in wild-type DT40 cells expressing EGFR. The JNK activity was determined in an immunocomplex kinase assay with c-Jun as a substrate. The kinetics of JNK activation were distinct from those of ERK2, being marked at 30 min and declined by 60 min (Fig. 4 B, and data not shown). Grb2-deficient cells showed the normal JNK response upon EGF stimulation, whereas this JNK response was abolished by loss of Shc (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that Shc, but not Grb2, is involved in EGF-mediated JNK activation. Previous results have shown that EGF-induced JNK activation can be completely inhibited by RasN17 and inhibited approximately 50% by a dominant negative form of Rac1, Rac1N17, in fibroblasts (14Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar, 15Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility in DT40 B cells, we transfected Rac1N17 into wild-type cells expressing EGFR (Fig. 6 A). As shown in Fig. 6 C, expression of Rac1N17 in DT40 cells almost completely abolished the EGF-mediated JNK activation, whereas this response was not affected by expression of RasN17. Our results support the previous contention that Grb2 plays a critical role in a highly conserved process for the control of Ras signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (3Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J.

Given the evidence that PKCα phosphorylates Raf-1, thereby leading to stimulation of its catalytic activity (29Sözeri O. Vollmer K. Liyanage M. Frith D. Kour G. Mark III G.E. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G.D.M. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), PKC activation may be involved in Ras-independent ERK activation through phosphorylation of Raf-1. In fact, EGF was able to induce phospholipase C-γ activation, leading to PKC activation in DT40 cells expressing EGFR (data not shown). Stimulation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) activates the NGF receptor (NGFR) Trk, and thereby induces neurite extension, in a response that is dependent on the Ras pathway (31Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Shc in PC12 cells induces neurite extension; furthermore, this extension is blocked by expression of a dominant negative Ras (RasN17) (26Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schressinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it has been proposed that Shc·Grb2 complex is involved in Ras pathway. However, the data presented here demonstrate that Shc does not participate in EGF-mediated Ras activation in DT40 B cells (Fig. 5). Since a recent report has shown that EGFR and NGFR can utilize Shc in different ways to promote their activation (25Thomas D. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22293-22299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), one explanation for this disparity is that EGFR utilizes more dominantly through the direct binding of Grb2-Sos complex to the autophosphorylated EGFR, whereas NGFR utilizes Shc·Grb2-Sos complex for Ras activation. It is also possible that this difference may reflect the difference in these cell types (lymphoid cellsversus neuronal cells). In contrast to no effect of disruption of Shc on EGF-mediated ERK response, Shc-deficient cells failed to induce EGF-mediated JNK response (Fig. 4 B). The effect of Shc on the JNK pathway is presumably mediated by Rho family GTPases because Rac1N17, but not RasN17, inhibited the EGF-mediated JNK response completely (Fig.6 C). Although Rho family GTPases mainly contribute to the JNK signaling pathway, previous results using fibroblasts have shown that the EGF-mediated JNK pathway is inhibited by expression of not only Rac1N17 but also RasN17 (14Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar, 15Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), suggesting a cross-talk between these GTPases (32Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These somewhat inconsistent findings might reflect the fact that the existence of this cross-talk between Rho family and Ras varies depending on different cell types. Indeed, RasN17 inhibited only the ERK pathway without affecting the JNK pathway in DT40 B cells (Fig. 6, B and C). Analogous to the mechanism by which Grb2 activates Ras, Shc might bring members of the family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho family GTPases (of which Vav is a member) to the plasma membrane where these GTPases are located. Assuming that Vav is a sole target, one would predict that the EGF-mediated JNK response is transient like the ERK response. However, as shown in this study, the EGF-mediated JNK response in DT40 B cells was marked at 30 min although the activation was observed at 10 min. Thus, our data suggest that two distinct GTPases might be involved in the initial phase and the sustained JNK activation, respectively. Reminiscent of this type of regulation is NGFR-mediated ERK activation; the early phase of the ERK activation is mediated by Ras, but sustained activation of this pathway is because of activation of Rap1 (33York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Because Rac1N17 is able to inhibit not only Rac1, but also other Rho family GTPases, an almost complete block of the EGF-mediated JNK response by introduction of Rac1N17 could be accounted for by simultaneous blockade of two distinct GTPases by Rac1N17.

https://openalex.org/W2081361583,"Fluid shear stress is an important regulator of endothelial cell (EC) function. To determine whether mechanosensitive ion channels participate in the EC response to shear stress, we characterized the role of ion transport in shear stress-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) stimulation. Replacement of all extracellular Na+ with either N-methyl-D-glucamine or choline chloride increased the ERK1/2 stimulation in response to shear stress by 1.89 +/- 0.1-fold. The Na+ effect was concentration-dependent (maximal effect, </=12.5 mM) and was specific for shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation as epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK1/2 activation was unaffected by removal of extracellular Na+. Shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation was potentiated by the voltage-gated sodium channel antagonist, tetrodotoxin (100 nM), to a magnitude similar to that achieved with extracellular Na+ withdrawal. Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with a rat brain type IIa voltage-gated sodium channel completely inhibited shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation in these cells. Inhibition was reversed by performing the experiment in sodium-free buffer or by including tetrodotoxin in the buffer. Western blotting of bovine and human EC lysates with SP19 antibody detected a 250-kDa protein consistent with the voltage-gated sodium channel. Degenerate polymerase chain reaction of cDNA from primary human EC yielded transcripts whose sequences were identical to the sodium channel SCN4a and SCN8a alpha subunit genes. These results indicate that shear stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation is regulated by extracellular sodium and demonstrate that ion transport via Na+ channels modulates EC responses to shear stress."
https://openalex.org/W1536551585,"The high mobility group (HMG) 1 and 2 proteins are the most abundant non-histone components of chromosomes. Here, we report that essentially the entire pool of HMG1 proteins in Drosophila embryos and Chironomus cultured cells is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues located within acidic tails of these proteins. The phosphorylation sites match the consensus phosphorylation site of casein kinase II. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopic analyses revealed that Drosophila HMGD and Chironomus HMG1a and HMG1b are double-phosphorylated and that Drosophila HMGZ is triple-phosphorylated. The importance of this post-translational modification was studied by comparing some properties of the native and in vitro dephosphorylated proteins. It was found that dephosphorylation affects the conformation of the proteins and decreases their conformational and metabolic stability. Moreover, it weakens binding of the proteins to four-way junction DNA by 2 orders of magnitude, whereas the strength of binding to linear DNA remains unchanged. Based on these observations, we propose that the detected phosphorylation is important for the proper function and turnover rates of these proteins. As the occurrence of acidic tails containing canonical casein kinase II phosphorylation sites is common to diverse HMG and other chromosomal proteins, our results are probably of general significance."

This family includes the tumor suppressor pp32, expressed in normal tissue, and the pro-oncogenic genespp32r1 and pp32r2 that are found principally in neoplastic cells. At the protein level, pp32, pp32r1, and pp32r2 are approximately 90% identical, yet they subsume opposite functions. In this study, we identify the region of pp32 associated with the ability to inhibit oncogene-mediated transformation in a rat embryo fibroblast system, an in vitro correlate of tumor-suppressive activity. Deletion and truncation analysis define a region spanning pp32 amino acids 150–174 as absolutely required for inhibition of transformed foci elicited by RAS and MYC. Comparison of pp32 with the pp32r1 sequence by moving averages of sequence identity reveals divergence over this region; pp32r2 also differs in this region through truncation after pp32 amino acid 131. The deletion experiments and the experiments of nature therefore converge to demonstrate that tumor-suppressive functions of pp32 reside in amino acids 150–174.

Kv1.3, a Shaker family K+ channel protein, appears to play an essential role in the activation of peripheral human T cells. Although Kv1.3-mediated K+ currents increase markedly during the activation process in mice, and to a lesser degree in humans, Kv1.3 mRNA levels in these organisms do not, indicating post-transcriptional regulation.

Recently it has been shown that Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 are expressed in mouse T cells and that they are up-regulated during mitogen-stimulated activation. In this study, we show that the human Kvβ subunits substantially increase K+ current amplitudes when coexpressed with their Kv1.3 counterpart, and that unlike in mouse, protein levels of human Kvβ2 remain constant upon activation.

Voltage-gated K+ channels play an important role in the propagation of electrical signals in the nervous system of higher organisms (1Rudy B. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). A large number of voltage-gated K+channel proteins are expressed throughout the mammalian nervous system. These proteins are encoded by a large number of genes which fall into various families or subfamilies of homology. The mammalianShaker family of K+ channels contains at least seven different genes, Kv1.1–Kv1.7 (2Coetzee W. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Pountney D.

Nature. 1990; 345: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that in the mammalian nervous system the channel-formingShaker proteins are usually complexed with cytoplasmic Kvβ subunits (Kvβ1–Kvβ3) (5Shamotienko O.G. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8195-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Coexpression studies, utilizing mRNA injection and voltage-clamp analysis of Xenopus oocytes, have shown that the major brain Kvβ subunit (6Scott V.E.S.

Sci. 1994; 91: 1637-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), Kvβ2, and at least one splice form of Kvβ1 (Kvβ1a) are able to alter the inactivation properties of a number of neuronally expressed Kv1 channel proteins (7Rettig J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither of these two Kvβ subunits significantly alters the inactivation properties of Kv1.3, a K+ channel that is sparingly expressed within the nervous system (9Heinemann S. Rettig J. Scott V. Parcej D.N. Lorra C. Dolly J. Pongs O. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1994; 88: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Perhaps more importantly, Kvβ subunits are also able to increase K+ current amplitudes of neuronal Kv1 K+ channels in the oocyte plasma membrane (8McCormack K. McCormack T. Tanouye M. Rudy B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, coexpression of several neuronal Kv1 channels with Kvβ2 in mammalian cell lines has shown that Kvβ2 increases the number of these Kv1 proteins reaching the membrane surface (10Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that the Kvβ subunits are likely to increase the surface expression offunctional, neuronal K+ channels.In addition to their role in the nervous system, K+ channel proteins are expressed in other cell types, where they may help determine membrane potential and maintain osmotic equilibrium. What specific physiological roles might these K+ channel proteins play outside the nervous system? They appear to play an essential role in the stimulation and maintenance of cellular proliferation of T cells (11Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), B cells (12Sutro J.B. Vayuvegula B.S. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Adv. Exp. Med.

Physiol. 1993; 264: C1014-C1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T-lymphocytes, the role has been extensively investigated: mitogens cause an immediate shift in K+conductance (15McKinnon D. Ceredig R. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1846-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. DeCoursey T.E. Gupta S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 197-237Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar); activated T cells show substantially greater K+ conductances than quiescent cells (11Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); activation is attenuated by membrane depolarization (18Gelfand E.W Cheung R.K. Mills G.B. Grinstein S. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 527-531PubMed Google Scholar); and pharmacological agents that inhibit K+ channel conductances block T-cell proliferation (19DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In human peripheral T-lymphocytes, the Kv1.3 K+ channel plays a critical role in mediating the K+ current increase, which accompanies proliferation (20Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and is also likely to be the site of blockade, which inhibits this event (21Koo G.C. Blake J.T. Talento A. Nguyen M. Lin S. Sirotina A. Shah K. Mulvany K. Hora Jr., D. Cunningham P. Wunderler D.L. McManus O.B. Slaughter R. Bugianesi R. Felix J. Garcia M. Williamson J. Kaczorowski G. Sigal N.H. Springer M.S. Feeney W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5120-5128PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Kv1.3 mRNA does not appear to be up-regulated during proliferation, indicating that the Kv1.3 gene product is post-transcriptionally regulated (22Cai Y.C. Osborne P.B. North R.A. Dooley D.C. Douglass J. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Attali B. Romey G. Honore E. Schmid-Alliana A. Mattei M.G. Lesage F. Ricard P. Barhanin J.

Belkowski S.M. Constantinescu C.S. Cohen J.A. Prystowsky M.B. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 8-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the murine Kvβ mRNA and protein levels are markedly increased upon interleukin-2 stimulation. If the Kvβ subunits were able to increase the surface expression of Kv1.3 channels, then up-regulation of Kvβ subunits would result in greater K+ channel surface expression and therefore greater K+ conductance during the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and perhaps other cell types (11Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Sutro J.B. Vayuvegula B.S. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Adv. Exp. Med.

Utilizing the Xenopus oocyte expression system, we report the effects of coexpression of the human Kvβ1a and Kvβ2 subunits on the expressed current levels of Kv1.3 channels.DISCUSSIONT-lymphocytes are critical for eliciting cellular immune responses. It is well established that K+ channels play important roles in the activation of T-lymphocytes: important physiologic changes which T-lymphocytes undergo as a result of the activation process are inhibited by blockers of K+channels, including protein synthesis, cell volume increase, and cell-cycle progression (17Lee S.C. Sabath D.E. Deutsch C. Prystowsky M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that channels containing the Kv1.3 subunit are the major K+ channel (type n channel) in T-lymphocytes (25Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The K+ conductance increases 20-fold in murine T-cells treated with mitogen, whereas in human T-cells, the K+ conductance increases roughly 2-fold (11Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Lee S.C. Sabath D.E. Deutsch C. Prystowsky M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, treatment of these cells by a mitogen results in constant or decreased, rather than increased, Kv1.3 mRNA levels in mice and humans, respectively (22Cai Y.C. Osborne P.B. North R.A. Dooley D.C. Douglass J. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Attali B. Romey G. Honore E. Schmid-Alliana A. Mattei M.G. Lesage F. Ricard P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that the expression of the murine Kvβ2 subunit increases markedly in response to stimulation by interleukin-2 (24Autieri M.V. Belkowski S.M. Constantinescu C.S. Cohen J.A. Prystowsky M.B. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 8-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Our results show that Kv1.3 can form functional channels alone but that the presence of Kvβ subunits, primarily Kvβ2, the more abundant β-subunit in human T-lymphocytes (24Autieri M.V. Belkowski S.M. Constantinescu C.S. Cohen J.A. Prystowsky M.B. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 8-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), accelerates the functional assembly of Kv1.3 channels. The ability of the Kvβ2 subunit to enhance current levels of Kv1.3 may help to explain how the increase in Kvβ2 subunit expression can up-regulate the expression of Kv1.3 channels in activated murine lymphocytes. The much greater increase in Kvβ2 protein levels of mitogen-treated T-cells in mouse (24Autieri M.V. Belkowski S.M. Constantinescu C.S. Cohen J.A. Prystowsky M.B. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 8-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), compared with human (Fig. 6), is consistent with the differential increase in K+ current observed in mitogen-treated T-cells in these two organisms. In fact, although K+ current levels in human mitogen-treated T-cells increase roughly 2-fold, this effect is immediate (19DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), unlike in mouse (20Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), ruling out transcriptional or translational regulation as the means by which the K+current level increases. The differences in β-subunit regulation in mice and humans may account for the vast difference in the extent to which Kv1.3 K+ conductance is up-regulated in activated T-cells in these two organisms. Voltage-gated K+ channels play an important role in the propagation of electrical signals in the nervous system of higher organisms (1Rudy B. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). A large number of voltage-gated K+channel proteins are expressed throughout the mammalian nervous system. These proteins are encoded by a large number of genes which fall into various families or subfamilies of homology. The mammalianShaker family of K+ channels contains at least seven different genes, Kv1.1–Kv1.7 (2Coetzee W. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Pountney D. Saganich M. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 233-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), which form functional homo- and heterotetrameric channel complexes (3McCormack K. Lin J.W. Iverson L.E. Rudy B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Sewing S. Pongs O. Nature. 1990; 345: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that in the mammalian nervous system the channel-formingShaker proteins are usually complexed with cytoplasmic Kvβ subunits (Kvβ1–Kvβ3) (5Shamotienko O.G. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8195-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Coexpression studies, utilizing mRNA injection and voltage-clamp analysis of Xenopus oocytes, have shown that the major brain Kvβ subunit (6Scott V.E.S. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 1637-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), Kvβ2, and at least one splice form of Kvβ1 (Kvβ1a) are able to alter the inactivation properties of a number of neuronally expressed Kv1 channel proteins (7Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 8McCormack K. McCormack T. Tanouye M. Rudy B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither of these two Kvβ subunits significantly alters the inactivation properties of Kv1.3, a K+ channel that is sparingly expressed within the nervous system (9Heinemann S. Rettig J. Scott V. Parcej D.N. Lorra C. Dolly J. Pongs O. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1994; 88: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Perhaps more importantly, Kvβ subunits are also able to increase K+ current amplitudes of neuronal Kv1 K+ channels in the oocyte plasma membrane (8McCormack K. McCormack T. Tanouye M. Rudy B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, coexpression of several neuronal Kv1 channels with Kvβ2 in mammalian cell lines has shown that Kvβ2 increases the number of these Kv1 proteins reaching the membrane surface (10Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that the Kvβ subunits are likely to increase the surface expression offunctional, neuronal K+ channels. In addition to their role in the nervous system, K+ channel proteins are expressed in other cell types, where they may help determine membrane potential and maintain osmotic equilibrium. What specific physiological roles might these K+ channel proteins play outside the nervous system? They appear to play an essential role in the stimulation and maintenance of cellular proliferation of T cells (11Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), B cells (12Sutro J.B. Vayuvegula B.S. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1989; 254: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar), macrophages (13Kitagawa S. Johnston Jr., R.B. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3417-3423PubMed Google Scholar), and brown adipocytes (14Pappone P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1014-C1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In T-lymphocytes, the role has been extensively investigated: mitogens cause an immediate shift in K+conductance (15McKinnon D. Ceredig R. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1846-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. DeCoursey T.E. Gupta S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 358: 197-237Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar); activated T cells show substantially greater K+ conductances than quiescent cells (11Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Lee S.C. Sabath D.E. Deutsch C. Prystowsky M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); activation is attenuated by membrane depolarization (18Gelfand E.W Cheung R.K. Mills G.B. Grinstein S. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 527-531PubMed Google Scholar); and pharmacological agents that inhibit K+ channel conductances block T-cell proliferation (19DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In human peripheral T-lymphocytes, the Kv1.3 K+ channel plays a critical role in mediating the K+ current increase, which accompanies proliferation (20Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and is also likely to be the site of blockade, which inhibits this event (21Koo G.C. Blake J.T. Talento A. Nguyen M. Lin S. Sirotina A. Shah K. Mulvany K. Hora Jr., D. Cunningham P. Wunderler D.L. McManus O.B. Slaughter R. Bugianesi R. Felix J. Garcia M. Williamson J. Kaczorowski G. Sigal N.H. Springer M.S. Feeney W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5120-5128PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Kv1.3 mRNA does not appear to be up-regulated during proliferation, indicating that the Kv1.3 gene product is post-transcriptionally regulated (22Cai Y.C. Osborne P.B. North R.A. Dooley D.C. Douglass J. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Attali B. Romey G. Honore E. Schmid-Alliana A. Mattei M.G. Lesage F. Ricard P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Kvβ2, and Kvβ1 to a lesser extent, are both expressed in mouse T-lymphocytes (24Autieri M.V. Belkowski S.M. Constantinescu C.S. Cohen J.A. Prystowsky M.B. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 77: 8-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the murine Kvβ mRNA and protein levels are markedly increased upon interleukin-2 stimulation. If the Kvβ subunits were able to increase the surface expression of Kv1.3 channels, then up-regulation of Kvβ subunits would result in greater K+ channel surface expression and therefore greater K+ conductance during the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and perhaps other cell types (11Decoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Sutro J.B. Vayuvegula B.S. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. Adv. Exp. Med.

Referred to previously as the CSKH domain, we will refer to this domain as Lck-binding domain 2 (LBD2). Tip has no other recognizable protein interaction domains or catalytic domains. We have examined here the mechanism by which Tip activates Lck.DISCUSSIONOur results show that Tip can activate Lck under conditions where no activating changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck can occur. This suggests strongly that Tip can activate Lck, at least partially, through an induced conformational change. The population of Lck bound to Tip in vivo is, however, phosphorylated to a greater extent at Tyr394, the site of activating phosphorylation, than at Tyr505, the site of inhibitory phosphorylation. There appear to be two steps in the activation of Lck by Tip. First, the binding of Tip induces a conformational change that leads to greater catalytic activity. Second, the Lck that has been activated by the Tip-induced conformational change undergoes increased phosphorylation at Tyr394 and possibly decreased phosphorylation at Tyr505, and this leads to a further increase in catalytic activity.It is likely that Tip exerts some of its effect as a result of displacement of the SH3 domain of Lck. The SH3 domains of two Src kinases, c-Src and Hck, bind intramolecularly to polyproline type II helices in the linker between their SH2 domains and their catalytic domains (21Sicheri F. Moarefi I.

The human immunodeficiency virus Nef protein, which contains an SH3 domain-binding motif, can both bind to the SH3 domain of Hck and activate Hck (43Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 44Briggs S. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the activation of Hck by Nef results from displacement of the SH3 domain from the SH2 catalytic domain linker, thereby allowing the catalytic domain to achieve a catalytically more favorable conformation.Tip contains two Lck-binding domains. LBD1 is a proline-rich domain that binds to the SH3 domain of Lck. LBD2 binds to an as yet unidentified site in the carboxyl-terminal half of Lck.2The binding of the proline-rich LBD1 of Tip to the Lck SH3 domain could displace the SH3 domain and activate Lck by removing conformational constraints, as has been inferred to occur when Nef binds to Hck (43Moarefi I.

Consistent with this model are earlier observations that mutation of either the SH3 domain (45Reynolds P.J. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1949-1955PubMed Google Scholar, 46Weil R. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22830-22838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or of the SH2 catalytic domain linker (47Wright D.D. Sefton B.M. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) activates Lck partially.The mechanism of activation of Lck by Tip is not identical to that by which Nef activates Hck. Tip containing only a functional LBD1 can bind to Lck in vitro through the Lck SH3 domain, but this does not activate Lck detectably (Fig. 2). This suggests that the binding of LBD2 to Lck also participates in the activation of Lck. In that LBD2 binds to the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein that consists largely of the catalytic domain, it is possible that LBD2 alters the conformation of the catalytic domain directly. How this might occur is not yet known. LBD2 has sequence identity with the αI helix in the Lck catalytic domain (8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Broker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is possible that it displaces this helix and that such a displacement is activating. Alternatively, this binding domain could affect the positioning of the αC helix in the catalytic domain in a manner similar to that by which cyclin activates cyclin-dependent kinases (49Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar).Tip differs from other known regulatory proteins of Src kinases in its bimodal binding to Lck. The middle T antigen of polyoma virus binds only to the carboxyl termini of Src kinases (50Dunant N.M. Senften M. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activates them apparently by interfering with inhibitory phosphorylation (26Cartwright C.A. Kaplan P.L. Cooper J.A. Hunter T. Eckhart W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1562-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The HIV Nef protein appears to function only as an SH3 domain ligand (43Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 44Briggs S. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and is not known to interact directly with the catalytic domain of Hck. A question of particular interest is whether Tip has a cellular homologue that functions as a natural, endogenous activator of Lck in T cells. If so, this would suggest that tyrosine-protein kinases may normally be subject to an as yet unappreciated form of regulation and that cellular Tip-like activators of other tyrosine-protein kinases may exist.

Tip containing only a functional LBD1 can bind to Lck in vitro through the Lck SH3 domain, but this does not activate Lck detectably (Fig. 2). This suggests that the binding of LBD2 to Lck also participates in the activation of Lck. In that LBD2 binds to the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein that consists largely of the catalytic domain, it is possible that LBD2 alters the conformation of the catalytic domain directly. How this might occur is not yet known. LBD2 has sequence identity with the αI helix in the Lck catalytic domain (8Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B.

It is possible that it displaces this helix and that such a displacement is activating. Alternatively, this binding domain could affect the positioning of the αC helix in the catalytic domain in a manner similar to that by which cyclin activates cyclin-dependent kinases (49Jeffrey P.D.

A question of particular interest is whether Tip has a cellular homologue that functions as a natural, endogenous activator of Lck in T cells. If so, this would suggest that tyrosine-protein kinases may normally be subject to an as yet unappreciated form of regulation and that cellular Tip-like activators of other tyrosine-protein kinases may exist. Our results show that Tip can activate Lck under conditions where no activating changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck can occur. This suggests strongly that Tip can activate Lck, at least partially, through an induced conformational change. The population of Lck bound to Tip in vivo is, however, phosphorylated to a greater extent at Tyr394, the site of activating phosphorylation, than at Tyr505, the site of inhibitory phosphorylation. There appear to be two steps in the activation of Lck by Tip. First, the binding of Tip induces a conformational change that leads to greater catalytic activity. Second, the Lck that has been activated by the Tip-induced conformational change undergoes increased phosphorylation at Tyr394 and possibly decreased phosphorylation at Tyr505, and this leads to a further increase in catalytic activity. It is likely that Tip exerts some of its effect as a result of displacement of the SH3 domain of Lck. The SH3 domains of two Src kinases, c-Src and Hck, bind intramolecularly to polyproline type II helices in the linker between their SH2 domains and their catalytic domains (21Sicheri F. Moarefi I.

The human immunodeficiency virus Nef protein, which contains an SH3 domain-binding motif, can both bind to the SH3 domain of Hck and activate Hck (43Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the activation of Hck by Nef results from displacement of the SH3 domain from the SH2 catalytic domain linker, thereby allowing the catalytic domain to achieve a catalytically more favorable conformation. Tip contains two Lck-binding domains. LBD1 is a proline-rich domain that binds to the SH3 domain of Lck. LBD2 binds to an as yet unidentified site in the carboxyl-terminal half of Lck.2The binding of the proline-rich LBD1 of Tip to the Lck SH3 domain could displace the SH3 domain and activate Lck by removing conformational constraints, as has been inferred to occur when Nef binds to Hck (43Moarefi I.

https://openalex.org/W2155642067,"ProW is an Escherichia coli inner membrane protein that consists of a 100-residue-long periplasmic N-terminal tail (N-tail) followed by seven closely spaced transmembrane segments. N-tail translocation presumably proceeds in a C-to-N-terminal direction and represents a poorly understood aspect of membrane protein biogenesis. Here, using an in vivo depletion approach, we show that N-tail translocation in a ProW derivative comprising the N-tail and the first transmembrane segment fused to the globular P2 domain of leader peptidase depends both on the bacterial signal recognition particle (SRP) and the Sec-translocase. Surprisingly, however, a deletion construct with only one transmembrane segment downstream of the N-tail can assemble properly even under severe depletion of SecE, a central component of the Sec-translocase, but not under SRP-depletion conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the SRP-targeting pathway does not necessarily deliver SRP-dependent inner membrane proteins to the Sec-translocase. The data further suggest that N-tail translocation can proceed in the absence of a functional Sec-translocase.

Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), Fig. 1, and has been established as a convenient model protein for studying N-tail translocation. Previous work has shown that translocation of the ProW N-tail is proton motive force-dependent, that it can be blocked by the introduction of positively but not negatively charged amino acids, and that it is not affected in conditional secA and secY mutant strains or by treatment with sodium azide (which inhibits the ATPase activity of the preprotein translocase subunit SecA) (8Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Whitley P. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29831-29835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the use of conditional mutant strains or sodium azide to study Sec-translocase dependence has been found not to be sufficient to prove Sec-translocase independence (3de Gier J.-W.L. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14587-14589Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied the translocation of the ProW N-tail across the inner membrane in more detail using tight SRP-4.5S RNA and SecE-depletion strains rather than conditional mutant strains. We show that the ProW N-tail cannot be translocated across the inner membrane by itself but requires a C-terminal signal-anchor sequence. Surprisingly, we find that an operational SRP-targeting pathway is always required for translocation of the ProW N-tail, whereas the Sec-translocase appears not to be needed for the proper membrane insertion of a truncated ProW molecule consisting only of the N-tail and the first transmembrane segment. This suggests that the SRP-targeting pathway does not necessarily deliver SRP-dependent proteins to the Sec-translocase, as has hitherto been assumed to be the case, and that N-tail translocation can be Sec-independent. Strain MC4100 (11Casadaban M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose. The 4.5 S RNA (SRP) conditional strain FF283 was cultured as described previously (12Ribes V. Römisch K. Giner A. Dobberstein B. Tollervey D. Cell. 1990; 63: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To deplete cells for 4.5 S RNA, cells were grown to mid-log phase in the absence of IPTG. The SecE-depletion strain CM124 (13Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol.

Over night cultures were washed once with M9 medium and backdiluted 1:20. To deplete cells for SecE, cells were, if not stated differently, grown to mid-log phase in the absence of l-arabinose. Depletion of SecE was checked by monitoring the accumulation of pro-OmpA during a short pulse labeling with [35S]methionine. Where appropriate, ampicillin (final concentration 100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (final concentration 50 μg/ml) were added to the medium.

ProW N-tail constructs were expressed by l-arabinose induction from the pING1 vector (14Johnston S. Lee J.H. Ray D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or from the pBAD24 vector (15Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar) in strains MC4100 and FF283 and by IPTG induction from the pDHB5700 vector in strain CM124 (3de Gier J.-W.L. Scotti P.A.

For all experiments cells were grown to mid-log phase. Expression of the ProW N-tail constructs was induced for 5 min with either IPTG (final concentration 1 mm) or l-arabinose (final concentration 0.2%). Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (150 μCi/ml, Ci = 37 GBq) for 15 s whereupon nonradioactive methionine was added (final concentration 500 μg/ml). After labeling, cells were converted to spheroplasts. For spheroplasting, cells were collected at 14,000 rpm for 2 min in a microcentrifuge, resuspended in ice-cold buffer (40% w/v sucrose, 33 mm Tris pH 8.0), and incubated with lysozyme (final concentration 5 μg/ml) and 1 mm EDTA for 15 min on ice. Aliquots of the spheroplast suspension were incubated on ice for 1 h either in the presence or absence of proteinase K (final concentration 0.3 mg/ml). Subsequently, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the spheroplast suspension (final concentration 0.33 mg/ml). After addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%), resuspended in 10 mm Tris, 2% SDS, immunoprecipitated with antisera to the ProW N-tail, OmpA (a periplasmic control (16de Gier J.-W.L.

Gels were scanned in a Fuji BAS1000 phosphoimager and quantitated using the MacBAS software (version 2.31). To rule out the presence of cryptic targeting signals in the ProW N-tail itself, translocation of a deletion mutant, ProW Nt, comprising only the N-tail without any transmembrane segments was monitored by protease treatment of spheroplasts, Fig. 2. No translocation was observed, indicating that the ProW N-tail cannot be translocated by itself but requires additional information for translocation across the inner membrane. As already shown (9Whitley P. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29831-29835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the addition of a C-terminal signal-anchor sequence (the first ProW transmembrane segment followed by three C-terminal lysines: ProW Nt/TM1/3K (Fig. 1)) is sufficient to bring about efficient translocation of the N-tail across the inner membrane, Fig. 3. Efficient N-tail translocation was also seen when the Nt/TM1/3K construct was lengthened at the C terminus with the globular P2 domain of leader peptidase (Ref.8Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and Figs. 1 and 4). We conclude that a single transmembrane domain is sufficient to initiate translocation of the ProW N-tail across the inner membrane.Figure 3N-tail translocation in ProW Nt/TM1/3K depends on SRP but not on SecE.

The translocation of the ProW N-tail was both in Nt/TM1/3K and Nt/TM1/P2 strongly inhibited under SRP-depletion conditions, Figs.3 A and 4 A, suggesting that SRP is required for targeting ProW to the inner membrane. To our surprise, N-tail translocation in Nt/TM1/3K was not affected even after prolonged depletion of SecE, while translocation of the Sec-dependent protein OmpA was completely blocked under these conditions, Fig. 3 B. In contrast, when the Nt/TM1/3K construct was extended at the C terminus with the P2-domain of leader peptidase, N-tail translocation was inhibited even upon mild depletion of SecE, Fig. 4 B. An alternative protein translocation pathway has recently been identified: the so-called twin arginine translocation pathway found both in thylakoids and bacteria (20Settles A. Martienssen R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 494-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Dalbey R. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To rule out the (unlikely) involvement of the twin arginine translocation pathway in translocation of the ProW N-tail, assembly of constructs Nt/TM1/3K and Nt/TM1/P2 was tested in a tatC mutant strain (22Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As expected, no effect on translocation was seen in this strain (data not shown). In this communication we show that the ProW N-tail requires a C-terminal signal anchor sequence and an operational SRP-targeting pathway for translocation across the inner membrane. In addition, the Nt/TM1/P2 construct depends on the Sec-translocase for membrane insertion. Interestingly, however, the short Nt/TM1/3K construct inserts efficiently into the inner membrane even after severe depletion of SecE, suggesting that SRP-dependent proteins may not necessarily be targeted to the Sec pathway. Since a C-terminal lengthening of the SecE-independent Nt/TM1/3K construct renders it SecE-dependent, one possibility is that a co-translational interaction between the substrate protein and SRP is necessary (and sufficient?) for targeting to the Sec-translocase. Recently, it has been reported that translocation of large protein domains (β-lactamase, PhoA) across the inner membrane can be initiated by a downstream hydrophobic targeting signal and that translocation is both SecA- and SecB-dependent (23McMurry J.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6776-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Mitsopoulos C. Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Broome-Smith J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the SecE dependence noted above for the ProW Nt/TM1/P2 construct and further underscores the surprising finding that SecE depletion does not affect the translocation of the short Nt/TM1/3K construct. On the other hand, the addition of just a few positively charged residues to the ProW N-tail prevents its translocation (8Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Whitley P. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29831-29835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), while both β-lactamase and PhoA contain many basic residues, suggesting that there may be important differences in their mode of translocation yet to be identified. In yeast mitochondria an inner membrane protein, Oxa1p, has been shown to be involved in the assembly in N-tail inner membrane proteins (25Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,26He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In E. coli there is a homologue of this protein, Oxa1Ec (27Sääf A. Monné M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30415-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, no function has yet been assigned to Oxa1Ec, and it remains to be seen if it plays a role in the assembly of N-tail inner membrane proteins. In conclusion, we have shown that the SRP-targeting pathway does not necessarily deliver proteins to the Sec-translocase and that N-tail translocation can be Sec-independent. Antiserum against the ProW N-tail was a kind gift from Erhard Bremer."

Krebs cycle intermediates represent important fuels for renal proximal tubule cells (1Simpson D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F223-F234PubMed Google Scholar). Di- and tricarboxylates are taken up from the glomerular filtrate via the brush-border (luminal) membrane as well as from the blood across the basolateral membrane by sodium-coupled dicarboxylate transporters (2Burckhardt G. Ullrich K.J. Kidney Int. 1989; 36: 370-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The transporter located in the basolateral membrane may be directly involved in the secretion of some anionic drugs (3Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Klöss S. Kidney Int. 1989; 36: 78-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, this transporter maintains an outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient, which drives organic anion excretion via the so-called p-aminohippurate (PAH) 1The abbreviations PAHp-aminohippurate transporter (4Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). By this mechanism, a great variety of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, including drugs and environmental chemicals, can be secreted (5Ullrich K.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). p-aminohippurate Experiments with rabbit and rat renal membrane vesicles demonstrated that the dicarboxylate transporters in the brush-border (luminal) and basolateral membranes differ with respect to their substrate affinity (6Wright S.H.

For the luminal transporter aK m for succinate of 0.61 mm was determined, whereas the basolateral transporter exhibited a much higher affinity for succinate with a K m of about 12 μm (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar). Both 2,3-dimethylsuccinate andcis-aconitate inhibited the basolateral transporter, but not the luminal transporter (8Ullrich K.J. Fasold H. Rumrich G. Klöss S. Pflügers Arch. 1984; 400: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Ullrich K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Succinate uptake by the basolateral transporter was decreased by lowering the pH, whereas luminal succinate transport was independent of pH (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J.

Acta. 1982; 684: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Uptake of citrate by the basolateral transporter was independent of pH (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar) or slightly increased by raising pH from 5.5 to 7.0 (12Jørgensen K.E. Kragh Hansen U. Røigaard Petersen H. Sheikh M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F686-F695PubMed Google Scholar), whereas citrate transport by the luminal transporter was much higher at lower pH than at neutral pH (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), as well as homologous transporters from rat, Ri-19 (17Khatri I.A. Kovacs S.V. Forstner J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), andXenopus laevis intestine, NaDC-2 (18Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar), have been cloned. In contrast, the basolateral transporter has not yet been characterized on the molecular level. Experiments with renal tubules from flounder have shown that low concentrations of glutarate in sodium-containing bathing medium stimulate basolateral PAH uptake via PAH/dicarboxylate exchange (19Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R1470-R1477PubMed Google Scholar). This argues for the existence of a basolateral sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter in flounder kidney. Since the winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) kidney consists almost exclusively of proximal tubules (20Kinter W.B. Fortschr. Zool. 1975; 23: 223-231Google Scholar) resulting in an enrichment of the mRNA of interest, and has been successfully used for cloning of the PAH/dicarboxylate exchanger fROAT (21Wolff N.A. Werner A. Burkhardt S. Burckhardt G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we screened a flounder kidney cDNA library for expression of Na+-dependent dicarboxylate uptake. A Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter, named fNaDC-3, was cloned. The functional characteristics of fNaDC-3 suggest that it represents the winter flounder homologue to the mammalian renal basolateral dicarboxylate carrier. To clone the flounder dicarboxylate transporter, we screened a unidirectional cDNA library, which was constructed from a 2–4-kilobase size fraction of mRNA from winter flounder (P. americanus) kidney (22Werner A. Murer H. Kinne R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F311-F317PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (21Wolff N.A. Werner A. Burkhardt S. Burckhardt G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both strands of the isolated clone, fNaDC-3, were sequenced by dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems), starting with T7 and pUC sequencing primers (NAPS) and then proceeding through the sequence with fNaDC-3-specific primers (automatic sequencer: ABI Prism, Applied Biosystems). The sequence was assembled and analyzed with the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software package, unless otherwise stated. Sequence homology searches were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST network service. Stage V and VI oocytes (23Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) were prepared from X. laevis (Nasco) ovaries by treatment with collagenase (Type CLSII, Biochrom) and subsequent washing in Ca2+-free oocyte Ringer's solution (see below) as described earlier (24Steffgen J. Kienle S. Scheyerl F. Franz H.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 23 or 46 nl of cRNA (0.5–1 μg/μl) using a micropump (Drummond). During the screening process, injected oocytes were maintained for 2 or 3 days at 18 °C in Barth's medium (in mm: 90 NaCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 1 K2SO4, 0.8 MgSO4, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5), containing 12 mg/liter gentamycin (RefobacinR, Merck). The medium was changed daily, and damaged oocytes were discarded. For uptake experiments, 5–10 oocytes were incubated for the indicated time in a modified Ringer's solution (in mm: 110 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5) usually containing the radioactively labeled substrate [1,4-14C]succinate (15–60 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) at 1 μCi/ml incubation solution. To determine the sodium-dependent succinate uptake, sodium was replaced by tetramethylammonium. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The two-electrode voltage clamp technique was employed either in the current clamp or in the voltage clamp mode using a commercial amplifier (OC 725 A, Warner). After 10 min of membrane potential stabilization following microelectrode impalements, the response to succinate was measured, to verify that the oocytes had expressed fNaDC-3. Afterward, the membrane potential was clamped to a holding potential,V h, of −60 mV. Oocytes were superfused at a rate of 4 ml/min with the test solutions at room temperature. To determine the charge to substrate coupling ratio, current evoked by 1 mm succinate was measured under voltage clamp at the initial membrane potential, and afterward tracer uptake of 1 mm succinate was determined for the same individual oocytes. Current was converted to the rate of net charge influx according to the equation: rate of net charge influx (mol/min) = 60 × A/F, where A represents current and F the Faraday's constant (9.65 × 104 Coulombs/mol). All data are given as means ± S.E. A winter flounder cDNA library was screened for Na+-dependent succinate uptake by injection of cRNA into oocytes. A single cDNA clone was isolated, which increased succinate transport 250-fold over controls (Fig. 1 A). This stimulated uptake was completely sodium-dependent. Based on these results, the cDNA of this positive clone was named fNaDC-3, or flounderNa+-dicarboxylate cotransporter 3. Testing the membrane potential response in the presence of 1 mm succinate, we detected a depolarization of 52.9 ± 7.8 mV (n = 12 oocytes) in oocytes injected with cRNA from fNaDC-3 (Fig. 1 B). When the same oocytes were investigated afterward in voltage clamp experiments (holding potential −60 mV), addition of 1 mm succinate induced a net inward current, I succ, of −119 ± 24 nA (n = 12). Cell membrane conductance at −60 mV significantly (p < 0.001) increased from 0.4 ± 0.07 microsiemens under control conditions to 1.8 ± 0.26 microsiemens in the presence of 1 mm succinate. Control oocytes showed barely detectable changes in membrane potential, in inward current (Fig. 1 B, H2O), and in cell membrane conductance upon addition of 1 mm succinate. To determine the coupling ratio of substrate to charge influx, the same oocytes were first analyzed for succinate induced currents under voltage clamp conditions and then assayed individually for tracer uptake, both at 1 mm succinate. Current converted to the rate of net charge influx was 21.9 ± 2.8 pmol/min/oocyte, and uptake rate was 19.7 ± 2.4 pmol/min/oocyte (n = 9 oocytes). Thus, the transport of the divalent negatively charged succinate was most likely accompanied by movement of three Na+ ions. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of fNaDC-3 are shown in Fig. 2 A. The fNaDC-3 cDNA is 2384 nucleotides in length with a major open reading frame coding for a protein of 601 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 66.4 kDa. This reading frame contains several potential AUG codons, which lie in a favorable context for translation initiation according to Kozak's rules (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Due to its 5′-proximal localization, the first of these was tentatively assigned as the first codon. Secondary structure analysis using several different programs,i.e. Sosui (26Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), TMpred (27Hofman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar), and TopPred2 (28von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), predicts 12 transmembrane domains in overlapping regions. Only eight of these are identified by Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig.2 B. However, assuming that at least one of the two potentialN-glycosylation sites (NXS/T) at the C-terminal end of the protein (Asn586 and Asn598) is actually used, both the N terminus and the C terminus would have to be localized extracellularly according to all these models. Such an orientation has been suggested previously for the Na+-d-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 (30Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There are several potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II (cf. Fig. 2 A). Only in the secondary structure predicted by Kyte-Doolittle analysis would any of these be localized on the cytosolic side of the membrane. However, to our knowledge, regulation of renal sodium-dicarboxylate cotransport by phosphorylation has not yet been demonstrated. On the other hand, C-terminal glycosylation sites are present in all Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporters cloned to date, and glycosylation has indeed been shown for both the rabbit and human NaDC-1 (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from hypothetical proteins, a data base search revealed the highest homology of fNaDC-3 with six proteins, five of which represent Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporters from kidney (human, rat, and rabbit NaDC-1) and intestine (rat Ri-19 and X. laevisNaDC-2) (Fig. 3), the other being the rat renal Na+-sulfate cotransporter NaSi-1. Of these, the rat and rabbit NaDC-1 (15Sekine T. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Watanabe N. Furuta Y. Fukuda K. Igarashi T. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F298-F305PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1808-C1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as NaSi-1 (32Markovich D. Forgo J. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8073-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), have so far been associated with the luminal membrane of the epithelium. The degree of identity of the fNaDC-3 protein with the functional Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporters is around 45% (in detail: 46% with X. laevis NaDC-2; 43, 44, and 43% with rat, rabbit, and human NaDC-1, respectively). The lower amino acid identity to the not yet functionally characterized Ri-19 (36%) might be attributable to possible frameshifts as discussed by Sekine et al. (15Sekine T. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Watanabe N. Furuta Y. Fukuda K. Igarashi T. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F298-F305PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the human renal NaDC-1 has a strikingly higher homology not only to rabbit and rat NaDC-1 (78 and 77% identity, respectively), but also to X. laevisintestinal NaDC-2 (66% identity). This suggests that the low homology of fNaDC-3 to other members of this transporter family might not be attributable to evolutionary distance alone. Additionally, the sequence of fNaDC-3 shows almost no similarity to the other cloned dicarboxylate transporters between positions 166 and 237 (corresponding to amino acids 160–222 of rabbit NaDC-1 in the alignment). Interestingly, antisera raised against amino acids 164–223 of rabbit NaDC-1 only stained the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule (31Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1808-C1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that the different immunoreactivity could be related to the lack of homology between the luminal and the basolateral transporter in this particular region of the protein. Taken together, the divergence of the fNaDC-3 sequence suggests that it could represent the basolateral Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter. In oocytes expressing fNaDC-3, uptake of succinate linearly increased with time up to 30 min (r = 0.99) with an uptake rate of 28.8 pmol/min × oocyte (three independent experiments with 10 oocytes per treatment each). To characterize the sodium dependence of fNaDC-3, we varied the sodium concentration from 0 to 110 mm (Fig.4) by isoosmotic replacement with tetramethylammonium. [14C]Succinate uptake exhibited sigmoidal relationship to the Na+ concentration. Half-maximal activation of succinate uptake occurred at approximately 40 mm Na+. Using the Michaelis-Menten equation, the best fit to the data could be obtained assuming a cotransport of 3 sodium ions, resulting in an apparent affinity constant of 39.6 ± 3.3 mm Na+. When we replotted the data according to Hill (not shown), a straight line could be obtained with a slope of 2.5 ± 0.4, indicating positive cooperativity between multiple binding sites for Na+. Together with the inward current induced by succinate (see Fig. 1 B), these data indicate net movement of at least three sodium ions per succinate molecule. In the presence of 10 mm lithium, succinate uptake was inhibited by 66.4 ± 4.8% (three independent experiments, each carried out on 8–10 oocytes per treatment). Lithium (10 mm) also completely prevented membrane depolarization and the inward current induced by succinate (not shown). The inhibition by lithium, which is probably due to the replacement of one of the sodium ions by lithium, has been shown previously for dicarboxylate transport in the renal luminal (33Sheridan E.

In contrast, lithium binds probably to all sodium binding sites of the intestinal transporter NaDC-2, albeit the V maxof succinate uptake in the presence of Li+ was approximately one-third of that in the presence of Na+(18Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar). Succinate uptake in fNaDC-3-cRNA-injected oocytes showed saturation (Fig. 5) with a K mvalue of 30.4 ± 13.5 μm succinate. Therefore, fNaDC-3 seems to encode for a high affinity succinate transporter similar to that detected in rabbit renal basolateral membrane vesicles, which has a K m of 12 μm (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, succinate uptake by brush-border membrane vesicles has a reported K m of 0.61 mm (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar). For the cloned luminal dicarboxylate transporters of rabbit and human kidney, NaDC-1 and hNaDC-1, expressed in oocytes, K m values for succinate of 0.45 mm (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and 0.36 mm (14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, have been determined. Similarly, the calculatedK m value of the cloned dicarboxylate transporter from X. laevis intestine, NaDC-2, was 0.28 mm(18Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one functional difference of fNaDC-3 from these low affinity transporters is its higher affinity for succinate. Since the luminal and the basolateral dicarboxylate transporter also differ with respect to substrate specificity (see below), we characterized uptake of succinate in the presence of 1 mmof other potential substrates (Fig. 6). Inhibitory potency ranked in the following order: succinate = α-ketoglutarate = fumarate > glutarate > 2,3-dimethylsuccinate > cis-aconitate = citrate = isocitrate. On the other hand, there was only a small inhibition by malate, maleate, and pyruvate and no inhibition by lactate, sulfate, or aspartate. The expressed transporter preferred substrates with a trans configuration (fumarate) over those with a cis configuration (maleate), as has been reported previously for both the luminal and basolateral dicarboxylate transporters (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ullrich K.J. Fasold H. Rumrich G. Klöss S.

Acta. 1994; 1197: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) reported that 2,3-dimethylsuccinate and cis-aconitate inhibit the basolateral, but not the luminal dicarboxylate transporter. In our experiments, the addition of 2,3-dimethylsuccinate or cis-aconitate caused a significant inhibition of succinate uptake. Testing the effects of 1 mm2,3-dimethylsuccinate and cis-aconitate in electrophysiological measurements, we could also demonstrate inward currents of −128 ± 21 nA (n = 7) and −71 ± 20 nA (n = 4), respectively, evoked by these substances at −60 mV. Therefore, both substrates are actually translocated by fNaDC-3. In contrast, neither the cloned rabbit or human NaDC-1, nor X. laevis NaDC-2 were inhibited by dimethylsuccinate (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, dimethylsuccinate did not evoke a significant current in oocytes injected with cRNA from rabbit NaDC-1 (35Pajor A.M. Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18923-18929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or rat SDCT1 (16Chen X.Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The effect of cis-aconitate on the cloned luminal transporters has not been tested so far. Thus, fNaDC-3 resembles basolateral dicarboxylate transport in mammalian renal tubules (8Ullrich K.J. Fasold H. Rumrich G. Klöss S. Pflügers Arch. 1984; 400: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in its response to 2,3-dimethylsuccinate andcis-aconitate. In experiments with membrane vesicles, the basolateral and the luminal dicarboxylate transporters also differed with respect to the pH dependence of succinate and citrate uptake. In the basolateral membrane, uptake of succinate was significantly stimulated by raising pH from 5.5 to 7.5, whereas succinate uptake by brush-border membrane vesicles was not influenced by pH (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar, 10Burckhardt G. Pflügers Arch. 1984; 401: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared succinate-mediated current at pH 7.5 with current at pH 6.5 and pH 5.5. At a holding potential of −60 mV, maximum current was found at pH 7.5 (−70.3 ± 7.9 nA), and was significantly (p < 0.05, n = 7 each) decreased at pH 6.5 (−59.6 ± 8.9 nA) and pH 5.5 (−57.7 ± 6.2 nA). In contrast, succinate transport in oocytes injected with cRNA coding for the luminal transporters rabbit NaDC-1, hNaDC-1, SDCT1, or X. laevisNaDC-2 was independent of pH changes (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen X.Z. Shayakul C.

Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the pH dependence of succinate transport by fNaDC-3 differs from the previously cloned luminal dicarboxylate carriers, but resembles that of the renal basolateral transporter. It has been well established that both the luminal and the basolateral dicarboxylate transporters accept citrate as a substrate (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar, 10Burckhardt G. Pflügers Arch. 1984; 401: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a specific difference exists with respect to the dependence of citrate uptake on pH. Lowering pH increased citrate uptake by the luminal dicarboxylate transporter (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jørgensen K.E. Kragh Hansen U. Røigaard Petersen H. Sheikh M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F686-F695PubMed Google Scholar), but did not significantly affect (6Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar) or slightly decreased (12Jørgensen K.E. Kragh Hansen U. Røigaard Petersen H. Sheikh M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F686-F695PubMed Google Scholar) basolateral citrate uptake. Therefore, we compared the citrate-evoked current at pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 in oocytes injected with fNaDC-3 cRNA. There was a slight, but significant (p < 0.05, n = 7 each), decrease of citrate current from −58 ± 6.9 nA to −48 ± 6.8 nA when pH was lowered from pH 7.5 to pH 5.5, with no significant difference between the current evoked by citrate at pH 7.5 and pH 6.5 − 54 ± 6.2 nA). Additionally, in six independent uptake experiments there was no significant difference in the inhibition of succinate uptake by 1 mm citrate at pH 6.0 and 7.5. The predominant ionic species of citrate at pH 7.5 is trivalent, whereas at pH 6.0 the divalent citrate dominates (pK 3 = 6.4). If citrate were transported in the trivalent form together with three sodium ions, transport should be electroneutral. However, we registered a depolarization and an inward current in the presence of 1 mm citrate. Depolarization and an inward current were also observed with another tricarboxylate,cis-aconitate. This can be explained either by a symport of even four sodium ions with one trivalent citrate orcis-aconitate molecule or only transport of the divalent tricarboxylate. In the latter case, the binding site of the transporter could be influenced by lowering pH such that affinity for both succinate and citrate were reduced. Whether this assumption is valid was not tested further. In uptake experiments with the cloned luminal dicarboxylate transporters, citrate uptake was strikingly higher at pH 6.0 than at pH 7.5 (13Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, electrophysiological measurements with the cloned luminal transporter of rat kidney (16Chen X.Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) revealed a much higher citrate-induced current at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.5. Again, fNaDC-3 differs from the other cloned dicarboxylate transporters, while resembling basolateral transport. In summary, a sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter, fNaDC-3, has been cloned from flounder kidney. fNaDC-3 differs from the luminal dicarboxylate transporters cloned from rabbit and human kidney (NaDC-1) and X. laevis intestine (NaDC-2) with respect to substrate affinity, inhibition by dimethylsuccinate, and pH dependence of succinate and of citrate uptake. Inhibition by dimethylsuccinate and the effect of pH on succinate or citrate uptake also contrast with the data obtained for the luminal dicarboxylate transporter (rNaDC-1 or SDCT1) of rat kidney. Therefore, fNaDC-3 should to be regarded as a new type of Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter similar to the basolateral transporters characterized in rat and rabbit kidney. We thank Dr. A.

The nucleotide binding properties of myosin were not altered by the deletion. However, the deletion affected actin binding and the communication between the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites. The affinity of M765NL for actin (644 nm) was approximately 100-fold lower than that of wild-type construct M765 (5.8 nm). Despite this reduction in affinity, actin binding weakened the affinity of ADP for the motor to a similar extent for both mutant and wild-type constructs. The addition of 0.5 μmactin decreased ADP affinity from 0.6 to 34 μm for M765NL and from 1.6 to 39 μm for M765. In contrast, communication between the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites appears disturbed in regard to phosphate release: thus, basal ATPase activity for M765NL (0.19 s−1) was 3-fold larger than for M765 (0.06 s−1), and the stimulation of ATPase activity by actin was 5-fold lower for M765NL. These results indicate different paths of communication between the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites, in regard to ADP and Pi release, and they confirm that loop 2 is involved in high affinity actin binding.

Myosins form a superfamily of ATP-driven molecular motors that produce unidirectional movement along actin filaments. Myosins consist of a globular catalytic domain, an extended neck region, and a functionally diverse tail region. The globular motor domain contains both actin- and nucleotide-binding sites. Force and movement are produced by this generic motor domain upon actin-induced ATP hydrolysis and subsequent product release (1Cheney R.E. Riley M.A. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Goodson H.V. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The neck region contains one or more binding sites for calmodulin-like light chains. A rigid elongated structure is formed by the neck region; this amplifies small conformational changes in the globular motor domain, thus producing force and movement along actin filaments in steps of approximately 5–10 nm/ATP hydrolyzed (3Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 4Schröder R.R.

The myosin II fragment, consisting of the motor domain and the neck region, is frequently referred to as subfragment-1 or S1. The functionally diverse tail region is important for formation of ordered assemblies or attachment to specific binding partners. This region of myosin II is for example involved in the formation of thick filaments in muscle (5Vikstrom K.L. Seiler S.H. Sohn R.L. Strauss M. Weiss A. Welikson R.E. Leinwand L.A. Cell Struct.

Two prominent trypsin-sensitive surface loops form the borders of the 25-, 50-, and 20-kDa subdomains of S1 (11Mornet D. Pantel P. Audemard E. Kassab R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Mornet D. Ue K. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The first loop, loop 1, spanning the 25/50-kDa junction is situated near the nucleotide-binding site and is involved in determining the rate of ADP release (13Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 225SPubMed Google Scholar, 14Kurzawa-Goertz S.E. Perreault-Micale C.L. Trybus K.M. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7517-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 50/20-kDa junction, also called loop 2, plays a central role in actin binding and consequently in tuning of the motor activity (15Uyeda T.Q. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 16Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Myosin binding to actin has been described in a three-state model (18Geeves M.A. Conibear P.B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 194S-199SPubMed Google Scholar). First a collision complex is formed; this process involves long range electrostatic interactions. The resulting attached (A) state is a low affinity complex that undergoes a conformational change into the high affinity rigor (R) state. The equilibrium between the A and R states is strongly influenced by the nucleotide bound to the myosin motor. Myosin dissociates from actin upon ATP binding. After ATP hydrolysis, rebinding to actin and product release, the high affinity complex (R) is reformed, and simultaneously myosin moves one step forward along the actin filament. The importance of loop 2 in tuning the enzymatic activity of myosin II was demonstrated in studies in which the native loop 2 was replaced with that from other myosins. Insertion of β-cardiac or skeletal loop 2 in smooth muscle heavy meromyosin led to an unregulated heavy meromyosin (16Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Replacement of Dictyostelium myosin loop 2 with several other loop 2 regions resulted in chimeric myosins with actin-activated ATPase activities that correlated well with the activity of the donor myosins (15Uyeda T.Q. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Insertion of positive charges intoDictyostelium myosin loop 2 increased the affinity for actin in the absence and presence of Mg2+-ATP. These constructs displayed a 2–3-fold increase in k cat, a more than 10-fold reduction in K app for actin, and an up to 70-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Up to now all mutational analyses of loop 2 involved enlarging of this region. From the atomic structure of the Dictyosteliummyosin motor domain, it appears that a minimal size of the loop spanning the 50/20-kDa junction may be required to retain correct communication between the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites (3Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Shortening of loop 2 is expected to produce conformational stress and a slight distortion of the myosin motor domain. To test the effect of loop 2 shortening on myosin motor activity, we have now constructed and characterized a Dictyostelium myosin II that has 9 amino acids of this loop exchanged for a single valine residue. ATPase rates, actin binding characteristics, nucleotide binding, in vitromotility, and functional complementation in vivo of this mutant myosin were studied to gain a better understanding of the role of loop 2 in myosin motor function. Rabbit skeletal actin was prepared by the method described by Lehrer and Kerwar (19Lehrer S.S. Kerwar G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Mant-ATP was synthesized using the protocol described by Hiratsuka (20Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 724: 496-508Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar). (4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid used to label actin with a fluorescent pyrene group (21Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was from Molecular Probes. G418 was from Life Technologies, Inc., imidazole from BDH Laboratory Supplies (Poole, United Kingdom). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Subcloning was done using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The vector pBIGMyD containing the complete coding sequence of the Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain A was used to construct the loop 2 deletion mutant, NL-myosin. First the native loop 2 sequence TTCAATGATCCAAACATTGCCAGTGGTGCAAAG, encoding fnDPNIASRAK, was changed using oligo-directed mutagenesis into TTCGAATCTAGACTTAAG, encoding FESRLK. This gene was digested withBstB I and AflIII, filled in using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and self-ligated. The resulting sequence was TTCGTTAAG encoding FVK. Thus residues 613 to 621 were exchanged for a single valine residue. Plasmid pDH20, a pDXA-3H derivative, was used for the expression of M765 under the control of theDictyostelium actin 15 promoter (23Manstein D.J. Schuster H.-P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene. 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). M765 includes the first 765 amino acids of the Dictyostelium mhcAgene and carries a C-terminal His-7 tag. The NL-mutation was transferred to M765 from the plasmid encoding NL-myosin. The resulting plasmid pDH21 encodes M765NL. Dictyosteliumcells were grown on HL-5 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml G418 (24Watts P.J. Ashworth J.M. Development. 1998; 103: 1-16Google Scholar). Cells were harvested when a density of 4–6 × 106 was reached. Typically 30–40 g of cells were used per purification, yielding up to 2 mg of pure protein per gram of cells (wet weight). The protein purification was performed as described earlier (25Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were Triton-lysed in the presence of alkaline phosphatase. The expressed myosin was extracted with Mg-ATP from the Triton-insoluble pellet. The His-tagged myosin head fragment (MHF)1 was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Full-length myosin and NL-myosin were purified as described by Ruppel et al.(26Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped flow experiments were performed at 20 °C with a Hi-tech Scientific SF61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a 100 W Xe/Hg lamp and a monochromator. The mant-derivatives of ATP or ADP were excited at 364 nm, pyrene was excited at 365 nm, and the emitted light was detected after passing through a KV389-nm cut-off filter. The rate of MHF binding to pyrene-actin was monitored by the change in light scattering at 410 nm and detected at an angle of 90° to the incident light. Data were stored and analyzed using software provided by Hi-tech. Transients were determined as the average of three to five consecutive shots of the stopped-flow machine. All concentrations refer to the concentration of the reactants after mixing in the stopped-flow observation cell. The experimental buffer was 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl. Dictyostelium MHFs have been shown to follow the same basic mechanism of actin and nucleotide binding that was described for S1 from rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin and other muscle myosins. The dynamics of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the MHFs were analyzed in terms of the model shown in Scheme 1 (27Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in which M representsDictyostelium MHF. In this and the following schemes a notation is used that distinguishes between the constants in the presence and absence of actin by using bold (k +1, K 1)versus italics type (k +1,K 1); subscript A and D refer to actin (K A) and ADP (K D), respectively.

This dissociation and the effect of ADP on it were analyzed in terms of models developed by Millar and Geeves (28Millar N.C. Geeves M.A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Siemanowski and White (29Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol.

A·M+ATP⇌K1A·M·ATP→k+2A+M·ATP A·M·ADP⇌KADA·M+ADP SCHEMEII After mixing A·M and ATP a rapid equilibrium is reached, defined by the equilibrium constant K 1. The following isomerization of the ternary complex limits the maximum rate of actin dissociation from the complex. Thus the observed rate constant for the ATP-induced dissociation of actin is given by Eq. 1. kobs=[ATP]K1k+2/(1+K1[ATP])Equation 1 where K 1 represents the association constant for the ternary complex formation. In the presence of ADP, the two nucleotides compete for binding to A·M. Assuming a rapid equilibrium between A·M and the ADP bound state,k obs for a fixed ATP concentration is given by Eq. 2. kobs=k0/(1+[ADP]/KAD)Equation 2 where the k obs in the absence of ADP isk 0 and the dissociation constantK AD represents the affinity of ADP for the acto-myosin complex (29Siemankowski R.F.

Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant myosin constructs were expressed at similar levels in Dictyostelium discoideum. Cells were lysed in the presence of alkaline phosphatase to remove all ATP, and co-sedimentation with actin was used as the first purification step of MHF. In the case of M765 more than 95% of total MHF precipitated with actin, whereas for M765NL approximately 35% was recovered in the Triton-insoluble pellet. Yields of approximately 3 and 1 mg of MHF/gram of cells were obtained for M765 and M765NL following Mg2+-ATP extraction and Ni2+-NTA chromatography. The purity of the myosin or MHFs was ≥95% as evaluated by Coomassie staining (data not shown). The M765 constructs were used for nucleotide- and actin binding studies as they are soluble under physiological salt conditions, whereas full-length myosin constructs were used for in vitro motility assays andin vivo rescue studies. Binding of mant-ATP to M765 and M765NL resulted in similar changes in fluorescence intensity, and almost identical values of 9.2 × 105m−1 s−1 and 8.9 × 105m−1 s−1 for the second order rate constant for mant-ATP bindingK 1 k +2 were obtained (Fig.1 A and TableI). The affinity of mant-ADP (K D) for M765NL was increased 2.5-fold compared with M765 (0.61 and 1.56 μm, respectively). This increase was mainly because of a 2.5-fold reduction in the rate of mant-ADP dissociation (k −D) from M765NL, 0.50 s−1 compared with 1.21 s−1 for M765. The second order rate constant for mant-ADP binding (k +D) was virtually identical to that of M765. Values of 8.2 × 105m−1s−1 versus 7.8 × 105m−1 s−1 were obtained for the mutant and wild-type construct, respectively (Fig. 1 B and Table I).Table ITransient kinetic analysisRate constantM765M765NLNucleotide binding to MHFK 1 k +2(m−1s−1)9.2 ± 0.13 × 1058.9 ± 0.45 × 105k +D(m−1s−1)7.8 ± 0.49 × 1058.2 ± 0.29 × 105k −D (s−1)1.21 ± 0.0630.50 ± 0.021K D(μm) (k −D/k +D)1.6 ± 0.130.61 ± 0.033Nucleotide binding to acto · MHFK 1 k +2(m−1s−1)1.0 ± 0.10 × 1055.1 ± 0.14 × 105K 1(m−1)5571029k +2(s−1)176500K AD (μm)38.8 ± 6.6834.0 ± 3.15Actin binding to MHFk +A(m−1s−1)3.4 ± 0.13 × 1060.45 ± 0.01 × 106k −A (s−1)0.020 ± 0.00120.29 ± 0.029K A =k −A/k +A(nm)5.9 ± 0.41644 ± 66.1Experimental conditions for all measurements: 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0, 20 °C.

Myosin-actin binding characteristics can be monitored by measuring the quenching that occurs when myosin binds pyrene-labeled actin (32Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Woodward S.K. Manstein D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8619-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching is thought to occur when myosin undergoes a conformational change from the attached weakly bound A-state to the strongly bound rigor R-state (18Geeves M.A. Conibear P.B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 194S-199SPubMed Google Scholar). The actin binding parameters determined for wild-type construct M765 were similar to those obtained with an S1-like Dictyostelium myosin II construct (17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of M765NL to pyrene-actin did not produce any fluorescence quenching. Co-precipitation of actin and M765NL demonstrated that actin binding occurs, but much less effective than with wild-type M765. Addition of excess ATP completely released the bound M765NL from actin (data not shown). The rate of actin binding to M765 and M765NL was measured by light scattering to confirm the reduced affinity of M765NL for actin. The time-dependent increase in light scattering that follows mixing of the myosin constructs with an excess of pyrene-actin could be described by a single exponential function. Thek obs values increased linearly with increasing concentrations of actin over the range from 0.5 to 2.5 μmfor M765 and up to 10 μm actin in the case of M765NL (Fig. 2). The slopes of the lines define the second order rate constants, k +A, for actin binding (27Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Values of 3.6 ± 0.31 × 106m−1 s−1 and 0.43 ± 0.01 × 106m−1s−1 were obtained for M765 and M765NL, respectively. Because interaction of M765NL with pyrene-actin does not produce a change in the fluorescence signal, the rate of dissociation of the acto-myosin complex (k −A) was determined in a competition experiment. In this experiment acto-M765NL complex was mixed with increasing concentrations of M765 (5 to 40 μm) and quenching of pyrene-actin fluorescence upon binding of M765 was recorded. The recorded processes were clearly biphasic and could be fitted to a bi-exponential function. The first phase of the observed process represents the binding of M765 to noncomplexed pyrene-actin. The k obs values for the fast phase increased with higher concentrations of M765 whereas thek obs for the slow phase was 0.85 s−1 in the presence of 2 μm M765 and decreased to 0.3 s−1 at 10 μm M765 (Fig.2 B). This decrease in k obs with increasing [M765] could be described by a hyperbola with a dissociation equilibrium constant K A of approximately 490 nm. The rate constant for actin dissociation from M765NL (k −A) is defined by k min (0.29 s−1). A dissociation rate constant k −A of 0.29 s−1 and an association rate constantk +A of 0.45 × 106m−1 s−1 predict a value forK A of 644 nm (Table I). The corresponding values for M765 were determined as 0.02 s−1for k −A and 5.8 nm forK A as described earlier (17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To study the communication between nucleotide- and actin-binding sites of M765NL, we examined the ATP-induced dissociation of acto·MHF as described in Scheme II. Preformed acto·MHF complex was mixed with increasing concentrations of ATP and the decrease in light scattering was monitored as the complex dissociated. The observed rate constants were linearly dependent on ATP concentrations in the range up to 25 μm (Fig. 3 A). The second order binding constantK 1 k +2 (see Scheme II) was increased 5-fold for M765NL to 5.1 × 105m−1 s−1. At higher concentrations of ATP (>1 mm) the observed rate constants saturate (Fig.3 B) and the [ATP] dependence ofk obs could be described by a hyperbola (Eq. 1) as predicted by Scheme II, where k max =k +2 and K 0.5 = 1/K 1. For M765NL both K 1and k +2 were increased compared with M765 (TableI). The affinity of ADP for the pyrene-actin·MHF (K AD) was determined from the competitive inhibition of ATP-induced dissociation of acto·MHF as shown in Fig.4. Again the decrease in light scattering was monitored. The resulting data were fitted to Eq. 2 as shown under “Experimental Procedures.” Dissociation constants of 38 and 34 μm were obtained for M765 and M765NL, respectively (TableI). Steady-state ATPase activity was measured for wild-type and mutant myosin constructs. First the high-salt Ca2+ ATPase rate was determined. Hydrolysis of ATP in the absence of Mg2+ but in the presence of Ca2+ and high concentrations of salt results in high hydrolysis rates, because these conditions favor the release of hydrolysis products (33Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). High salt-Ca2+ ATPase did not significantly differ for M765 and M765NL, indicating that the mutant does not have a defect in the mechanism of hydrolysis (TableII). M765NL and full-length NL-myosin showed elevated basal levels of Mg2+-ATPase hydrolysis activity when compared with the wild-type constructs (Table II.). M765NL and NL-myosin showed little stimulation of their ATPase activity by actin. At concentrations much lower thanK app, the dependence of the apparent ATPase rate on actin concentration can be fitted to a straight line and the apparent second order rate constantk cat/K app of the reaction can be determined from the slope of this line. M765NL gave a 5–6-fold decreased value of 0.045 × 105m−1 s−1 compared with M765 (0.23 × 105m−1s−1), and the results suggest a more than 5-fold increase in K app for M765NL (Fig.5).Table IISteady-state ATPase activitiesMg2+ATPaseMg2+ ATPase + 20 μm actinHigh salt Ca2+ ATPaseM7650.06 ± 0.020.54 ± 0.031.45 ± 0.20M765NL0.19 ± 0.020.30 ± 0.031.33 ± 0.17Wild-type-myosin0.07 ± 0.050.78 ± 0.142.9 ± 0.5NL-myosin0.25 ± 0.070.29 ± 0.10NDaND, not determined.Results for ATPase activity measurements are given as Piliberated/myosin head/s.

The data presented are the mean of at least three independent measurements from at least two independent protein preparations. The deletion also affects the motor function of myosin. In vitro motility studies demonstrated that the NL-myosin binds actin, but all actin filaments diffused away instantly upon ATP addition (data not shown). Furthermore, NL-myosin did not interfere with motility of wild-type myosin when mixed in an in vitromotility experiment (data not shown). This behavior of NL-myosin inin vitro motility experiments can be explained by its low affinity for actin and high rate for ATP-induced dissociation of acto-M765NL (34Holmes K.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R112-R118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion in the 50/20-kDa junction strongly affects myosin function in vivo also.Dictyostelium offers the unique possibility to assess myosin function in vivo (35Egelhoff T.T. Manstein D.J. Spudich J.A. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1995; 140 (37): 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dictyostelium cells lacking the myosin II gene show a defined phenotype. Myosin II null cells are unable to grow in suspension culture, are often multinucleated, show a defect in the capping of cell surface receptors and cannot complete the developmental cycle (37De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 38Manstein D.J. Titus M.A. De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Introduction of wild-type myosin in myosin II null cells completely rescues these phenotypic changes (35Egelhoff T.T. Manstein D.J. Spudich J.A. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When the NL-myosin was reintroduced into the myosin null cells, none of the developmental defects were rescued, and the transformants were not able to grow in suspension (data not shown). This indicates that NL-myosin is not functional in vivo. In this report we describe the kinetic and functional analysis of myosin mutant constructs M765NL and NL-myosin, in which the 50/20-kDa junction is truncated. Previously we had examined the effect on myosin function of increasing the length and altering the charge of the loop 2 region and found that extensions of the loop 2 region by up to 20 residues did not alter kinetic behavior of the myosin motor. In contrast there was a clear correlation between the charge of loop 2, the activation by actin of the mutant constructs' ATPase rates and the strength of interaction of mutant motor domains and actin (17Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of the myosin motor domain predict that a minimal size of loop 2 is required for normal motor function. The deletion of part of loop 2 should result in local structural perturbations that interfere with normal communication between the actin-binding site and other regions of the myosin motor (3Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 4Schröder R.R.

Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The present transient kinetic analysis of M765NL demonstrates that nucleotide binding to MHF is not affected by partial deletion of loop 2. The affinities of M765NL for both mant-ATP and mant-ADP are very similar to the values determined for wild-type M765. The largest change observed with the mutant myosin was a 2.5-fold increase in ADP affinity. In contrast to the interaction with nucleotide, the deletion in loop 2 had a large effect on the association and dissociation constants for actin binding, resulting in approximately 100-fold lower affinity for actin. Pyrene quenching was not observed with M765NL. It has been reported that quenching of pyrene-actin fluorescence by myosin occurs upon the conformational change leading to the formation of the actin bound R-state of myosin (18Geeves M.A. Conibear P.B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 194S-199SPubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of pyrene fluorescence quenching upon binding of M765NL to pyrene-labeled actin could result from the inability of the mutant myosin motor domain to complete the transition from the weakly bound, attached (A) state to the strongly bound (R) state. However, the nonformation of R-states is expected to result in a much higher reduction in affinity, and the kinetic data suggest that the partial loss of loop 2 has similar effects on bothk +A and k −A. Therefore, a change in affinity cannot be entirely attributed to aK 2 effect, as k +A andk −A correspond toK 0 k +1 andk −1/(1 + K 2), respectively (see Scheme III). Additionally, if R-states cannot be formed, one would expect little acceleration of the M765NL ATPase rate and little weakening of ADP binding following the addition of actin. We did indeed observe a similar change in ADP affinity upon addition of actin, from 1.6 to 38 μm for M765 and 0.61 to 34 μm for M765NL (Table I). Thus, although M765NL displays a large decrease in actin affinity, actin is still effective in displacing ADP from the mutant myosin motor, by inducing a 56-fold weakening of ADP binding. The ratio ofK AD/K D indicates that coupling between actin binding and ADP release is normal or slightly increased in M765NL. In contrast, the 3-fold elevated basal ATPase activity of M765NL, and the failure of actin to enhance ATPase activity to the normal extent suggest that the communication between actin- and nucleotide-binding sites is disturbed in regard to phosphate release. In summary, deletion of 9 amino acids from the loop spanning the 50/20-kDa junction results in a myosin with almost normal nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties but approximately 100-fold decreased actin affinity. Two independent routes of communication between the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites are apparent from this work. One route is responsible for the actin-induced phosphate release from the nucleotide-binding site. This first route of communication is disturbed by the deletion of part of loop 2. The second route, which appears to function normally in M765NL, is responsible for the actin-dependent decrease in ADP affinity that facilitates the dissociation of ADP. We thank D. Hunt and U.

We previously cloned and characterized the bovine lysozyme 5A (lys5A) promoter with the purpose of determining cis- andtrans-acting elements controlling airway epithelial cell-specific expression. We found that such expression is controlled by protein binding to an ETS consensus sequence located approximately at −46 to −40 bp from the transcription start site. The identity of the ETS-related protein responsible for gene transactivation was unknown. In this study, we screened six ETS-related proteins by transient transfection into epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Results showed that among these factors, the myeloid Elf-1-like factor (MEF) was the most potent. Gel shift analysis of epithelial cell nuclear extracts using a lys5A probe including the ETS-binding site (−50/−31) yielded a single band with retarded mobility. This band was supershifted by an antibody directed against MEF. Supporting the possibility that MEF is responsible for functional transactivation of lysozyme in epithelial cells, we found that antisense MEF mRNA decreased lys5A promoter activity and that MEF overexpression in stably transfected cells increased lysozyme mRNA and protein expression. We conclude that MEF is required for epithelial cell transactivation of lysozyme. Lysozyme is an important component of innate immunity against common pathogens at mucosal surfaces.

Lysozyme, also known as muramidase, is an enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of β1–4-glycosidic bonds betweenN-acetylmuraminic acid andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine, constituents of the cell walls of most bacteria. Its antibacterial properties render it an important participant in host defense at mucosal surfaces and in leukocytes (1Klockars M. Osserman E.F. J. Histochem.

One feature that appears to be critical for expression in both cell types, however, is transactivation by ETS (E26transforming-specific) family proteins (8Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M.

Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Many myeloid-specific genes require ETS protein binding to DNA (e.g. CD4 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor) (13Wurster A.L. Siu G. Leiden J.M. Hedrick S.M. Mol. Cell.

That ETS proteins play important roles in myeloid cell development was demonstrated by experiments showing that the targeted disruption of the PU.1 orETS-1 gene has profound effects on development (15Muthusamy N.

Takeuchi K. Ohmori H. Li J.-D. Gallup M. Basbaum C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This was consistent with results indicating a requirement for binding of the ETS family transcription factor PU.1 to mediate lysozyme transcription in chicken macrophages (18Ahne B. Stratling W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17794-17801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the identity of the lysozyme-associated ETS protein in epithelial cells was unknown, it was clearly not PU.1 since PU.1 is not expressed in epithelial cells (19Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R.

The only ETS proteins active in this regard were MEF and ESE-1 (Fig. 1). MEF stimulated transcription more strongly than did ESE-1 in lung epithelial cells (A549), colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2), and skin fibroblasts (NIH3T3) (Fig. 1). That this occurred through MEF binding to the ETS consensus sequence was indicated by the fact that activation was inhibited when the ETS consensus sequence in the lysozyme regulatory region was changed from 5′-GGAA-3′to 5′-GGTC-3′. The reason for the weak inhibition by the mutation in Caco-2 cells is unclear.To determine whether or not MEF was endogenously present in the nuclei of epithelial cells and could thereby mediate endogenous lysozyme expression, we performed gel shift and supershift assays. As a probe, we used the radiolabeled lys5A promoter −50/−31 oligonucleotide. We observed a single band with retarded mobility after probe incubation with A549 cell nuclear extract (Fig. 2). That the band represented a specific DNA/protein interaction was evident from experiments showing competitive inhibition of band formation using excess unlabeled wild-type probe, but not the probe mutated at the ETS consensus binding site. That MEF was present in the complex was indicated by assays showing that anti-MEF antibody, but not preimmune serum or antibodies directed against human Ets-1, Ets-2, PU.1, or PEA3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (data not shown), caused a supershift of the DNA-protein complex.Figure 2Identification of the specific DNA-protein complex in A549 cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A double-stranded lys5A promoter oligonucleotide (−50/−31) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with 2 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) in the absence (lanes 1 and2) and presence (lanes 3–7) of 1 μg of nuclear protein. The following unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were added at a 100-fold molar excess over the probe oligonucleotide: wild-type competitor (WT; lane 4) and mutated competitor (MT; lane 5). Nonimmune antibody (N; lane 6) or anti-MEF antibody (MEF; lane 7) was added to the reaction mixture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether or not endogenous MEF is required for basal activity of the lys5A promoter, we produced antisense MEF mRNA in A549 cells using expression plasmid pCB6 with MEF cDNA in reverse orientation. The presence of antisense mRNA was associated with an 80% inhibition of luciferase activity for lys5A-(−50/+10) and 30% inhibition for lys5A-(−100/+10) (Fig.3). In addition, the presence of antisense ESE-1 mRNA with antisense MEF mRNA strongly inhibited luciferase activity for lys5A-(−100/+10). This construct contains enhancer-like activity in the region at −94 to −66 bp (17Kai H. Takeuchi K. Ohmori H. Li J.-D. Gallup M. Basbaum C. J. Cell.

A549 cells were cotransfected with antisense MEF or ESE-1 expression vector and lys5A luciferase constructs (lys5A-(−100/+10) and lys5A-(−50/+10)) or the parental pGL2-basic vector. Luciferase activity in the lysates was determined 48 h after transfection.

The stable transfectants are referred to as line 71. MEF overexpression strongly stimulated transiently transfected lys5A promoter activity if cells were transfected with wild-type constructs, but not with constructs mutated at the MEF DNA-binding site (Fig.4 A). In addition, MEF overexpression up-regulated endogenous lysozyme mRNA and protein expression, but not mRNA encoding the housekeeping protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 4, B andC).Figure 4Effects of stably overexpressed MEF on lys5A promoter activity (A), lysozyme steady-state mRNA (B), and lysozyme protein expression (C). A, the cells were transfected with luciferase constructs ((−100 bp)WT) containing the lys5A promoter as well as the parental pGL2-basic vector. Luciferase activity in the lysates was determined 48 h after transfection and is expressed as -fold activation over the activity of (−100 bp)WT in parental A549 cells. B, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR of lysozyme and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, shown is the stably transfected MEF enhanced expression of endogenous lysozyme protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe studies reported here indicate that the ETS protein MEF is present in lung epithelial cells and is required for lysozyme transcription in these cells. This is the first information regarding requirements for lysozyme expression in epithelial cells, as previous studies have focused on macrophages. Although lysozyme transcription in macrophages and epithelial cells is similar in requiring ETS protein transcription factors, the two cell types differ in their specific use of ETS proteins. Thus, whereas macrophages activate lysozyme transcription via PU.1, our data indicate that epithelial cells use, at least in part, the ETS family member MEF.We found that in epithelial cells, MEF up-regulated not only the activity of a transiently transfected lys5A promoter, but also the transcription of the endogenous lysozyme gene and protein. Moreover, antisense experiments showed that inhibition of endogenous MEF in epithelial cells attenuated the base-line level of lysozyme expression. Taken together, these results indicate that MEF is required for base-line expression of lysozyme in epithelial cells.The finding that antisense MEF constructs did not completely block lysozyme expression suggests that other factors are also involved in A549 cells. A strong candidate is the ETS family member ESE-1/ERT/ESX/ELF-3 (21Andreoli J.M. Jang S.I. Chung E. Coticchia C.M. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G.

With respect to lysozyme up-regulation, we are aware of the existence of a second element (−100/−51) that is well conserved in the human lysozyme gene. Although the enhancer remains to be identified, MEF may require interaction with the enhancer-binding protein to activate lysozyme expression.Our results showing a requirement for ETS family proteins in the expression of lysozyme in epithelial cells are consistent with previous data showing that the ETS protein PU.1 is required for lysozyme expression in chicken macrophages (18Ahne B. Stratling W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17794-17801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PU.1-binding site is present in an enhancer located 2.7 kilobases upstream of the transcription start site of chicken lysozyme. Mutation of this site abolishes enhancer activity in macrophages (18Ahne B. Stratling W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17794-17801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unclear at this point is the issue of whether epithelial cells in chicken, like those in mammals, use MEF and/or ESE-1 to activate the response element activated by PU.1 in macrophages.A subtle contrast with the findings reported here are results regarding the mouse M lysozyme gene. This gene, although also regulated by ETS transcription factors, is flanked by ETS consensus sequences lying 3′, rather than 5′, to the gene coding region. The 3′-region containing ETS consensus sequence is co-extensive with DNase I hypersensitivity sites that undergo demethylation in lysozyme-expressing macrophages (27Klages S. Mollers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and is therefore likely to be functionally important.A major focus of our laboratory's research is the differentiation and function of respiratory tract epithelial cells. In this regard, it is interesting that the 5′-flanking regions of several genes selectively expressed in respiratory tract serous cells contain ETS protein-binding sites. Specifically, the motif is present flanking genes encoding proline-rich proteins (28Kim H.-S. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6712-6718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lactoferrin (29Johnston J.J. Rintels P. Chung J. Sather J. Benz E.J. Berliner N. Blood. 1992; 79: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (30Yoshimura K. Nakamura H. Trapnell B.C. Dalemans W. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.-P. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9140-9144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (31Abe T. Kobayashi N. Yoshimura K. Trapnell B.C. Kim H.

The presence of shared transcription factor-binding sites may denote the presence of a regulatory cascade that controls serous cell differentiation in a manner similar to that already described for more extensively studied tissues such as skeletal muscle (32Lassar A. Munsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).In summary, these studies provide the first information identifying transcription factors controlling lysozyme expression in epithelial cells. As bacteria become progressively more resistant to exogenously applied antibiotics, information regarding mechanisms controlling innate immunity, such as that provided by epithelial lysozyme, may offer important new therapeutic approaches. Lysozyme, also known as muramidase, is an enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of β1–4-glycosidic bonds betweenN-acetylmuraminic acid andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine, constituents of the cell walls of most bacteria. Its antibacterial properties render it an important participant in host defense at mucosal surfaces and in leukocytes (1Klockars M. Osserman E.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Klockars M. Reitamo S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1975; 23: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 3Mason D. Taylor C. J. Clin. Res. 1975; 28: 124-132Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that inhibition of cationic antimicrobial proteins such as lysozyme predisposes the airway epithelium to infection (4Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85 (Correction (1996) Cell87, 2): 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). At mucosal surfaces, lysozyme expression is confined to specialized epithelial cells, including the serous gland cell of the respiratory epithelium (5Bowes D. Corrin B. Thorax. 1977; 32: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Dohrman A. Tsuda T. Escudier E. Cardone M. Jany B. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Exp. Lung Res. 1994; 20: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the Paneth's cell of the gastrointestinal epithelium. In hematopoietic cells, lysozyme expression is confined to the macrophage and granulocyte lineages (7Cross M. Mangelsdorf I. Wedel A. Renkawitz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6232-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Mechanisms responsible for cell-specific expression are poorly understood. One feature that appears to be critical for expression in both cell types, however, is transactivation by ETS (E26transforming-specific) family proteins (8Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Rankawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ETS proteins were initially described in the E26 avian leukemia virus (9Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and they have now been identified in many species fromDrosophila to man (12Albagli O. Klaes A. Ferreira E. Leprince D. Klambt C. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Many myeloid-specific genes require ETS protein binding to DNA (e.g. CD4 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor) (13Wurster A.L. Siu G. Leiden J.M. Hedrick S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6452-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.-M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). That ETS proteins play important roles in myeloid cell development was demonstrated by experiments showing that the targeted disruption of the PU.1 orETS-1 gene has profound effects on development (15Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 16Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that epithelial cell-specific lysozyme expression required an intact ETS-binding site in the proximal promoter of the bovine lysozyme gene 5A (17Kai H. Takeuchi K. Ohmori H. Li J.-D. Gallup M. Basbaum C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This was consistent with results indicating a requirement for binding of the ETS family transcription factor PU.1 to mediate lysozyme transcription in chicken macrophages (18Ahne B. Stratling W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17794-17801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the identity of the lysozyme-associated ETS protein in epithelial cells was unknown, it was clearly not PU.1 since PU.1 is not expressed in epithelial cells (19Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Beveren C.V. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we examined the role of various ETS family members in the control of lysozyme transcription in epithelial cells. Our results indicate that the myeloid Elf-1-like factor (MEF) 1The abbreviations MEFmyeloid Elf-1-like factorPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)WTwild-typelys5Alysozyme 5AGSTglutathioneS-transferase 1The abbreviations MEFmyeloid Elf-1-like factorPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)WTwild-typelys5Alysozyme 5AGSTglutathioneS-transferaseis necessary for lysozyme expression in epithelial cells and is sufficient to mediate lysozyme transcription in fibroblasts. myeloid Elf-1-like factor polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) wild-type lysozyme 5A glutathioneS-transferase myeloid Elf-1-like factor polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) wild-type lysozyme 5A glutathioneS-transferase RESULTSA screen of ETS transcription factors (Elf-1, Ets-1, Ets-2, PEA3, ESE-1, and MEF) revealed that despite the presence of an ETS consensus binding sequence on the lys5A promoter, most ETS proteins were unable to activate lysozyme transcription. The only ETS proteins active in this regard were MEF and ESE-1 (Fig. 1). MEF stimulated transcription more strongly than did ESE-1 in lung epithelial cells (A549), colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2), and skin fibroblasts (NIH3T3) (Fig. 1). That this occurred through MEF binding to the ETS consensus sequence was indicated by the fact that activation was inhibited when the ETS consensus sequence in the lysozyme regulatory region was changed from 5′-GGAA-3′to 5′-GGTC-3′. The reason for the weak inhibition by the mutation in Caco-2 cells is unclear.To determine whether or not MEF was endogenously present in the nuclei of epithelial cells and could thereby mediate endogenous lysozyme expression, we performed gel shift and supershift assays. As a probe, we used the radiolabeled lys5A promoter −50/−31 oligonucleotide. We observed a single band with retarded mobility after probe incubation with A549 cell nuclear extract (Fig. 2). That the band represented a specific DNA/protein interaction was evident from experiments showing competitive inhibition of band formation using excess unlabeled wild-type probe, but not the probe mutated at the ETS consensus binding site. That MEF was present in the complex was indicated by assays showing that anti-MEF antibody, but not preimmune serum or antibodies directed against human Ets-1, Ets-2, PU.1, or PEA3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (data not shown), caused a supershift of the DNA-protein complex.To determine whether or not endogenous MEF is required for basal activity of the lys5A promoter, we produced antisense MEF mRNA in A549 cells using expression plasmid pCB6 with MEF cDNA in reverse orientation. The presence of antisense mRNA was associated with an 80% inhibition of luciferase activity for lys5A-(−50/+10) and 30% inhibition for lys5A-(−100/+10) (Fig.3). In addition, the presence of antisense ESE-1 mRNA with antisense MEF mRNA strongly inhibited luciferase activity for lys5A-(−100/+10).

We found that in epithelial cells, MEF up-regulated not only the activity of a transiently transfected lys5A promoter, but also the transcription of the endogenous lysozyme gene and protein. Moreover, antisense experiments showed that inhibition of endogenous MEF in epithelial cells attenuated the base-line level of lysozyme expression. Taken together, these results indicate that MEF is required for base-line expression of lysozyme in epithelial cells. The finding that antisense MEF constructs did not completely block lysozyme expression suggests that other factors are also involved in A549 cells. A strong candidate is the ETS family member ESE-1/ERT/ESX/ELF-3 (21Andreoli J.M. Jang S.I. Chung E. Coticchia C.M. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G.

With respect to lysozyme up-regulation, we are aware of the existence of a second element (−100/−51) that is well conserved in the human lysozyme gene. Although the enhancer remains to be identified, MEF may require interaction with the enhancer-binding protein to activate lysozyme expression. Our results showing a requirement for ETS family proteins in the expression of lysozyme in epithelial cells are consistent with previous data showing that the ETS protein PU.1 is required for lysozyme expression in chicken macrophages (18Ahne B. Stratling W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17794-17801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PU.1-binding site is present in an enhancer located 2.7 kilobases upstream of the transcription start site of chicken lysozyme. Mutation of this site abolishes enhancer activity in macrophages (18Ahne B. Stratling W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17794-17801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unclear at this point is the issue of whether epithelial cells in chicken, like those in mammals, use MEF and/or ESE-1 to activate the response element activated by PU.1 in macrophages. A subtle contrast with the findings reported here are results regarding the mouse M lysozyme gene. This gene, although also regulated by ETS transcription factors, is flanked by ETS consensus sequences lying 3′, rather than 5′, to the gene coding region. The 3′-region containing ETS consensus sequence is co-extensive with DNase I hypersensitivity sites that undergo demethylation in lysozyme-expressing macrophages (27Klages S. Mollers B. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and is therefore likely to be functionally important. A major focus of our laboratory's research is the differentiation and function of respiratory tract epithelial cells. In this regard, it is interesting that the 5′-flanking regions of several genes selectively expressed in respiratory tract serous cells contain ETS protein-binding sites. Specifically, the motif is present flanking genes encoding proline-rich proteins (28Kim H.-S. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6712-6718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lactoferrin (29Johnston J.J. Rintels P. Chung J. Sather J. Benz E.J. Berliner N.

The presence of shared transcription factor-binding sites may denote the presence of a regulatory cascade that controls serous cell differentiation in a manner similar to that already described for more extensively studied tissues such as skeletal muscle (32Lassar A.

In summary, these studies provide the first information identifying transcription factors controlling lysozyme expression in epithelial cells. As bacteria become progressively more resistant to exogenously applied antibiotics, information regarding mechanisms controlling innate immunity, such as that provided by epithelial lysozyme, may offer important new therapeutic approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2056734015,"The G protein-coupled thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), mediates many of the actions of thrombin on cells including chemotaxis. In contrast to the reversible agonist binding that regulates signaling by most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), PAR1 is activated by an irreversible proteolytic mechanism. Although activated PAR1 is phosphorylated, uncoupled, and internalized like typical GPCRs, signal termination is additionally dependent on lysosomal degradation of cleaved and activated receptors. In the present study we exploit two PAR1 mutants to examine the link between chemotaxis and receptor shutoff. One, a carboxyl tail deletion mutant (Y397Z), is defective in phosphorylation and internalization. The other, a carboxyl tail chimeric receptor (P/S), is phosphorylated and internalized upon activation but recycles to the plasma membrane like reversibly activated GPCRs. Expression of these receptors in a hematopoietic cell line disrupted cell migration along thrombin gradients. Thrombin activation of cells expressing P/S or Y397Z resulted in persistent signaling independent of the continued presence of thrombin. Signaling in response to the soluble agonist peptide SFLLRN was reversible for P/S but persisted for Y397Z. Strikingly, cells expressing P/S responded chemokinetically to thrombin but chemotactically to SFLLRN. In contrast, Y397Z-mediated migration was largely chemokinetic to both agonists. These studies suggest that termination of PAR1 signaling at the level of the receptor is necessary for gradient detection and directional migration."

The molecular origins of cooperativity in the binding of NF-κB and HMG I(Y) to DNA are not well understood. Here we have examined the determinants of specificity in the binding of HMG I(Y), both alone and in cooperation with NF-κB, to two different DNA elements, PRDII from the interferon-β enhancer and IgκB from the immunoglobulin κ light chain enhancer. Of particular interest was the influence of a flanking AT-rich sequence on binding by HMG I(Y).

Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The expression of HMG I(Y) is normally very low in adult tissues, but is up-regulated in the rapidly proliferating cells found in embryonic and neoplastic tissues, leading to the suggestion that the HMG I(Y) gene might be directly involved in development and neoplasia (2Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMG I(Y) has also been implicated as a structural component involved in the condensation of AT-rich regions of mammalian chromosomes (3Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Reeves R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and has been shown to be a host protein required for integration by HIV-1 preintegration complexes in vitro (4Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).HMG I and HMG Y are isoforms produced by alternative splicing of a single functional pre-mRNA, with 11 internal amino acids present in HMG I but deleted in HMG Y (3Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Reeves R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); the function of this 11-amino acid stretch is not known, hence the two isoforms are designated interchangeably as HMG I(Y). HMG I(Y) and HMG I-C, the other member of HMG I(Y) family, are both small (∼10 kDa) proteins, which share three highly conserved basic regions arranged in tandem, in addition to an acidic COOH-terminal domain. The basic regions are essential for DNA binding, whereas the COOH-terminal domain facilitates sequence-specific interaction with DNA (5Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The consensus basic repeats possess a unique structure referred to as an “AT-hook,” which binds deeply into the minor groove of the AT-rich DNA recognition sites (6Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). HMG I proteins do not appear to function independently as transcriptional activators or repressors (12Landsman D. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4483-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), even though they possess an acidic domain reminiscent of that often found in many transcriptional activator proteins (13Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Instead, they bind to certain AT-rich sequences within or flanking transcription factor recognition sites, either enhancing (10Leger H. Sock E. Renner K. Grummt F. Wegner M. Mol. Cell.

Falvo J.V. Kim T.H. Kim T.K. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Wathelet M.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), which is transcriptionally activated upon viral infection. The gene enhancer consists of a negative regulatory domain NRDI (17Nourbakhsh M. Hoffmann K. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as well as four adjacent positive regulatory domains (PRDs) organized in the order: PRDII, PRDI-PRDIII, and PRDIV; these are recognized, respectively, by the transcription factors NF-κB (18Visvanathan K.V. Goodbourn S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), Ifn-regulatory factor 1 (19Fujita T. Kimura Y. Miyamoto M. Barsoumian E.L. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1989; 337: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2)/c-Jun (20Du W. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HMG I(Y) binds specifically to one site within NRDI, one site in PRDII, and two sites in PRDIV (5Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rather than four HMG I(Y) molecules individually contacting these four different sites, recent evidence indicate that two HMG I(Y) molecules bind the enhancer, with each protein molecule occupying two closely juxtaposed sites. Specifically, the second and third repeats of HMG I(Y) simultaneously bind PRDII and NRDI, whereas the second and first repeats bind the two sites within PRDIV (5Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In both cases, the tandem HMG I(Y)-binding sites are separated by one full helical turn, and the binding interaction is highly cooperative. All four HMG I(Y) sites within the enhancer are essential for optimal virus induction of the Ifn-β gene. The binding of HMG I(Y) to the minor groove of PRDII stimulates NF-κB binding to the major groove of the same site approximately 10-fold in vitro (11Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Similarly, the affinity of ATF-2 for PRDIV increases about 4-fold upon coincubation with HMG I(Y) (8Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Circular permutation and phasing analyses of Ifn-β gene enhancer revealed that the intrinsic DNA bends in the enhancer can be reversed by the binding of NF-κB and ATF-2/c-Jun, and further modulated by HMG I(Y) binding (22Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies establish an important role for HMG I(Y) as an accessory protein which mediates the assembly and function of the Ifn-β gene enhanceosome by promoting the cooperative binding of transcription factors to the enhancer (23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (298) Google Scholar).NF-κB is the prototype of the dimeric class of Rel proteins, members of which are characterized by the presence of an approximately 300-amino acid Rel homology region (RHR) that mediates protein-protein interactions, sequence-specific DNA recognition, and nuclear translocation (25Chytil M. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NF-κB plays a broad role in inducible and coordinate regulation of genes involved in inflammation, immune responses, cell growth and differentiation, and virus infection (26Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that NF-κB cooperates with HMG I(Y) at a variety of regulatory loci. In addition to the Ifn-β gene, HMG I(Y) has also been reported to enhance NF-κB activity on several other promoters including E-selectin (27Lewis H. Kaszubska W. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), interleukin-2/granulocyte-macrophate colony-stimulating factor (28Himes S.R. Coles L.S. Reeves R. Shannon M.F. Immunity. 1996; 5: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and chemokine MGSA/GRO α (29Wood L.D. Farmer A.A. Richmond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Despite the importance of the cooperative interactions between NF-κB and HMG I(Y), the mechanistic basis for this phenomenon is poorly understood. In principle, cooperative binding of NF-κB and HMG I(Y) to DNA could arise from either or both of two limiting scenarios: (i) the binding of one protein to its site might induce local structure changes in DNA that favor interaction of the other protein with its site; or (ii) NF-κB and HMG I(Y) might make favorable protein-protein contacts with each other. Consistent with the first scenario, HMG I(Y) can reduce the intrinsic DNA curvature of PRDII and enhance the reversal of PRDII bending by NF-κB (22Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In keeping with the second scenario, HMG I(Y) has been shown to bind both NF-κB and ATF-2 in GST fusion protein binding assays (8Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 9John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J.X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Leger H. Sock E. Renner K. Grummt F. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a procedure that can sometimes detect weak interactions that do not occur physiologically. Direct evidence has not been provided to show that NF-κB and HMG I(Y) can make energetically favorable contacts to each other on DNA recognition elements in vivo. Therefore, the contribution of direct protein-protein interactions to the cooperative binding of NF-κB and HMG I(Y) to DNA remains uncertain.To investigate this issue and further analyze the NF-κB/HMG I(Y)/DNA interaction interface, while avoiding the potential complexity arising from the abundant endogenous HMG I(Y) and NF-κB proteins in mammalian cells, we have reconstituted the core NF-κB·HMG I·DNA complex in yeast. Using this system, we investigated the DNA binding specificity of HMG I(Y) on two κB DNA motifs (the core NF-κB sites from PRDII and IgκB). We demonstrate that the discrimination of these two κB sites by HMG I(Y), in terms of both DNA recognition and cooperation with NF-κB, can be greatly enhanced by the presence of additional AT-rich sequences adjacent to the core κB DNA motifs. The use of yeast one-hybrid screening assays (30Peterson B.R. Sun L.J. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13671-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Sun L.J. Peterson B.R. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in combination with deletion and alanine-scanning mutagenesis (32Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) of HMG I enabled us to examine and compare mutations affecting NF-κB/HMG I cooperativity and HMG I/DNA recognition on the PRDII or IgκB site, which either alone or flanked by NRDI as in the context of the entire interferon response element (IRE, including PRDI, PRDII, and NRDI). Intriguingly, we find that the mutations affecting NF-κB/HMG I cooperative DNA binding also affect HMG I DNA affinity to a similar extent. While the residues most important for core NF-κB site recognition fall within the second basic repeat of HMG I, the third repeat is identified as being crucial for HMG I/PRDII-NRDI interaction. Further in vitrocharacterization of the protein-protein interaction independent of DNA revealed that the same mutations in the second repeat abolished the interaction of HMG I with NF-κB p50 as well. Therefore, binding sites for the same region of HMG I exist in both NF-κB p50 protein and κB DNA motifs. These data imply that the second repeat of HMG I, through either binding to κB DNA motifs, or interacting with NF-κB p50, or both, contributes the most to the cooperative binding of NF-κB and HMG I to DNA.DISCUSSIONThe enhanceosome model for transcriptional activation emphasizes the importance of cooperative interactions among regulatory proteins and the transcriptional apparatus as a means of stabilizing an initiation-competent complex (23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 24Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (298) Google Scholar). HMG I(Y) is unique in several respects among cooperative partners: (i) the protein is exceptionally broad in its DNA sequence preferences; (ii) HMG I(Y) contains no intrinsic transcriptional activation domain, and most probably acts only to enhance the affinity of its partner protein for DNA; and (iii) HMG I(Y) cooperates with an unusually diverse array of structurally unrelated proteins, including NF-κB, ATF-2/c-Jun, Tst-1, and Elf-1 (8Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 9John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J.X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Leger H. Sock E. Renner K. Grummt F. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). A major challenge is to understand how HMG I exerts such specific effects on transcription while exhibiting such apparent promiscuity in binding. The present studies were aimed at gaining insight into these issues through in vitro and in vivo analyses of HMG I and one of its cooperative partners, NF-κB.An intriguing clue to the mystery of specificity in HMG I/DNA interactions was gained by the observation that the tandem repeats in HMG I can interact simultaneously with appropriately phased AT-rich tracts in the interferon-β promoter (5Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This intramolecularly cooperative binding mode was found to enhance the affinity of HMG I/DNA interactions, thereby raising the possibility that specificity might also be affected. Indeed, our results confirm the fact that intramolecular cooperativity substantially strengthens HMG I/DNA interactions; furthermore, we find that the specificity of HMG I for tandem AT-rich sites is significantly increased over that for single sites alone. This dichotomy in DNA-binding mode by HMG I may help to explain the weak discrimination for the core PRDII versusIgκB sites observed in our studies, while others have reported stronger discrimination. A critical difference between these studies lies in the fact that we purposely excluded AT-rich flanking sequences from our core κB probes, whereas the naturally occurring DNA elements used previously contained such AT-rich flanking elements as a natural consequence of proper binding function. Remarkably, HMG I shows less than 5-fold discrimination for DNA containing a single AT-rich tract (PRDII) over mixed sequence DNA containing no AT-tract, but increases to nearly 20-fold when the AT-rich tract is linked to another in NRDI.The effect of tandem intramolecular binding by HMG I on its cooperation with NF-κB has not been examined previously. Here we find that the binding of HMG I to either the core PRDII or IgκB site does little if anything to stimulate NF-κB binding (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, HMG I powerfully stimulates the binding of NF-κB to the tandemly arrayed PRDII-NRDI site (Fig. 4 A). This stimulation does not appear to result simply from tandem intramolecular binding of HMG I, but rather in some more complex way from the DNA sequence, as little cooperativity between HMG I and NF-κB was evident on the IgκB-NRDI site (Fig. 4 A).What is the mechanism of cooperative DNA binding by HMG I and NF-κB on PRDII-NRDI? The near perfect correlation between the effects of mutations on reporter assays driven by HMG I alone and in the presence of NF-κB is most consistent with an indirect readout mechanism, wherein the binding of HMG I alters DNA structure so as to make it more favorable for NF-κB recognition. Indeed, the PRDII site contains an intrinsic bend, which is reversed upon NF-κB binding (22Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar); perhaps HMG I lowers the energetic cost of this reversal. Paradoxically, however, several alanine mutations that disturb HMG I-DNA binding and HMG I/NF-κB cooperation also weaken protein-protein interactions between HMG I and NF-κB (Fig. 7), suggesting the two proteins might cooperate through direct contacts as well. This paradox could be resolved if the very same residues in the second basic repeat of HMG I that contact DNA also contact NF-κB. As no experimental data are presently available to address this question, nor was a simple, direct and definitive experimental test immediately apparent, we turned to the NMR structure of the HMG I (51–90) fragment bound to DNA (6Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As revealed by this structure, a central Arg-Gly-Arg core (residues 58–60) in the second repeat of HMG I adopts an extended conformation and penetrates deep into the DNA minor groove. Importantly, NF-κB is bound exclusively in the major groove on the backside of DNA. From the perspective of this NMR structure, the spatial separation between the HMG I- and NF-κB-binding sites renders it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for multiple DNA contact residues of the HMG I second basic repeat to simultaneously contact residues of NF-κB. Either of two possibilities seems more likely: (i) protein-protein contacts between HMG I and NF-κB that are responsible for GST pull-down result from some weak interaction between the two proteins that bears no relevance to cooperative complex formation; or (ii) perhaps the overall structure of HMG I changes substantially with respect to DNA in going from the binary to ternary complexes, thereby allowing the protein to interact with both DNA and NF-κB using the second basic repeat.If NF-κB and HMG I cooperate by making mutually favorable alterations of DNA structure, then it is possible to rationalize straightforwardly the marked sequence dependence of cooperativity observed in our in vitro cooperativity assays (Fig.4 A). Specifically, binding of HMG I or NF-κB to one site may induce a DNA structure that favors binding of the other protein, whereas a different DNA sequence cannot adopt the same structure. It is noteworthy that one of the two base pairs that differ in the PRDII and IgκB sites is contacted directly by the p50 subunit of NF-κB: K244 of p50 hydrogen bonds to the T residue of the 5′-GGGAAATTCC-3′·5′-GGAATTTCCC-3′ (PRDII) or to the corresponding G residue in IgκB. Likewise, the NMR structure of HMG I peptide bound to DNA reveals that residues Arg-58, Gly-59, and Arg-60 (second repeat) or Arg-84, Gly-85, and Arg-86 (third repeat) make extensive minor groove contacts to both base pairs that differ in PRDII and IgκB (6Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The fact that both partners contact the same base pairs in PRDII and IgκB, although from different grooves, provides a clear mechanism for the two partners to communicate with one another through DNA. It stands to reason that the ability to communicate and thus bind DNA cooperatively should depend upon the covalent structure and conformation of the bound DNA sequence.The inability to pinpoint precisely the mechanism of cooperativity between HMG I and NF-κB reflects in no small part the inherent difficulty of studying proteins such as HMG I that exhibit relatively weak specificity, and possess little or no secondary or tertiary structure, even when bound to DNA. There exists a great need for new experimental approaches to study such problems. It is worth mentioning that even alanine-scanning mutagenesis fails to detect any potentially important interactions involving the polypeptide backbone and α-carbons, hence important information on cooperative binding may not be revealed with this technique.Three highly conserved basic regions in HMG I(Y) have been shown to be responsible for the specific recognition of AT-rich sequences (7Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, multiple copies of this motif are also found in several eukaryotic proteins that bind AT-rich sequences and whose genes are involved in chromosome translocations associated with human disease (44Tjaden G. Coruzzi G.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar, 45Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The interaction modes of the second and the third repeats with DNA have been illustrated in the HMG I (51–90)/DNA NMR structure (6Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In our study, we mutated residues in each basic repeat to alanines in the context of full-length HMG I and then assayed the binding activity of each mutant in vivo and in vitro. On a single AT-rich binding site, the second repeat seems to make the greatest energetic contribution to the overall protein-DNA interaction, as judged by the strong effect of mutations in this region. Nevertheless, high-affinity binding of HMG I can be achieved through simultaneous interactions of multiple basic motifs with multiple AT tracts located in close proximity to each other (21Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This multivalent HMG I DNA binding was indeed the case on the Ifn-β gene enhancer: simultaneous contacts were observed with either the second and third repeats to PRDII and NRDI within IRE, or the second and first repeats to two sites within PRDIV (5Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Being the most specific DNA-binding region in HMG I, the second repeat also shows the highest DNA binding affinity, being 10–100-fold greater than those of the other two repeats (6Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that the second repeat is the most important region for HMG I/DNA binding. The molecular details of inter- and intra-molecularly cooperative binding by HMG I await further investigation.

Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The expression of HMG I(Y) is normally very low in adult tissues, but is up-regulated in the rapidly proliferating cells found in embryonic and neoplastic tissues, leading to the suggestion that the HMG I(Y) gene might be directly involved in development and neoplasia (2Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Phosphorylation of Thr-177 expands the substrate specificity of CaM KI and is not merely an “on-off” switch for kinase activity. Protein phosphorylation plays a regulatory role in signal transduction for many physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. Frequently, both receptor and nonreceptor kinases not only phosphorylate cellular proteins to elicit biological responses, but are also phosphoproteins themselves. Phosphorylation of kinases by either autophosphorylation in response to ligand binding, in the case of receptor kinases, or by an upstream kinase, in the case of nonreceptor kinases, is an important step in the signal transduction cascade. The regulatory phosphorylation event(s) usually occur on a single (or multiple) residue(s) located in a region termed the activation loop between kinase subdomains VII and VIII.

In all of these cases, activation loop phosphorylation markedly activates the protein kinase, and the phosphorylated form of the kinase is thought to be physiologically relevant. For example, mutation of Tyr-1007 to Ala in the Janus 2 kinase eliminated activity, and the mutant could not restore erythropoietin signaling in cells lacking Janus 2 kinase (12Feng J.

A second example of the biological significance of activation loop phosphorylation is the phosphorylation of Iκ-B kinase α by the NF-κB-inducing kinase. A mutated Iκ-B kinase α in which the activating Ser-176 was changed to Ala acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB activation (21Ling L. Cao Z.

In the crystal structure of PKA, Thr-197 is phosphorylated, and the phosphate makes electrostatic contacts with the small and large lobes of the kinase. These contacts were proposed to facilitate both ATP and peptide substrate binding (22Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Biochemical analysis of PKA confirmed that the phosphate of Thr-197 is required for both ATP binding as well as efficient phosphate transfer to the peptide substrate (25Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S.

When PKA is expressed in bacteria, Thr-197 phosphorylation occurs by autophosphorylation, but in mammalian cells Thr-197 may be phosphorylated by another protein kinase. Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 can phosphorylate and activate PKA in vitro (27Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two members of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent family of protein kinases, CaM KI and IV, are activated by upstream kinases (28Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D.

Activation loop phosphorylation of CaM KI and CaM KIV by CaM kinase kinase A and CaM KKB, both of which are also members of the CaM kinase family, increases enzyme activity 10–50-fold (30Edelman A.M.

These data provide compelling evidence that phosphorylation of CaM KI and IV is a physiological response to signals that increase intracellular Ca2+ with these kinases serving as intermediates in signal transduction cascades. Recent data from Chin et al. (36Chin D. Winkler K.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31235-31240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) revealed that Thr-177-dephosphorylated CaM KI has one of the highest specific activities reported for any protein kinase, and peptide substrates could show greater than 400-fold differences in specificities. These surprising observations raised the possibility that activation loop phosphorylation of CaM KI may not be essential for kinase activity but could modulate substrate specificity. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation is not an absolute requirement for CaM KI activity but, indeed, serves to expand the peptide substrate specificity of the enzyme. We have also found that CaM KIV is regulated in a similar manner. CaM KI and IV, therefore, represent the first kinases whose peptide substrate specificity has been shown to be regulated by activation loop phosphorylation and raises the possibility that such control may be extended to members of other protein kinase families.

Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by mild sonication at 4 °C. The cell debris was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatants were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose columns, extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with 10 mmglutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Purity of enzyme preparations was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzymes were aliquoted in 40% glycerol, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Enzymes were thawed and used once only. The rat CaM KKB gene was isolated and subcloned into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England Biolabs) as described (35Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.-H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The KKB 1–487 mutant was generated by by PCR by placing a stop codon immediately after amino acid residue 487. The PCR product was subcloned into the pMAL-c2X vector and sequenced in its entirety. Protein was induced as above. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm phosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA. Lysates were loaded onto an amylose column and washed with 12–15 column volumes of buffer containing 10 mm phosphate, 0.5m NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA. The fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm maltose in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6. The MBP-KKB was analyzed and handled as described for CaM KI. The concentrations of KKB and CaM KI were determined using the Lowry assay with some modifications (38Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7105) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Bovine CaM concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Synapsin-(4–13) and the alcohol dehydrogenase repressor peptides (ADR1)-(222–234)G233 peptides were synthesized by Dr. David Klapper at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and quantified by amino acid analysis. (Dr. William Abrams, University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine). All other peptides were quantified by phenylalanine absorption at 257 nm and standardized to the known concentrations of synapsin-(4–13) and ADR1-(222–234)G233. CaM KI or IV activity was assayed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and varying concentrations of CaM, ATP, and peptide substrate in a volume of 40–50 μl. Assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme or, in the cases of pre-incubation, by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) and substrate. Pre-incubation and assay times varied and are described in the figure legends. Reactions were terminated by spotting the mixture on P81 phosphocellulose filter papers (39DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Brautigan D.L. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13466-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P81 filters were washed 3 times for 1 h in either 75 mm phosphoric acid for peptide kinase assays or in 20% trichloroacidic acid (Fig. 1), rinsed in 100% acetone, and air dried. Incorporation of 32Piinto peptide or enzyme was quantified using a Beckman LS 6000 scintillation spectrometer. For kinetic analyses the 5 or 6 ATP concentrations ranged from 400 to 5000 μm. ADR1-(222–234)G233, peptides containing variations of ADR1, and the LKK and LRR-synapsin-(4–13) peptides were assayed at 5 concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000 μm for 10 min with 1 ng of Thr-177 dephospho-CaM KI or for 5 min with 1 ng of Thr-177 phospho-CaM KI. The synapsin-(4–13) peptide and variants other than the LKK and LRR peptides were assayed at 5 concentrations ranging from 50 to 1200 μm for 15 min with 1 ng of Thr-177 dephospho-CaM KI and for 5 min with 1 ng of Thr-177 phospho-CaM KI. The CaM concentration for all kinetic studies was 1 μm. KKB did not phosphorylate any of the peptides used for these studies. Kinetic constants were determined by using the KaleidaGraph program. The general curve fit option of this program was used to apply Michaelis-Menten equations to directly fit the raw data using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Peptides (200 μm) were phosphorylated in the standard assay buffer containing 500 μm ATP for 5 min using 5 ng of Thr-177 dephospho-CaM KI. Reactions were stopped by the addition of protein sample buffer to a final concentration of 2X 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol. An eighth of the reaction mixture was electrophoresed on 20% Laemmli gels in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 200 mm tricine, and 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to film. The radioactive bands were carefully excised and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The procedure was similar to Kemp et al. (40Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Bio-Rad anion exchange resin AG1 × 8 (acetate form) was equilibrated in water, and the buffer was then changed to 30% acetic acid. Prior to the experiments, the ATP binding capacity of the resin was monitored by absorbance at 259 nm so >95% of the ATP bound. Chimeric peptides were phosphorylated by 5 ng of CaM KI for 5 min in the presence of 500 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a volume of 40 μl. Reactions were stopped by adding 360 μl of 30% acetic acid. The reactions were loaded onto individual AG1 × 8 columns at 4 °C. The flow through and 6-ml 30% acetic acid washes were counted by a Beckman LS 6000 scintillation spectrometer in the 3H channel (Cherenkov radiation). CaM KI has been shown to be activated by phosphorylation on Thr-177, a residue residing in the activation loop (28Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), by two distinct Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases. The smaller kinase (64 kDa), designated CaM kinase kinase A, was identical to the reported CaM KIV kinase (41Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), whereas CaM KKB (68 kDa) was a novel CaM KK (30Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

We have isolated a cDNA encoding CaM KKB from both human and rat brain libraries, expressed the rat kinase as a maltose-binding fusion protein, and examined its properties (35Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.-H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Here we asked whether recombinant CaM KKB can phosphorylate CaM KI as does its tissue-purified counterpart (28Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R.

Recombinant CaM KKB catalyzes a time-dependent phosphorylation of CaM KI to approximately 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme (Fig.1). The extent of phosphate incorporation at Thr-177 directly correlates with the degree of CaM KI kinase activity. 2S. S. Hook and A. R. Means, unpublished observations. In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, KKB also autophosphorylates to a stoichiometry of 0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme (Fig. 1), but this autophosphorylation does not alter KKB activity (35Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.-H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of Thr-177 phosphorylation on the kinetics of peptide phosphorylation, we stoichiometrically phosphorylated CaM KI using recombinant KKB and examined changes in its ability to phosphorylate the most extensively studied CaM KI peptide substrate, synapsin-(4–13). This peptide, LRRRLS9DANF, is derived from the sequence surrounding site 1, LRRRLS9DSNF, of synapsin. We determined that Thr-177 dephospho-CaM KI has aK m for the synapsin-(4–13) peptide of 209 μm and a V max of 26.1 μmol/min/mg (Table I). After CaM KI phosphorylation by recombinant KKB, the K m for synapsin-(4–13) decreases 44-fold (209 to 4.7 μm) and the V max increases to 65.5 μmol/min/mg. After Thr-177 phosphorylation, the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, as indicated by V max/K m, increases 107-fold.Table IKinetic analysis of synapsin-(4–13), ADR1-(222–234)G233, and chimeric peptidesDephospho-CaM KIaThe results shown in the table represent an average of four experiments for dephospho-CaM KI and one experiment for phospho-CaM KI.V max/K mPhospho-CaM KIaThe results shown in the table represent an average of four experiments for dephospho-CaM KI and one experiment for phospho-CaM KI.V max/K mK mV maxK mV maxμmμmol/min/mgSynapsin-(4–13)LRRRLSDANF20926.10.134.765.513.94ADR1-(222–234)G233LKKLTRRASFSGQ17.439.41.987.187.012.25MYNLRRRLS FSGQ2788.20.03NDbND, not determined.LKKLTRRAS DANF32.033.61.054.1238.379.31LRRLTRRASFSGQ59.838.90.658.5846.085.37LKK LRRRLSDANF6.740.46.032.8963.3321.91LRRLRRRLSDANF18.736.71.9613.7167.174.90The underlined type represents the sequences from synapsin, and the bold type represents the sequences from ADR1.a The results shown in the table represent an average of four experiments for dephospho-CaM KI and one experiment for phospho-CaM KI.b ND, not determined.

Phosphorylation within the autoinhibitory and CaM binding domains of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (43Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (44Conti M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3178-3181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is known to affect enzyme activation by CaM. To address whether activation loop phosphorylation of CaM KI affects its sensitivity to CaM, we determined the concentration of CaM required to produce 50% maximal enzyme activity (K CaM) with Thr-177 dephospho- and phospho-CaM KI. CaM KI (10 ng) was phosphorylated for 20 min by 400 ng of 1–487 KKB in the presence of 20 nm CaM. The 1–487 KKB is a constitutively active truncation mutant from which the C-terminal autoinhibitory and CaM binding domains were removed. Thus, the CaM included in the preincubation mixture served only to bind CaM KI and expose Thr-177 to KKB (28Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After the 20 min preincubation, the reaction mixture was diluted 200-fold in the presence of EGTA. This effectively decreased the concentration of CaM. The CaM activation curve was then generated by assaying CaM KI activity toward synapsin-(4–13) in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2and CaM concentrations ranging from 100 pm to 1 μm (Fig. 2). In this experiment, representative of five, the K CaM for Thr-177 dephospho-CaM KI was 14.0 ± 0.95 nm. The CaM curve for Thr-177 phospho-CaM KI was left-shifted from that of the Thr-177 dephospho-CaM KI and the KCaM 4-fold lower or 3.7 ± 0.39 nm. Thus, Thr-177 phosphorylation causes a decrease not only in the peptide K m but also in theK CaM of CaM KI. ADR1 is phosphorylated by PKA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (45Denis C.L. Fontaine S.C. Chase D. Kemp B.E. Bemis L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A peptide surrounding the PKA phosphorylation site has also been shown to be a good substrate for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CaM KIV (45Denis C.L. Fontaine S.C. Chase D. Kemp B.E. Bemis L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and CaM KI (36Chin D. Winkler K.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31235-31240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have tested 10 variants of ADR1 and found that substitutions at positions within the synapsin-(4–13) peptide, which were shown to be critical or dispensable for phosphorylated CaM KI by Lee et al. (46Lee J.C. Kwon Y.G. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2054273229,"The recovery of enzymatic activity during the folding of muscle acylphosphatase and two single residue mutants (proline 54 to alanine and proline 71 to alanine) from 7m urea has been monitored and compared with the development of intrinsic fluorescence emission. Fluorescence measurements reveal the presence in the wild-type protein of a major rapid refolding phase followed by a second low amplitude slow phase. The slow phase is absent in the fluorescence trace acquired with the proline 54 to alanine mutant, suggesting the involvement of this proline residue in the fluorescence-detected slow phase of the wild-type protein. The major kinetic phase is associated with a considerable recovery of enzymatic activity, indicating that a large fraction of molecules refolds with effective two-state behavior. The use of time-resolved enzymatic activity as a probe to follow the folding process reveals, however, the presence of another exponential slow phase arising from proline 71. This slow phase is not observable by utilizing optical probes, indicating that, unlike proline 54, thecis to trans isomerization of proline 71 can take place in an intermediate possessing a native-like fold. We suggest that, although spectroscopically silent and structurally insignificant, the cis-trans interconversion of proline residues in native-like intermediates may be crucial for the generation of enzymatic activity of functional enzymes.

We suggest that, although spectroscopically silent and structurally insignificant, the cis-trans interconversion of proline residues in native-like intermediates may be crucial for the generation of enzymatic activity of functional enzymes. The conversion of a polypeptide chain, newly synthesized from the information contained within the cellular DNA, into a native and functional protein is a key aspect of the conversion of genetic information into biological activity. This process, called protein folding, is achieved with very great efficiency compared with a random search process. Moreover, it is now well accepted that small proteins can fold in vitro without the assistance of any other protein, indicating that the information for the refolding process is contained in the sequence, and the question of how this is encoded is one of the most intriguing as well as difficult problems in structural biology. A detailed study of the mechanism of protein folding is experimentally challenging because of the very large number of atoms and interactions present in the native state of a protein. Modern views of protein folding have pointed to the existence of an enormous number of conformations through which the polypeptide chains can in principle pass to attain the native state. The sequence of conformations traversed in the search for the native state may vary substantially between different protein molecules, a consideration that has shifted the attention of theoreticians and experimentalists from the concept of a single pathway to that of a multiplicity of pathways or trajectories in protein folding reactions (1Dill K.A. Chan K.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, 2Dobson C.M. Sali A. Karplus M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998; 37: 868-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Due to the complexity of the problem, an understanding of protein folding and the description of the events that occur upon passing from the unfolded to the native state requires a combination of experimental techniques. One approach that has proved to be extremely valuable involves the utilization of protein engineering methods to probe the contributions to efficient folding of individual residues within the protein. This can provide a detailed description of the likely structures of intermediates and transition states involved in the folding process (3Matouschek A. Kellis J.T. Serrano L. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1989; 340: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 4Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 260-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Other important contributions to our understanding of protein folding mechanisms have been provided by biophysical studies aimed at monitoring the folding process in real time by means of a series of probes, such as intrinsic fluorescence, far- and near-UV circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, and ligand binding, each of which can monitor specifically the acquisition of native-like structure as it develops (5Plaxco K.W. Dobson C.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to monitor the folding process of human muscle acylphosphatase (AcP) 1The abbreviations AcPhuman muscle acylphosphataseHFIPhexafluoroisopropyl alcoholPPIpeptidylprolyl isomerase by means of time-resolved measurements of enzymatic activity. AcP is a 98-residue protein characterized by two antiparallel α-helices packed against a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1) (6Saudek V. Boyd J. Williams R.J.P. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Pastore A. Saudek V. Ramponi G. Williams R.J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Taddei N. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Structure. 1997; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It contains two proline residues at positions 54 and 71, both in a transconfiguration in the native state (Fig.1). No disulfide bridges or cofactors are present. The protein used in the present work is a mutated form of AcP where the cysteine residue at position 21 has been replaced with a serine residue to avoid the complexities originating from a free sulfydryl group (9van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of AcP is associated with the hydrolysis of acylphosphates. Substrates of this enzyme are species formed during the normal activity of cells, such as 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, carbamoyl phosphate, succinyl phosphate, and the β-aspartyl phosphate associated with membrane pumps as well as synthetic acylphosphates such as acetyl phosphate and benzoylphosphate (10Stefani M. Ramponi G. Life Chem. Rep. 1995; 12: 271-301Google Scholar). human muscle acylphosphatase hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol peptidylprolyl isomerase AcP has been shown to fold in an apparent two-state fashion without the accumulation of intermediates (9van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A low amplitude slow phase of folding, detected with optical probes and NMR, in concurrence with the main exponential phase, has been attributed to a small fraction of molecules where cis to trans isomerization of a peptidylprolyl bond has to take place in the denatured state prior to the development of the native fold (9van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, which proline residue is involved in such a step is not yet clear. By combining intrinsic fluorescence emission and enzymatic activity as probes to follow the folding of wild-type AcP and two proline mutants (P54A and P71A), we have been able to establish a detailed folding scheme for AcP and detect an additional slow proline isomerization step that has not been observed using conventional techniques. The nature and characteristics of this step give new insight into the significance of prolinecis-trans isomerization in mechanisms of protein folding. The protein used in the present work is the C21S mutant of AcP. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described by Taddei et al. (11Taddei N. Stefani M. Magherini F. Chiti F. Modesti A. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7077-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). AcP expression and purification was performed according to Modesti et al. (12Modesti A. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Colombini B. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by UV absorption using an ε280value of 1.42 mlmg−1 cm−1 for wild type and mutants of AcP. Benzoylphosphate was synthesized and purified as described by Camici et al. (13Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. Experientia. 1976; 32: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade. The equilibrium urea-induced unfolding of wild-type and mutated AcP was studied at 28 °C using intrinsic fluorescence emission as a probe. A Perkin-Elmer LS 50 B spectrofluorimeter was used with excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 335 nm, respectively. Each titration curve was obtained by determining the fluorescence of 27 equilibrated samples containing 0.04 mg/ml AcP in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and various urea concentrations and was fitted to the equation, y={(yf+mf[urea])+(yu+mu[urea])exp[−ΔG(H2O)/RT+m[urea]/RT]}/{1+exp[−ΔG(H2O)/RT+m[urea]/RT]}Equation 1 where y f, m f,y u and m u are the intercepts and slopes of the pre- and post-transition base lines, ΔG(H2O) is the free-energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, and m is the dependence of ΔG on urea concentration (14Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The half-denaturation urea concentration, C m, was determined by dividing ΔG(H2O) by the m value obtained from the fitting. One-dimensional1H NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 50 mm acetate-d 3 buffer, 10% D2O, pH 3.8, using a home-built spectrometer operating at 500.0 MHz and were processed using FELIX 2.3 (Hare Research). The water resonance was presaturated by selective irradiation during the 1.5-s relaxation delay. 1024 scans were taken using a spectral width of 6666.7 Hz. 1H chemical shifts are given relative to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane5-sulfonate. Folding of wild-type AcP and the mutant proteins was studied using an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter. Folding was initiated by mixing the protein denatured in 7 m urea with a refolding solution. The final conditions after mixing were as follows: 0.63 murea, 2.27% hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (3.63% for P54A mutant), 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 28 °C. Small amounts of hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol were added to accelerate the fast phase of folding in order to separate it from the slower phase and allow its clear observation (9van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The folding reaction was studied by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence change above 320 nm (excitation wavelength, 280 nm) and by fitting the kinetic traces to single or double exponential functions for the determination of the relevant kinetic parameters. No significant differences in the parameters derived from the best fits (rate constants and relative amplitudes) were found when the folding process was monitored using different excitation wavelengths such as 225, 280, and 295 nm. The Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow device was also used to study the recovery of enzymatic activity during the refolding of wild-type and P54A AcP. Because of its lack of enzymatic activity, this analysis could not be performed on the P71A mutant of AcP. AcP denatured in 7 m urea was mixed with a refolding solution containing benzoylphosphate as a substrate. The final conditions for individual experiments are reported in the figure legends. In all cases, the decay of 283-nm absorbance, derived from the AcP-catalyzed hydrolysis of benzoylphosphate (15Ramponi G. Treves C. Guerritore A.

From the time course of the absorbance, the change of enzymatic activity during the folding reaction can be obtained as follows. The rate for the AcP-catalyzed hydrolysis of substrate is given by the equation, v=6·104(−d[S]/dt)Equation 2 where v is the hydrolysis rate in IU/ml, [S] is the substrate concentration, and 6·104 is a factor to convert the hydrolysis rate from m/s into IU/ml. We define the relative absorbance, A rel, as the ratio between the observed absorbance and the initial value of absorbance before the commencement of the reaction. Following the Beer-Lambert law and the approximation that only the substrate contributes significantly to the overall absorbance of the solution, the first derivative ofA rel with respect to time is given by the equation, dArel/dt=(1/[S]0)(d[S]/dt)Equation 3 where [S]0 is the initial substrate concentration. Combining Equations 3 and 2, we obtain the dependence of the enzymatic activity on dA rel/dt, v=−6.104[S]0(dArel/dt)Equation 4 From every time-resolved trace of A rel, values of dA rel/dt were calculated at time intervals of 0.4 or 4 s. By means of Equation 4, dA rel/dt was converted intov using a value of 5 mm for [S]0(the initial concentration used in the experiment). As a result, the time course of the hydrolysis rate (v) was determined up to completion of folding. In our experiments, a saturating concentration of substrate was chosen ([S]0 is more than 10 times higher than the Michaelis constant (K M). Moreover, a low protein concentration was chosen so that the depletion of substrate was slow enough to maintain such saturating conditions until the completion of folding. In these circumstances, the hydrolysis rate is independent of substrate concentration and can be taken as a direct measure of the concentration of catalytically active enzyme,i.e. enzymatic activity. This procedure allows the time-resolved changes of enzymatic activity to be determined throughout the folding reaction. Two mutants of AcP, each having single amino acid substitutions at the position of the two proline residues (P54A and P71A), were generated in order to investigate the consequences of these substitutions on the structure, stability, and enzymatic activity of AcP. TableI summarizes the steady-state kinetic parameters for the enzymatic activity of wild-type and mutated AcP. The replacement of Pro54 with an alanine residue does not cause significant changes in the substrate binding affinity of the protein and allows nearly 100% of specific activity to persist in the mutated enzyme. This indicates that the amino acid substitution has not caused a significant change in the geometry of the active site. Different arguments apply to the P71A mutant of AcP, since the specific activity is reduced to <1% in this mutant (Table I). The removal of Pro71 also has major consequences for the conformational stability of AcP, as inferred by urea-induced denaturation experiments (Fig. 2). The P71A mutant denatures at urea concentrations substantially lower than wild-type AcP, and the thermodynamic analysis of the urea denaturation curves acquired at equilibrium shows that the free energy of unfolding is reduced byca. 6 kJ mol−1 (Table I). The substitution of alanine for Pro54 is also destabilizing, but to a substantially smaller extent (Table I).Table IEnzymatic activity and stability parameters of wild-type AcP and its proline mutantsSpecific activityaData obtained in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.3, at 25 °C, using benzoylphosphate as a substrate (15).K maData obtained in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.3, at 25 °C, using benzoylphosphate as a substrate (15).ΔG(H2O)bData obtained from equilibrium urea denaturation curves acquired in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 28 °C and analyzed according to Santoro and Bolen (14).Uream valuebData obtained from equilibrium urea denaturation curves acquired in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 28 °C and analyzed according to Santoro and Bolen (14).C mbData obtained from equilibrium urea denaturation curves acquired in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 28 °C and analyzed according to Santoro and Bolen (14).

Open table in a new tab The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of wild-type AcP and the two mutants were acquired in order to investigate the extent of the structural changes caused by the amino acid substitutions (Fig.3). The spectra of both mutants exhibit a substantial chemical shift dispersion, indicating that the two mutations do not lead to overall denaturation of AcP. The spectrum of the P71A mutant shows marked differences with respect to the spectrum of wild-type AcP with substantial changes in many of the chemical shifts. As an example, we focus attention on three well resolved and assigned resonances 2van Nuland, N. A. J., unpublished results. in the aliphatic region (the methyl group resonances of Val20, Leu65, and Ala30) and on two resonances in the aromatic region (the indole NH proton resonances of Trp38and Trp64). In the P71A mutant, the Leu65methyl group resonances (positioned at 0.04 ppm in the wild-type spectrum) move downfield under the unresolved peak at 0.22 ppm, which contains the methyl group resonances of Ala30 and Val20. At the same time, a peak appears at 0.14 ppm, most probably belonging to Val20 (the chemical shift of the Val20 resonance in the wild-type spectrum is 0.22 ppm). In the wild-type NMR spectrum there is a peak at 0.27 ppm belonging to Ala30 that is probably shifted under the unresolved peak close to 0.22 ppm in the mutant spectrum. The two peaks of Trp38 and Trp64 overlap in the spectrum of the wild-type protein. While the chemical shift of Trp38maintains its wild-type value, that of Trp64 undergoes a shift of 0.3 ppm in the P71A mutant. Val20 is relatively close to Pro71 in the structure (within 7 Å), and more importantly, it is located in the catalytic loop involving residues 15–21. Leu65 and Trp64 do not interact directly with Pro71(their side chains are more than 8 Å apart), while Ala30is positioned in the C-terminal region of the first α-helix at the other side of the active site. The fact that the substitution of Pro71 by alanine causes a general change in the NMR spectrum of the protein indicates that this mutation leads to the reorganization of the positions of a number of the protein residues. These structural changes appear extended rather than localized and involve a significant number of residues other than those immediately close to the mutation site. A less dramatic structural change is caused by the mutation of Pro54. In the spectrum of the P54A mutant, all of the peaks considered in our analysis undergo only minor shifts, and the similarity of the overall spectrum to that of the wild-type protein is far more evident than for the P71A mutant (Fig.3). Fig. 4 shows the fluorescence changes measured during the folding of the wild-type and mutated forms of AcP. The relevant kinetic parameters are summarized in TableII. In the wild-type protein, two exponential phases are evident, and the calculated amplitudes and rate constants are in close agreement with those reported previously under the same conditions (9van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The folding kinetics of the P71A mutant are very similar to those of the wild-type protein (Table II). What is of particular interest in this analysis is that the relative amplitude of the slow phase in the P71A mutant is the same as that of the slow phase in the refolding of the wild-type protein. This rules out the possibility that the cis-trans isomerization of Pro71 is the origin of the slow phase of folding that is detectable with optical probes.Table IIKinetic parameters for folding of wild-type AcP and its proline mutantsk fastA fastk slowA slows −1%s −1%Intrinsic fluorescence emissionWild typeaConditions: 0.63 m urea, 2.27% HFIP, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 28 °C.0.79 ± 0.1086.9 ± 1.00.076 ± 0.01013.1 ± 1.0P71AaConditions: 0.63 m urea, 2.27% HFIP, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 28 °C.0.70 ± 0.1086.2 ± 1.00.070 ± 0.01013.8 ± 1.0P54AaConditions: 0.63 m urea, 2.27% HFIP, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 28 °C.0.17 ± 0.02100P54AbConditions as in Footnote a with the exception of 3.64% HFIP.0.41 ± 0.05100Enzymatic activityWild typeaConditions: 0.63 m urea, 2.27% HFIP, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 28 °C.0.75 ± 0.2052 ± 100.033 ± 0.00848 ± 8P71AaConditions: 0.63 m urea, 2.27% HFIP, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 28 °C.NDcND, not determined.NDNDNDP54AbConditions as in Footnote a with the exception of 3.64% HFIP.0.41 ± 0.1184 ± 60.027 ± 0.00816 ± 7P54A + PPIdConditions: 2 μm PPI, 0.18 m urea, 3.64% HFIP, 90 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 28 °C.0.38 ± 0.1010000Folding of wild type and P54A and P71A mutants of AcP was followed by fluorescence and enzymatic activity measurements.

See “Experimental Procedures” for further details. The P54A mutant exhibits different behavior. Its folding rate is remarkably slow compared with that of the wild-type protein, and the fluorescence trace fits very well to a single exponential function (Table II). The experiment was repeated under slightly different conditions (in the presence of 3.64% (v/v) hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol) in order to perturb the folding kinetics and therefore investigate the possible existence of any minor phase that could be masked by the presence of the major folding process. It is known that the fast phase of folding of the wild-type protein is substantially accelerated by the addition of hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol, while the slow phase is virtually unaffected (9van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The trace reported in Fig. 4for the P54A mutant is that acquired under these conditions, and the fitting procedure reveals again the presence of a single phase. This allows the conclusion to be drawn that cis-transisomerization of the Gly53–Pro54 peptide bond is entirely responsible for the slow phase of wild-type AcP folding. Given that the isomerization of the Gly53–Pro54 peptide bond is the origin of the slow phase of AcP folding, the question naturally arises as to the effect of cis-trans isomerization of the Ser70–Pro71 peptide bond in the folding of this small protein. To investigate this further, the time course of recovery of the enzymatic activity of AcP during folding has been studied. When benzoylphosphate is used as a substrate, the enzymatic activity is proportional to the rate of decay of the substrate-derived absorbance (15Ramponi G. Treves C. Guerritore A. Experientia. 1966; 22: 705-710Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the change of benzoylphosphate absorbance in a series of experiments.Trace 1 derives from a control experiment performed by mixing a 7 m urea solution containing the substrate with a 7 m urea solution containing denatured wild-type AcP. The absorbance does not change significantly with time, indicating that no substrate hydrolysis takes place, a result consistent with the denaturing conditions. Trace 2 also corresponds to a control experiment in which native AcP was mixed with a solution containing the substrate in which the native state of the protein is stable. In this case, a considerable enzymatic activity exists as revealed by the regular decrease of absorbance. In the experiment corresponding to trace 3, AcP denatured in 7 m urea was mixed with a refolding solution containing the substrate. The rate of substrate hydrolysis can be seen to increase as the protein refolds until a maximum and constant level of acylphosphatase activity is reached. The absorbance traces corresponding to wild-type AcP and the P54A variant were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to yield plots showing the increase of enzymatic activity upon folding (Fig. 6). These plots can be fitted satisfactorily to a double exponential function, and the kinetic parameters obtained by the fitting procedure are reported in Table II. For the wild-type protein, the rate constant for the fast phase obtained using this procedure is in good agreement with that measured by using fluorescence as a probe to follow the folding reaction. Nevertheless, the rate constant of the slow phase of the development of enzymatic activity is somewhat lower than that measured by fluorescence. Moreover, the relative amplitude of the slow phase appears to be ∼48 ± 8% by enzymatic activity measurements, a value considerably different from that of 13 ± 1% calculated by monitoring the folding reaction with intrinsic fluorescence. The enzymatic activity analysis applied to the P54A mutant reveals the presence of a low amplitude slow phase that is not detectable by probing the folding process using fluorescence (compare Figs.4 C and 6 B). In addition, this phase is significantly slower than the fluorescence-detected slow phase of the wild-type protein. In the presence of peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPI), an enzyme catalyzing specifically the cis-transinterconversion of peptidylprolyl bonds, this slow phase appears to be dramatically accelerated (PPI, Fig. 6 C), identifying Pro71, the only proline residue present in the mutant, as the origin of this folding-associated conformational change. The main kinetic phase in the folding of AcP is associated with the formation of a functional and catalytically active enzyme, confirming previous findings that a large fraction of AcP molecules folds in a cooperative two-state manner (9van Nuland N.A.J. Chiti F. Taddei N. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The substitution of Pro54 leads to the disappearance of the fluorescence-detected slow phase. This slow phase of folding is accelerated with great efficiency by PPI. It possesses the same relative amplitude (13 ± 2%) when the folding process is monitored by fluorescence, far-UV circular dichroism, or time-resolved NMR, and its rate is independent of urea or hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol concentration (9van Nuland N.A.J.

This pathway is also inhibited by treatments such as 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dGlc) or glucose deprivation that inhibit glycolysis and lead to significant decreases in cellular ATP and other trinucleotides. We sought to determine whether glucosamine's effect on capacitative Ca2+ entry was also due to ATP depletion, as has been suggested recently for its link to insulin resistance. In contrast to brief treatments with 2dGlc, there was no significant decrease in ATP following exposure to glucosamine. In addition, the 2dGlc-mediated inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx was reversed by staurosporine, a microbial alkaloid that inhibits a broad range of protein kinases. Staurosporine was also able to reverse the inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry seen following other treatments that decreased cellular ATP levels, including cytochalasin B and iodoacetic acid. Other inhibitors of protein kinase C, including bisindolylmaleimide, K252a, H-7, and calphostin C, were unable to mimic this effect of staurosporine. However, the inhibition of capacitative Ca2+influx in the presence of glucosamine was not reversed by staurosporine. These data indicate that the inhibitory action on capacitative Ca2+ entry of glucosamine is distinct from that caused by ATP depletion.

They also showed that inhibition of glucose flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway prevented hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance from developing. These results have been extended to show that insulin resistance develops in animals infused with glucosamine (4Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin.

Glucosamine has also received attention in the lay press (12Theodosakis J. Adderly B. Fox B. The Arthritis Cure.

It has been suggested that glucosamine's efficacy is due to a stimulation in the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and other glycoconjugates (12Theodosakis J. Adderly B. Fox B. The Arthritis Cure.

Here, we present data that suggest an alternative mechanism to explain at least some of glucosamine's effects. In macrophages and other nonexcitable cells, Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane is triggered by the depletion of Ca2+ from intracellular, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive stores. The formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is not a prerequisite for this influx to be initiated, as release of Ca2+ from these stores by other means, including an inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, can cause this influx pathway to be activated (15Thastrup O.

Thus influx has been termed store-operated (16Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar) or capacitative Ca2+ entry (17Putney Jr., J.W.

This suggests that different protein kinases may be active at different steps in the regulation of this pathway and that the balance among antagonistic regulatory reactions dependent on protein phosphorylation may dictate the time dependence and/or steady-state level of Ca2+ influx. Here, these issues were investigated in cells in which ATP had been depleted with several inhibitors of glycolysis, including 2-deoxyglucose (2dGlc). 1The abbreviations 2dGlc2-deoxy-d-glucoseHBSHepes-buffered saline solutionGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateTgthapsigarginstpstaurosporine Following ATP depletion capacitative Ca2+ entry is inhibited, as might be expected if an activating kinase were operating less than optimally. However, in the presence of staurosporine a balance in regulation appears to be re-achieved such that capacitative Ca2+ entry is substantially restored. 2-deoxy-d-glucose Hepes-buffered saline solution guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate thapsigargin staurosporine In the course of these investigations monosaccharides other than 2dGlc were also examined for their effects on capacitative Ca2+entry. Surprisingly, short incubations with glucosamine and mannosamine were found to selectively inhibit this pathway via a mechanism that was not accompanied by a loss of ATP and could not be reversed by staurosporine. This inhibition may be significant to the utilization of glucosamine as a treatment for osteoarthritis (14Barclay T.S. Tsourounis C. McCart G.M. Ann. Pharmacother. 1998; 32: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), since capacitative Ca2+ entry is critical to the transcriptional regulation of cytokines in immune cells (40Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 41Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodenow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). J774 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Hepes-buffered saline solution (HBS) comprised 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1 mmCaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. J774 cells were washed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2.5 mm probenecid. Probenecid was added to decrease the leakage of Fura-2 (42DiVirgilio F. Meyer B.S. Greenberg S. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in HBS. Fluorescence measurements were performed in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technologies Inc.) with the cells suspended in a cuvette in a temperature-controlled chamber (37 °C) equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 510 nm with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (43Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): [Ca2+]i =K d × [R −R min]/[R max −R] ×S f2/S b2, whereK d is the Fura-2 dissociation constant for Ca2+ (224 nm), R is the ratio of the intensities at 340 nm and 380 nm, and R min andR max are the R values at 0 and saturating levels of Ca2+, respectively.S f2/S b2 is the ratio of the intensities at 380 nm excitation underR min and R max conditions. In presentations in which traces overlap, base-line values ranged between 70 and 120 nm with no significant differences being seen among the various conditions. Cellular ATP levels were determined using an ATP assay kit (Calbiochem) based on firefly luciferase-catalyzed oxidation of d-luciferin. The emitted light was quantitated by luminometry. Cells (106/ml) were incubated in HBS containing the indicated nutrients or inhibitors for 4 min at 37 °C. The cells were then centrifuged and extracted with 1m HCl04 at 4 °C. The extracts were neutralized with 5 m K2CO3. A 10-μl aliquot of the extract was added to 400 μl of HBS buffer, and the reaction was initiated by addition of the luciferase. The addition of thapsigargin to Fura-2-loaded J774 cells leads to a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i. This irreversible inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase causes depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and thereby activates the capacitative influx of Ca2+ (15Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). The elevated plateau value of [Ca2+]i is ∼100 nm higher than the starting base line in J774 macrophages under our standard assay conditions (Fig. 1 A), reflecting the new balance between Ca2+-extruding mechanisms active at the plasma membrane and the ongoing capacitative influx of Ca2+. As we reported previously (30Darbha S. Marchase R.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a 4-min pretreatment with 2dGlc inhibits the capacitative Ca2+ influx pathway in these cells (Fig. 1 E). We speculated that local changes in ATP levels caused by 2dGlc could lead to a selective decrease in the activity of a protein kinase that was necessary for a sustained capacitative Ca2+ entry, thus altering the equilibrium between antagonistic kinases controlling this response. Staurosporine is a microbial alkaloid that was initially described as an inhibitor of protein kinase C but has since been shown to be a broad range inhibitor of protein kinase activity (34Meggio F. Donella Deana A. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Cesaro L. Guerra B. Meyer T. Mett H. Fabbro D. Furet P. Dobrawalska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Staurosporine augments capacitative Ca2+ influx in rat parotid acinar (36Tojyo Y. Tanimura A. Matsumoto Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 69: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and mesangial cells (38Mene P. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 983-990PubMed Google Scholar) and modulates Ca2+ responses in Jurkat T lymphocytes (39Ahnadi C.E. Payet M.D. Dupuis G. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Also, in Xenopus oocytes the t 12of inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry by GTPγS was found to be increased by staurosporine (37Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Most recently, a staurosporine-sensitive kinase was shown to be critical to the Ca2+-dependent down-regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry in human submandibular gland cells (35Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The effect of staurosporine on capacitative Ca2+ influx in J774 macrophages was therefore tested both with and without 2dGlc pretreatment. We found that a 5-min incubation with staurosporine, either prior to or after 2dGlc addition, resulted in approximately an 80% reversal of the inhibition seen in the presence of 2dGlc alone (Fig. 1, Cand D). As can be seen by comparing Fig. 1, A with E, the initial peak height following the addition of thapsigargin, in addition to the capacitative plateau, is lower in the presence of 2dGlc. This is due not only to the inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx by 2dGlc, but to the ability of 2dGlc to partially deplete intracellular, thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores (30Darbha S. Marchase R.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of staurosporine, the 2dGlc-mediated inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx is relieved, although the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is not reversed (Fig. 1and data not shown). Unlike the finding in rat parotid acinar cells (44Tojyo Y. Tanimura A. Matsui S. Matsumoto Y. Sugiya H. Furuyama S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C194-C200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), staurosporine did not affect the capacitative Ca2+entry pathway in untreated J774 cells (Fig. 1 B), even at concentrations of up to 150 nm. This suggests that the effect of staurosporine is not due to an inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase or the opening of a different Ca2+ channel, but rather to a reversal of the inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry seen with 2dGlc. The inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx by 2dGlc can also be demonstrated by its addition after the pathway has been activated. In Fig. 2 Fura-2-loaded cells were treated with thapsigargin, and once a plateau value for [Ca2+]i was established, 2dGlc was added. Within ∼1 min of its addition [Ca2+]i decreased. The subsequent addition of 40 nm staurosporine caused [Ca2+]i to return to the initial, higher plateau value. Following the recovery of Ca2+ influx by staurosporine, treatment with SKF 96365, an inhibitor of Ca2+ influx via the capacitative entry pathway (45Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), caused [Ca2+]i to return to base line. This, like the finding that staurosporine itself caused no increase over the normal capacitative Ca2+ plateau (Fig. 1), supports the premise that the effect of staurosporine on Ca2+ influx is attributable to capacitative Ca2+ entry. In order to determine whether the effect of staurosporine is limited to reversing only 2dGlc-mediated inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry, we tried alternate ways of inhibiting glycolysis. The addition of iodoacetic acid also caused a decrease in Ca2+ influx that was reversed by the subsequent addition of staurosporine (Fig.3 A). Addition of cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of glucose transport (46Salter D.W. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3554-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also caused a decrease in Ca2+ influx similar to that seen upon the addition of 2dGlc (Fig. 3 B). The subsequent addition of staurosporine restored the influx to normal. Dihydrocytochalasin B, which has a similar effect as cytochalasin B on the cytoskeleton but does not interfere with glucose transport (47Atlas S.J. Magargal W.W. Lin S. J. Recept. Res. 1980; 1: 113-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), had no effect on capacitative Ca2+influx (data not shown). This is in agreement with our previous results indicating that glucose deprivation inhibits the influx of Ca2+ via the capacitative entry pathway (30Darbha S. Marchase R.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that staurosporine is able to reverse compromised capacitative Ca2+ entry that is accompanied by and presumably due to a decrease in cellular ATP levels. An excess of glucose can overcome the 2dGlc-mediated inhibition in capacitative Ca2+ influx. As shown in Fig. 3 C, an inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry can also be achieved by the addition of 5 mm 2dGlc to cells suspended in medium containing 1 mm glucose. Upon the addition of excess glucose (10 mm), the inhibition is reversed. As expected, the reversal in this case is accompanied by an increase in cellular ATP levels (data not shown). We next sought to determine the effects of a 4-min incubation with monosaccharides other than 2dGlc on the activation of capacitative Ca2+ influx by thapsigargin. As shown in Fig. 4, galactose, mannose,N-acetylglucosamine, and 3-O-methylglucose were without effect. However, glucosamine and mannosamine caused nearly complete inhibition in the ongoing elevation of Ca2+, indicating an absence of capacitative Ca2+ influx. The inhibition in capacitative Ca2+ entry by these amino sugars can also be demonstrated in a Ca2+ add-back experiment. Fura-2-loaded J774 cells were suspended in a nominally Ca2+-free buffer. Glucosamine was added 5 min prior to the addition of thapsigargin. Following release from intracellular stores, Ca2+ was added to the medium so that the entry of Ca2+ via the capacitative Ca2+ pathway could be observed in isolation (Fig. 5). Glucosamine caused little change in the release of intracellular Ca2+ from stores by thapsigargin. However, the capacitative entry of Ca2+ was clearly inhibited. We asked if staurosporine could reverse the inhibition of the capacitative Ca2+ influx seen in the presence of the amino sugars. As shown in Fig. 6, staurosporine was unable to reverse the inhibition in capacitative Ca2+influx that is brought about by the action of glucosamine or mannosamine. Since glucosamine's link to insulin resistance has been attributed to ATP depletion (11Hresko R.C. Heimberg H. Chi M.M.-Y. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20658-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we asked if, like 2Glc, short term glucosamine treatments sufficient to inhibit capacitative Ca2+ entry would lead to drops in cellular ATP levels. A 4-min treatment in the presence of the amino sugars did not decrease ATP levels to an extent that was statistically significant. This is in contrast to the much more substantial decreases obtained with 2dGlc (Fig. 7). The effect of staurosporine on cellular ATP levels was also investigated. Staurosporine had no effect on ATP levels in the presence or absence of 2dGlc. Thus, staurosporine is not reversing the 2dGlc-mediated inhibition by countering the effect of 2dGlc on intracellular ATP levels. Based on previous reports on the involvement of protein kinases in the capacitative pathway for Ca2+ entry, the most likely target for staurosporine's action is protein kinase C (35Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine whether staurosporine was having its effects via inhibition of this serine/threonine kinase, the effects of alternate protein kinase C inhibitors were examined. K252a, bisindolylmaleimide, calphostin C, and H-7 were all unable to mimic the effect of staurosporine (Fig. 8). A dose response with staurosporine (Fig. 9) also revealed that its effect is not likely to be due to protein kinase C inhibition, since the IC50 for protein kinase C inhibition has been reported to be ∼5 nm (34Meggio F. Donella Deana A. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Cesaro L. Guerra B. Meyer T. Mett H. Fabbro D. Furet P. Dobrawalska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), whereas a concentration of ∼18 nm is half-maximal for the reversal of the inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx in our experiments.Figure 9Dose-dependent effect of staurosporine on capacitative Ca2+ influx. Tg was added to Fura-2-loaded cells suspended in HBS containing 5 mm glucose and 5 mm pyruvate, and a stable plateau of [Ca2+]i was achieved. At each of the staurosporine concentrations used, the new plateau value of Ca2+ was then measured following the addition of nothing further or stp alone (A); the latter is depicted as a percent of the former; 25 mm 2dGlc or 25 mm2dGlc and then 4 nm staurosporine (B); 25 mm 2dGlc or 40 nm stp and then 2dGlc (C). InB and C the percent reversal of the 2dGlc-mediated inhibition seen as a result of staurosporine treatment is depicted. Each determination is the mean of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Other experiments were performed to determine whether activators of protein kinase C might cause a decrease in capacitative Ca2+ entry similar to that seen with 2dGlc. Phorbol myristate acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, did not have any effects on the capacitative influx pathway in these cells in the presence or absence of 2dGlc. Phorbol myristate acetate has been shown previously to inhibit the Ca2+ response to IgG in these cells (42DiVirgilio F. Meyer B.S. Greenberg S. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The finding that in our experiments phorbol myristate acetate was again able to suppress the response to IgG excludes the possibility that under the conditions/concentrations used the phorbol ester was ineffective in activating protein kinase C in our cells (data not shown). We had shown previously an inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ influx within 4 min of 2dGlc treatment or glucose deprivation in J774 macrophages (30Darbha S. Marchase R.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here, we found that staurosporine, a microbial alkaloid that inhibits a broad range of protein kinases, is able to reverse the 2dGlc-mediated inhibition of the capacitative Ca2+ influx pathway. The decreases in influx following other means of inhibiting glycolysis were also reversed by staurosporine. However, the identity of staurosporine's target remains unclear, as protein kinase C does not appear to be the object of its action. We also found that the amino sugars glucosamine and mannosamine inhibited capacitative Ca2+ influx. The inhibitory action of these amino sugars appears to be distinct from that of 2dGlc. This conclusion is based in part on our observation that in the presence of either of these sugars there was no significant decrease in ATP levels. In addition, all treatments investigated that led to an inhibition of the capacitative Ca2+ pathway that was accompanied by a decrease in cellular ATP were reversed by the addition of staurosporine. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of glucosamine and mannosamine were not reversed by this kinase inhibitor. The mechanism by which staurosporine restores the block in capacitative Ca2+ entry caused by depletion of ATP is still undetermined. It is likely that protein kinases play regulatory and possibly counter-balancing roles in controlling the magnitude of capacitative Ca2+ influx. It is possible that an activating kinase is preferentially inhibited when ATP levels fall, allowing an inhibitory kinase with a lower K m for ATP to dominate. This could be responsible for the inhibition seen with 2dGlc and other glycolytic inhibitors. In such a model, staurosporine is proposed to selectively inhibit the proposed inhibitory kinase so as to allow the system to re-achieve a balance permissive for capacitative Ca2+ influx. A related possibility is that a staurosporine-sensitive inhibitory kinase with a lowK m for ATP is kept in check by phosphorylation. When ATP falls, it becomes dephosphorylated and in turn phosphorylates and thereby inhibits an element important for capacitative Ca2+entry. In evaluating such models it should be noted that an activating kinase does not appear to be essential for the initiation of capacitative Ca2+ entry, at least in patch clamp experiments. When such experiments are carried out with no ATP in the pipette solution capacitative Ca2+ entry activates within minutes of whole cell break-in (33Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The relationship between this mechanism of activation and the necessity for ATP in whole cell experiments observed both by us (30Darbha S. Marchase R.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and, for instance, Gamberucci et al. (28Gamberucci A. Innocenti B. Fulceri R. Banhegyi G. Guinti R. Pozzan T. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23597-23602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is still unclear. It should also be noted that a decrease in GTP cannot be experimentally dissociated from a decrease in ATP (33Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effects observed with 2dGlc could be due to decreases in a trinucleotide other than ATP. Previously, staurosporine had been shown in a variety of cell types to augment capacitative Ca2+ influx (36Tojyo Y. Tanimura A. Matsumoto Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 69: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 37Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Mene P. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 983-990PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ahnadi C.E. Payet M.D. Dupuis G. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In several of these experiments staurosporine's effect targeted a kinase other than protein kinase C, since other inhibitors of this enzyme were, as seen here, ineffective. The most parsimonious explanation for the data presented here is that staurosporine's effect is on a protein kinase that is capable of inactivating capacitative Ca2+ entry and that is relatively resistant to the initial decreases in intracellular ATP brought about by glycolytic inhibitors. The assertion that glucosamine can affect biological processes via a mechanism independent of ATP depletion contrasts with arguments recently put forth by Hresko et al. (11Hresko R.C. Heimberg H. Chi M.M.-Y. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20658-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). They reported that glucosamine treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes dramatically decreased cellular ATP and that subsequently this prevented normal levels of insulin-stimulated protein phosphorylation from occurring. Furthermore, they suggested that this was the mechanism responsible for the insulin resistance caused by glucosamine in these cells. They went on to suggest that many of the other biological effects of glucosamine were likely to be due to ATP depletion. However, in the data presented here and in a related study by Bounelis et al. 2P. Bounelis, Z. Su, E. A. Johnson, H. McFerrin, W. Bennett, J. E. Blalock, and R. B. Marchase, submitted for publication. we did not observe significant decreases in ATP in response to short term glucosamine treatments. The difference between our findings and those reported by Hresko et al. (11Hresko R.C. Heimberg H. Chi M.M.-Y. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20658-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) would appear to be due to the provision of alternate fuels from which ATP can be generated. In our experiments 5 mm glucose and 5 mm pyruvate were present along with glucosamine. In the experiments reported by Hresko et al. (11Hresko R.C. Heimberg H. Chi M.M.-Y. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20658-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) the cells were starved for glucose for several hours prior to the addition of glucosamine. This no doubt exacerbated ATP depletion and would appear to be a significant procedural difference relative to the experiments reported here. Under conditions in which glucose is present along with glucosamine, the data presented here and elsewhere2 suggest that a non-ATP-dependent inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry must be considered as a mechanism by which glucosamine affects cell physiology. In addition, a recent publication by Kim et al. (5Kim Y.-B. Zhu J.-S. Zierath J.R. Shen H.-Q. Baron A.D. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed following glucosamine treatment no inhibition of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or IRS-1. The authors concluded that the inhibition caused by glucosamine was at a step distal to these early phosphorylation events. In a related study by Bounelis et al.,2 we have determined that short term glucosamine inhibits capacitative Ca2+ entry in Jurkat T lymphocytes, RBL-2 cells, and BHK-21 cells. In those experiments, the influx and metabolism of glucosamine was followed utilizing [3H]glucosamine. We observed an increase in intracellular levels of glucosamine, glucosamine-6-P, and UDP-GlcNAc. The most likely candidate for mediating the effect of extracellular glucosamine on capacitative Ca2+ entry is the initial intracellular metabolite of glucosamine, glucosamine 6-phosphate. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments in RBL-2 cells determined that glucosamine 6-phosphate, but not other intracellular metabolites of glucosamine, inhibited the trans-plasma membrane currentI CRAC, the Ca2+release activated Ca2+current regulated by Ca2+ store depletion and responsible for capacitative Ca2+ entry in those cells. We propose that this metabolite is also responsible for the inhibition seen here in J774 cells. Increased flux through the glucosamine pathway that could lead to the accumulation of intracellular glucosamine metabolites has been reported to be a response to hyperglycemia (49Buse M.G. Robinson K.A. Gettys T.W. McMahon E.G. Gulve E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E1080-E1088PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, such increases may occur in response to dietary glucosamine, which is currently being widely used as an alternative treatment for osteoarthritis (12Theodosakis J. Adderly B. Fox B. The Arthritis Cure. St. Martin's Press, New York1997Google Scholar). An inhibition in capacitative Ca2+ entry due to excessive hexosamine biosynthesis could affect a number of physiological processes, including several important to the capacity to combat infections and the onset of inflammation. For instance, increases in [Ca2+]i have been shown to accompany phagocytosis in macrophages (42DiVirgilio F. Meyer B.S. Greenberg S. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and to be necessary for phagosome/lysosome fusion in neutrophils (50Jaconi M.E. Lew D.P. Carpentier J.L. Magnusson K.E. Sjogren M. Stendahl O. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, phagosome/lysosome fusion in macrophages appears to be a Ca2+-independent event (51Zimmerli S. Majeed M. Gustavsson M. Stendahl O. Sanan D.A. Ernst J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, capacitative Ca2+ entry is important to certain aspects of gene regulation. The best described examples of this involve transcription mediated by members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells family. These transcription factors require capacitative Ca2+ entry in order to provide for the ongoing activation of calcineurin and the subsequent sustained nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells family members (40Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). This transcription factor family is critical to production of a number of cytokines that greatly influence both the selection of peripheral T cell populations and the function of other cells more directly involved in combating infections. For instance, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is dependent upon an nuclear factor of activated T cells family member for its transcriptional control (40Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Such alterations in cytokine environment could be expected to have effects on host defense against a variety of infectious agents. Because glucosamine metabolites increase during hyperglycemia (49Buse M.G. Robinson K.A. Gettys T.W. McMahon E.G. Gulve E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E1080-E1088PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibition of capacitative Ca2+ entry seen here may be relevant to the inability of diabetic individuals to effectively combat infections. For instance, Rayfield et al. (52Rayfield E.J. Ault M.J. Keusch G.T. Brothers M.J. Nechemias C. Smith H. Am. J. Med. 1982; 72: 439-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) found a striking correlation between the prevalence of infection and mean plasma glucose levels in diabetic outpatients. Consistent with these data is a more recent report by Zerr et al. (48Zerr K.J. Furnary A.P. Grunkemeier G.L. Bookin S. Kanhere V. Starr A. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 1997; 63: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) in which infection rates increased with blood glucose in patients recovering from chest surgery. Those individuals with the highest blood glucose levels suffered from rates of infection more than 15 times those seen in a control population. Interestingly, implementation of a glucose control protocol led to a 40% drop in infection rate among the diabetic population. Last, glucosamine is currently being widely used as an alternative treatment for osteoarthritis (12Theodosakis J. Adderly B. Fox B. The Arthritis Cure. St. Martin's Press, New York1997Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that, rather than acting to enhance glycosaminoglycan synthesis, a change in cytokine profiles and subsequent decreases in inflammatory immune responses could underlie the putative effectiveness of such treatments.

https://openalex.org/W2068264666,"Proteases form one of the largest and most diverse families of enzymes known. Once considered primarily as “enzymes of digestion,” it is now clear that proteases are involved in every aspect of organismal function. All proteases catalyze the addition of water across amide (and ester) bonds to effect cleavage using a reaction involving nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond. The exact mechanisms of cleavage and active site substituents vary widely among different protease subtypes. This provides the basis for the classification of proteases into the serine proteases, the cysteine proteases, the metalloproteases, etc. (see Ref.1Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., London1998Google Scholar for a detailed discussion of protease classification and nomenclature). More important, however, is the diversity of substrate specificity for different proteases. This involves recognizing internal peptide bonds or those of residues at the NH2 or COOH terminus of the molecule as well as side chains of the surrounding amino acids either amino- or carboxyl-terminal to the bond to be cleaved. It is this great diversity and potential for selectivity that provides the basis for the variety of actions of proteases in different aspects of physiological activity. The most difficult and arguably most important aspect of protease action is the control of protease activity to limit cleavage to intended substrates without general destruction of functional proteins both within and outside otherwise normal tissue. In the current miniseries, we have chosen to focus on four protease systems where major advances are being made in elucidating mechanisms of action and control in fundamental cellular processes. Not surprisingly, these are also systems with substantial linkages to disease processes. Nothing more exemplifies the need for absolute control of protease activity than the cascade of enzymes involved in the cellular death response. The first of the protease minireviews is the following contribution in this issue by Wolf and Green (2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Suicidal tendencies: apoptotic cell death by caspase family proteinases. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Google Scholar), which discusses the current state of knowledge of the caspase family of proteases and their role in apoptotic cell death. Named for the fact that they arecysteine proteases that cleave specifically ataspartic acid residues, the importance of caspases in programmed cell death was first realized in 1993 by Horvitz and co-workers (3Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. The C. elegans cell death gene ced-3 encodes a protein similar to mammalian interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme..Cell. 1993; 19: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2257) Google Scholar) from the analysis of the cell death gene,ced3, in Caenorhabditis elegans. These enzymes are normally present in cells as the inactive zymogen but are activated through a very tightly regulated proteolytic cascade initiated by the cell death domain containing signaling molecules and/or sensors of the cellular metabolic state including the mitochondrion. Their activation results in degradation of essential cellular proteins and subsequently and most importantly, chromosomal DNA leading to cell death. These processes are essential for proper development even in relatively primitive animal systems. Dysfunction in caspase cascades is thought to be important in diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The second minireview in the series is a contribution by Steiner and colleagues (4Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. Proteolytic processing in the secretory pathway..J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), which examines the long standing but still expanding field of hormone-processing enzymes, the prohormone convertases. Indeed, the first indication of the existence of prohormones and their processing to yield biologically active products was published in 1967 by Steiner et al. (5Steiner D.F. Cunningham D. Spigelman L. Aten B. Insulin biosynthesis: evidence for a precursor..Science. 1967; 157: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) from pulse-chase studies of insulin production from the proinsulin precursor in islet cells. This in turn led to the discovery of a family of subtilisin-like proteases that are now known to be involved in the processing of a variety of hormone and peptide neurotransmitter precursors as well as other types of important proproteins. Relationships among this family of important enzymes and the expanding list of roles they play in physiological and pathological processes are presented in this review. The third minireview of this series by Nagase and Woessner (6Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. Matrix metalloproteases..J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) discusses the family of matrix metalloproteinases or MMPs. Like other metalloproteases, they utilize a bound metal ion, Zn2+, as part of their catalytic center. The MMPs act on a variety of the molecules that form the extracellular matrix including collagens, fibronectin, laminin, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, and others. These actions of MMPs are essential for a variety of normal biological processes where surface remodeling is required and make these enzymes important in a variety of pathologies including cancer and metastatic disease, cardiovascular diseases, and developmental and ulcerative disorders. As with other proteases, matrix metalloproteases are synthesized as inactive zymogens and are activated by proteolysis. Their activities are further controlled by a set of specific endogenous inhibitors, called TIMPs, expressed in most tissues. The coordinate regulation of matrix metalloproteinase expression and activation and TIMP expression is essential in modulating the various functions of MMPs as discussed in this review. The final contribution in this series by DeMartino and Slaughter (7DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. The proteasome: a novel protease regulated by multiple mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press): 274Google Scholar) considers recent advances in our understanding of the structure, function, and regulation of the most complicated proteolytic entity known, the proteasome. This multisubunit enzyme appears to have arisen early in evolution as a large cylinder-shaped protease particle, dedicated to the compartmentalized destruction of proteins within the cell. Proteolysis is usually assisted by ATP hydrolysis, presumably due to protein unfolding, because access to the central active site cavity is restricted. Thought for many years to be composed of serine proteases, the proteasomal protease has recently been shown through detailed structural and functional analysis of the archaeon proteasome to be unique, using an NH2-terminal threonyl residue as the catalytic nucleophile (8Seemuller E.A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Proteasome from Thermoplasma acidophilum: a threonine protease..Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Additional complexes can be associated with the core proteasome adding additional regulatory properties to the complex. Most notably in eukaryotes, additional cap structures provide for the recognition of polyubiquitinated proteins as substrates. Although ubiquitination provides a handy tag to identify proteins for degradation, demonstration by Kirschner and colleagues (9Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Cyclin is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway..Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) that this pathway is involved in cyclin turnover, a key step in regulating the cell cycle, first indicated that proteasomal degradation plays a direct role in cellular physiology and regulation beyond simple protein clearance. Although by no means inclusive, we hope that these reviews give our readership an appreciation for the rapid pace of developments in the field of protease research."
https://openalex.org/W2079760790,"The molecular chaperones GroEL and GroES facilitate protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner under conditions where no spontaneous folding occurs. It has remained unknown whether GroE achieves this by a passive sequestration of protein inside the GroE cavity or by changing the folding pathway of a protein. Here we used citrate synthase, a well studied model substrate, to discriminate between these possibilities. We demonstrate that GroE maintains unfolding intermediates in a state that allows productive folding under nonpermissive conditions. During encapsulation of non-native protein inside GroEL·GroES complexes, a folding reaction takes place, generating association-competent monomeric intermediates that are no longer recognized by GroEL. Thus, GroE shifts folding intermediates to a productive folding pathway under heat shock conditions where even the native protein unfolds in the absence of GroE."

Whatever its specificity, each anti-human μ-opioid receptor (hMOR) extracellular loop peptide IgG preparation was unable, when examined individually, to reduce adenylate cyclase activity.

The presence of low levels of circulating autoantibodies is a normal feature of the immune system. Numerous biological functions for these so-called natural autoantibodies have been proposed such as first line host-defense against pathogens, senescent cell removal, immunoregulatory activity (1Avrameas S. Ternynck T. Res. Immunol. 1995; 146: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has also been considered that disease-associated autoantibodies are derived from natural autoantibody repertoire. Autoantibodies directed against G protein-coupled receptors have been characterized in a number of diseases including Graves' disease (2Strakosch C.R. Wenzel B.E. Row V.V. Volpe R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 307: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), Chagas' disease (3Borda E. Pascual J. Cossio P. De La Vega M. Arana R. Sterin-Borda L. Clin. Exp.

In each of these pathological situations, the autoantibodies behave as agonists by interacting with extracellular domains of the corresponding receptors. We have previously characterized the presence of IgG autoantibodies directed against the human μ-opioid receptor (hMOR) 1The abbreviations hMORhuman μ-opioid receptorhMORΔ1–61human μ-opioid receptor deleted from its first 61 amino acidsCHOChinese hamster ovary cellshMOR/CHOhMOR-expressing CHO-K1 cellhMORΔ1–61/CHOhMORΔ1–61-expressing CHO-K1 cellELextracellular loopPTXpertussis toxinPBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum of at least 42% healthy individuals. These autoantibodies also displayed an agonistic activity (7Macé G. Blanpied C. Emorine L.J. Druet P. Dietrich G. Eur. J.

Deletion of the amino-terminal domain of the receptor did not alter the ability of anti-hMOR IgG to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. The role of the three extracellular loops of the receptor was examined by measuring, on intact recombinant hMOR/CHO cells, the agonistic activity of IgG affinity-purified against peptides corresponding to each extracellular loop. A Gi/Go-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was observed with an equimolar mixture of IgG specifically directed against the first and the third extracellular loops. Our results show that efficient ligand/hMOR interactions involving the first and third extracellular loops of the hMOR can mimic the signal elicited by small alkaloid agonist as morphine. This alternative pathway for receptor activation opens new perspectives in the conception of analgesic drugs. The cDNA encoding the hMOR and the hMOR lacking the first 61 amino acids in the amino-terminal segment (hMORΔ1–61) (8Dietrich G. Gaibelet G. Capeyrou R. Butour J.-L. Pontet F. Emorine L.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector. CHO-K1 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure (9Okayama H. Berg P. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 270-279PubMed Google Scholar). Cell clones obtained by limiting dilutions were screened for their ability to bind [3H]diprenorphine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). Intact cells (3 × 105) were incubated with increasing amounts of [3H]diprenorphine for 60 min at 25 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled diprenorphine. For competition experiments, 1 nm[3H]diprenorphine was added to the cells together with increasing amounts of morphine (Francopia, Paris, France). IgG preparation obtained from a large pool of plasma from normal donors was used as a source of human IgG (SandoglobulinTM, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). Lyophilized IgG preparation was reconstituted in H2O and extensively dialyzed against PBS before use. IgG directed against hMOR (anti-hMOR IgG) were purified on hMOR/CHO cells (7Macé G. Blanpied C. Emorine L.J. Druet P. Dietrich G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, IgG were incubated with confluent hMOR/CHO cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound antibodies were eluted using 0.1m sodium-citrate, pH 3.5, purified by chromatography on protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) and then incubated with untransfected CHO cells. Three peptides NYLMGTWPFGTILCK, KYRQGSIDCTLTFSHPTWYWENLVK, and KALVTIPETTFQT corresponding to the hMOR extracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 (hMOR EL1, hMOR EL2, hMOR EL3), respectively (10Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), were immobilized on AminoLinkTM coupling gel (Pierce). Anti-hMOR EL peptide IgG were affinity-purified according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Anti-laminin IgG autoantibodies were purified from the original IgG pool by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose-bound laminin as described elsewhere (11Druet E. Praddaude F. Druet P. Dietrich G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Antibody activity was assessed by ELISA. Plates were coated with mouse laminin (5 μg/ml) (E-Y Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) or hMOR EL peptides (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C in PBS. Uncoated sites were saturated with PBS containing 1% gelatin (PBS-gel) for 90 min at 37 °C. Plates were washed before incubation for 60 min at 37 °C with IgG diluted in PBS-gel. Bound antibodies were revealed using biotin-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) and peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. CHO cell clones were incubated with IgG for 45 min at 4 °C. Bound IgG were revealed using biotin-labeled goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)2-specific antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs.) and phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). 150,000 hMOR/CHO were incubated in the absence or in the presence of 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) (Sigma) for one night. Supernatants were removed, and 250 μl of fresh medium containing 0.1 μm adenine (Sigma) and 0.6 μCi [3H]adenine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and incubated for 10 min with 10 μm forskolin (Sigma), 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), 0.1 mm 4-(butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Biomol Research Lab., Plymouth Meeting, PA) together with either morphine or IgG in the presence or in the absence of naloxone (Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 2.2 N HCl, and [3H]cAMP content was determined (12Alvarez R. Daniels D.V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The lack of the NH2-terminal extracellular domain in the hMOR did not prevent the biological effect of morphine as assessed by specific inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (Fig.1). In agreement with previous reports (8Dietrich G. Gaibelet G. Capeyrou R. Butour J.-L. Pontet F. Emorine L.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Wang J.B.

Anti-hMOR IgG were affinity-purified from a normal human IgG pool on intact hMOR/CHO cells (7Macé G. Blanpied C. Emorine L.J. Druet P. Dietrich G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-hMOR IgG antibodies specifically recognized both hMOR/CHO and hMORΔ1–61/CHO cells (Fig.2). No antibody binding to any cell clone was observed with unpurified IgG and anti-laminin control IgG. The inhibitory potency of anti-hMOR IgG on forskolin-induced adenylate cyclase activity was similar in hMOR/CHO and in hMORΔ1–61/CHO cell clones, indicating that the activity of these antibodies was not dependent on the NH2-terminal extracellular region of the receptor (Fig. 3). Because a weak residual binding of anti-hMOR IgG on control CHO cells was observed (Fig. 2), we have checked out that CHO-reactive IgG had no effect on the inhibition of the adenylate cyclase (not shown) (7Macé G. Blanpied C. Emorine L.J. Druet P. Dietrich G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Figure 3Inhibitory activity of anti-hMOR IgG on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in intact hMOR/CHO and hMOR Δ1–61/CHO cells. 150,000 hMOR/CHO (white column) or hMORΔ1–61/CHO (gray column) cells were incubated with 10 μm forskolin alone (control) or together with affinity-purified anti-hMOR IgG. Each experimental point represents mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in tetraplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated the contribution of the three other extracellular regions of the hMOR in the anti-hMOR IgG-mediated opioid signal. For this purpose, peptides corresponding to the three extracellular loops of the hMOR (EL1, EL2, and EL3) were synthesized. The amino acid sequence of each peptide was defined relative to the putative positioning of transmembrane domains of the receptor (10Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Three preparations of IgG directed toward EL1, EL2, and EL3 peptides, respectively, were prepared from the human IgG pool by affinity chromatography on peptide-bound agarose columns. Enrichment of the antibody activity against each peptide was estimated in ELISA. Affinity purification of IgG against each hMOR EL peptide resulted in enhancement of specific antibody activity as compared with unpurified IgG (Fig.4). The ability of each anti-hMOR peptide affinity-purified IgG to bind to the hMOR was then estimated by cytofluorometry analysis using hMOR/CHO, hMORΔ1–61/CHO, and control CHO-K1 cells. The anti-hMOR EL peptide activity of IgG was associated with recognition of the hMOR in native configuration (i.e.expressed on cell surface) (Fig. 5). We then examined each anti-hMOR EL peptide IgG preparation, individually or in combination, for their inhibitory effect on forskolin-induced adenylate cyclase activity in intact hMOR/CHO cells. When examined individually, none of the anti-hMOR EL peptide IgG preparations was able to reduce the adenylate cyclase activity (Fig.6 A). When examined in combination, a dose-dependent decrease in cAMP accumulation was observed with an equimolar mixture of anti-hMOR EL1 IgG and anti-hMOR EL3 IgG (Fig. 6). By contrast, mixtures of anti-hMOR EL1 and anti-hMOR EL2 IgG or anti-hMOR EL2 and anti-hMOR EL3 IgG were inefficient. This inhibitory effect induced by anti-hMOR EL1 IgG together with anti-hMOR EL3 IgG was reversed either in presence of naloxone or by pretreatment of cells with PTX (Fig. 6 B). Thus, simultaneous recognition of the first and third extracellular loops of the hMOR by IgG antibodies is responsible for a specific activation of the hMOR associated with a Gi/Go-dependent transduction signal.Figure 5Assessment by cytofluorometry of the binding activity of affinity-purified anti-hMOR EL peptide IgG. hMOR/CHO, hMORΔ1–61/CHO, and CHO-K1 cells were stained using 5 μg each of either affinity-purified anti-hMOR EL peptide IgG, unpurified IgG, or affinity-purified anti-laminin IgG.

Blanpied C. Emorine L.J. Druet P. Dietrich G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is elicited by their simultaneous binding to the first and third extracellular loops of the hMOR. These findings confirm and extend our previous observations on the pivotal role of EL1 and EL3 in the formation of the μ-opioid binding site; by studying chimeric μ-opioid/angiotensin receptor, we had indeed suggested that these two loops may constrain the relative positioning of the connected transmembrane α-helices that contain receptor/ligand contact points (8Dietrich G.

Strader C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 26: 16891-16897Google Scholar) or by autoantibodies recognizing the second extracellular loop of the receptor (4Magnusson Y. Wallukat G. Waagstein F. Hjalmarson A. Hoebeke J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Point mutagenesis experiments have shown that key residues of the μ-opioid binding site may be distributed over the third, sixth, and seventh transmembrane domains (18Mansour A. Taylor L.P. Fine J.L. Thompson R.C. Hoverstein M.T. Mosberg H.I. Watson S.J. Akil H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It seems, however, unlikely that the agonistic behavior of IgG is because of interaction with such residues. Recent reports demonstrated that activation of rhodopsin required rearrangement of the relative positions of the third and sixth transmembrane helices (19Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbel W.L. Khorana H.G. Nature. 1996; 274: 768-770Google Scholar, 20Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Similar conformational changes are expected to be involved in the activation of other G protein-coupled receptors including μ-opioid receptor (21Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 22Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Accordingly, modeling of opioid receptors three-dimensional structure has suggested that interaction of morphine with Asp128 within the third transmembrane helix might induce such a repositioning of the third and sixth transmembrane helices (23Pogozheva I.D. Lomize A.L. Mosberg H.I. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 612-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that G protein-coupled receptor activation such as rhodopsin and tachykinin NK-1 receptor is prevented by reducing flexibility of either the third and sixth or the fifth and the sixth transmembrane helices using zinc binding to engineered metal ion binding sites (24Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 25Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it could be speculated that similar movements of the third and sixth transmembrane segments are triggered by the binding of IgG to the adjacent first and third extracellular loops. The requirement for hMOR activation of a coordinated shift of the third and sixth transmembrane helices would explain the ineffectiveness of each anti-hMOR EL peptide IgG when individually tested.

In comparison to the wild-type enzyme, steady state activity of NDKS122P with ATP and TDP as substrates was slowed down 5-fold. We have utilized transient kinetic techniques to analyze phosphoryl transfer between the mutant enzyme and various pairs of nucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside diphosphates. The two half-reactions of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the active site histidine residue (His118) were studied separately by making use of the intrinsic fluorescence changes which occur during these reactions. All apparent second order rate constants are drastically reduced, falling 5-fold for phosphorylation and 40–200-fold for dephosphorylation. Also, the reactivity of the mutant with pyrimidine nucleotides and deoxy nucleotides is more than 100-fold reduced compared with the wild-type. Thus, the rate-limiting step of the NDK-BS122P-catalyzed reaction is phosphoryl transfer from the phospho-enzyme intermediate to the nucleoside diphosphate and not phosphoryl transfer from the nucleoside triphosphate to the enzyme as was found for the wild-type protein. This results in a pronounced shift of the equilibrium between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme. Moreover, like the Killer-of-prune mutation inDrosophila NDK and the neuroblastoma Ser120→ Gly mutation in human NDK-A/Nm23-H1, the Ser122 → Pro substitution in NDK-B affects the stability of the protein toward heat and urea.

The enzymatic properties of NDKs have been examined in many early studies (1Parks R.E. Agarwal R.P. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 307-334Google Scholar); however, recently a completely new role for this enzyme has emerged when the product of the tumor suppressor gene nm23was identified as NDK (2Rosengaard A.M. Krutsch H.C. Shearn A. Biggs J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 3Stahl J.A. Leone A. Rosengaard A.M. Porter L. Richter King C. Steeg P.S. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 445-449PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, several point mutations in NDK have been found in tumor cell lines: S120G in the human isoform NDK-A (4Chang C.L. Zhu X.X. Thoraval D.H. Ungar D. Rawwas J. Hora N. Strahler J.R. Hanash S.M. Randy E. Nature. 1994; 370: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), L48V (5Leone A. Seeger R.C. Hong C.M. Hu Y.Y. Arboleda M.J. Brodeur G.M. Stram D. Slamon D.J. Steeg P.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 855-865PubMed Google Scholar), S122P (6Hamby C.V. Mendola C.E. Potla L. Stafford G. Backer J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and W133R (7Mandai M. Konishi I. Komatsu T. Mori T. Arao S. Nomura H. Kanda Y. Hiai H. Fukumoto M. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in the human isoform NDK-B. So far, only NDK-AS120G, which was found in neuroblastoma, has been characterized extensively in two independent studies (8Chang C.L. Strahler J.R. Thoraval D.H. Qian M.G. Hinderer R. Hanash S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 659-667PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lascu I. Schaertl S. Wang C. Sarger C. Giartosio A. Briand G. Lacombe M.-L. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15599-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), demonstrating that its enzymatic properties are similar to the wild-type protein. In contrast, its stability is significantly reduced as observed under various in vitro conditions (9Lascu I. Schaertl S. Wang C. Sarger C. Giartosio A. Briand G. Lacombe M.-L. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15599-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, these studies could not explain satisfactorily the highly metastatic behavior of the tumor cells expressing mutated NDK-AS120G. The NDK-BS122P mutant was identified in melanoma of high metastatic potential as tested by transfection into mice (6Hamby C.V. Mendola C.E. Potla L. Stafford G. Backer J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was speculated that this mutant protein has a quarternary structure different from the wild-type, but so far no data were available about effects of this mutation on enzymatic activity or stability. Another point mutation known inDrosophila NDK, P97S, called Killer of prune(Kpn) mutation, has been shown to affect severely the development of the fly (10Biggs J. Hersperger E. Steeg P.S. Liotta L.A. Shearn A. Cell. 1990; 63: 933-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This mutation reduces stability but not catalytic efficiency of the protein (11Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). nucleoside diphosphate kinase nucleoside triphosphate nucleoside diphosphate nucleoside 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) wild type adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid nucleoside diphosphate kinase nucleoside triphosphate nucleoside diphosphate nucleoside 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) wild type adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The mechanism of tumor suppression by NDK is poorly understood, although some speculations about the role of the enzyme have been presented (12Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1170-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations leading to metastatic tumor cell lines are not clear, even though there is evidence fromDrosophila NDK mutants that stability of the oligomeric enzyme may play a major role (11Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we applied transient kinetic methods to examine the phosphoryl transfer reactions of the mutants NDK-BS122P and NDK-AS120G, an approach we successfully used before to characterize human wild-type NDKs (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We measured the phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation reactions of both mutant enzymes with different substrates and compared them with the wild-type enzymes under identical experimental conditions. Whereas NDK-AS120G had only slightly altered enzymatic properties, NDK-BS122P showed major changes in the reaction mechanism. This, together with a reduced stability toward heat and urea, may shed light on this mutant protein and the associated metastatic potential. All reagents were obtained from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, unless stated otherwise, and treated as described before (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mutations S122P and S120G were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis after the Kunkel Method (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene kit (Bio-Rad) and the mutagenic primers: 5′-CATGGCAGTGATCCG GTAAAAAGTGCTG-3′ for S122P and 5′-GAACATTATACATGGCG GTGATTCTGT-3′ for S120G (9Lascu I.

The altered bases are indicated in bold italic letters, and the underlined sequences specify the newly introduced restriction sites forBsaWI and HphI, respectively, which were used to identify positive clones carrying the mutation. The entire coding regions of the mutants were verified by automatic DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems 373 sequencer) to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and clone integrity. The DNA fragments encoding WT and mutant NDK-A were cloned into the Escherichia coliexpression vector pJC20 (16Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.G. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11326-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that for WT and mutant NDK-B into pJC20 HisN. This latter vector was generated by transferring the 125 bpXbaI/BamHI fragment (which encompasses the ribosomal binding site, the histidine tag region, and the enterokinase cleavage site) from the pET-19b vector (Novagen) into the pJC20 vector cut with XbaI and BamHI. Cloning of an open reading frame via NdeI and BamH restriction sites into pJC20HisN then fuses the amino acid sequence MG(H)10I(D)4KHLD to the N terminus of the protein. Proteins were overproduced in BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The NDK-B proteins carrying the N-terminal histidine-tag (His-tag) were purified on a nickel-agarose column (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the supplier. The 21-amino acid N-terminal extension was shown to have no influence on the activity of the enzyme (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutant NDK-A was purified like wild-type NDK-A as described before (9Lascu I. Schaertl S. Wang C. Sarger C. Giartosio A. Briand G. Lacombe M.-L. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15599-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proteins were equilibrated in buffer A (buffer A: 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and stored as an ammonium sulfate precipitate at 4 °C. Phosphorylated NDK was prepared by incubating the protein with an excess of nucleoside triphosphates and then passing it through a PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that removed the nucleotides. The phosphorylated proteins was stable for several hours when kept on ice. Protein concentrations were estimated by using an extinction coefficient of 1.3 cm2 mg−1 at 280 nm (18Schaertl S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and molecular masses of 17.1 kDa for NDK-A and 17.2 kDa for NDK-B and are given with respect to catalytic sites, i.e.monomers. Proteins were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed in buffer A on a Superose 6 column on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC apparatus as described before (18Schaertl S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NDP kinase activity was measured at 20 °C in a standard pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled-enzyme assay (20Agarwal R.P. Parks Jr., R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2258-2264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 2 mm ATP and 0.5 mm dTDP as substrates in buffer A (see above). Fluorescence spectra of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS 3B fluorimeter at 20 °C. The titration experiments to determine K eq were performed as described before (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), using ATP as phosphoryl donor. At half-saturation of the fluorescence change, the following relations apply: [E] = 0.5 [E 0] = [E∼P] = [ADP] (E stands for the free enzyme, E 0 for the total enzyme, and E∼P for the phosphorylated enzyme). Designating these quantities by x, the concentration of free ATP is given by [ATP] = [ATP0] − x, and from the equilibrium constant K eq = [E∼P][ADP]/[ATP][E], we derive the following equation, Keq=x/([ATP0]−x)Equation 1 To ensure that NDK-BS122P was unphosphorylated prior to the experiment, the enzyme was incubated at a concentration of 50 μm with 5 mm ADP, and the nucleotide was removed by gel filtration. Experiments to determine the stability against denaturation by urea were performed in buffer A (see above) according to Ref. 21Lascu I. Deville-Bonne D. Glaser P. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20268-20275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The concentration of MgCl2 was always kept in excess over the nucleotide. Native protein, as well as protein denatured in the presence of 8 m urea, were diluted into samples of buffer A containing between 0 and 8 m urea. After equilibration for 16 h at room temperature, activity was determined using the coupled enzyme assay as a measure for inactivation and reactivation. Also intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, excited at 295 nm and measured at 340 nm, was recorded to follow denaturation. Stability toward heat was determined by incubating NDK for 8 min at temperatures between 20 and 75 °C and measuring residual activity in the coupled enzyme assay. The rates of nucleotide-induced protein fluorescence changes at 20 °C in buffer A were measured with a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-51 stopped-flow apparatus equipped with a 100-watt xenon/mercury lamp and monochromator as described before (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm and monitored through a 320-nm long-pass filter. Data were captured, stored, and analyzed using Hi-Tech software running on a PC platform. Three to ten traces were collected with the same solution, averaged, and fitted to a fitting routine in Hi-Tech software. Enzyme was mixed with at least 5-fold excess of nucleotides and concentrations are those after mixing in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Reaction curves were analyzed over more than 95% of the total amplitude so that at the lower limit of 5-fold excess ligand there is less than about 10% deviation from the real value of the pseudo-first order rate constant (22Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1995: 59-63Google Scholar). In our previous paper we presented evidence that the transient kinetics of the interaction of nucleotides with NDK were compatible with the following reaction scheme, which represents the donor/acceptor half-reaction for the overall reaction, K1K2K3 E+NTP⇔E­NTP⇔E∼P­NDP⇔E∼P+NDP SCHEMEIwith E = NDK, E∼P = phosphorylated NDK, NTP and NDP = substrates and products, respectively, and K i (=k +i/k −i) is the equilibrium constant of the i-th step. In the absence of acceptor, adding excess NTP to NDK results in accumulation of phosphorylated enzyme which is accompanied by a decrease of intrinsic protein fluorescence (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F. Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14634-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The time course of this fluorescence change can be described by a single exponential. When phosphoryl transfer is much slower than nucleotide binding (i.e. k +2 +k −2 ≪ [ATP] k +1 +k −1), then the observed rate constant (k obs) is predicted to be hyperbolically dependent on [NTP] as follows. kobs=K1k+2[NTP]/(1+K1[NTP])Equation 2 At low ATP concentrations such that K 1[NTP] ≪ 1, k obs =K 1 k +2 [NTP], and the apparent second order rate constant definesK 1 k +2. A similar situation holds for the reverse reaction in which addition of excess NDP to NDK∼P in the absence of NTP results in an exponential increase in fluorescence with, kobs=k−2[NDP]/(K3+[NDP])Equation 3 and at low NDP concentrations such thatK 3 ≫ [NDP] thenk obs = k −2[NDP]/K 3. NDKs used in this study were purified to more than 95% homogeneity. Analysis with gel electrophoresis showed NDK-A and NDK-AS120G migrating at 20 kDa and histidine-tagged NDK-B and NDK-BS122P at 22 kDa. When analyzed by gel filtration, the elution volumes of NDK-A and NDK-AS120G as well as of His-tagged NDK-B and NDK-BS122P were identical, suggesting the same quarternary structure of mutant and WT proteins. The WT isoforms NDK-A and NDK-B (with the N-terminal His-tag) had an average specific activity of 150 s−1 at 20 °C. The mutant NDK-AS120G showed a slightly reduced turnover rate of 75% of WT, whereas NDK-BS122P had only 22% of the steady state activity of WT. As shown below, the low activity of the NDK-BS122P is unlikely to be due to the presence of inactive protein. The NDK-BS122P appeared to be significantly less stable than the WT protein; indeed, we experienced considerable difficulty in preparing active protein in a multistep purification process. In contrast, the His-tagged protein was purified much more quickly and was active. The untagged NDK-A and NDK-AS120G could be purified with high activity as shown in our previous report (9Lascu I. Schaertl S. Wang C. Sarger C. Giartosio A. Briand G. Lacombe M.-L. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15599-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the His-tagged wild-type NDK-B has the same steady state activity and kinetic behavior as untagged NDK-B (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All of the experiments reported here were therefore performed with the His-tagged protein. NDK-B and NDK-BS122P were checked for stability in the presence of urea and against heat denaturation. While NDK-B lost all enzymatic activity at 70 °C, NDK-BS122P was inactivated at 60 °C. Unfolding of native enzyme in urea was followed by the loss of enzyme activity (not shown) and fluorescence intensity and occurred for WT NDK-B at 4 m urea and for the mutant at 3m urea (Fig. 1, Aand B). Activity and fluorescence of NDK-B, previously denatured in 8 m urea, was recovered completely below 1m urea (Fig. 1 A). When unfolded NDK-BS122P was diluted into lower urea concentrations, no recovery of either activity or fluorescence could be observed (Fig.1 B). Thus, NDK-BS122P is less stable than WT NDK-B. A similar reduced stability of NDK-AS120G was seen in our previous study (9Lascu I. Schaertl S. Wang C. Sarger C. Giartosio A. Briand G. Lacombe M.-L. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15599-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), denaturing at 50 °C and in 2m urea compared with WT NDK-A at 58 °C and 3.5m urea. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of NDK-BS122P was of similar intensity to that of the WT enzyme. Also, on adding ATP a 10% quench in fluorescence occurred, just as in WT, which has been shown to be due to phosphorylation of the enzyme (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F. Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14634-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The decrease in fluorescence was quite reproducible, indicating that all protein must contribute to it and little inactive protein is present. In a titration experiment, ATP was added and the fluorescence change recorded to determine the equilibrium constant of the reaction. TheK eq for NDK-BS122P had a value of 5 (±1) compared with 0.54 (±0.05) measured for WT NDK-B. These values can be pictured as the amount of ATP that has to be added toe.g. 1 μm NDK to obtain 50% phosphorylated enzyme (Equation 1), being 0.6 and 1.43 μm for mutant and WT NDK-B, respectively. No values of K eq have been determined for NDK-A by this method, since the 6% fluorescence change of these proteins was too small to obtain reliable results in a titration experiment. Nucleotide-induced fluorescence transients of the mutant proteins NDK-BS122P and NDK-AS120G were measured using the approach that was established in our previous study of the WT proteins (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rapid mixing of 0.5 μm NDK-B with 15 μm ATP resulted in a 9% quench in fluorescence, which could be described by a single-exponential process with a rate constant of 124 s−1 (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the fluorescence of the mutant NDK-BS122P was quenched by 10.5% at a lower rate of 41 s−1 when mixed with 30 μm ATP (Fig. 2 B). Phosphorylated enzyme was prepared as described under “Materials and Methods,” and rapid mixing of 0.5 μm NDK-B∼P with 5 μm ADP resulted in a 6% increase in fluorescence at a rate of 101 s−1 (Fig. 2 C). Phosphorylated mutant enzyme, NDK-BS122P∼P, was dephosphorylated by 5 μmADP at a much lower rate of 1.5 s−1, with a larger increase in fluorescence of 8% (Fig. 2 D). The larger amplitudes observed for the mutant protein are compatible with the larger value of K eq for the overall reaction. We previously characterized the reaction of the WT protein with ATP, GTP, ADP, and GDP over a range of concentrations (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The observed rate constants,k obs, were linearly dependent upon nucleotide concentration over the accessible range, and apparent second order rate constants were obtained from linear fits to plots ofk obs versus nucleotide (TableI). The data were interpreted in terms of the three-step model for the reaction as shown in Scheme I.Table IApparent second order rate constants (10 −6m −1 s −1) for phosphorylation (A; K1k+2) and dephosphorylation (B; k−2/K3) for NDK-B and NDK-B S122PA: PhosphorylationNDK-BaData from Ref. 14.NDK-BS122PATP7.9 (±0.5)1.4 (±0.3)GTP12.2 (±0.5)3.2 (±0.8)B: DephosphorylationNDK-B∼PaData from Ref. 14.NDK-BS122P∼PADP17.9 (±1)0.55 (±0.16)GDP29.1 (±2.4)0.8 (±0.2)UDP3.8 (±0.4)0.04 (±0.003)CDP1.3 (±0.04)0.01 (±0.001)a Data from Ref. 14Schaertl S.

Open table in a new tab The dependence of the rate of phosphorylation of NDK-BS122P on nucleotide concentration was studied with ATP and GTP, and the data are plotted in Fig. 3A. The data show that the observed rate constant for phosphorylation by ATP was linearly dependent upon ATP concentration for both proteins, but the apparent second order rate constant, K 1 k +2 (Eq. 2), was 5-fold lower for NDK-BS122P (Table I, A). In contrast, the observed rate of the reaction with GTP appeared to saturate at high concentrations. The data could be described by a hyperbola, as predicted from Equation 2, giving an apparent second order rate constant 4-fold slower than for WT and a value of 196 s−1for k +2 (the maximum value ofk obs) and) 53 μm for 1/K 1 (or K 0.5 = the concentration of GTP required to give k obs =k max/2) (TableII). The value ofk +2 for the WT protein is thought to be too fast to measure by the stopped flow method, but we did previously observe hyperbolic dependence of the reaction when using ATPγS or GTPγS (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We reported that the values of k obs for phosphorylation by ATPγS or GTPγS were reduced about 1000-fold compared with ATP and GTP, and we determined bothk +2 and 1/K 1 (Table II, A). From our previous experiments we argued that nucleotide affinity was not much affected by the thio-modification, and thereforeK 1 is similar to that of the equivalent unmodified nucleotide (14Schaertl S. Konrad M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5662-5669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). With NDK-BS122P and thio-modified substrates the reaction was too slow to follow even with nucleotide concentrations up to 1 mm, and the fluorescence signal disappeared in the background due to the absorbance of the nucleotide. This is expected if the value of k +2is also 1000-fold reduced for the thiophosphoryl transfer.Table IIMaximal rate (kmax) and substrate concentration at which half-kmax is reached (K0.5), determined with NDK-B (only thionucleotides (data from Ref. 14Schaertl S.

Open table in a new tab Studies of the dephosphorylation reaction of NDK-BS122P by either ADP or GDP produced hyperbolic plots (Fig. 3 B) with apparent second order rate constants (k −2/K 3) reduced more than 30-fold compared with WT in each case. The values ofk −2 (k max) andK 3 (K 0.5) are listed in Table II, B. In contrast to the mutant, the WT protein showed no evidence of deviation from a linear dependence on NDP concentration. This suggests that the major effect of the mutation is to slow the phosphoryl transfer steps in the direction of both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. We repeated these measurements with NDK-BS122P for a range of NDP and dNDP nucleotides and the results are summarized in Table II. With the exception of CDP and dCDP, the data showed a hyperbolic dependence on NDP concentration and estimates ofk −2 and K 3 were obtained. For CDP and dCDP the data appeared linearly dependent upon NDP concentration up to at least 2 mm. In our previous study, thiophosphorylated WT protein was mixed with a wide range of NDPs and a hyperbolic dependence on NDP concentration appeared. This allowed estimates of k −2 and K 3for the same series of substrates (Table II). We previously argued that the value of K 3 (the affinity of NDP for the protein) may be similar for NDK∼P and NDK∼thioP. The values ofK 3 for both NDK-BS122P∼P and NDK-B∼thioP are listed in Table II, B. They differ by a factor of 0.3–4 for each NDP and 0.2–3 for each dNDP. We conclude that the mutation S122P primarily affects the rate of phosphoryl transfer (k −2) and not the affinity of NDP for the protein (K 3). This conclusion is supported by the results for GTP and GTPγS phosphorylating NDK-B and NDK-BS122P. The values of 1/K 1 with GTP or GTPγS and WT were 25 and 36 μm, respectively, and for the mutant, 1/K 1 with GTP had a value of 53 μm. Thus, although the observed rates of phosphorylation and thiophosphorylation of NDK-B"

Regulation of a number of cytokine and growth factor receptors is mediated in part through accessory proteins, recruited before or following ligand binding.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In this report we demonstrate the presence of a novel, attachment-regulated component of the IL-1 receptor complex at focal adhesions that constitutes a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Recruitment of this component affects receptor function, both in terms of the level of type I IL-1 receptors and their affinity for ligand, and correlates with IL-1-mediated, attachment-regulated signaling and biological responses.RESULTSConfocal microscopy of human fibroblasts transfected with a 5′IL-1RI-EGFP 3′ receptor construct showed that 24 h after transfection, the receptor fusion protein was located at the cell membrane. Serial observations of single cells replated on fibronectin demonstrated a high degree of accumulation of the GFP-tagged fusion protein at extended processes following cell attachment and spreading (Fig. 1 a), in agreement with earlier data on localization of the endogenous receptor protein. Immunocytochemical staining of transfected cells showed co-localization of the receptor fusion protein with the transmembrane linkage protein vinculin at these sites, and at occasional sites along the cell membrane (Fig. 1).Binding studies showed that attachment to fibronectin caused an increase in endogenous cell surface receptor levels (Fig.2 a). As reported earlier (11Dower S.K. Kronheim S.R. March C.J. Conlon P.J. Hopp T. Gillis S. Urdal D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), there was a significant variation in receptor number between experiments (fibronectin, 2.3–11 × 103receptors/cell; tissue culture, 1.1–7.3 × 103receptors/cell). However, in parallel experiments, cells attached to fibronectin consistently showed a higher level of cell surface binding (4.3 ± 0.85 × 103 receptors/cell) than cells on bare tissue culture plastic (2.6 ± 0.6 × 103receptors/cell), an average increase of 1.8 ± 0.17-fold. Similarly, attachment to collagen and vitronectin resulted in an increase in IL-1 receptor levels, which was, however, less pronounced (1.3–1.5-fold) (data not shown).Figure 2IL-1 receptor levels are affected by fibronectin attachment. a, cells plated on fibronectin (▵) or on bare tissue culture plates (○) were incubated in the cold (4 °C) for 2 h with various concentrations of radiolabeled IL-1α, as indicated, and the level of specific receptor binding was determined. Nonspecific binding, measured in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled ligand, has been subtracted from the data, and the continuous curves were calculated from the best fit parameter values. Scatchard analyses reveal a 2-fold reduction in affinity constant in cells attached to fibronectin relative to cells on bare tissue culture plastic. Data represent the mean of four experiments. b,cells were incubated with radiolabeled IL-1α but in the presence or absence of a blocking anti-type I IL-1 receptor antibody, and the level of specific IL-1 receptor binding was measured as in a. Data shown represent mean of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Scatchard analyses revealed that fibronectin attachment, in addition, caused a decrease in IL-1 receptor affinity (K a) for ligand, from 1.0 × 109(m−1), in cells plated on tissue culture plastic, to 5.6 × 108 (m−1) in fibronectin-attached cultures (Fig. 2 a). Furthermore, incubation with a blocking monoclonal antibody to the type I IL-1 receptor resulted in total inhibition of receptor binding under both conditions, showing that the attachment-induced enhancement in specific cell surface IL-1 binding was absolutely dependent on binding to the type I IL-1 receptor (Fig. 2 b). Additional analyses of binding kinetics at a range of IL-1 concentrations revealed a 2-fold reduction in association rate constant in cells attached to fibronectin (k on, 2.42 × 107m−1 min−1) compared with control (k on, 4.77 × 107m−1 min−1) (Fig.3), demonstrating that the effect on the affinity constant shown in Fig. 2 a could be accounted for totally by an effect on the on-rate (k on).Figure 3Fibronectin attachment causes a reduction in the IL-1/IL-1 receptor association rate constant. a,cells plated on fibronectin (fn) or on bare tissue culture plastic (TC), as above, were incubated with various concentrations of radiolabeled IL-1α (0.1–1.5 nm) for various times, as indicated, and the level of cell surface receptor binding determined.

This effect was concentration-dependent and saturable, resulting in about a 40% reduction in IL-1 receptor binding at 10−6-10−5m soluble heparin (data not shown). Thus, in cells plated on fibronectin, cell surface binding of radiolabeled IL-1, measured in the presence of soluble heparin was similar to that measured in cells on bare plastic, whereas addition of chondroitin sulfate had no effect (Fig.4 a). In comparison, in cells plated on bare plastic, addition of soluble heparin had no effect on receptor binding (Fig. 4 b). In contrast, inhibiting integrin aggregation by the use of an RGD peptide (10−4m) or adding a control peptide (RGE, 10−4m) had no effect on cells plated under either condition (data not shown). The effect of fibronectin attachment on the kinetics of IL-1/IL-1 receptor interaction was also inhibited by addition of heparin (Fig. 5). Thus, the association rate constant for cells attaching to fibronectin (k on, 2.4 × 107m−1 min−1) was increased in the presence of heparin (k on, 5.9 × 107m−1 min−1), reaching a value similar to that for cells on tissue plastic (k on, 4.8 × 107m−1 min−1).Figure 4The fibronectin induced effects on IL-1 receptor levels are inhibited by heparin. Cells were plated on fibronectin or on bare tissue culture plastic in panel a or on bare tissue culture plastic in panel b as above and incubated with radiolabeled IL-1α in the presence or absence of soluble heparin (10−5m) or with the same concentration of chondroitin sulfate used as control, and specific IL-1 receptor binding was determined as above. a: ▴, tissue culture; ●, fibronectin; ▵, fibronectin + heparin; ▿, fibronectin + chondroitin sulfate; b: ▴, tissue culture; ▵, tissue culture + heparin; ▿, tissue culture + chondroitin sulfate.

This was present in cells plated either in the presence or absence of fibronectin. In addition, in cells attached to fibronectin, a broad, high molecular mass complex of 300–350 kDa was present that contained between 50 and 70% of the cross-linked IL-1 (Fig. 6). This complex was barely detectable in cells on tissue culture plastic. The presence of 100-fold excess cold ligand resulted in complete blocking of cross-linking of radiolabeled IL-1 to both the 97-kDa band and to the high molecular mass band, demonstrating specificity of both interactions.Figure 6Fibronectin attachment induces formation of a high molecular mass complex.

Instead, 100% of the cross-linked IL-1 was present in the 97-kDa band, as in cells on tissue culture plastic (Fig.7 b).Figure 7a, the attachment induced high molecular mass complex contains a heparan sulfate. Cells were plated on fibronectin and incubated with radiolabeled IL-1, as above. Following ligand binding and cross-linking, cell extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of heparinase (0.2 units/ml) for digestion of glycosaminoglycan chains, prior to separation by gel electrophoresis (3–12% SDS-PAGE). b, formation of the high molecular mass component requires interaction with the heparin binding site on fibronectin. Cells were plated on wild type fibronectin (fn), on a mutant fibronectin lacking the heparin binding domain (fn(hep−)), or on bare tissue culture plastic (TC). Cells were incubated with radiolabeled IL-1α and complexes cross-linked as above. Separation was done using 3–12% SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)An interaction between the IL-1 receptor and the high molecular mass component was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, following IL-1 binding and cross-linking. Thus, a nonblocking monoclonal antibody to the type I IL-1 receptor immunoprecipitated both the 97-kDa and the 300–350-kDa complexes from fibronectin plated cells to which IL-1 had been cross-linked (Fig. 8 a). This procedure, after cell surface iodination and cross-linking, followed by heparinase treatment, revealed a core protein of the recruited proteoglycan of 80–90 kDa (Fig. 8 b). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation following sulfate labeling of the glycosaminoglycan chains after incubation with or without IL-1 showed that the appearance of the high molecular mass band was dependent on ligand binding to the type I receptor (Fig. 8 c).Figure 8a, the fibronectin-induced high molecular mass complex interacts with the IL-1 receptor. Cells were plated on fibronectin and incubated with radiolabeled IL-1 as above. Following cross-linking, the extract was immunoprecipitated with an anti-IL-1 receptor antibody and subsequently subjected to 3–12% SDS-PAGE. The negative control shown (2nd Ab) is an immunoprecipitation carried out in the presence of the second antibody and beads alone. b, the heparan sulfate contains a core protein of 80–90 kDa. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-IL-1 receptor monoclonal antibody (MoAb) was carried out following cell surface iodination of cells plated on fibronectin and incubated with unlabeled IL-1 (1 nm). Extracted samples were incubated with (+Hep) or without (−Hep) heparinase (0.2 unit/ml) and analyzed by 3–12% SDS-PAGE. c, IL-1 receptor/heparan sulfate interaction is stabilized through ligand binding. Cells were plated on fibronectin, biosynthetically labeled using [35S]sulfate (overnight, 37 °C), replated on fibronectin, and incubated with or without unlabeled IL-1 as indicated, followed by cross-linking. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using an anti IL-1 receptor antibody and separated by gel electrophoresis (3–12% SDS-PAGE).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONGlycosylated proteins have been shown to play an important role in cytokine and growth factor regulation of biological responses (40Yamaguchi Yu.

Transfection experiments showed the IL-1 receptor protein in adherent cells to be located at sites of focal adhesion, in agreement with earlier reports using radiolabeled ligand (27Qwarnström E.E. Page R.C. Gillis S. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8261-8269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin attachment through these sites induced formation of a high molecular mass IL-1 receptor complex containing cell surface heparan sulfate, resulting in effects on IL-1 receptor expression and affinity. Induction of these effects was mediated through attachment via the heparin binding domain in fibronectin and stabilized by IL-1/receptor interaction.The increase in type I IL-1 receptor expression induced by fibronectin may reflect an increase in the rate of translocation of receptor protein to the cell surface. It is, however, known that translocation of receptor protein is rapid and that over 95% is normally expressed at the cell surface (46Urdal D.L. Call S.M. Jackson J.L. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2870-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the increase in steady state surface expression could result from retardation in the basal internalization rate, by stabilization in focal adhesions at the cell surface. Such a mechanism, involving masking or immobilization of the receptor protein, is suggested by the slower association rate of the ligand. In addition, this is consistent with the recruitment of the additional high molecular mass component to the IL-1 receptor complex. Finally, the lack of effect using the RGD peptide demonstrated that integrin mediated signaling was not involved and supports the notion that the changes were induced as a direct consequence of alterations in the ligand or in the receptor complex.Involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycan in matrix regulation of IL-1 receptor function was suggested by inhibition of the fibronectin induced effects by soluble heparin and confirmed by digestion of the high molecular mass complex with heparinase. In contrast to heparin regulation of fibroblast growth factor-receptor binding (1Yayon A. Klagburn M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1992; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), in which the ligand binds the proteoglycan with detectable affinity, no interaction occurs initially between IL-1 and the proteoglycan, as suggested by binding studies on cells attached to bare plastic. The effect involves a cell surface component in close proximity to the IL-1 receptor as demonstrated by cell surface labeling, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the heparan sulfate is recruited secondary to IL-1/IL-1 receptor binding, as demonstrated by blocking experiments using a monoclonal antibody or excess cold ligand. The effect involves an increase in a single class of IL-1 binding sites, as judged by affinity constant, again indicating that the IL-1 affinity for the heparan sulfate is low and nondetectable in conventional binding assays. Interfering with IL-1/IL-1 receptor binding required a 10,000-fold higher concentration of the glycosaminoglycan, suggesting an interaction with a K a in the range of 105m similar to that of integrin/matrix interaction and about 100-fold lower than that of heparan-fibroblast growth factor interaction (1Yayon A. Klagburn M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1992; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2073) Google Scholar).The requirement for ligand/IL-1 receptor binding, prior to association of the heparan sulfate suggests a mechanism similar to that in the LIF/oncostatin M system, in which recruitment of gp130 to the receptor complex follows LIF binding (2Kishimoto T. Akira S. Nrazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosely B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Digestion experiments suggested the ligand/heparan sulfate interaction to be due to protein/glycosaminoglycan binding, the most common type of growth factor/proteoglycan interaction. Similar to the heparin-glycosminoglycan-fibroblast growth factor interaction (47Zhu X. Hsu B. Rees D.C. Structure. 1993; 1: 27-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 48Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.M. Waksman G.

Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), it is likely also dependent on sulfation (50Sudhalter J. Folkman J. Svahn C.M. Bergendal K. DAmore P.A. J. Biol Chem. 1989; 264: 6892-6897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could involve a conformational change of the IL-1 protein following interaction with the glycosaminoglycan (51Lindahl U. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Effects of heparan sulfate on the receptor protein are likely indirect, because the only species appearing following sulfate labeling and cross-linking was of the same size as that containing the heparan sulfate and the ligand, observed using radiolabeled IL-1. Thus, the simplest model suggested by this data is that following binding to fibronectin, cell surface heparan sulfate is recruited to the IL-1 receptor complex by IL-1 and that IL-1 functions as a bridge between the receptor and heparan sulfate. Furthermore, the data show that effects of the heparan sulfate binding are induced indirectly through the ligand and that no direct interaction occurs between the t"

In this study, we asked if these two pathways utilize a common translocation pore. A fusion protein consisting of a 23-kDa subunit of the oxygen evolving complex and Escherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein was biotinylated in E. coli cells and purified. When incubated with isolated pea thylakoids in the absence of avidin, the purified fusion protein was imported into the thylakoids via the ΔpH-dependent pathway. However in the presence of avidin, the fusion protein became lodged in the thylakoid membranes, with its N terminus reaching the thylakoidal lumen, while its C-terminal segment complexed with avidin exposed on the thylakoidal surface. The translocation intermediate of the fusion protein inhibited the import of authentic 23-kDa subunit, suggesting that it occupies a putative translocation pore for the ΔpH-dependent pathway. However the intermediate did not block import of the 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen evolving complex, which is a substrate for the Sec-dependent pathway. These results provide evidence against the possibility of a common translocation pore shared by the Sec-dependent pathway and the ΔpH-dependent pathway.

Nuclear-encoded thylakoidal proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, are imported into the chloroplast stroma, and are subsequently inserted into or translocated across the thylakoid membranes.

In vitro competition experiments have shown that the import of a certain substrate protein into isolated thylakoids is effectively competed with saturating amounts of another competitor protein which utilizes the same thylakoidal transport pathway as the substrate protein but not with competitor proteins using other pathways (21Sargent F.

However the competition could occur only in the rate-limiting step of the transport, and the passage through a possible common translocation pore might not correspond to this step. A maize mutant lacking cpSecY shows more severe defects in thylakoid biogenesis than mutants lacking cpSecA, suggesting a possibility that cpSecY is involved in the thylakoidal protein transport along the pathways other than the Sec-dependent one (12Roy L.M. Barkan A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).One of the crucial tests for the possibility of the common translocation pore shared by different thylakoidal transport pathways would be to generate a saturating amount of a translocation intermediate that occupies most of the translocation pores for one pathway and to see its competition effects on the protein transport along other pathways. Such a translocation intermediate will span the thylakoid membranes with topology in which its N terminus reaches the thylakoid lumen while its C terminus remains outside the thylakoids. Since precursor proteins bearing avidin, which forms a stable tetrameric structure and tightly binds biotin, have been successfully used to generate a translocation intermediate spanning the mitochondrial membranes (23Endo T. Nakayama Y. Nakai M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that spanning the chloroplast envelope (24Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol.

The extent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is rapidly attenuated after only 1–2 min of stimulation as a means of tightly controlling the initial signaling response. Here we show that this attenuation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, CrkL, and the proto-oncogene Cbl is mimicked by treatment of mouse T lymphocytes or cultured Jurkat cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This effect is blocked by the specific protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, but not by PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinase. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester also causes rapid (t 12 = 2 min) dissociation of both CrkL and p85/phosphoinositide 3-kinase from Cbl concomitant with Cbl tyrosine dephosphorylation. More important, GF109203X treatment of Jurkat cells prior to T cell receptor stimulation by anti-CD3/CD4 antibodies results in an enhanced (2-fold) peak of Cbl phosphorylation compared with that observed in control cells. Furthermore, the rate of attenuation of both Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with CrkL following stimulation with anti-CD3/CD4 antibodies is much slower in Jurkat cells treated with GF109203X. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that one or more isoforms of phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C play a key role in a feedback mechanism that attenuates tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and reverses formation of signaling complexes in response to T cell receptor activation.

The kinases involved belong to two families of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, the Src (Fyn and Lck) and Syk (Syk and ZAP-70) families (1Alberola-Ila J. Takaki S. Kerner J.D. Perlmutter R.M.

Activation of Lck and/or Fyn leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the intracellular segments of the CD3 ε- and ζ-proteins (4Reth M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24913-24916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by the recruitment, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of ZAP-70. This biochemical response couples the TCR to a diverse group of signal transduction molecules, including adaptor proteins, serine/threonine kinases, phospholipids and their cleavage products, and GTP-binding proteins, leading ultimately to interleukin-2 production and cell proliferation. Such proliferation of T lymphocytes directed against a specific antigen is crucial to mounting appropriate cell-based immune responses to foreign entities.The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins observed after TCR activation is a transient process, apparently a result of the combined actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The ensuing desensitization of tyrosine kinase signaling after stimulation is likely to be important in coordinating the complex network of events that lead to T cell proliferation. An integral part of this response is an internalization of the TCR complex, followed by its degradation by a mechanism that involves the targeting of the internalized receptors to an endocytic degradative pathway (6Reinherz E. Meuer S. Fitzgerald K. Hussey R. Levine H. Schlossman S. Cell. 1982; 30: 735-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 7Valitutti S. Muller S. Cella M. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1995; 375: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). However, the maximal level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation occurs after only 1 or 2 min, and the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins is rapid following this peak (8Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). The rapid kinetics of protein tyrosine dephosphorylation indicate that T cell receptor internalization cannot fully account for deactivation of the signaling pathways following T cell stimulation, but other mechanisms that may be involved are unknown.Two cellular protein substrates for T cell receptor-activated tyrosine kinases that undergo rapid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to antigen presentation are the proto-oncogene products c-Cbl and CrkL. Both have prominent roles in T cell signaling, serving to link receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream effectors such as p85/PI 3-kinase (9Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell.

Cbl contains an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain (19Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol.

Cbl also possesses a number of proline-rich motifs as well as several tyrosine residues in the C terminus that serve as binding sites for SH3 and SH2 domains, respectively (18Blake T.J. Shapiro M.

Bonvini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30806-30811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We reported that D-Cbl, the Drosophila homologue of Cbl containing only the N-terminal portion of the protein, acts as a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated R7 photoreceptor cell development inDrosophila (26Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernández B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The use of c-Cbl-deficient mice has provided further evidence that c-Cbl is involved in the negative control of T cell function. The c-Cbl-deficient mice display marked changes in their hemopoietic profiles, including an enhanced selection of CD4+ T cells, altered TCR expression, lymphoid hyperplasia, primary splenic extramedullary hemopoiesis, and increased ZAP-70 activity (30Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15547-15552Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and its association with p85/p110 PI 3-kinase indicate that the protein also plays some positive signaling role in T cell function. This is reinforced by recent experiments on interleukin-4 signaling (32Ueno H. Sasaki K. Honda H. Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Miyagawa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1998; 91: 46-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that T cell activation is wortmannin-sensitive (33Shi J. Cinek T. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4688-4695PubMed Google Scholar).One possible mechanism for the attenuation of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors and substrate proteins that occurs following initial tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation is suggested by recent data on the serine/threonine phosphorylation of these proteins. For example, substantial evidence suggests that rapid serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its substrate IRS-1 correlates with their decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased binding of IRS-1 to p85/p110 PI 3-kinase (34De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 35De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 causes its binding to 14-3-3 proteins, which may block further tyrosine phosphorylation (36Kosaki A. Yamada K. Suga J. Otaka A. Kuzuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 940-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that after TCR stimulation, Cbl is phosphorylated not only on tyrosine, but also on serine, and that this post-translational modification regulates its interaction with 14-3-3 ζ-proteins (37Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,38Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The phorbol ester PMA was also able to cause serine phosphorylation of Cbl and to induce its interaction with 14-3-3 ζ-proteins, implicating the protein kinase C family of serine/threonine kinases in Cbl function. These considerations prompted us to test whether protein kinase C isoforms might be involved in mediating the attenuation of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation in T lymphocytes following T cell receptor activation. We show here that activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester causes rapid dephosphorylation of tyrosine phosphate sites on three protein substrates of T cell tyrosine kinases (Shc, CrkL, and Cbl) and that the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X causes hyperphosphorylation of Cbl in response to T cell receptor engagement. These results support a key role of protein kinase C in signal attenuation during T lymphocyte stimulation.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here show that PMA addition to T cells causes a rapid decline in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Shc, CrkL, and Cbl (Fig. 1). This effect coincides with rapid dissociation of Cbl-CrkL protein complexes (Fig. 2). More important, the time course of this dissociation is similar to that observed following the transient formation of Cbl-CrkL complexes in response to TCR/CD3 receptor stimulation (Fig. 6). Conversely, when protein kinase C activity is blocked by the inhibitor GF109203X, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and CrkL following TCR/CD3 ligation is significantly amplified (Fig. 5). These results suggest that activation of protein kinase C following TCR ligation, thought to initiate downstream signaling events, also leads to a feedback mechanism that reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and CrkL and hence return to the non-activated state. The PMA-induced dephosphorylation of Shc and other proteins (Fig. 1) and its prevention by GF109203X indicate that protein kinase C activation modulates the tyrosine phosphorylation state of other cellular proteins besides Cbl and CrkL.It is well established that both phorbol esters and TCR ligation by antigen-presenting cells or by anti-CD3 antibody induce internalization of the TCR. The half-life of the TCR complex on the cell surface after PMA treatment is ∼10 min (58Cantrell D.A. Davies A.A Crumpton M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8158-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 59Lauritsen J.P. Christensen M.D. Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Odum N. Geisler C. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18837-18843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to PMA-induced down-regulation and recycling, TCR ligation by antigen-presenting cells or anti-CD3 antibody results in an internalization and targeting to lysosomes for degradation (63Luton F. Buferne M. Davoust J. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar, 64Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The t 12 of ligand-induced TCR degradation has been shown by various investigators to be 15–30 min (6Reinherz E. Meuer S. Fitzgerald K. Hussey R. Levine H. Schlossman S. Cell. 1982; 30: 735-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 7Valitutti S. Muller S. Cella M. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A.

Immunol. 1987; 17: 991-997Google Scholar). By contrast, the data presented here show that the Cbl-CrkL complex is dissociated by PMA or OKT3 plus OKT4 (Figs. 1 and 6) significantly faster, with a t 12 of 2 min. Therefore, the dissociation of CrkL and Cbl precedes, and is not simply a consequence of, activation-induced TCR endocytosis. The similar kinetics of Cbl-CrkL dissociation by TCR ligation or by PMA and blockade of this dissociation by GF109203X are evidence that protein kinase C activation is involved.We also report here that PMA causes the dissociation of CrkL from the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2) and that Cbl mediates the association of p85 with CrkL (Fig. 3). These findings are consistent with results obtained in c-Fms Chinese hamster ovary cells activated by colony-stimulating factor-1, in which prior removal of Cbl from cell lysates diminished by 95% the amount of PI 3-kinase associated with CrkII (67Husson H. Mogarbi B. Schmid-Antomarchi H. Fischer S. Rossi B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By contrast, in MO7e cells, CrkL appears to bind directly to p85 through the CrkL SH3 domains, and this interaction is further increased by Steel factor (23Sattler M. Salgia R. Shrikhande G. Verma S. Pisick E. Prasad K.V.S. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10248-10253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reason for these discrepancies is unknown and can reflect differences in the mechanisms of Cbl-CrkL association in different cell types. Although CrkL becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon T cell activation, no consensus motif is present for the binding of the SH2 domain of p85 (49Gesbert F. Garbay C. Bertoglio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3986-3993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Cbl may play a role as a multifunctional adaptor protein, interacting independently with CrkL and p85, and that PI 3-kinase is dissociated from Cbl after PMA stimulation. It is not known if p85 becomes serine-phosphorylated under the conditions described here; however, it has been demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase greatly reduces PI 3-kinase activity (68Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).The ability of the highly specific cell-permeable protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X to block Cbl-CrkL dissociation is strong evidence that the activation of a conventional or novel protein kinase C isoform is required. GF109203X has no effect on the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases such as insulin, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (53Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although all protein kinase C isoforms can be activated by phospholipids in various cell types, only protein kinases Cα and Cθ are rapidly translocated to the cell membrane of T lymphocytes following antigen-presenting cell recognition (70Szamel M. Appel A. Schwinzer R. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2207-2214PubMed Google Scholar, 71Monks C.R.F. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase Cθ leads, in turn, to an increase in interleukin-2 receptor expression and activation of the MAPK c-Jun N-terminal kinase (70Szamel M. Appel A. Schwinzer R. Resch K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2207-2214PubMed Google Scholar, 72Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Because TCR ligation results in the membrane translocation of Cbl as well (45Hartley D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21939-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is possible that protein kinase C binds to and directly phosphorylates Cbl (11Liu Y.-C. Altman A. Cell. Signaling. 1998; 10: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Evidence that Cbl becomes serine-phosphorylated after PMA or TCR stimulation has been demonstrated by Liu et al. (37Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In these studies, TCR activation caused the serine phosphorylation of a serine-rich region of Cbl extending from amino acids 615 to 644 and enhanced the binding of Cbl to the 14-3-3 protein. However, it is also possible that protein kinase C acts indirectly, i.e. through an activation-dependent decrease in serine phosphatase or increase in tyrosine phosphatase activity. In this context, Cbl was found to be a substrate of the SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (73Uddin S. Gardziola C. Dangat A. Yi T. Platanias L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether the introduction of inactive forms of protein kinase C isozymes, particularly protein kinase Cθ, into T lymphocytes modulates Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and blocks Cbl-CrkL dissociation.Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical mechanism for the regulation of signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation, and development. It is well established that protein kinase C-mediated serine/threonine phosphorylation of growth factor receptors causes an inhibition of receptor protein-tyrosine kinase activity (74Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In human 293 cells, the IRS-1 adaptor protein, which is extensively tyrosine-phosphorylated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase after insulin activation, also becomes serine-phosphorylated (75Sun A. Rothenberg P. Kahn C. Backer J. Araki E. Wilden P. Cahill D. Goldstein B. White M. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), which correlates with the decreased binding of IRS-1 to p85 (34De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Activation of endogenous or transfected protein kinase C by PMA causes extensive serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, resulting in an inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin (35De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and the development of insulin resistance (76Hotamisligil G. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M. Spiegelman B. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Similarly, it is well established that TCR ligation causes the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1, leading to activation of protein kinase C, which in turn phosphorylates phospholipase C-γ1 on serine residues and reverses tyrosine phosphorylation (77Park D.J. Min H.K. Rhee S.G J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1496-1501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also in T cells, PMA treatment reduces thein vitro and in vivo CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation from anti-CD28 antibody-stimulated cells (78Hutchcroft J.E. Tsai B. Bierer B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13362-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), resulting in interleukin-2 production. Thus, serine phosphorylation of several signaling proteins coincides with dephosphorylation of these proteins on tyrosine residues, an event that may provide a critical negative feedback signal for the inhibition of growth factor signaling. In a recent work by Finco et al. (79Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), it has been show that the mutant Jurkat T cell line JCaM2 is deficient in pp36/LAT expression, resulting in defective TCR-mediated signal transduction. More important, these cells show an elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and a significantly diminished phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 and generation of inositol phosphates. It is conceivable that in the absence of LAT, phospholipase C-γ1-dependent activation of protein kinase C does not occur, mimicking the effect of protein kinase C inhibition by GF109203X on Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. Further work will be required to test this hypothesis.

The kinases involved belong to two families of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, the Src (Fyn and Lck) and Syk (Syk and ZAP-70) families (1Alberola-Ila J. Takaki S. Kerner J.D. Perlmutter R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 125-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Cantrell D.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 3Wange R.L.

Activation of Lck and/or Fyn leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the intracellular segments of the CD3 ε- and ζ-proteins (4Reth M.

This biochemical response couples the TCR to a diverse group of signal transduction molecules, including adaptor proteins, seri"

While most people are aware that hemodialysis will keep people with failing kidneys alive, many do not know the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure. For instance, patients in their early 50s who are undergoing chronic hemodialysis have less than a 50:50 chance of surviving for 5 years. Why? The answer has to do with the exact role played by the functioning kidney cells.

The kidney is an amazing organ that functions as both an endocrine gland (secreting a version of vitamin D), and a filtration unit (removing the bloodstream's many toxic waste products). Toxins such as blood urea nitrogen, ammonia, and organic ions will rise to toxic levels in the blood if not for the function of specific cells in the kidney. These key cells are located in the proximal renal tubules. A group in Michigan has now tested whether these cells could augment hemodialysis and yield a better treatment for patients with renal failure.

The investigators used a coupled system that relies on standard ultrafiltration technology to remove small molecules, like blood urea nitrogen, in concert with a novel, cell-based technology to perform the metabolic processes of the kidney. The latter technology is based on the ability to grow porcine proximal renal tubules in culture after harvest from 4- to 6-week-old Yorkshire pigs. These renal cells can be grown as confluent monolayers on the inner surface of hollow fibers. These fibers can then be packed into bioreactor cartridge devices, termed renal tubule assist devices (RAD), that contain up to 2.5 × 109 cells.

To test the function of a such a bioreactor kidney, they chose to use dogs that were put into renal failure by bilateral nephrectomies. By creating a closed perfusion circuit that went from jugular vein to hemofilter to RAD cartridge to jugular vein, they created a system in which to study the biochemical changes produced by the live cells.

First, they did a mock experiment to find whether the porcine cells would be harmed by the toxic metabolites in the blood of human renal failure patients. They took a culture of porcine renal tubules and bathed it in the uremic ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with end-stage renal disease. After culturing these cells with the ultrafiltrate for 1 week, they did not see any significant cell death. The pig renal cells seemed well adapted to functioning in a uremic environment.

Next, they looked at the stability of the porcine cells in the RAD cartridge. The uremic filtrate must flow over the cells in the system, a situation that produces some amount of shear stress on the cell layer. They investigated whether the cells could remain firmly attached during the cleansing run. During the first hour of the run there was some cell loss, but it decreased to near zero for the last part of a 24-hour run. Of the 2.5 × 109 cells, only <6 × 104 cells were lost in total.

The researchers then measured critical elements in the plasma of dogs before and after treatment with the RAD system and compared the results to control dogs that were in renal failure but were left untreated. They found a significant decrease in the levels of potassium and blood urea nitrogen in the treated dogs. Potassium fell from an average of 5.7 meq/l in the untreated dogs to 3.8 meq/l in the treated dogs during the approximately 24-hour treatment procedure. The blood urea nitrogen level fell from 90 to 57 mg/dl in the same treated dogs.

To ask whether metabolic activity was robust in the RAD system, they looked at the processing of ammonia in the filtrate. Ammonia constitutes about 15% of all nitrogenous waste produced in the body. It is also a key player in the removal of acid from the peripheral blood. From analysis of both acid and filtered ammonia levels, the RAD cartridge was shown to be active. In addition, the group measured the level of 1,25-(OH)2D3 an active version of vitamin D produced by functioning kidneys. Amazingly, they found that animals repeatedly treated with RAD had levels of the hormone nearly equivalent to those of normal subjects.

The results of the RAD studies are encouraging, and show nicely how the fruits of cell culture and bioreactor technology can be applied to a medical problem. The next steps may involve experiments to immortalize the porcine renal tubule cells to make it easier to obtain significant supplies for large-scale clinical trials in the future.
