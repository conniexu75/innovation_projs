https://openalex.org/W3093790719,"Objective This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of cancer inpatients with COVID-19 exploring clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. Results The mean age was 55.3 years (SD ± 21.1). Comorbidities were present in 110 (60.8%) cases. The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. Metastatic disease accounted for 90 (49.7%) cases. In total, 63 (34.8%) had recently received cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7% (52 out of 138 patients) and for hematological malignancies, 23.5% (8 out of 34). According to the univariate analysis COVID-19-specific mortality was significantly associated with age over 75 years (P = .002), metastatic cancer (p <0.001), two or more sites of metastases (P < .001), the presence of lung (P < .001) or bone metastases (P = .001), non-curative treatment or best supportive care intent (P < .001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P = .002), admission due to COVID-19 (P = .009), and antibiotics use (P = .02). After multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms of COVID-19 (P = .027) and with two or more metastatic sites (P < .001) showed a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death. Conclusion This is the first Brazilian cohort of cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high."
https://openalex.org/W3093552547,"Introduction 
Multimorbidity and polypharmacy are current challenges when caring for the older population. Both have led to an increase of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), illustrating the need to assess patients’ attitudes towards deprescribing. We aimed to assess the prevalence of PIM use and whether this was associated with patient factors and willingness to deprescribe.


Method 
We analysed data from the LESS Study, a cross-sectional study on self-reported medication and on barriers and enablers towards the willingness to deprescribe (rPATD questionnaire). The survey was conducted among multimorbid (≥3 chronic conditions) participants ≥70 years with polypharmacy (≥5 long-term medications). A subset of the Beers 2019 criteria was applied for the assessment of medication appropriateness.


Results 
Data from 300 patients were analysed. The mean age was 79.1 years (SD 5.7). 53% had at least one PIM (men: 47.8%%, women: 60.4%%; p = 0.007). A higher number of medications was associated with PIM use (p = 0.002). We found high willingness to deprescribe in both participants with and without PIM. Willingness to deprescribe was not associated with PIM use (p = 0.25), nor number of PIMs (p = 0.81).


Conclusion 
The willingness of older adults with polypharmacy towards deprescribing was not associated with PIM use in this study. These results suggest that patients may not be aware if they are taking PIMs. This implies the need for raising patients’ awareness about PIMs through education, especially in females, in order to implement deprescribing in daily practice."
https://openalex.org/W3093803320,"All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), the active metabolite of vitamin A, is an essential signaling molecule in all chordates. Global knockouts of the atRA clearing enzymes Cyp26a1 or Cyp26b1 are embryonic lethal. In adult rodents, inhibition of Cyp26a1 and Cyp26b1 increases atRA concentrations and signaling. However, postnatal knockout of Cyp26a1 does not cause a severe phenotype. We hypothesized that Cyp26b1 is the main atRA clearing Cyp in postnatal mammals. This hypothesis was tested by generating tamoxifen-inducible knockout mouse models of Cyp26b1 alone or with Cyp26a1. Both mouse models showed dermatitis, blepharitis, and splenomegaly. Histology showed infiltration of inflammatory cells including neutrophils and T lymphocytes into the skin and hyperkeratosis/hyperplasia of the nonglandular stomach. The mice lacking both Cyp26a1 and Cyp26b1 also had a reduced lifespan, failed to gain weight, and showed fat atrophy. There were significant changes in vitamin A homeostasis. Postnatal knockout of Cyp26b1 resulted in increased atRA concentrations in the skin while the postnatal knockout of both Cyp26a1 and Cyp26b1 resulted in increased atRA concentrations in the liver, serum, skin, spleen, and intestines. This study demonstrates the paramount role of Cyp26b1 in regulating retinoid homeostasis in postnatal life."
https://openalex.org/W3093961781,"Mechanical cues activate cardiac fibroblasts and induce differentiation into myofibroblasts, which are key steps for development of cardiac fibrosis. In vitro, the high stiffness of plastic culturing conditions will also induce these changes. It is therefore challenging to study resting cardiac fibroblasts and their activation in vitro. Here we investigate the extent to which disrupting mechanotransduction by culturing cardiac fibroblasts on soft hydrogels or in the presence of biochemical inhibitors can be used to maintain resting cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. Primary cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from adult mice and cultured on plastic or soft (4.5 kPa) polyacrylamide hydrogels. Myofibroblast marker gene expression and smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) fibers were quantified by real-time PCR and immunostaining, respectively. Myofibroblast differentiation was prevented on soft hydrogels for 9 days, but had occurred after 15 days on hydrogels. Transferring myofibroblasts to soft hydrogels reduced expression of myofibroblast-associated genes, albeit SMA fibers remained present. Inhibitors of transforming growth factor β receptor I (TGFβRI) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) were effective in preventing and reversing myofibroblast gene expression. SMA fibers were also reduced by blocker treatment although cell morphology did not change. Reversed cardiac fibroblasts maintained the ability to re-differentiate after the removal of blockers, suggesting that these are functionally similar to resting cardiac fibroblasts. However, actin alpha 2 smooth muscle (Acta2), lysyl oxidase (Lox) and periostin (Postn) were no longer sensitive to substrate stiffness, suggesting that transient treatment with mechanotransduction inhibitors changes the mechanosensitivity of some fibrosis-related genes. In summary, our results bring novel insight regarding the relative importance of specific mechanical signaling pathways in regulating different myofibroblast-associated genes. Furthermore, combining blocker treatment with the use of soft hydrogels has not been tested previously and revealed that only some genes remain mechano-sensitive after phenotypic reversion. This is important information for researchers using inhibitors to maintain a “resting” cardiac fibroblast phenotype in vitro as well as for our current understanding of mechanosensitive gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3094203388,"Background Frailty and obesity contribute to the adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, but the interaction between frailty and obesity remains uncertain. Objective To examine the interaction between frailty and obesity on the clinical outcome of PD patients. Design Single centre prospective observational cohort study. Patients 267 prevalent Chinese PD patients were recruited. Measurements Frailty was identified by a standard score. General and central obesity were determined by body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR), respectively. Body composition was assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy. All patients were followed for two years. Outcome measures included all-cause as well as cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization. Results Of the 267 patients, 120 (44.9%) were frail. Frail individuals were more likely to have central obesity (p < 0.001) but not general obesity. Although WHR did not predict patient survival, there was a significant interaction between WHR and frailty on patient survival and cardiovascular survival (p = 0.002 and p = 0.038, respectively). For patients without frailty, the two-year cardiovascular survival was 91.3% and 74.4% for those with and without central obesity, respectively (p = 0.002). For patients with frailty, however, the two-year cardiovascular survival was 64.6% and 66.7% for those with and without central obesity, respectively (p = 0.6). For patients without frailty, the number of hospital admission for cardiovascular disease over 2 years were 0.12 ± 0.37 and 0.34 ± 0.72 for those with and without central obesity, respectively (p = 0.03). For frail patients, however, the number of hospital admission was similar between those with and without central obesity. Conclusion There is a significant interaction between frailty and central obesity on the outcome of PD patients. The protective role of central obesity is only apparent in PD patients without frailty but not the frail ones, and there is a little prognostic value of general (non-central) obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3094409980,"Objectives The aim was to analyse the tumor expression of Notch1, Hes1, Ascl1, and DLL3 in Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and each such biomarker’s potential association with clinical characteristics and prognosis after platinum-doublet chemotherapy (PDCT). Material and methods The protein expression of the biomarkers was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Patients were categorized according to their sensitivity to first line PDCT: with a Progression-free survival (PFS) ≥ 3 months after completion of treatment considered “sensitive” and < 3 months after completion of treatment considered “refractory”. PFS and overall survival were computed using Kaplan-Meier curves with 95% confidence interval. Results and conclusion The study included 46 patients, with 21 and 25 of the patients having “sensitive” and “refractory” disease, respectively. The majority of patients had a high DLL3 expression (n = 38), while a minority had Notch 1-high expression (n = 10). The chi-square test showed that there was a statistically significant negative association between Notch1 and Ascl1 expression (p = 0.013). The overall survival for patients with Notch1- high vs. low expression was 8.1 vs. 12.4 months, respectively (p = 0.036). Notch1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.02). No other biomarker showed any prognostic impact in this highly selected SCLC cohort. DLL3 is highly expressed in the majority of advanced staged SCLC cases, as expected. In the same patient population, Notch1 expression might have a potential prognostic implication, by driving a non-neuroendocrine differentiation process. Given the small number of cases with Notch1 high expression, the results of this study needs to be confirmed on a larger cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3094494906,"Background Uremic pruritus (UP) is a multifactorial problem that contributes to low quality of life in dialysis patients. The long-term influences of UP on dialysis patients are still poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the contribution of UP to long-term outcomes. Materials and method We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct this study. Patients on chronic dialysis were included and divided into UP and non-UP groups according to the long-term prescription of antihistamine in the absence of other indications. The outcomes include infection-related hospitalization, catheter-related infection, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and parathyroidectomy. Results After propensity score matching, 14,760 patients with UP and 29,520 patients without UP were eligible for analysis. After a mean follow-up of 5 years, we found that infection-related hospitalization, MACCE, catheter-related infection, heart failure and parathyroidectomy were all slightly higher in the UP than non-UP group (hazard ratio: 1.18 [1.16–1.21], 1.05 [1.01–1.09], 1.16 [1.12–1.21], 1.08 [1.01–1.16] and 1.10 [1.01–1.20], respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed that the increased risk of adverse events by UP was generally more apparent in younger patients and patients who underwent peritoneal dialysis. Conclusion UP may be significantly associated with an increased risk of long-term morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3094058736,"Objectives Pouchitis is a major complication after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Although there have been many investigations of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in various diseases, its role in predicting the development of pouchitis remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of the NLR for predicting the development of pouchitis after IPAA in UC patients. Materials and methods UC patients who underwent IPAA at Osaka City University Hospital between May 2006 and March 2019 were included. The incidence of pouchitis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Potential preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative predictors for pouchitis, including various demographic and clinical variables, were analyzed. The combined impact of the NLR and other known prognostic factors were investigated using Cox proportional hazard regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Results Forty-nine patients with UC who underwent IPAA were included. The median follow-up period was 18.3 months (interquartile range: 10.7–47.2 months). Eighteen patients (36.7%) developed pouchitis. The incidence of pouchitis was 19.2%, 32.6%, and 45.9% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. NLR was significantly associated with the development of pouchitis in the univariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01–1.28; P = 0.03). The NLR cutoff value of 2.15 was predictive of the development of pouchitis according to receiver operating characteristic analysis (specificity: 67.7%, sensitivity: 72.2%). The incidence of pouchitis was significantly lower in the low NLR group than that in the high NLR group (P = 0.01, log-rank test). Cox regression analyses using IPTW also identified NLR as a prognostic factor for the development of pouchitis by statistically adjusting for background factors (HR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.31–9.89; P = 0.01). Conclusions NLR may be a novel and useful indicator for predicting the development of pouchitis after IPAA in UC and should be introduced in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3094074504,"Background The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) is used world-wide as an observer-rated measure of depression in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) despite continued uncertainty regarding its factor structure. This study investigated the dimensionality of HDRS17 for patients undergoing treatment in UK mental health settings with moderate to severe persistent major depressive disorder (PMDD). Methods Exploratory Structural Equational Modelling (ESEM) was performed to examine the HDRS17 factor structure for adult PMDD patients with HDRS17 score ≥16. Participants (n = 187) were drawn from a multicentre RCT conducted in UK community mental health settings evaluating the outcomes of a depression service comprising CBT and psychopharmacology within a collaborative care model, against treatment as usual (TAU). The construct stability across a 12-month follow-up was examined through a measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) procedure via ESEM. Results ESEM showed HDRS17 had a bi-factor structure for PMDD patients (baseline mean (sd) HDRS17 22.6 (5.2); 87% PMDD >1 year) with an overall depression factor and two group factors: vegetative-worry and retardation-agitation, further complicated by negative item loading. This bi-factor structure was stable over 12 months follow up. Analysis of the HDRS6 showed it had a unidimensional structure, with positive item loading also stable over 12 months. Conclusions In this cohort of moderate-severe PMDD the HDRS17 had a bi-factor structure stable across 12 months with negative item loading on domain specific factors, indicating that it may be more appropriate to multidimensional assessment of settled clinical states, with shorter unidimensional subscales such as the HDRS6 used as measures of change."
https://openalex.org/W3094220020,"The rapid growth of industrial and agricultural activities in Malaysia are leading to the impairment of most of the rivers in recent years through realising various trace metals. This leads to toxicity, particularly when the toxic has entered the food chain. Perak River is one of the most dynamic rivers for the Malaysian population. Therefore, in consideration of the safety issue, this study was conducted to assess the concentration of such metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Pb) in the muscles of most widely consumed fish species (Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Puntius bulum, Puntius daruphani, Hexanematichthys sagor, Channa striatus, Mystacoleucus marginatus, and Devario regina) from different locations of Perak River, Malaysia by employing inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Among the trace metals, Fe and Cd were found to be the highest (29.33–148.01 μg/g) and lowest (0.16–0.49 μg/g) concentration in all of the studied species, respectively. Although the estimated daily intakes (μg/kg/day) of Cd (0.65–0.85), Fe (79.27–352.00) and Pb (0.95–12.17) were higher than their reference, the total target hazard quotients values suggested that the local residents would not experience any adverse health effects from its consumption. In contrast, the target cancer risk value suggested that all fish species posed a potential cancer risk due to Cd and cumulative cancer risk values, strongly implying that continuous consumption of studied fish species would cause cancer development to its consumers."
https://openalex.org/W3093539755,"Multimorbidity is defined as the co-existence of two or more chronic conditions. As life expectancy is increasing so does the prevalence of multimorbidity. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity in Cyprus and identify the most prevalent diseases.A representative sample of n = 1140 individuals over 18 years old was surveyed during 2018-2019. Demographic characteristics as well as the presence of chronic conditions, including mental disorders, were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Diseases were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10).The age and gender standardized prevalence of multimorbidity was 28.6%. Multimorbidity was associated with age (p<0.001), with the highest rate observed among people aged 65+ years old (68.9%). Multimorbidity was higher in women than men (28.2% vs. 22.5%, p < .001) but similar in urban and rural regions (26.4% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.395). The most prevalent chronic diseases among people with multimorbidity were hyperlipidemia (44.7%), followed by hypertension (37.5%), gastric reflux (23.9%), and thyroid diseases (22.2%), while the most common combinations of diseases were in the circulatory and endocrine systems. The profile of the multimorbid individual indicated this to be a person at an older age with a higher BMI, a current smoker with a higher salary.More than one quarter of the general population of Cyprus has multimorbidity, and this rate is almost 70% among the elderly. Multimorbidity is relatively common even in younger ages too. This underlines the need for prevention strategies and health awareness programs for the entire population."
https://openalex.org/W3093578994,"Iris is one of the largest genera in the family Iridaceae, comprising hundreds of species, including numerous economically important horticultural plants used in landscape gardening and herbal medicine. Improved taxonomic classification of Iris species, particularly the endangered Korean-native Iris, is needed for correct species delineation. To this end, identification of diverse genetic markers from Iris genomes would facilitate molecular identification and resolve ambiguous classifications from molecular analyses; however, only two Iris plastid genomes, from Iris gatesii and Iris sanguinea, have been sequenced. Here, we used high-throughput next-generation sequencing, combined with Sanger sequencing, to construct the plastid genomes of 14 Korean-native Iris species with one outgroup and predict their gene content. Using these data, combined with previously published plastid genomes from Iris and one outgroup (Sisyrinchium angustifolium), we constructed a Bayesian phylogenetic tree showing clear speciation among the samples. We further identified sub-genomic regions that have undergone neutral evolution and accurately recapitulate Bayesian-inferred speciation. These contain key markers that could be used to identify and classify Iris samples into taxonomic clades. Our results confirm previously reported speciation patterns and resolve questionable relationships within the Iris genus. These data also provide a valuable resource for studying genetic diversity and refining phylogenetic relationships between Iris species."
https://openalex.org/W3093669074,"Quantification of phenotypic heterogeneity present amongst bacterial cells can be a challenging task. Conventionally, classification and counting of bacteria sub-populations is achieved with manual microscopy, due to the lack of alternative, high-throughput, autonomous approaches. In this work, we apply classification-type convolutional neural networks (cCNN) to classify and enumerate bacterial cell sub-populations (B. subtilis clusters). Here, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the cCNN developed in this study can be as high as 86% when trained on a relatively small dataset (81 images). We also developed a new image preprocessing algorithm, specific to fluorescent microscope images, which increases the amount of training data available for the neural network by 72 times. By summing the classified cells together, the algorithm provides a total cell count which is on parity with manual counting, but is 10.2 times more consistent and 3.8 times faster. Finally, this work presents a complete solution framework for those wishing to learn and implement cCNN in their synthetic biology work."
https://openalex.org/W3094282347,"Many studies have demonstrated that moral philosophies, such as idealism and relativism, could be used as robust predictors of judgements and behaviours related to common moral issues, such as business ethics, unethical beliefs, workplace deviance, marketing practices, gambling, etc. However, little consideration has been given to using moral philosophies to predict environmentally (un)friendly attitudes and behaviours, which could also be classified as moral. In this study, we have assessed the impact of idealism and relativism using the Ethics Position Theory. We have tested its capacity to predict moral identity, moral judgement of social vs. environmental issues, and self-reported pro-environmental behaviours. The results from an online MTurk study of 432 US participants revealed that idealism had a significant impact on all the tested variables, but the case was different with relativism. Consistently with the findings of previous studies, we found relativism to be a strong predictor of moral identity and moral judgement of social issues. In contrast, relativism only weakly interacted with making moral judgements of environmental issues, and had no effects in predicting pro-environmental behaviours. These findings suggest that Ethics Position Theory could have a strong potential for defining moral differences between environmental attitudes and behaviours, capturing the moral drivers of an attitude-behaviour gap, which continuously stands as a barrier in motivating people to become more pro-environmental."
https://openalex.org/W3094548599,"Many epidemiological studies provide us with the evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) contributing to the bacterial genomic diversity that benefits the bacterial populations with increased ability to adapt to the dynamic environments. Campylobacter jejuni, a major cause of acute enteritis in the U.S., often linked with severe post-infection neuropathies, has been reported to exhibit a non-clonal population structure and comparatively higher strain-level genetic variation. In this study, we provide evidence of the HGT of chromosomally encoded genetic markers between C. jejuni cells in the biphasic MH medium. We used two C. jejuni NCTC-11168 mutants harbouring distinct antibiotic-resistance genes [chloramphenicol (Cm) and kanamycin (Km)] present at two different neutral genomic loci. Cultures of both marker strains were mixed together and incubated for 5 hrs, then plated on MH agar plates supplemented with both antibiotics. The recombinant cells with double antibiotic markers were generated at the frequency of 0.02811 ± 0.0035% of the parental strains. PCR assays using locus-specific primers confirmed that transfer of the antibiotic-resistance genes was through homologous recombination. Also, the addition of chicken cecal content increased the recombination efficiency approximately up to 10-fold as compared to the biphasic MH medium (control) at P < 0.05. Furthermore, treating the co-culture with DNase I decreased the available DNA, which in turn significantly reduced recombination efficiency by 99.92% (P < 0.05). We used the cell-free supernatant of 16 hrs-culture of Wild-type C. jejuni as a template for PCR and found DNA sequences from six different genomic regions were easily amplified, indicating the presence of released chromosomal DNA in the culture supernatant. Our findings suggest that HGT in C. jejuni is facilitated in the chicken gut environment contributing to in vivo genomic diversity. Additionally, C. jejuni might have an active mechanism to release its chromosomal DNA into the extracellular environment, further expediting HGT in C. jejuni populations."

In this work, we aimed to find markers of acute toxicity of p,p'-DDT exposure among proteins expressed in NES2Y human pancreatic beta-cells employing 2-D electrophoresis. We exposed NES2Y cells to a high concentration (150 μM, LC96 after 72 hours) of p,p'-DDT for 24 and 30 hours and determined proteins with changed expression using 2-D electrophoresis. We have found 22 proteins that changed their expression. They included proteins involved in ER stress (GRP78, and endoplasmin), mitochondrial proteins (GRP75, ECHM, IDH3A, NDUS1, and NDUS3), proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell morphology (EFHD2, TCPA, NDRG1, and ezrin), and some other proteins (HNRPF, HNRH1, K2C8, vimentin, PBDC1, EF2, PCNA, biliverdin reductase, G3BP1, FRIL, and HSP27). The proteins we have identified may serve as indicators of p,p'-DDT toxicity in beta-cells in future studies, including long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W3093777549,"The present study sought to identify household risk factors associated with aflatoxin contamination within and across diverse Indian food systems and to evaluate their utility in risk modeling. Samples (n = 595) of cereals, pulses, and oil seeds were collected from 160 households across four diverse districts of India and analyzed for aflatoxin B1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Demographic information, food and cropping systems, food management behaviors, and storage environments were profiled for each household. An aflatoxin detection risk index was developed based on household-level features and validated using a repeated 5-fold cross-validation approach. Across districts, between 30–80% of households yielded at least one contaminated sample. Aflatoxin B1 detection rates and mean contamination levels were highest in groundnut and maize, respectively, and lower in other crops. Landholding had a positive univariate effect on household aflatoxin detection, while storage conditions, product source, and the number of protective behaviors used by households did not show significant effects. Presence of groundnut, post-harvest grain washing, use of sack-based storage systems, and cultivation status (farming or non-farming) were identified as the most contributive variables in stepwise logistic regression and were used to generate a household-level risk index. The index had moderate classification accuracy (68% sensitivity and 62% specificity) and significantly correlated with village-wise aflatoxin detection rates. Spatial analysis revealed utility of the index for identifying at-risk localities and households. This study identified several key features associated with aflatoxin contamination in Indian food systems and demonstrated that household characteristics are substantially predictive of aflatoxin risk."
https://openalex.org/W3094310273,"High concentrations of metals in the environment alter bacterial diversity, selecting resistant and tolerant species. The study evaluated the selection of a potential bacterial strain from Sepetiba Bay-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil marine sediments to remove Cu and Pb. The bacterial strain isolated from the sediments was used in three different bioassays: (1) Cu at concentrations of 0 (control), 6 and 50 μg.mL-1; (2) Pb at concentrations of 0 (control), 6 and 50 μg.mL-1; (3) Cu + Pb in concentrations of 3 μg.mL-1 Cu + 3 μg.mL-1 Pb (6 μg.mL-1) and 25 μg.mL-1 Cu + 25 μg.mL-1 Pb (50 μg.mL-1). The number of cells and the enzymatic activities of dehydrogenases and esterases were quantified. Results of taxonomic identification indicated the selection of the Pseudomonas stutzeri W228 strain, showing a greater degree of similarity (±73%) with the database used. There was no significant variation in the number of cells, 108 cells.mL-1, which represents a high biomass production in the presence of stressors. However, we observed a reduction in dehydrogenase activity at all tested concentrations of Cu, Pb and Cu + Pb. The activity of esterase increased, indicating a higher energy demand to complete the bacterial life cycle. The study showed significant results for the absorption of Pb by the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the efflux of Cu. The capacity of Pb absorption by EPS can be considered a resistance mechanism, as well as the efflux of Cu, so that the available EPS sites could be occupied by the most toxic ions demonstrating that Pseudomonas stutzeri is resistant to Pb and Cu."
https://openalex.org/W3093681053,"The Indian River Lagoon, located on the east coast of Florida, USA, is an Estuary of National Significance and an important economic and ecological resource. The Indian River Lagoon faces several environmental pressures, including freshwater discharges through the St. Lucie Estuary; accumulation of anoxic, fine-grained, organic-rich sediment; and metal contamination from agriculture and marinas. Although the Indian River Lagoon has been well-studied, little is known about its microbial communities; thus, a two-year 16S amplicon sequencing study was conducted to assess the spatiotemporal changes of the sediment bacterial and archaeal groups. In general, the Indian River Lagoon exhibited a prokaryotic community that was consistent with other estuarine studies. Statistically different communities were found between the Indian River Lagoon and St. Lucie Estuary due to changes in porewater salinity causing microbes that require salts for growth to be higher in the Indian River Lagoon. The St. Lucie Estuary exhibited more obvious prokaryotic seasonality, such as a higher relative abundance of Betaproteobacteriales in wet season and a higher relative abundance of Flavobacteriales in dry season samples. Distance-based linear models revealed these communities were more affected by changes in total organic matter and copper than changes in temperature. Anaerobic prokaryotes, such as Campylobacterales, were more associated with high total organic matter and copper samples while aerobic prokaryotes, such as Nitrosopumilales, were more associated with low total organic matter and copper samples. This initial study fills the knowledge gap on the Indian River Lagoon bacterial and archaeal communities and serves as important data for future studies to compare to determine possible future changes due to human impacts or environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W3093767466,"Considering that the Pc-Crash multibody dynamics software can reproduce the accident process accurately and obtain the collision parameters of pedestrian heads at the moment of head landing, the finite element analysis method can accurately analyze the injury of the pedestrian head when the boundary conditions are known. This paper combines the accident reconstruction method with the finite element analysis method to study the injury mechanism of pedestrian head impact on the ground in vehicle pedestrian collision accidents to provide a theoretical basis for pedestrian protection and the improvement of vehicle shapes. First, a real-life vehicle pedestrian collision is reproduced by Pc-Crash. The simulation results show that the rigid multibody model can accurately simulate the scene of the accident, then the speed and angle of the pedestrian head landing moment can be obtained at the same time. Second, the finite element model of human heads with a detailed facial structure is established and verified. Finally, the collision parameters obtained from the accident reconstruction are used as the boundary conditions to analyze the collision between the pedestrian head and the ground, and the biomechanical parameters, such as intracranial pressure, von Mises stress, shear stress and strain, can be determined. The results show that the stress wave will propagate inside and outside the skull and cause stress concentration in the skull and the brain tissue to varying degrees after the pedestrian head strikes the ground. When the stress exceeds a certain limit, it will cause different degrees of brain tissue injury."

The basic objective of this examination is to analyze and evaluate the performance of selected marketing mix elements from the perspective of the Poland’s confectionery industry’s sustainable development. The questionnaire survey was designed for this purpose. The purpose of the research questions was to evaluate a degree of development for selected elements of marketing mix from the perspective of sustainable development of the Poland’s confectionery industry. Thus, a novel development ratio based on the distance from exemplary performance was proposed. Next, aseminal approach to pairwise comparisons technique was applied for the importance evaluation of each survey question in order to provide a weighted average Mean Development Ratio (MdeR) for each element of marketing mix. In this process the seminal methodology for pairwise comparisons was applied i.e. a non-heuristic approach to pairwise comparisons technique with verifiable accuracy and reliability. In consequence, assuming that all elements of marketing mix have some designated importance in the process of sustainable development, a total weighted average MdeR for performance of all elements of marketing mix was computed and evaluated. Noticeably, the total weighted average MdeR for performance of all elements of marketing mix cannot be considered as satisfactory from the perspective of sustainable development of the Poland’s confectionery industry."
https://openalex.org/W3094374455,"A precisely balanced activity of canonical Wnt signaling is essential for a number of biological processes and its perturbation leads to developmental defects or diseases. Here, we demonstrate that alternative isoforms of the KDM2A and KDM2B lysine demethylases have the ability to negatively regulate canonical Wnt signaling. These KDM2A and KDM2B isoforms (KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF) lack the N-terminal demethylase domain, but they still have the ability to bind to CpG islands in promoters and to interact with their protein partners via their other functional domains. We have observed that KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF bind to the promoters of axin 2 and cyclin D1, two canonical Wnt signaling target genes, and repress their activity. Moreover, KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are both able to strongly repress a Wnt-responsive luciferase reporter. The transcriptional repression mediated by KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF, but also by KDM2A-LF, is dependent on their DNA binding domain, while the N-terminal demethylase domain is dispensable for this process. Surprisingly, KDM2B-LF is unable to repress both the endogenous promoters and the luciferase reporter. Finally, we show that both KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are able to interact with TCF7L1, one of the transcriptional mediators of canonical Wnt signaling. KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are thus likely to negatively affect the transcription of canonical Wnt signaling target genes by binding to their promoters and by interacting with TCF7L1 and other co-repressors."
https://openalex.org/W3093802057,"Aims Single measurements of higher levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-R1) have been shown to be associated with increased risk of mortality. However, up to date, little is known about the underlying temporal dynamics of sTNF-R1 concentrations and their relation with mortality. We aimed to characterize the effect of changes in sTNFR-1 levels on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, independent from other established risk factors for mortality, including other inflammatory markers. Methods We used data of the population based cohort study CARLA and included 1408 subjects with sTNF-R1 measured at baseline (2002–2006) and first follow-up (2007–2010). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association of baseline and follow-up sTNF-R1 measurements with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality during ~10 years since the first follow-up after adjusting for relevant confounders. Results Based on 211 deaths among 1408 subjects, per each doubling of the baseline sTNF-R1, the risk of all-cause mortality was increased by about 30% (Hazard ratio 1.28, 95% Confidence Interval 0.6–2.7), while per each doubling of the follow-up level of sTNF-R1 mortality was 3-fold (3.11, 1.5–6.5) higher in a model including both measurements and adjusting for confounders. The results were mainly related to the cardiovascular mortality (5.9, 2.1–16.8 per each doubling of follow up sTNF-R1 value). Conclusion Solely the follow-up value, rather than its change from baseline, predicted future mortality. Thus, while sTNF-R1 levels are associated with mortality, particularly cardiovascular, over a long-time period in the general population, if they change, the earlier measurements play no or little role."

However, the recent status of purchasing non-prescribed CHM and the associated factors are not completely understood. We aimed to report the prevalence of purchasing CHM and associated factors. Methods Using data from the 2017 Taiwan Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, we identified 16,528 individuals (householders) aged 18 years and older. Sociodemographic factors, expenditures on medical services and health behaviours were compared between people with and without a history of purchasing non-prescribed CHM by calculating adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Results The one-year prevalence of purchasing non-prescribed CHM was 74.8% in Taiwan. In addition to sociodemographics, marital status (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.88–2.44), the use of traditional Chinese medicine (OR 3.62, 95% CI 3.30–3.97), the purchasing of non-prescribed biochemical medications (OR 3.09, 95% CI 2.75–3.48), the purchasing of health foods (OR 2.59, 95% CI 2.33–2.86), the use of folk therapy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.95–2.64), and a high level of expenditure on alcohol (OR 3.79, 95% CI 3.29–4.36) were strongly correlated with purchasing non-prescribed CHM. Conclusion The one-year prevalence of purchasing non-prescribed CHM is very high in Taiwan and is correlated with sociodemographics, health behaviours, and the utilization of medical care. The interaction of non-prescribed CHM with physician-prescribed herbal medicine and biomedical medications requires more attention."
https://openalex.org/W3094166695,"Effects of aripiprazole on dopamine regulation are being tested as a treatment for patients with a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and addictions, often cocaine dependence. Aripiprazole has one of the fewest side-effects among the second-generation antipsychotics. Nevertheless, severe aripiprazole hepatotoxicity was reported in persons with a history of cocaine and alcohol abuse. Here we report that therapeutically relevant aripiprazole concentrations, equal to laboratory alert levels in patients’ serum, reduce the rate of hepatocytes’ division. This could be an underlying mechanism of severe liver injury development in the patients with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, the two hepatotoxic agents that require increased ability of liver self-regeneration. Monitoring liver functions is, therefore, important in the cases when aripiprazole is co-prescribed or used with drugs with potential hepatotoxic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3094466295,"Trail bridges can improve access to critical services such as health care, schools, and markets. In order to evaluate the impact of trail bridges in rural Rwanda, it is helpful to objectively know how and when they are being used. In this study, we deployed motion-activated digital cameras across several trail bridges installed by the non-profit Bridges to Prosperity. We conducted and validated manual counting of bridge use to establish a ground truth. We adapted an open source computer vision algorithm to identify and count bridge use reflected in the digital images. We found a reliable correlation with less than 3% error bias of bridge crossings per hour between manual counting and those sites at which the cameras logged short video clips. We applied this algorithm across 186 total days of observation at four sites in fall 2019, and observed a total of 33,800 daily bridge crossings ranging from about 20 to over 1,100 individual uses per day, with no apparent correlation between daily or total weekly rainfall and bridge use, potentially indicating that transportation behaviors, after a bridge is installed, are no longer impacted by rainfall conditions. Higher bridge use was observed in the late afternoons, on market and church days, and roughly equal use of the bridge crossings in each direction. These trends are consistent with the design-intent of these bridges."
https://openalex.org/W3093833796,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vision-threatening disorder characterized with retinal vaso-obliteration in phase 1 and pathological neovascularization (NV) in phase 2. However, there has been no effective and safe treatment for ROP. Current management is mainly focused on the reduction of abnormal NV in phase 2, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is the first-line treatment, yet, with great risks of late recurrence and systemic side effects. It has been reported that the severity of vaso-obliteration in phase 1 largely influences subsequent NV, suggesting that it may be a promising target to develop novel treatments for ROP. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential and safety of early rapamycin intervention in treating phase 1 ROP and possible underlying mechanisms using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). We found that intravitreal injection of rapamycin at postnatal day 7 (P7) significantly reduced retinal avascular area, increased vascular density, and reversed the suppression of deep capillaries development in phase 1 of OIR mice. Rapamycin treatment not only reduced vascular apoptosis, but also promoted proliferation and tip cell functions. Additionally, rapamycin did not interfere with normal retinal vascular development. Further investigation showed that Ang1/Tie2 pathway might be involved in rapamycin's vascular protection in phase 1 OIR retinas. Moreover, early rapamycin treatment at P7 had long-term protective effects of reducing retinal NV and avascular area, as well as enhancing vascular maturity in phase 2 of OIR mice. Together, our data suggest that rapamycin may be a safe and promising strategy for early intervention of ROP."
https://openalex.org/W3093918964,"Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) create a powerful regulatory mechanism for maintaining chromosomal integrity in cells. Histone acetylation and methylation, the most widely studied histone PTMs, act in concert with chromatin-associated proteins to control access to genetic information during transcription. Alterations in cellular histone PTMs have been linked to disease states and have crucial biomarker and therapeutic potential. Traditional bottom-up mass spectrometry of histones requires large numbers of cells, typically one million or more. However, for some cell subtype-specific studies, it is difficult or impossible to obtain such large numbers of cells and quantification of rare histone PTMs is often unachievable. An established targeted LC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the abundance of histone PTMs from cell lines and primary human specimens. Sample preparation was modified by omitting nuclear isolation and reducing the rounds of histone derivatization to improve detection of histone peptides down to 1,000 cells. In the current study, we developed and validated a quantitative LC-MS/MS approach tailored for a targeted histone assay of 75 histone peptides with as few as 10,000 cells. Furthermore, we were able to detect and quantify 61 histone peptides from just 1,000 primary human stem cells. Detection of 37 histone peptides was possible from 1,000 acute myeloid leukemia patient cells. We anticipate that this revised method can be used in many applications where achieving large cell numbers is challenging, including rare human cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W3093956102,"Virtual reality (VR) is a potentially challenging social environment for effective communication and collaboration. Thus, we conducted a VR study to determine whether increased familiarity with a teammate would improve performance on a joint decision making task. Specifically, because attitude familiarity, or knowledge of another person’s attitudes, has been correlated with better relationship functioning in the past, we anticipated that team performance would improve when teammates were first asked to discuss their task-relevant attitudes with one another. We also hypothesized that increased familiarity would be particularly useful in immersive VR, where typical social and other nonverbal cues were lacking. Twenty pairs recruited from a workplace environment were randomly assigned to either the Familiar or Control condition before completing a joint decision making task both in VR and on desktop monitors. The manipulation of attitude familiarity was successful: pairs in the Familiar condition were significantly more aware of their partners’ unique task-relevant attitudes. Results found that in VR, Familiar pairs were more accurate at determining patterns to events. Additionally, for teams less experienced in VR, Familiar pairs were also more accurate at predicting future events. However, there was no meaningful statistical difference in pairs’ ability to identify information. Familiar teams also took more time to answer questions, and we found no difference in self-reported communication quality. Overall, this was the first successful manipulation of attitude familiarity and results indicate that such an intervention may prove useful in a collaborative work environment, as Familiar teams demonstrated greater accuracy, especially in VR."
https://openalex.org/W3094002877,"The auditory midbrain (central nucleus of inferior colliculus, ICC) receives multiple brainstem projections and recodes auditory information for perception in higher centers. Many neural response characteristics are represented in gradients (maps) in the three-dimensional ICC space. Map overlap suggests that neurons, depending on their ICC location, encode information in several domains simultaneously by different aspects of their responses. Thus, interdependence of coding, e.g. in spectral and temporal domains, seems to be a general ICC principle. Studies on covariation of response properties and possible impact on sound perception are, however, rare. Here, we evaluated tone-evoked single neuron activity from the mouse ICC and compared shapes of excitatory frequency-response areas (including strength and shape of inhibition within and around the excitatory area; classes I, II, III) with types of temporal response patterns and first-spike response latencies. Analyses showed covariation of sharpness of frequency tuning with constancy and precision of responding to tone onsets. Highest precision (first-spike latency jitter < 1 ms) and stable phasic responses throughout frequency-response areas were the quality mainly of class III neurons with broad frequency tuning, least influenced by inhibition. Class II neurons with narrow frequency tuning and dominating inhibitory influence were unsuitable for time domain coding with high precision. The ICC center seems specialized rather for high spectral resolution (class II presence), lateral parts for constantly precise responding to sound onsets (class III presence). Further, the variation of tone-response latencies in the frequency-response areas of individual neurons with phasic, tonic, phasic-tonic, or pauser responses gave rise to the definition of a core area, which represented a time window of about 20 ms from tone onset for tone-onset responding of the whole ICC. This time window corresponds to the roughly 20 ms shortest time interval that was found critical in several auditory perceptual tasks in humans and mice."
https://openalex.org/W3094341926,"Non-indigenous species are often identified as threats to native species and communities. Yet, the mechanisms that enable many of these invaders to thrive and alter their newly invaded habitats are still not fully understood. This applies to habitats such as widespread sedimentary shorelines characterized by the presence of scattered biogenic clumps of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) structurally more complex than bare sediments. In Atlantic Canada, some of these shorelines are numerically dominated by native mud crabs (Dyspanopeus sayi) but have been gradually invaded by the European green crab (Carcinus maenas). This study describes between-habitat (mussel clump vs. bare sediment) differences in density and diversity of invertebrates. It also tests the impact of juvenile green crabs in comparison to native mud crabs using two approaches: First, measuring habitat-related differences in these crabs’ feeding rates on a common prey (soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria). Second, measuring their influence on invertebrate communities associated with mussel clumps. The results show that mussel clumps hold higher invertebrate density and diversity than surrounding sedimentary bottoms. In the laboratory, the feeding rates of native mud crabs were dependent on the type of habitat (sand flat > mussel clump), whereas those of green crabs were significantly higher and unrelated to the habitat in which predation occurred. In field experiments, juvenile green crabs were also the only predators that changed community structure in the mussel clump habitat. These results indicate that green crabs can cause a significant impact on native species and communities. Moreover, they suggest that the ability of this species to overcome the refuge provided by complex biogenic habitats for prey may represent an unexplored mechanism to explain this invader’s expansion here and elsewhere."

In brief, the algorithm that yields the highest value of the entropy of the partition, for a given number of clusters, is the best one. We show indeed, on a wide range of datasets of various sizes and topological structures, that the ranking provided by the entropy of the partition over a variety of partitioning algorithms is strongly correlated with the overlap with a ground truth partition The codes related to the project are available in https://github.com/Sandipan99/Ranking_cluster_algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3094055700,"Objectives We examined the effect of ‘labels’ versus ‘descriptions’ across four asymptomatic health conditions: pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, mild hyperlipidaemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 3A, on participants’ intentions to pursue further tests. There were four secondary objectives: 1) assessing confidence and satisfaction in their intention to test further; 2) revealing psychological drivers affecting intentions; 3) exploring whether intentions, confidence and satisfaction differ by label vs. description and health condition; and 4) producing a perceptual map of illnesses by label condition. Methods Practitioner validated health-related scenarios were used. Two variants of each condition were developed. Participants were recruited through Qualtrics from Australia, Ireland and Canada and randomly assigned two ‘labelled’ or two ‘descriptive’ scenarios. Results There was no significant difference in intentions to test between label and description conditions (95% CI -0.76 to 0.33 points, p = 0.4). Confidence and satisfaction were both positively associated with intentions: regression coefficient (β) for confidence β = 0.58 points (95% CI 0.49 to 0.68, p < .001) and for satisfaction 0.67 points (95% CI 0.57 to 0.77, p < .001). Predisposition to seek healthcare (β = 0.72; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98), attributing illness to bad luck (β = -0.16 points; 95% CI -0.3 to -0.02), and concern about the health condition (β = 0.51; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.65) also significantly predicted intentions. Conclusions Unlike studies investigating symptomatic illnesses, the disease label effect on behavioural intentions was not supported suggesting that reducing demand for medical services for borderline cases cannot be achieved by labelling. The average intention to test score was higher in this sample than previous symptomatic health-related studies and there was a positive relationship between increased intentions and confidence/satisfaction in one’s decision. Exploratory insights suggested perceptions of the four labelled asymptomatic illnesses all shifted toward greater levels of dread and concern compared to their respective description condition.

https://openalex.org/W3094163840,"High-precision source localization depends on many factors, including a suitable location method. Beamforming-based methods, such as the steered response power (SRP), are a common type of acoustic localization methods. However, these methods have low spatial resolution. The SRP method with phase transform (SRP-PHAT) improves the spatial resolution of SRP and is one of the most effective and robust methods for source localization. However, the introduction of a phase transform to SRP might amplify the power of the noise and result in many local extrema in the SRP space, which has a negative impact on source localization. In this paper, a steered sample algorithm (SSA) based on the reciprocity of wave propagation for acoustic source localization is proposed. The SSA localization process is similar to the hyperbolic Radon transform, which is theoretically analyzed and is the most essential difference form the SRP/SRP-PHAT. Compared with the SRP-PHAT, the experimental results demonstrate that the SSA perform better when it comes to array signal positioning with limited array elements and narrow azimuth signal, where SSA can achieve high precision positioning with lower SNR."

Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between sedentary behaviour and the risk of anxiety symptoms in youth. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association among youth in 24 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods Data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) were analyzed in 59587 youth aged 12–15 years. Most of the country-wide data were nationally representative. Anxiety symptoms were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analyses of country-wise estimates were conducted. Results The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 10.3%. Countrywide meta-analysis demonstrated that sedentary behaviour of >2 h/day (vs.≤2 h/day) was associated with an increased risk of anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.10–1.37). Conclusions This study provides multi-national evidence of the dangerous effect of sedentary behaviour against anxiety symptoms among youth in LMICs. Decreasing the level of sedentary behaviour during adolescence could be an important target for reducing the prevalence of anxiety."

The genes corresponding to the mature enzymes were cloned in a pET vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The two cholesterol oxidases produced from the recombinant E. coli were purified to examine their properties. The amino acid sequence of ChoRI showed significant similarity (57%) to that of ChoRII. ChoRII was more stable than ChoRI in terms of pH and thermal stability. The substrate specificities of these enzymes differed distinctively from one another. Interestingly, the activities of ChoRII toward β-cholestanol, β-sitosterol, and stigmasterol were 2.4-, 2.1-, and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than those of cholesterol. No cholesterol oxidases with high activity toward these sterols have been reported so far. The cholesterol oxidation products from these two enzymes also differed.

https://openalex.org/W3094365612,"The NCoR corepressor plays critical roles in mediating transcriptional repression by both nuclear receptors and non-receptor transcription factors. Alternative mRNA splicing of NCoR produces a series of variants with differing molecular and biological properties. The NCoRω splice-variant inhibits adipogenesis whereas the NCoRδ splice-variant promotes it, and mice bearing a splice-specific knockout of NCoRω display enhanced hepatic steatosis and overall weight gain on a high fat diet as well as a greatly increased resistance to diet-induced glucose intolerance. We report here that the reciprocal NCoRδ splice-specific knock-out mice display the contrary phenotypes of reduced hepatic steatosis and reduced weight gain relative to the NCoRω-/- mice. The NCoRδ-/- mice also fail to demonstrate the strong resistance to diet-induced glucose intolerance exhibited by the NCoRω-/- animals. The NCoR δ and ω variants possess both unique and shared transcriptional targets, with expression of certain hepatic genes affected in opposite directions in the two mutants, others altered in one but not the other genotype, and yet others changed in parallel in both NCoRδ-/- and NCoRω-/- animals versus WT. Gene set expression analysis (GSEA) identified a series of lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolic pathways that are likely to contribute to their distinct steatosis and glucose tolerance phenotypes. We conclude that alternative-splicing of the NCoR corepressor plays a key role in the regulation of hepatic energy storage and utilization, with the NCoRδ and NCoRω variants exerting both opposing and shared functions in many aspects of this phenomenon and in the organism as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W3094417979,"Ditylenchus destructor is a migratory plant-parasitic nematode that causes huge damage to global root and tuber production annually. The main plant hosts of D. destructor contain plenty of starch, which makes the parasitic environment of D. destructor to be different from those of most other plant-parasitic nematodes. It is speculated that D. destructor may harbor some unique pathogenesis-related genes to parasitize the starch-rich hosts. Herein, we focused on the multi-copy alpha-amylase genes in D. destructor, which encode a key starch-catalyzing enzyme. Our previously published D. destructor genome showed that it has three alpha-amylase encoding genes, Dd_02440, Dd_11154, and Dd_13225. Comparative analysis of alpha-amylases from different species demonstrated that the other plant-parasitic nematodes, even Ditylenchus dipsaci in the same genus, harbor only one or no alpha-amylase gene, and the three genes from D. destructor were closely clustered in the phylogenetic tree, indicating that there was a unique expansion of the alpha-amylase gene in D. destructor. The enzymatic activity of the three alpha-amylase proteins was verified by an enzyme assay. Quantitative real-time PCR assay showed that the expression of the three alpha-amylase genes in the post-hatching stage of D. destructor was found to be significantly higher than that in eggs. In the in situ hybridization assay, the expression of the genes was localized to the intestine, implying the association of these genes with nematode digestion. An infection assay in sweet potato demonstrated that RNA interference of any one alpha-amylase gene had no influence on the infectivity of D. destructor. Using the multi-target dsRNA cocktail method, it was found that silencing of two of the three genes inhibited nematode infection, and the infectivity of worms treated with three dsRNA simultaneously changed the most, which decreased by 76.6%. Thus, the multi-copy alpha-amylase genes in D. destructor are compensatory and crucial for nematodes to parasitize the plant host."

However, there are limited records on the exploration of novel biomarkers for seminoma. Hence, we aimed to identify new biomarkers associated with overall survival in seminoma. mRNA-seq and clinical traits of TGCTs were downloaded from UCSC XENA and analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. After intersection with differentially expressed genes in GSE8607, common genes were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and enrichment analyses. Then, the top 10 common genes were investigated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses and univariate Cox regression analyses. Ultimately, TYROBP, CD68, and ITGAM were considered three prognostic biomarkers in seminoma. Based on correlation analysis between these genes and immune infiltrates, we suggest that the three biomarkers influence the survival of seminoma patients, possibly through regulating the infiltration of immune cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TYROBP, CD68, and ITGAM could be regarded as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for seminoma patients."

However, isolating NCCs from adult organs is challenging, because NCCs are broadly distributed throughout the body. Hence, we attempted to directly induce NCCs from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), which can be isolated easily, using small molecule cocktails. We established a controlled induction protocol with two-step application of small molecule cocktails for 6 days. The induction efficiency was evaluated based on mRNA and protein expression of neural crest markers, such as nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10). We also found that various trophic factors were significantly upregulated following treatment with the small molecule cocktails. Therefore, we performed global profiling of cell surface makers and identified distinctly upregulated markers, including the neural crest-specific cell surface markers CD271 and CD57. These results indicate that our chemical treatment can direct human ADSCs to developing into the neural crest lineage. This offers a promising experimental platform to study human NCCs for applications in cell therapy and regenerative medicine."

Proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, renal histology, urinary MGO and d-lactate changes were examined. Compared to the NTS control group, the middle dosage (10 mg/kg/day) of SSC significantly alleviated the development of nephritis based on urine protein measurements (34.40 ± 6.85 vs. 17.33 ± 4.79 mg/day, p<0.05). Pathological observation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) revealed monocyte infiltration, hypertrophy, and crescents were alleviated, and injury scoring also showed improved efficacy for the middle dose of SSC during nephritis (7.92 ± 1.37 vs. 3.50 ± 1.14, p<0.05). Moreover, the significant decreases in urinary levels of MGO (24.71 ± 3.46 vs. 16.72 ± 2.36 μg/mg, p<0.05) and D-lactate (0.31 ± 0.04 vs. 0.23 ± 0.02 μmol/mg, p<0.05) were consistent with the biochemical and pathological examinations. This study demonstrates that MGO and D-lactate may reflect the extent of damage and the efficacy of SSC in NTS nephritis; further studies are required to enable clinical application."

More than 54% of this funding was allocated to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS through the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Africa. However, recent studies indicate contradictory results regarding the effectiveness of PEPFAR. One by Bendavid, Holmes, Bhattacharya, and Miller shows positive effects of PEPFAR in reducing adult mortality in Africa, while another by Duber, Coates, Szekeras, Kaji, and Lewis finds that there are no significant differences in reducing adult mortality in countries that received PEPFAR funding vs countries that did not. Due to their potential impact on policy decisions regarding critical global health funding, we wanted to assess why the results are discrepant. To do this, we replicated the Bendavid study. The replication provides verification that the study replicable and that the analytic choices of the authors are robust to different assumptions or restrictions. This allows us to assess the different choices and data available to the two research groups and draw some conclusions about why the results may be different. Then, focusing on two of the prominently discrepant studies, i.e., the Bendavid study (1998–2008) and the Duber study (2000–2006), we establish why the two studies are in disagreement. We apply appropriate individual-level and country-level analytical methodology as used by Bendavid over the analytical time period used for the Duber study (2000–2006), which originally focused on nationally aggregated data and differed in some key focus countries. For our first objective, we replicated the original Bendavid study findings and our findings support their conclusion that between 1998–2008 all-cause mortality decreased significantly more (OR = 0.84, CI, 0.72–0.99) in countries that implemented PEPFAR. For our second objective (Bendavid’s data and methodology applied to Duber’s study period), we found reduction in all cause adult mortality to be borderline insignificant (OR = 0.87 CI, 0.75–1.01, p = 0.06), most possibly reflecting the abbreviated fewer number of events and sample size over a shorter period. Therefore, our overall analyses are consistent with the conclusion of positive impact of the PEPFAR program in reducing adult mortality. We believe that the discrepancy observed in the original studies mainly a reflection of shortcomings in the analytical approach necessitated by the Duber study’s nationally aggregated dataset or “may reflect a lack of data quality” in the Duber study (Duber, et al. 2010)."
https://openalex.org/W3093843347,"Many research teams perform numerous genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and other types of omic experiments to understand molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of disease and health. Often (but not always), the results of these experiments are deposited in publicly available repository databases. These data records often include phenotypic characteristics following genetic and environmental perturbations, with the aim of discovering underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the phenotypic responses. A constrained set of phenotypic characteristics is usually recorded and these are mostly hypothesis driven of possible to record within financial or practical constraints. We present a novel proof-of-principal computational approach for combining publicly available gene-expression data from control/mutant animal experiments that exhibit a particular phenotype, and we use this approach to predict unobserved phenotypic characteristics in new experiments (data derived from EBI's ArrayExpress and ExpressionAtlas respectively). We utilised available microarray gene-expression data for two phenotypes (starvation-sensitive and sterile) in Drosophila. The data were combined using a linear-mixed effects model with the inclusion of consecutive principal components to account for variability between experiments in conjunction with Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. We present how available data can be ranked in accordance to a phenotypic likelihood of exhibiting these two phenotypes using random forest. The results from our study show that it is possible to integrate seemingly different gene-expression microarray data and predict a potential phenotypic manifestation with a relatively high degree of confidence (>80% AUC). This provides thus far unexplored opportunities for inferring unknown and unbiased phenotypic characteristics from already performed experiments, in order to identify studies for future analyses. Molecular mechanisms associated with gene and environment perturbations are intrinsically linked and give rise to a variety of phenotypic manifestations. Therefore, unravelling the phenotypic spectrum can help to gain insights into disease mechanisms associated with gene and environmental perturbations. Our approach uses public data that are set to increase in volume, thus providing value for money."
https://openalex.org/W3094061799,"This paper presents a Bayesian analysis of linear mixed models for quantile regression based on a Cholesky decomposition for the covariance matrix of random effects. We develop a Bayesian shrinkage approach to quantile mixed regression models using a Bayesian adaptive lasso and an extended Bayesian adaptive group lasso. We also consider variable selection procedures for both fixed and random effects in a linear quantile mixed model via the Bayesian adaptive lasso and extended Bayesian adaptive group lasso with spike and slab priors. To improve mixing of the Markov chains, a simple and efficient partially collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed for posterior inference. Simulation experiments and an application to the Age-Related Macular Degeneration Trial data to demonstrate the proposed methods."
https://openalex.org/W3094519333,"Sib mating increases homozygosity, which therefore increases the risk of inbreeding depression. Selective pressures have favoured the evolution of kin recognition and avoidance of sib mating in numerous species, including the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. We studied the female neurogenomic response associated with sib mating avoidance after females were exposed to courtship displays by i) unrelated males or ii) related males or iii) no courtship (controls). First, by comparing the transcriptional responses of females exposed to courtship displays to those exposed to controls, we saw a rapid and extensive transcriptional shift consistent with social environment. Second, by comparing the transcriptional responses of females exposed to courtship by related to those exposed to unrelated males, we characterized distinct and repeatable transcriptomic patterns that correlated with the relatedness of the courting male. Network analysis revealed 3 modules of specific 'sib-responsive' genes that were distinct from other 'courtship-responsive' modules. Therefore, specific neurogenomic states with characteristic brain transcriptomes associated with different behavioural responses affect sib mating avoidance behaviour."
