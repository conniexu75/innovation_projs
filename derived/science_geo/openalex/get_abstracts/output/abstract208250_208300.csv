https://openalex.org/W169794223,"SUMMARY Tetrahydrofolate is the reductive source in synthesis of the methyl group of thymidylate de novo as shown by tritium trans- fer studies. 1. Tetrahydrofolate labeled with tritium was prepared by chemical reduction with sodium borohydride-H3 and by enzy- matic reduction with reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPNH) labeled stereospecifically with tritium on the A-side. The enzymatically prepared I, L-tetrahydrofolate-H3 was iso- lated in pure form. 2. TPNH was labeled on the ?-side by transfer of tritium from isocitrate-2-H3 and isocitric acid dehydrogenase and by reduction of oxidized triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN+)- tritium on the para position of the nicotinamide ring-with unlabeled glucose 6-phosphate and its specific dehydrogenase. 3. TPNH was labeled on the B-side by transfer of tritium from glucose 6-phosphate-l-H3 and its dehydrogenase. 4. TPNH was labeled on both sides A and B by use of glucose 6-phosphate-1-H3, its specific dehydrogenase, and a catalytic amount of oxidized triphosphopyridine nucleotide. 5. Dihydrofolate reductase from either chicken liver or mouse leukemic cells has stereospecificity for the A-side of the nicotin- amide ring of TPN. 6. Tritium was transferred from tetrahydrofolate-H3 during the synthesis of thymidylate. Degradation of the enzymatically formed thymidylate to 5-methylbarbiturate established un- equivocally that tritium was in the methyl group of the pyrimi- dine. 7. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate was not a 1 carbon donor for thymidylate synthesis."

Acceleration was observed during stimulation of the hypothalamus, and deceleration during stimulation of the septal region. In both areas self-stimulation reduced variability in heart rate."

https://openalex.org/W2050786084,"IT was previously shown that heparin and mucin bind histamine1,2. For this reason we worked with an enzyme acting on mucopolysaccharides, and looked for some modifications of histamine action. Lysozyme inhibits the action of histamine on the isolated guinea pig's ileum. The threshold is about 10−9 (w/v). No inhibitor action was observed towards acetylcholine, serotonin and barium."

When it is combined with an estrogen it provides adequate control of menstrual cyclicity, and, thus far, complete contraceptive effectiveness even in low daily doses."

https://openalex.org/W2048830116,IN previous work we have shown that metabolic alterations in the chain of reactions leading from tryptophan to nicotinic acid are present in both experimental hepatitis by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-3 virus)1 and in human viral hepatitis in the acute stage2.
https://openalex.org/W2050395746,"IN a recent communication Pease and, Bisset1 have given evidence in support of a hypothesis for the origin of myxoviruses from mucous-membrane parasitic bacteria, among other things, from the circumstances attending virus pneumonia (PAP). This condition, although ostensibly caused by a virus (or mycoplasma2), is accompanied by the development of serum agglutinins against a bacterium, Streptococcus MG, in a significant number of patients. Although the Streptococcus can sometimes be isolated from cases of the disease, attempts to demonstrate an antigenic relationship with the Eaton agent have previously failed3."

https://openalex.org/W2013747707,"IN performing chemical determinations on isolated tissues, one is faced with the problem of adequate removal of superficial fluid which adheres to the tissue. This fluid is usually removed by blotting with ‘ion-free’ filter paper. A search of the literature reveals little information concerning a suitable blotting procedure, so one is described here which ensures adequate removal of superficial but not intercellular fluid."

https://openalex.org/W2017764646,"In mice of the genetically obese strain with body fatness below 28 percent, fatness of the eviscerated carcass equaled fatness of the total body. Above 28 percent, the two values diverged with the eviscerated carcass being the higher. In the fattest individuals the prediction of total body fatness from measurements made on the eviscerated carcass may be in error by +6.5 percent-fatness. When total body fatness exceeded about 25 percent, visceral depots no longer participated proportionately, and probably did not participate at all in further fat accretion."

Amino acids tested, other than cysteine, were not stimulatory, except tyrosine and arginine to a slight degree. The pattern of stimulation resembled that brought about by thyroid-stimulating hormone. Stimulation of labeled CO(2) production was greater when glucose-1-C(14) rather than glucose-6-C(14) was the substrate."
