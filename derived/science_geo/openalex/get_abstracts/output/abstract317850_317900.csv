Covariance mapping allows these correlations to be revealed unambiguously. As an example of the applicability of this technique, the dynamics of fragmentation of molecules ionized by an intense picosecond laser are analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2140351311,"A typology was established for more than 5000 ceramic artifacts at Dolni Vestonice, Czechoslovakia. Conjectured methods of manufacture were confirmed by radiography. The compositions and mineralogy of the artifacts were identical to those of the local soil, loess. A firing temperature range of 500 degrees to 800 degrees C was measured and compared with those of hearths and kilns. The mechanism of sintering was impurity-initiated, liquid-phase sintering. Many fracture sections show evidence of thermal shock, although thermal expansion of the loess is low. The making, firing, and sometimes exploding of the figurines may have been the prime function of the ceramics at this site rather than being manufactured as permanent, portable objects."
https://openalex.org/W1984941026,"The distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) in the Allende meteorite has been probed with two-step laser desorption/laser multiphoton ionization mass spectrometry. This method allows direct in situ analysis with a spatial resolution of 1 square millimeter or better of selected organic molecules. Spectra from freshly fractured interior surfaces of the meteorite show that PAH concentrations are locally high compared to the average concentrations found by wet chemical analysis of pulverized samples. The data suggest that the PAHs are primarily associated with the fine-grained matrix, where the organic polymer occurs. In addition, highly substituted PAH skeletons were observed. Interiors of individual chondrules were devoid of PAHs at our detection limit(about 0.05 parts per million)."

Protection from bright light, natural and artificial, has eliminated many falsely positive reactions. (2) Other factors that appear to influence the cephalin flocculation procedure have been briefly mentioned. Misses Dorothy Feinberg, Arvilla Howley and Mary Lanning contributed helpful technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2055429455,"Very high resolution lasers allow spectroscopic pictures to be taken following a collision between two molecular reactants. The features of these ""pictures"" are the electronic, vibrational, rotational, and translational motions of the atomic particles, which relate the quantum states of the reactants to the quantum states of the products. Such state-to-state kinetic information can be used to test the shape and nature of the interaction potential that controls the collision process. The potential itself is akin to a map of the terrain through mountains and valleys where elevation is a measure of energy instead of height. Accurate mapping of this potential surface leads to an understanding of the forces which control rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions. The application of four different advanced laser techniques to the study of collisions between ""hot"" hydrogen(H) atoms and carbon dioxide(CO(2)) molecules has provided a wealth of information about both reactive and nonreactive collisions for this system. The availability of data for rotationally, vibrationally, and translationally inelastic excitation of CO(2) by H atoms, when compared with data for reactive events producing OH + CO, provides insights into the dynamics of collisions between H and CO(2), and illustrates the future promise of these powerful techniques for elucidating features of potential energy surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2017935180,"To the Editor:â€” The Universities Federation for Animal Welfare is compiling a handbook on the care and management of laboratory animals. The aim is to provide a concise, practical manual which will facilitate the uniform and humanitarian care of the smaller laboratory species, and it is in no way intended to produce a comprehensive monograph for each species. It is hoped to publish the work at such a cost that it will be readily accessible to technicians as well as to scientific workers. The different chapters deal with (1) animal houses and their pests, (2) the rat, (3) the mouse, (4) the rabbit, (5) the guinea pig, (6) the vole, (7) the hamster, (8) the cotton rat, (9) the deer mouse, by Prof. Lee R. Dice, University of Michigan, (10) the ferret, (11) the hedgehog, (12) the pigeon, (13) the fowl, (14) the canary, (15) the frog, the African clawed"
