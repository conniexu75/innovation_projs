Hurowitz et al . analyzed 3.5 years of data from the Curiosity rover’s exploration of Gale crater to determine the chemical conditions in the ancient lake. Close to the surface, there were plenty of oxidizing agents and rocks formed from large, dense grains, whereas the deeper layers had more reducing agents and were formed from finer material. This redox stratification led to very different environments in different layers, which provides evidence for Martian climate change. The results will aid our understanding of where and when Mars was once habitable. Science , this issue p. eaah6849"

https://openalex.org/W2512950167,"Detecting unusual oscillations Under the influence of a constant force, an electron in the periodic potential of a crystal lattice undergoes so-called Bloch oscillations. The same phenomenon has been seen with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, but it is not expected to occur in a uniform system. Meinert et al . observed Bloch oscillations of an impurity atom in one-dimensional tubes of strongly interacting cesium atoms—a system without built-in periodicity. Owing to the strong interactions, the bosonic atoms stayed away from one another, forming an effective lattice. The researchers observed reflections of the impurity atoms of this effective lattice in momentum space, with the lattice constant corresponding to the interatomic distance of the host gas.

https://openalex.org/W2621102750,"Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in disordered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the disordered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a disordered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong disorder-induced reflections that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in transmission, or the opposite feature of enhanced transmission. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the reflection appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing."

We studied wing and pectoral skeleton reduction leading to flightlessness in the Galapagos cormorant (Phalacrocorax harrisi). We sequenced and de novo assembled the genomes of four cormorant species and applied a predictive and comparative genomics approach to find candidate variants that may have contributed to the evolution of flightlessness. These analyses and cross-species experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans and in chondrogenic cell lines implicated variants in genes necessary for transcriptional regulation and function of the primary cilium. Cilia are essential for Hedgehog signaling, and humans affected by skeletal ciliopathies suffer from premature bone growth arrest, mirroring skeletal features associated with loss of flight."

https://openalex.org/W2620864330,"Allosteric drugs, which bind to proteins in regions other than their main ligand-binding or active sites, make it possible to target proteins considered “undruggable” and to develop new therapies that circumvent existing resistance. Despite growing interest in allosteric drug discovery, rational design is limited by a lack of sufficient structural information about alternative binding sites in proteins. Previously, we used Markov State Models (MSMs) to identify such “cryptic pockets,” and here we describe a method for identifying compounds that bind in these cryptic pockets and modulate enzyme activity. Experimental tests validate our approach by revealing both an inhibitor and two activators of TEM β-lactamase (TEM). To identify hits, a library of compounds is first virtually screened against either the crystal structure of a known cryptic pocket or an ensemble of structures containing the same cryptic pocket that is extracted from an MSM. Hit compounds are then screened experimentally and characterized kinetically in individual assays. We identify three hits, one inhibitor and two activators, demonstrating that screening for binding to allosteric sites can result in both positive and negative modulation. The hit compounds have modest effects on TEM activity, but all have higher affinities than previously identified inhibitors, which bind the same cryptic pocket but were found, by chance, via a computational screen targeting the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis of key contact residues predicted by the docking models is used to confirm that the compounds bind in the cryptic pocket as intended. Because hit compounds are identified from docking against both the crystal structure and structures from the MSM, this platform should prove suitable for many proteins, particularly targets whose crystal structures lack obvious druggable pockets, and for identifying both inhibitory and activating small-molecule modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2620878032,"Monitoring metabolic adaptation to chronic kidney disease (CKD) early in the time course of the disease is challenging. As a non-invasive technique, analysis of exhaled breath profiles is especially attractive in children. Up to now, no reports on breath profiles in this patient cohort are available. 116 pediatric subjects suffering from mild-to-moderate CKD (n = 48) or having a functional renal transplant KTx (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 60) matched for age and sex were investigated. Non-invasive quantitative analysis of exhaled breath profiles by means of a highly sensitive online mass spectrometric technique (PTR-ToF) was used. CKD stage, the underlying renal disease (HUS; glomerular diseases; abnormalities of kidney and urinary tract or polycystic kidney disease) and the presence of a functional renal transplant were considered as classifiers. Exhaled volatile organic compound (VOC) patterns differed between CKD/ KTx patients and healthy children. Amounts of ammonia, ethanol, isoprene, pentanal and heptanal were higher in patients compared to healthy controls (556, 146, 70.5, 9.3, and 5.4 ppbV vs. 284, 82.4, 49.6, 5.30, and 2.78 ppbV). Methylamine concentrations were lower in the patient group (6.5 vs 10.1 ppbV). These concentration differences were most pronounced in HUS and kidney transplanted patients. When patients were grouped with respect to degree of renal failure these differences could still be detected. Ammonia accumulated already in CKD stage 1, whereas alterations of isoprene (linked to cholesterol metabolism), pentanal and heptanal (linked to oxidative stress) concentrations were detectable in the breath of patients with CKD stage 2 to 4. Only weak associations between serum creatinine and exhaled VOCs were noted. Non-invasive breath testing may help to understand basic mechanisms and metabolic adaptation accompanying progression of CKD. Our results support the current notion that metabolic adaptation occurs early during the time course of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2620590295,"We aimed to investigate the association of the expression levels of five epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins (Snail, Twist, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin) with tumorigenesis, pathologic parameters and prognosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) patients by immunohistochemistry of tissue microarray. The expression levels of Snail, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin were significantly different between the tumor adjacent normal and tumor tissues. In tumor tissues, lower E-cadherin and higher N-cadherin levels were associated with a higher grade of cell differentiation, advanced stage of disease, and lymph node metastasis. However, higher Vimentin expression was associated with poor cell differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Patients with low E-cadherin expression had poor disease-specific survival (DSS). Conversely, positive N-cadherin and higher Vimentin expression levels were associated with poor DSS and disease-free survival. Notably, our multivariate Cox regression model indicated that high Vimentin expression was an adverse prognostic factor for DSS in TSCC patients, even after the adjustment for cell differentiation, pathological stage, and expression levels of Snail, Twist, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. Snail, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin were associated with tumorigenesis and pathological outcomes. Among the five EMT-related proteins, Vimentin was a potential prognostic factor for TSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2620901688,"Methods Alanine scan of insulin receptor (IR)-B exon 11 and site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid 718 in human IR-A and IR-B were performed. Ligand affinities to wild type and mutated receptors were studied by displacement of radioactive insulin in binding assay on secreted soluble midi receptors or solubilized semi-purified full length receptors stably expressed in Baby Hamster Kidney cells. Phosphorylation of IR in response to insulin, IGF1 and IGF2 was measured using ELISA. Results Insulin, insulin detemir and insulin glargine maximally showed two fold differences in affinity for human IR-A and IR-B, but IGF1 and IGF2 had up to 10 fold preference for IR-A. Alanine scan of exon 11 revealed that position 718 is important for low IGF1 affinity to IR-B. Mutational analysis of amino acid residue 718 in IR-A and IR-B demonstrated that charge is important for IGF1 and IGF2 affinity but not important for insulin affinity. The affinity of IGF1 and IGF2 for the mutant IR-A P718K was comparable to the wild type IR-B whereas the affinity of IGF1 and IGF2 for the mutant IR-B K718P was comparable to the wild type IR-A. Changes in affinity were also reflected in the IR activation pattern. Conclusion Mutating position 718 in human IR-B to the proline found at position 718 in human IR-A increased IGF1 and IGF2 affinity to a level comparable to IR-A and mutating position 718 in IR-A to the lysine found at position 718 in IR-B decreased IGF1 and IGF2 affinity to a level comparable to IR-B, whereas a negatively charged glutamate did not. These changes in the affinities were also reflected in the IR phosphorylation pattern, meaning that position 718 is important for both affinity and activation of the receptor. It should be emphasized that none of the mutations affected insulin affinity, indicating that the mutations did not alter the overall receptor structure and that the effect is ligand specific."
https://openalex.org/W2621280449,"Background Differences in within-person emotion dynamics may be an important source of heterogeneity in depression. To investigate these dynamics, researchers have previously combined multilevel regression analyses with network representations. However, sparse network methods, specifically developed for longitudinal network analyses, have not been applied. Therefore, this study used this approach to investigate population-level and individual-level emotion dynamics in healthy and depressed persons and compared this method with the multilevel approach. Methods Time-series data were collected in pair-matched healthy persons and major depressive disorder (MDD) patients (n = 54). Seven positive affect (PA) and seven negative affect (NA) items were administered electronically at 90 times (30 days; thrice per day). The population-level (healthy vs. MDD) and individual-level time series were analyzed using a sparse longitudinal network model based on vector autoregression. The population-level model was also estimated with a multilevel approach. Effects of different preprocessing steps were evaluated as well. The characteristics of the longitudinal networks were investigated to gain insight into the emotion dynamics. Results In the population-level networks, longitudinal network connectivity was strongest in the healthy group, with nodes showing more and stronger longitudinal associations with each other. Individually estimated networks varied strongly across individuals. Individual variations in network connectivity were unrelated to baseline characteristics (depression status, neuroticism, severity). A multilevel approach applied to the same data showed higher connectivity in the MDD group, which seemed partly related to the preprocessing approach. Conclusions The sparse network approach can be useful for the estimation of networks with multiple nodes, where overparameterization is an issue, and for individual-level networks. However, its current inability to model random effects makes it less useful as a population-level approach in case of large heterogeneity. Different preprocessing strategies appeared to strongly influence the results, complicating inferences about network density."
https://openalex.org/W2620718902,"One single bout of exercise can be associated with positive effects on cognition, due to physiological changes associated with muscular activity, increased arousal, and training of cognitive skills during exercise. While the positive effects of life-long physical activity on cognitive ageing are well demonstrated, it is not well established whether one bout of exercise is sufficient to register such benefits in older adults. The aim of this study was to test the effect of one bout of exercise on two cognitive processes essential to daily life and known to decline with ageing: audio-visual perception and immediate memory. Fifty-eight older adults took part in a quasi-experimental design study and were divided into three groups based on their habitual activity (open skill exercise (mean age = 69.65, SD = 5.64), closed skill exercise, N = 18, 94% female; sedentary activity-control group, N = 21, 62% female). They were then tested before and after their activity (duration between 60 and 80 minutes). Results showed improvement in sensitivity in audio-visual perception in the open skill group and improvements in one of the measures of immediate memory in both exercise groups, after controlling for baseline differences including global cognition and health. These findings indicate that immediate benefits for cross-modal perception and memory can be obtained after open skill exercise. However, improvements after closed skill exercise may be limited to memory benefits. Perceptual benefits are likely to be associated with arousal, while memory benefits may be due to the training effects provided by task requirements during exercise. The respective role of qualitative and quantitative differences between these activities in terms of immediate cognitive benefits should be further investigated. Importantly, the present results present the first evidence for a modulation of cross-modal perception by exercise, providing a plausible avenue for rehabilitation of cross-modal perception deficits, which are emerging as a significant contributor to functional decline in ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2621377595,"Cognitive impairment seems to be frequent in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) survivors, but remains widely understudied. In this study, we investigated the frequency and patterns of vascular cognitive disorders (VCDs) in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-related and deep ICH compared to patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) and healthy controls.We prospectively recruited 20 patients with CAA-related lobar ICH, 20 with deep ICH, 20 with MCI-AD and 17 healthy controls. Patients with cognitive decline pre-ICH were excluded from the analysis. Each participant underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and a structural brain MRI. Cognitive assessment was performed at a median delay of 4 months after the acute phase in ICH patients, and more than 6 months after the first complaint in MCI-AD patients. Cognitive profiles were compared between groups. The prevalence of VCDs in the ICH groups was estimated using the recent VASCOG criteria.""Mild"" and ""major VCDs"" were respectively observed in 87.5% and 2.5% of all ICH patients. Every patient in the CAA group had mild VCDs. No significant difference was observed in cognitive functioning between CAA-related and deep ICH patients. The most impaired process in the CAA group was naming, with a mean (±standard deviation) z-score of -5.2 ±5.5, followed by processing speed (-4.1±3.3), executive functioning (-2.6 ±2.5), memory (-2.4 ±3.5) and attention (-0.9 ±1.3). This cognitive pattern was different from the MCI-AD patients, but the groups were only different in gestural praxis, and by construction, in memory processes.VCDs are frequent after ICH. Cognitive patterns of patients with deep or CAA-related ICH did not differ, but there was impaired performance in specific domains distinct from the effects of Alzheimer's disease.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

https://openalex.org/W2621038115,"Litchi downy blight, caused by Peronophythora litchii, is one of the major diseases of litchi and has caused severe economic losses. P. litchii has the unique ability to produce downy mildew like sporangiophores under artificial culture. The pathogen had been placed in a new family Peronophytophthoraceae by some authors. In this study, the whole transcriptome of P. litchii from mycelia, sporangia, and zoospores was sequenced for the first time. A set of 23637 transcripts with an average length of 1284 bp was assembled. Using six open reading frame (ORF) predictors, 19267 representative ORFs were identified and were annotated by searching against several public databases. There were 4666 conserved gene families and various sets of lineage-specific genes among P. litchii and other four closely related oomycetes. In silico analyses revealed 490 pathogen-related proteins including 128 RXLR and 22 CRN effector candidates. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of 164 single copy orthologs from 22 species, it is validated that P. litchii is in the genus Phytophthora. Our work provides valuable data to elucidate the pathogenicity basis and ascertain the taxonomic status of P. litchii."
https://openalex.org/W2621021733,"Heterodimeric PEBP2/CBFs are key regulators in diverse biological processes, such as haematopoietic stem-cell generation, bone formation and cancers. In this work, we cloned runt-like transcriptional factor (designated as PmRunt) and CBF β (designated as PmCBF) gene, which comprise the heterodimeric transcriptional factor in Pinctada martensii. PmRunt was identified with an open reading frame that encodes 545 amino acids and has typical Runt domain. Phylogenetic analysis results speculated that runt-like transcriptional factors (RDs) in vertebrates and invertebrates are separated into two branches. In molluscs, PmRunt and other RDs are clustered in one of these branches. Direct interaction between PmRunt and PmCBF was evidenced by yeast two-hybrid assay results. Gene repression by RNA interference decreased the expression level of PmRunt, and subsequent observation of the inner surface of the nacre by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated disordered growth. The luciferase activities of reporters that contain promoter regions of Collagen VI-like (PmColVI) and PmNacrein were enhanced by PmRunt. Meanwhile, Pm-miR-183 apparently inhibited the relative luciferase activity of reporters containing the 3′-UTR of PmRunt. The expression level of PmRunt was repressed after Pm-miR-183 was overexpressed in the mantle tissue. Therefore, we proposed that PmRunt could be targeted by Pm-miR-183 and regulate the transcription of PmColVI and PmNacrein by increasing their transcriptional activity, thereby governing nacre formation."
https://openalex.org/W2621402842,"Wildlife residing in urban landscapes face many human-related threats to their survival. For birds, collision with glass on manmade structures has been identified as a major hazard, causing hundreds of millions of avian fatalities in North America every year. Although research has investigated factors associated with bird-glass collision mortality at buildings, no prior studies have focused on bird fatalities at glass-walled bus shelters. Our objectives in this study were to describe the magnitude of bird-bus shelter collisions in the city of Stillwater, Oklahoma and assess potential predictors of collision risk, including characteristics of shelters (glass area) and surrounding land cover (e.g., vegetative features). We surveyed for bird carcasses and indirect collision evidence at 18 bus shelters over a five-month period. Linear regression and model selection results revealed that the amount of glass on shelters and the area of lawn within 50 m of shelters were both positively related to fatal bird collisions; glass area was also positively associated with observations of collision evidence on glass surfaces. After accounting for scavenger removal of carcasses, we estimate that a minimum of 34 birds are killed each year between May and September by collision with the 36 bus shelters in the city of Stillwater. While our study provides an initial look at bird fatalities at bus shelters, additional research is needed to generate a large-scale estimate of collision mortality and to assess species composition of fatalities at a national scale. Designing new bus shelters to include less glass and retrofitting existing shelters to increase visibility of glass to birds will likely reduce fatal bird collisions at bus shelters and thus reduce the cumulative magnitude of anthropogenic impacts to birds in cities."

In animal models, plaque hypoxia is also associated with depletion of glucose and ATP. ATP depletion may impair healing of plaques and promote necrotic core expansion. To investigate if ATP depletion is present in human plaques, we analyzed the distribution of energy metabolites (ATP, glucose, glycogen and lactate) in intermediate and advanced human plaques.Snap frozen carotid endarterectomies from 6 symptomatic patients were analyzed. Each endarterectomy included a large plaque ranging from the common carotid artery (CCA) to the internal carotid artery (ICA). ATP, glucose, and glycogen concentrations were lower in advanced (ICA) compared to intermediate plaques (CCA), whereas lactate concentrations were higher. The lowest concentrations of ATP, glucose and glycogen were detected in the perinecrotic zone of advanced plaques.Our study demonstrates severe ATP depletion and glucose deficiency in the perinecrotic zone of human advanced atherosclerotic plaques.

In order to select and evaluate appropriate germplasm to produce biodiesel, we analyzed the genetic diversity of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge germplasm based on morphological traits and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in this study. Fifty-six germplasm samples were evaluated using nine morphological traits and 23 SSR loci. Significant differences among germplasms were observed in eight morphological characters. The SSR markers analysis showed high genetic diversity among the germplasms. All SSRs had polymorphisms, and we detected 77 alleles in total. The number of alleles at each locus ranged from two to six, averaging 3.35 per marker. The polymorphic information content values ranged from 0.36 to 0.61, averaging 0.49. Expected heterozygosity, observed heterozygosity, and Shannon’s information index calculations detected large genetic variations among germplasms. The high average number of alleles per locus and the allelic diversity observed in the set of genotypes analyzed indicated that the genetic base of this species is relatively wide. Thus, microsatellite markers can be used to efficiently distinguish Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge germplasms and assess their genetic diversity. Hundred-grain weight and lateral diameter were positively correlated with monounsaturated fatty acids and depended on genotype. These results suggest that seeds with higher hundred-grain weight and lateral diameter could be more suitable to produce biodiesel.

Obesity is a well-recognized risk factor for thrombotic cardiovascular complications including ischemic stroke, and it has been linked with increased plasma vWF. We evaluated whether elevated plasma levels of vWF associate with areas of visceral (VAT), pericardial (PAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) compartments in patients with acute/subacute stroke. Methods and results A total of 69 patients with stroke of suspected cardiogenic etiology were examined. The plasma level of vWF antigen (vWF-ag) was measured both in the acute phase and in the chronic phase three months after stroke. The areas of VAT and/or PAT were assessed with computed tomography. As expected, in stroke patients, the levels of plasma vWF-ag were significantly higher than in the national reference population both in the acute and in the chronic phase. The level of vWF-ag in the chronic phase correlated with the amounts of VAT and PAT, but not with subcutaneous adipose tissue. Conclusions These results agree with previous observations of the chronic inflammation/prothrombotic tendency in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Future studies should seek to clarify the role of visceral type adipose tissue in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke."

If the black holes started out as paired stars, then they should spin in the same direction as their orbital axis. If the black holes formed before they paired, then they could spin in any direction. On 4 January, LIGO twin detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, spotted black holes of 31 and 19 solar masses spiraling together 3 billion light-years from Earth. By comparing the second-long ripple picked up by the detectors with previously calculated waveforms, the LIGO team determined that the black hole spins were not aligned, and that there9s an 80% probability that at least one of them spun in generally the opposite sense of the orbital motion. In this case, at least, the dynamical pairing scenario seems more likely."

Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the most studied plant species, and, as a model organism, there is a need to understand its origin and genetic diversity. Durvasula et al. investigated the genetic diversity of Arabidopsis populations from Africa. Contrary to previous hypotheses suggesting that Arabidopsis was introduced recently to Africa, the samples examined did not derive from other continents. Furthermore, Arabidopsis samples examined from sub-Saharan Africa were native and exhibited more variation and ancient diversity than Eurasian samples, suggesting an African origin. Interestingly, the spread of Arabidopsis out of Africa reflects the patterns of genetic diversity seen in other species, including humans, suggesting a common response to the climate among disparate organisms.

Climate warming should decrease the concentration of dissolved oxygen (O2) in the surface ocean, for a variety of reasons. This trend, predicted on theoretical grounds and by ocean models, has been difficult to detect within the much greater range of natural variability, though. Ito et al. analyzed existing measurements of O2 in the ocean collected from 1958 to 2015, and they report that a widespread negative O2 trend has begun to emerge. Further work will be needed to understand which mechanisms are responsible for the global and regional trends, however.

Among them, we find one of the earliest pie charts, created in 1805 to visualize the area of different states in America; a yet-to-be-deciphered disk, produced in 1700 B.C.E. on the island of Crete; and a finely detailed Korean star chart, based on a stone engraving from 1395. The images come from different times and places and afford glimpses into different systems of knowledge and preoccupations. What unites them is their reliance on the same elemental shape."

The satellite dwarf galaxies that orbit our Milky Way can be used to constrain models of cosmology. Cautun and Frenk examined the 10 Milky Way satellites whose three-dimensional velocities have been measured precisely and compared them with a cosmological simulation. They find that the observed velocities are mostly tangential (i.e., favoring circular orbits), whereas the simulation predicts that radial motions should dominate. That difference is unlikely but not impossible: Only a few percent of simulated galaxies are as extreme as the Milky Way. Either the observations or models are biased, the Milky Way is a statistical outlier, or our understanding of cosmology is incomplete.

In the tropics, the single-celled parasite Leishmania major transmitted by biting sandflies causes cutaneous leishmaniasis. This difficult-to-treat infection causes disfiguring lesions, and there is no protective vaccine. Glennie et al. studied a population of skin-resident CD4+ memory T cells that can promote a protective immune response in mice. They found that within 3 days of infection, these cells recruited inflammatory monocytes to the infection site. The monocytes helped to kill the parasites by releasing nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species. The skin-resident T cells were key to protection; circulating T cells could not substitute for their protective role within the skin. Thus, the barrier function of the skin is fortified by the presence of these immunological sentinels.

Magnetic tunnel junctions, which are essential to the function of hard drive read heads in modern computers, allow current to pass when the spins of their two ferromagnetic layers are pointing in the same direction. Eisenstein et al. built a magnetic tunnel junction out of much more exotic components: a bilayer of GaAs quantum wells, each hosting a two-dimensional electron gas. A perpendicular external magnetic field caused the electrons in each well to group into the so-called Landau energy levels. When the filling fraction was 5/2 in one layer and 7/2 in the other, the junction acted as a diode, allowing the tunneling of current in essentially only one direction. This suggests that each layer acted like a ferromagnet, with full spin polarization.
