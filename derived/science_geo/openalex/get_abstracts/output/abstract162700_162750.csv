https://openalex.org/W2004767178,"The stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin in muscle and adipose tissue requires translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter protein from intracellular storage sites to the cell surface1,2,3,4,5,6. Although the cellular dynamics of GLUT4 vesicle trafficking are well described, the signalling pathways that link the insulin receptor to GLUT4 translocation remain poorly understood. Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) is required for this trafficking event, but it is not sufficient to produce GLUT4 translocation7. We previously described a pathway involving the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl, which is recruited to the insulin receptor by the adapter protein CAP8,9. On phosphorylation, Cbl is translocated to lipid rafts. Blocking this step completely inhibits the stimulation of GLUT4 translocation by insulin10. Here we show that phosphorylated Cbl recruits the CrkII–C3G complex to lipid rafts, where C3G specifically activates the small GTP-binding protein TC10. This process is independent of PI(3)K, but requires the translocation of Cbl, Crk and C3G to the lipid raft. The activation of TC10 is essential for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. The TC10 pathway functions in parallel with PI(3)K to stimulate fully GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin."

https://openalex.org/W2089337462,"Adult-like expertise in processing face information takes years to develop1 and is mediated in part by specialized cortical mechanisms2 sensitive to the spacing of facial features (configural processing)3. Here we show that deprivation of patterned visual input from birth until 2–6 months of age results in permanent deficits in configural face processing. Even after more than nine years' recovery, patients treated for bilateral congenital cataracts were severely impaired at differentiating faces that differed only in the spacing of their features, but were normal in distinguishing those varying only in the shape of individual features. These findings indicate that early visual input is necessary for normal development of the neural architecture that will later specialize for configural processing of faces."

https://openalex.org/W2019129382,"Migration is a basic feature of many cell types in a wide range of species1. Since the 1800s, cell migration has been proposed to occur in the nervous and immune systems2,3, and distinct molecular cues for mammalian neurons and leukocytes have been identified. Here we report that Slit, a secreted protein previously known for its role of repulsion in axon guidance and neuronal migration, can also inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis induced by chemotactic factors. Slit inhibition of the chemokine-induced chemotaxis can be reconstituted by the co-expression of a chemokine receptor containing seven transmembrane domains and Roundabout (Robo), a Slit receptor containing a single transmembrane domain. Thus, there is a functional interaction between single and seven transmembrane receptors. Our results reveal the activity of a neuronal guidance cue in regulating leukocyte migration and indicate that there may be a general conservation of guidance mechanisms underlying metazoan cell migration. In addition, we have uncovered an inhibitor of leukocyte chemotaxis, and propose a new therapeutic approach to treat diseases involving leukocyte migration and chemotactic factors."

https://openalex.org/W2010338274,"Mixing in fluids is a rapidly developing area in fluid mechanics, being an important industrial and environmental problem. The mixing of liquids at low Reynolds numbers is usually quite weak in simple flows, and it requires special devices to be efficient. Recently, the problem of mixing was solved analytically for a simple case of random flow, known as the Batchelor regime. Here we demonstrate experimentally that very viscous liquids containing a small amount of high-molecular-weight polymers can be mixed quite efficiently at very low Reynolds numbers, for a simple flow in a curved channel. A polymer concentration of only 0.001% suffices. The presence of the polymers leads to an elastic instability and to irregular flow, with velocity spectra corresponding to the Batchelor regime. Our detailed observations of the mixing in this regime enable us to confirm several important theoretical predictions: the probability distributions of the concentration exhibit exponential tails, moments of the distribution decay exponentially along the flow, and the spatial correlation function of concentration decays logarithmically."

To characterize this mechanism and its quantitative importance in biological systems, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and NO electrode studies were performed. The XO reducing substrates xanthine, NADH, and 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde triggered nitrite reduction to NO, and the molybdenum-binding XO inhibitor oxypurinol inhibited this NO formation, indicating that nitrite reduction occurs at the molybdenum site. However, at higher xanthine concentrations, partial inhibition was seen, suggesting the formation of a substrate-bound reduced enzyme complex with xanthine blocking the molybdenum site. Studies of the pH dependence of NO formation indicated that XO-mediated nitrite reduction occurred via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. Nitrite and reducing substrate concentrations were important regulators of XO-catalyzed NO generation. The substrate dependence of anaerobic XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, enabling prediction of the magnitude of NO formation and delineation of the quantitative importance of this process in biological systems. It was determined that under conditions occurring during no-flow ischemia, myocardial XO and nitrite levels are sufficient to generate NO levels comparable to those produced from nitric oxide synthase. Thus, XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction can be an important source of NO generation under ischemic conditions.

Nitric oxide is an important regulator of a variety of biological functions, and it also plays important roles in the pathogenesis of cellular injury. It has been generally accepted that NO is solely generated in biological tissues by specific nitric- oxide synthases (NOSs)1 that metabolize arginine to citrulline with the formation of NO. However, previous studies have also demonstrated that NOS-independent generation of NO from nitrite occurs in ischemic tissues, such as the heart, demonstrating that nitrite can be a source rather than a product of NO, particularly under acidic conditions (1Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 2Zweier J.L. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Biochim. Biophys.

Although it is clear that NO formation occurs secondary to nitrite reduction (3Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), questions remain regarding the source of the reducing equivalents required and the role of non-NOS enzymes in this process (1Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a ubiquitous enzyme in mammalian cells that plays important roles in both physiological and pathological conditions. It is involved in the catabolism of purine and pyrimidines, oxidizing hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. XO also reduces oxygen to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide and is one of the key enzymes responsible for superoxide-mediated cellular injury (4McCord J.M. Roy R.S. Schaffer S.W. Adv. Myocardiol. 1985; 5: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has a central role in the process of injury that occurs upon reoxygenation of hypoxic cells and tissues (5Allison R.C. Kyle J. Adkins W.K. Prasad V.R. McCord J.M. Taylor A.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 95: 597-603Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Zweier J.L. Broderick R. Kuppusamy P. Thompson-Gorman S. Lutty G.A. J. Biol.

XO contains critical flavin, iron sulfur, and molybdenum sites and has some structural similarity with microbial nitrite reductase (8Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.D. Benjamin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that XO catalyzes reduction of nitrite to NO under hypoxic conditions (8Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.D. Benjamin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7757-7763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), but a number of important questions have remained regarding the mechanism, substrate specificity, and magnitude of this process. XO exhibits broad specificity, accepting a variety of reducing substrates (11Xia M. Dempski R. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3323-3330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It was first reported that NADH, but not xanthine, can act as an electron donor to XO and catalyze nitrite reduction (8Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.D. Benjamin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Xanthine or hypoxanthine was found to inhibit this NO formation from XO (9Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, more recently, it was reported that xanthine can serve as a reducing substrate to stimulate nitrite reduction (10Godber L.J.B. Doel J.J. Sapkota P.G. Blake R.D. Stevens R.C. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7757-7763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, other investigators reported that XO in the presence of xanthine does not reduce nitrite to NO (12Trujillo M. Alvarez M.N. Peluffo G. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7828-7834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, in these studies there are major differences regarding the rates of NO formation and K m values of XO for nitrite or the requisite reducing substrate. Thus, questions remain regarding the substrate source required as well as the rate of this XO-catalyzed process of NO formation as a function of a given substrate concentration. Considering the important physiological roles of NO in blood pressure regulation, vascular tone, neural signaling, and immune function (13Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 14Garthwaite J. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 60-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar, 15Langrehr J.M.

Transplantation. 1993; 55: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and the functions of the derivatives of NO and superoxide in biological systems, it is important to determine the mechanism, magnitude, and role of XO-catalyzed NO generation. To characterize this XO-catalyzed pathway of NO production and its quantitative importance in biological systems, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and NO electrode studies were performed. The mechanism of NO formation was shown to occur due to nitrite reduction at the molybdenum site, with either NADH or xanthine serving as reducing substrates. The kinetic parameters for nitrite, NADH, and xanthine were determined, enabling prediction of the magnitude of NO formation and delineation of the quantitative importance of this process in biological systems. Xanthine oxidase from buttermilk (xanthine: oxygen oxidoreductase) (EC 1.1.3.22), xanthine, oxypurinol, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), sodium nitrite, β-NADH, and 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde were obtained from Sigma.N-Methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was synthesized using carbon disulfide andN-methyl-d-glucamine, as described (16Shinobu L.A. Jones S.G. Jones M.M. Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1984; 54: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Ferrous ammonium sulfate was purchased from Aldrich (99.997%). Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Life Technologies Inc. EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker-IBM ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band. Measurements were performed using a TM110 microwave cavity at ambient temperature with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 2.5 G, and microwave power of 20 mW. NO formation was measured by spin trapping using the ferrous iron complex of MGD, Fe-MGD. Solid ferrous ammonium sulfate and MGD (molar ratio, 1:5) were added to the deoxygenated (argon-purged) PBS buffer with a final concentration 2 mm in iron. Experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions achieved by argon purging in a glass-purging vessel followed by transfer under argon to a quartz flat cell that was then sealed. Quantitation of NO trapping was determined from the intensity of NO adduct signal recorded after mixing of Fe-MGD with aqueous solutions equilibrated with NO gas of known concentration (3Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The rate of the NO production was measured using a Sievers 270B nitric oxide analyzer interfaced through a DT2821 A to D board to PC. In the analyzer, NO is reacted with ozone forming excited-state NO2, which emits light. Mixing of reagents and separation of NO from the reaction mixture were done at a controlled temperature of 37 °C in a glass-purging vessel equipped with heating jacket. An ice-water cooling condenser was attached to the top of the vessel to reduce the outflow of vapors during purging. Additionally, an ice-cooled chemical trap filled with 1.0 m NaOH was placed between the purging vessel and NO analyzer. The release of NO was quantified by analysis of the digitally recorded signal from the photomultiplier tube using specially designed data acquisition and analysis software developed in our laboratory. Calibration of the magnitude of NO production was determined from the integral of the signal over time compared with that from nitrite concentration standards added to acetic acid containing 1% potassium iodide (3Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To enhance sensitivity for measurements of low levels of NO formation, a high quality, low noise photomultiplier tube was installed in the analyzer. Electrochemical measurements of NO generation by XO were carried out at 37 °C using a CHI 832 electrochemical detector with a Faraday cage (CH Instruments, Inc., Cordova, IN) and WPI NO electrode (Word Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The electrochemical detector continuously recorded the current through the working electrode, which is proportional to the NO concentration in the solution. The sensor was calibrated before and after experiments with known concentrations of NO, using NO gas-equilibrated solutions. The electrode was placed in a closed, water-jacketed glass electrochemical cell with ports for gas purging. All measurements were performed at 37 °C with prepurging of argon gas into the solution for 20 min before measurements, and then continuous flow of argon above the solution was maintained to assure anaerobic conditions throughout the measurements. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least three repeated measurements, and the statistical significance of difference was evaluated by Student's t test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance. Kinetic fits to the experimental data were performed on a PC using Table Curve 2D v4 (Jandel Scientific). NO is paramagnetic and binds with high affinity to the water-soluble spin trap Fe2+-MGD, forming a mononitrosyl iron complex with characteristic triplet spectrum at g = 2.04 with hyperfine splitting a N = 12.8. From the intensity of the observed spectrum, quantitative measurement of NO generation can be performed (17Xia Y. Cardounel A.J. Vanin A.F. Zweier J.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19Lancaster Jr., JR. Langrehr J.M. Begonia H.A. Murase N. Simmons R.L. Hoffman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10994-10998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This technique was applied to measure nitrite-mediated NO generation under anaerobic conditions. In the absence of nitrite, mixtures of XO (0.1 mg/ml) and its reducing substrate xanthine (20 μm) gave rise to no signal (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of XO but the presence of nitrite (1 mm), only a trace signal was seen (Fig. 1 B). Whereas xanthine (20 μm) and nitrite only gave rise to a trace signal (Fig. 1 C), upon addition of the XO reducing substrates NADH (1 mm), 2,3-dithydroxybenz-aldehyde (DBA) (200 μm), or xanthine (20 μm), a marked increase in the NO signal was seen (Fig. 1, D–F). Thus, all of the typical types of XO reducing substrates, including NADH, 2,3-dithydroxybenz-aldehyde, and xanthine, acted as electron donors for XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction and triggered large amounts of NO generation under anaerobic conditions. To further confirm the existence of the XO-catalyzed mechanism of NO generation in the absence of any possible effects or perturbation by the spin trap, studies were performed measuring NO generation using a specific electrochemical NO sensor. Prior to the addition of XO, no detectable NO generation was seen from nitrite (1 mm) in the presence of xanthine (10 μm) or NADH (1 mm). However, after addition of XO (0.015 mg/ml), prominent NO generation was triggered from xanthine or NADH (Fig.2, traces A and B). The magnitude and rate of NO generation in the presence of xanthine (Fig. 2, trace A) was considerably higher than that with NADH (Fig. 2, trace B), whereas with xanthine and nitrite in the absence of XO, no NO generation was observed (Fig. 2,trace C). Of note, the substrate DBA also stimulated NO generation from nitrite in the presence of XO, with magnitude and rate approaching that seen from xanthine (data not shown). Thus, both EPR spin trapping and NO electrode studies demonstrate that XO can generate NO production in the presence of substrates that reduce the enzyme. To confirm that XO-mediated NO generation occurs and to directly measure the rate of this NO generation, further studies were performed using a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. Mixing of reagents was performed at 37 °C in the glass-purging vessel. NO was purged from the solution with argon gas and then reacted with ozone in the analyzer to form excited-state NO2, which emits light. This method provides direct measurement of the rate of NO generation as a function of time (3Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). With nitrite (1 mm) alone or nitrite in the presence of xanthine (5 μm) or NADH (1 mm), no measurable rate of NO formation was observed (Fig.3, trace C). However, with the addition of XO (0.02 mg/ml) in the presence of xanthine or NADH, prominent NO generation was triggered (Fig. 3, traces A andB). Additional control experiments performed with XO in the presence of xanthine or NADH but in the absence of nitrite confirmed that nitrite was required for NO generation. Again, a higher rate of XO-mediated NO generation was seen with xanthine than with NADH. As was seen with the electrode measurements, the substrate DBA (40 μm) also stimulated NO generation from nitrite in the presence of XO with a rate approaching that seen with xanthine (data not shown). The rate of NO formation derived from XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction was measured under anaerobic conditions using the NO analyzer. The concentration dependence of each reducing substrate was first determined in the presence of a fixed nitrite concentration of 1 mm. Each of the typical reducing substrates, xanthine, DBA, and NADH, acted as electron donors to support XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction, and each of these reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.4, A–C). For each reducing substrate, the apparent values of K m ,K cat, and V max were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the values for each reducing substrate are shown inside each curve. For each of these reducing substrates, the rate of XO-mediated NO formation was also determined as a function of nitrite concentration (Fig. 4,D–F). Again, typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed as a function of nitrite concentration, and the apparentK m , K cat, andV max values are shown inside each curve. From these kinetic data, it is possible to predict the magnitude of XO-catalyzed NO formation as a function of nitrite and reducing substrate concentration and to determine the quantitative importance of this mechanism of NO generation in a given biological system where these substrate levels are known. The effects of site-specific inhibitors of XO were studied to investigate the reaction sites involved in the process of the XO-catalyzed nitrite reaction observed with different reducing substrates. Oxypurinol binds to the molybdenum site of XO. It was observed that oxypurinol inhibited XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction regardless of the type of reducing substrate present. Near total inhibition of NO generation was seen in the presence of either xanthine or NADH (Fig. 5). Because oxypurinol inhibits substrates binding at the molybdenum site of the enzyme, this suggests that nitrite binds to the reduced molybdenum site. DPI, which acts at the FAD site, inhibited XO-dependent nitrite reduction only when NADH was used as the reducing substrate, and it did not inhibit NO generation when xanthine was used (Fig. 5). This suggests that NADH donates electrons to FAD, and then electrons are transported back to reduce the molybdenum that in turn reduces nitrite to NO. When xanthine or aldehydes are the electron donors, both XO reduction (by xanthine or aldehydes) and oxidation (by nitrite) takes place at the molybdenum site, so that only oxypurinol could inhibit XO-dependent NO formation. It has been reported that excess xanthine (>100 μm) can exert inhibition of XO catalytic function due to binding of xanthine to reduced forms of the enzyme generated in the process of XO-catalyzed oxygen reduction. This kind of substrate-bound reduced XO complex inhibits intramolecular electron transport from the molybdenum center to FAD (20Hille R. Stewart R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1570-1576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rubbo H. Radi R. Prodanov E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In view of the questions regarding the role and potency of xanthine as a reducing substrate for the process of XO-mediated NO formation, NO analyzer and EPR spin trapping studies were performed to detect XO-catalyzed NO generation under anaerobic conditions in the presence of high concentrations of xanthine (10–100 μm). Although XO-catalyzed NO generation followed classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics with low concentrations of xanthine (<20 μm, Fig. 4 B), higher concentrations of xanthine showed significant concentration-dependent inhibition of NO formation (Fig. 6). From fitting of the data in Fig. 6 A, K i was calculated to be 55 μm. These results suggest that a xanthine-reduced XO complex is formed and inhibits the maximum rate of NO generation from XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction. It is likely that excessive xanthine inhibits XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction by binding to reduced forms of the enzyme, in turn blocking the binding of nitrite to the molybdenum site. To determine the magnitude of NO generation that can occur in biological tissues that typically contain low nitrite concentrations, measurements of XO-derived NO generation were performed in the presence of 5–40 μm nitrite, the range of concentrations observed in myocardial tissue (1Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 2Zweier J.L. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A process of xanthine-stimulated NO generation was seen that was similar to that observed with higher nitrite levels (Fig.7). Maximum rates of NO generation of 18, 31, 56, and 135 pmol/s/mg were observed for 5, 10, 20, and 40 μm nitrite, respectively, at xanthine concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μm. With further increase in xanthine levels, progressive inhibition was seen, as was observed with 1 mm nitrite (Fig. 6). Under ischemic conditions, marked intracellular acidosis occurs, and pH values in tissues, such as the heart, can fall to levels of 6.0 or below (2Zweier J.L. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In order to assess the NO formation under different physiological or pathological conditions and to further characterize the mechanism of XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction, experiments were performed to measure the effect of different pH values on the magnitude of NO generation. Measurements were performed with 0.02 mg/ml of XO in the presence of 1 mm nitrite. As shown in TableI, it was observed for each of the three substrates xanthine, NADH, and DBA that under acidic conditions increased XO-catalyzed NO generation occurs. In contrast, under alkaline conditions, prominent inhibition was seen.Table IEffect of pH on NO generation rateNO generation ratepH 6.0pH 7.4pH 8.0nmol · mg−1 · s−1Xanthine (10 μm)2.15 ± 0.101.87 ± 0.090.34 ± 0.03NADH (1 mm)0.7 ± 0.050.3 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.01DBA (0.1 mm)1.96 ± 0.100.76 ± 0.050.45 ± 0.04Measurements were performed with 0.02 mg/ml XO in the presence of 1 mm nitrite.

In view of the critical role of NO in normal physiology and disease, it is of crucial importance to understand the biochemical mechanisms of NO formation that occur in biological cells and tissues. In addition to the formation of NO from specific NOS enzymes, it is clear that nitrite derived from either NO metabolism or dietary sources can be an important source of NO formation, particularly under conditions of limited tissue perfusion and resulting acidosis. Although NO can be formed by the simple process of nitrite disproportionation that is accelerated under acidic conditions, it has been previously observed that in ischemic tissues, nitrite is also reduced to form NO. Questions have remained regarding the role of non-NOS enzymes in this process of nitrite reduction (2Zweier J.L. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although it has recently been reported that XO can reduce nitrite to NO, questions remain regarding the biological importance of this pathway of NO production, as well as the mechanism, magnitude, and substrate specificity of this process. It was first reported that NADH, but not xanthine, can act as an electron donor to XO and catalyze nitrite reduction (8Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.D. Benjamin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 9Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Xanthine or hypoxanthine was found to inhibit this NO formation from XO (9Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, more recently, it was reported that xanthine can serve as a reducing substrate to stimulate nitrite reduction (10Godber L.J.B. Doel J.J. Sapkota P.G. Blake R.D. Stevens R.C. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7757-7763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, other investigators reported that XO in the presence of xanthine does not reduce nitrite to NO (12Trujillo M. Alvarez M.N. Peluffo G. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7828-7834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, in these studies, there were large differences regarding the rates of NO formation and K m values of XO for nitrite or the requisite reducing substrate. In view of these uncertainties, it has not been possible to ascertain the biological relevance and importance of this pathway of NO generation. Therefore, we performed a series of studies using EPR, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and NO electrode techniques to measure the magnitude and kinetics of NO formation that arises due to XO-mediated nitrite reduction. Data obtained using each of these three methods confirmed that XO does reduce nitrite to NO under anaerobic conditions. It was observed that each of the typical reducing substrates xanthine, DBA, and NADH could act as electron donors to support this XO-mediated nitrite reduction (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The results of these studies, along with the inhibition seen with oxypurinol, suggested that reduced XO was the direct electron donor to nitrite, with nitrite binding and reduction occurring at the molybdenum site. Whereas NADH-stimulated NO generation was inhibited by the flavin modifier DPI, NO generation stimulated by xanthine or DBA was unaffected. Thus, whereas xanthine or DBA directly reduces the molybdenum center, NADH initially reduces the flavin, which subsequently transfers electrons to the molybdenum. From past studies, questions remain regarding the K m and V max values observed for XO-mediated NO generation under anaerobic conditions as a function of nitrite and reducing substrate concentration. Initial studies reported a K m of 22.9 mm for nitrite reduction in the presence of NADH (9Millar T.M. Stevens C.R. Benjamin N. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. Blake D.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, a subsequent study reported aK m value of 2.4 mm (8Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.D. Benjamin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A more recent study measuring NADH depletion rather than NO generation reported aK m of 16 mm (10Godber L.J.B. Doel J.J. Sapkota P.G. Blake R.D. Stevens R.C. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7757-7763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In our studies, we observed that the K m for nitrite was consistently about 2.3 mm in the presence of 1.0 mm NADH. This observation agrees closely with the report of Zhang et al. (8Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.D. Benjamin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In contrast with the first two studies that report only enzyme reduction by NADH and the recent study reporting aK m of 36 mm for nitrite in the presence of xanthine, we observed that the K m for nitrite is 2.4 ± 0.2 mm for each of the three types of substr"

Fabricated from the ubiquitous thiol tripeptide GSH and related thiols in a novel transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by PC synthases (γ-glutamylcysteinyltransferase; EC 2.3.2.15), PCs have the general structure (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Xaa, contain 2–11 γ-Glu-Cys repeats, chelate heavy metals at high affinity, and facilitate the vacuolar sequestration of heavy metals, most notably Cd2+ (1Grill E.

Although it is more than a decade since the first report of the partial purification of a heavy metal-, primarily Cd2+-activated PC synthase from plant extracts (1Grill E. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Science. 1985; 230: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), it is only recently that the small family of genes encoding these enzymes has been identified in plants and the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (4Clemens S.

A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). As exemplified by the clone from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPCS1), these genes encode 45–55-kDa proteins that are sufficient for heavy metal-activated PC synthesis from GSH both in vivo andin vitro (6Vatamaniuk O.K. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 7Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). An unexpected outcome of the cloning of AtPCS1 and its equivalents from other plants and S. pombe was the identification of a single-copy gene homolog (accession numberZ66513) in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (4Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 5Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B.

A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Designated ce-pcs-1, this gene encodes a hypothetical 40.8-kDa protein (CePCS1) bearing 32% identity (45% similarity) to AtPCS1 in an overlap of 367 amino acid residues (6Vatamaniuk O.K. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Disclosure of aPCS1 homolog in the genome of C. elegans was surprising in that it raised for the first time the possibility that not only GSH and metallothioneins (8Klaassen C.D. Liu J. Choudhuri S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 267-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) but also PCs might participate in metal homeostasis in at least some animals. In the report that follows we demonstrate unequivocally thatce-pcs-1 encodes a bona fide PC synthase whose activity is necessary for the detoxification of heavy metals in the intact organism. Discovery of the PC synthase-dependent pathway in the model organism C. elegans establishes a firm basis for determining the ubiquity of this pathway in other animals and for elucidation of the identity and organization of the cellular machinery likely involved in the eventual elimination, sequestration, and/or metabolism of heavy metal·PC complexes in animals. ce-pcs-1 was isolated from C. elegans N2 total RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the resulting cDNA (accession numbersAF299332 and AF299333) was subcloned into yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pYES3 (10Lu Y.-P. Li Z.-S. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8243-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to place ce-pcs-1 under control of the constitutive yeast PGK gene promoter. For immunodetection of the translation product, vector pYES3-CePCS1::FLAG, containing the ce-pcs-1 insert engineered to code CePCS1 C-terminally fused with a FLAG (DYDDDDK) epitope tag, was constructed. Both constructs or empty vector pYES3 were used to transform (11Giest R.D. Schiestl R.H.

The pYES3-CePCS1, pYES3-CePCS1::FLAG, and empty vector transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy by plating on AHC medium supplemented with glucose (2% w/v) and tryptophan (50 μg/ml). pYES3-AtPCS1::FLAG-transformed DTY167 cells were generated as described (6Vatamaniuk O.K. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). For investigations of their PC content and PC synthase activities, aliquots of stationary phase cultures of CePCS1::FLAG-, AtPCS1::FLAG-, or empty vector-transformed DTY167 cells were inoculated into 40-ml volumes of AHC medium with or without added CdCl2 (25 μm), grown for 16–18 h at 30 °C to an A 600 nm of 0.8–1.0, and harvested by centrifugation. After resuspension and disruption of the cells by the glass bead method (14Parish R.W. Arch. Microbiol. 1975; 105: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in homogenization buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, the homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and assayed immediately for PCs and PC synthase activity. The cellular PC content and PC synthase activities of the cell-free extracts from yeast CePCS1::FLAG-, AtPCS1::FLAG-, and empty vector-transformants were estimated as described (7Vatamaniuk O.K.

Individual PC fractions were identified by estimating their Glu/Gly ratios (ratio = n = number of Glu-Cys repeats per Gly) after acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis of the appropriate HPLC fractions and/or on the basis of their comigration with PC standards synthesized in vitro by purified AtPCS1-FLAG (7Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Protein samples were prepared for and subjected to SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis against anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) as described (6Vatamaniuk O.K. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). For in vitro ce-pcs-1 RNA synthesis, the cDNA insert of pYES3-CePCS1 was subcloned into pBluescript, and RNA was transcribed from the T3 and T7 promoters using an in vitro RNA transcription kit (Stratagene). After DNase digestion of the template, the sense and antisense preparations were gel-purified, mixed in an equimolar ratio in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, heated for 1 min in boiling water, and annealed at room temperature (15Svoboda P. Stein P. Hayashi H. Schultz R.M. Development. 2000; 127: 4147-4156PubMed Google Scholar). The single electrophoretic species corresponding in size to that expected of dsce-pcs-1 RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, dissolved in water, diluted to a concentration of 500 ng/μl with injection buffer (16Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), and stored at −80 °C. Thece-pcs-1 RNA interference experiments were performed on wild type (N2) worms. The body cavities of adult hermaphrodites were injected as described (16Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Injected worms were cultured for 12–18 h on standard nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded withE. coli OP50 before transfer onto plates supplemented with CdCl2. Two treatment regimes were used to examine the effects of Cd2+. In the first regime, individual worms were transferred sequentially onto NGM plates supplemented with 0, 25, 50, and 100 μm CdCl2. After transfer onto each Cd2+ concentration, egg laying was allowed to proceed for 6 h, after which time the worms were transferred to the next higher Cd2+ concentration for another round of egg laying. In this way, it was determined that 25 μmCdCl2 was sufficient to cause severe morphological and developmental changes in the CePCS1-deficient worms but not the controls. In the second regime, individual injected worms were transferred to NGM plates supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 μm CdCl2 and allowed to lay eggs for 6 h, after which time they were transferred for another 6 h onto plates containing 25 μm CdCl2. Only the progeny of worms that exhibited the CePCS1-deficient phenotype upon transfer to plates containing 25 μm Cd2+(65–75% of the progeny of the total worms injected) were scored at the other concentrations. Control worms were treated in an identical manner except that they were injected with injection buffer alone. The phenotypes of the worms were examined 4–6 days after hatching. Features scored included gross morphology, developmental stage, and fertility. The specificity of the effects exerted by the injection of dsce-pcs-1 RNA and the efficacy of the injection protocol employed were assessed by the injection of wild type N2 worms and strain EE86 worms (genotypeupIs1(mup-4::gfp(CeMup-4.99.1617);rol-6(pRF4))) with dsgfp RNA by the same procedure. In both cases the worms were screened for Cd2+ tolerance; in the latter case the worms were also screened for diminished hypodermal cell MUP-4::GFP expression (17Hong, L., Elbl, T., Ward, J. T., Franzini-Armstrong, C., Rybicka, K. K., Gatewood, B. K., Baillie, D. L., and Bucher, E. A. (2001) J. Cell Biol., in press.Google Scholar). GFP levels were assessed under a Leica stereomicroscope equipped with UV illumination. The functional equivalence of CePCS1 with its plant and S. pombe homologs was determined by heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, which otherwise lacks PC synthase (4Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 5Ha S.B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S.

A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). For this purpose and to render its translation product immunodetectable,ce-pcs-1::FLAG fusions were cloned into expression vector pYES3, and these (pYES3-CePCS1::FLAG), the untagged construct (pYES3-CePCS1), and empty vector were transformed into Cd2+-hypersensitive S. cerevisiae strain DTY167 (see “Materials and Methods”). The involvement of CePCS1 in heavy metal tolerance was examined at three levels, by determining its capacity for alleviating Cd2+ hypersensitivity, by defining its facility for promoting the Cd2+-dependent intracellular accumulation of PCs, and by determining its ability for de novo Cd2+-activated synthesis of PCs from GSH in vitro. Regardless of the level at which it was examined, CePCS1 had the properties expected of a PC synthase. Plasmid-bornece-pcs-1::FLAG suppressed the Cd2+-hypersensitivity of yeast strain DTY167, as did untagged ce-pcs1, at efficacies comparable with those ofAtPCS1::FLAG (and AtPCS1; data not shown). CePCS1::FLAG and CePCS1 increased the concentration of CdCl2 in the growth medium required for 50% inhibition of growth by 12.0- and 12.4-fold and 1.5- and 1.4-foldversus empty vector-transformed controls or AtPCS1::FLAG-transformed cells (Fig. 1). As shown previously for AtPCS1 (6Vatamaniuk O.K. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), the tolerance conferred by CePCS1::FLAG (and CePCS1) was not restricted to Cd2+ but extended to other soft metals and metalloids, including mercury (as HgCl2) and arsenic (as AsO43− or AsO2−) (data not shown). Whenever enhanced Cd2+ tolerance was observed, it was associated with Cd2+-dependent intracellular PC accumulation. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of nonprotein thiols in the soluble fraction from ce-pcs-1-transformed DTY167 cells after growth in media containing CdCl2 revealed prominent peaks eluting after the GSH/2-mercaptoethanol injection peak whose chromatographic properties were indistinguishable from those of PCs (PC2, PC3, PC4, and PC5) synthesized in vitro by purified AtPCS1::FLAG (7Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). The aggregate thiol content of these nonprotein thiol peptides was 178 nmol/mg soluble protein. The corresponding fractions from CdCl2-grown empty vector control cells and from ce-pcs-1-transformed cells after growth in medium lacking Cd2+ were devoid of PC-like nonprotein thiols (Fig. 2 A), indicating that both CePCS1 and exposure to heavy metal were essential prerequisites for net PC synthesis in vivo. The CePCS1- and Cd2+-dependent synthesis of PCs measured in vivo was precisely replicated in vitro. Analyses of the capacity of CePCS1::FLAG yeast cell-free extracts for the Cd2+-dependent incorporation of GSH into PCs demonstrated net synthesis of PC2 and PC3 at an aggregate rate of 28.5 ± 4.3 nmol/mg/min (Fig. 2 B). No peaks other than those corresponding to GSH were detected when the same extracts were incubated in the media lacking CdCl2. The corresponding fraction from DTY167 cells transformed withAtPCS1::FLAG catalyzed PC2 and PC3 synthesis at an aggregate rate of 107.0 ± 36.0 nmol/mg/min (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, net PC synthesis by the cell-free extracts from vector controls was undetectable (<0.01 nmol/mg/min) (data not shown). Because approximate proportionality between net PC synthetic activity in vitro and the amount of recoverable fusion protein in the extracts was demonstrable immunologically (Fig. 2, inset), CePCS1::FLAG and AtPCS1::FLAG were inferred to have similar intrinsic catalytic capacities. The discovery of ce-pcs-1 in C. elegans and the demonstrated facility of its translation product for Cd2+-dependent PC synthesis was completely unexpected. PCs had never before been considered to be involved in metal homeostasis in animals (8Klaassen C.D. Liu J. Choudhuri S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 267-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Hence, to determine whether PC synthase-mediated PC synthesis might indeed contribute to metal detoxification in C. elegans, the in vivofunction of ce-pcs-1 was examined at the level of the whole organism. Toward this end, the double-stranded RNA interference technique (18Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C. Nature. 1998; 391: 706-811Crossref Scopus (11739) Google Scholar) was employed. This technique for the targeted suppression of specific genes was thought to be particularly applicable to the study of ce-pcs-1, a single-copy gene. Wild type (N2) or a GFP-expressing line (EE86) of C. elegans were injected with injection buffer alone, injection buffer containing dsgfp RNA, or with injection buffer containing dsce-pcs-1 RNA and cultured on standard NGM or on NGM containing different concentrations of CdCl2. 4 days later, the progeny of these worms were scored for gross morphology, development, and fertility. The progeny of control worms injected with either injection buffer or dsgfp RNA were indistinguishable from wild type (see Fig.3 and Fig.4 A), although all of the progeny of the dsgfp RNA-injected GS86 worms exhibited markedly diminished or no GFP expression as determined by fluorescence microscopy. At low (5, 10, and 25 μm) concentrations of Cd2+, the wild type control progeny developed into normal-sized, gravid adults, comparable with those grown in the media devoid of heavy metal (see Fig. 3 and Fig 4 B). At higher concentrations (50 and 100 μm), the controls grew more slowly but nevertheless reached adulthood and laid eggs after about 6 days (data not shown). In contrast, marked differences were evident in the progeny of worms injected with dsce-pcs-1 RNA, even at the lowest concentrations of Cd2+. When raised on 5 and 10 μm Cd2+, the CePCS1-deficient animals reached adulthood (Fig. 3); however, at 5 μm most individuals retained their eggs and at 10 μm showed severe necrosis (Fig. 4 B), producing fewer eggs. A fraction (21%) of the worms reached adulthood at 25 μm CdCl2 (Fig.3), but they were small, necrotic, and sterile and eventually died. At 50 and 100 μm Cd2+, CePCS1-deficient worms arrested at the L2-L4 larval stage, were extensively necrotic and had died by day 6 (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 C). The differential effects seen were conditional on exposure to Cd2+, because CePCS1-deficient worms were identical to wild type when grown on standard NGM plates (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 A). As would be expected if the effects of Cd2+ on the CePCS1-deficient worms were irreversible, transfer of arrested larvae to standard NGM plates did not restore growth (data not shown).Figure 4Morphology of control worms (Control) and CePCS1-deficient worms (CePCS1) after growth on NGM plates containing (A) 0 μmCdCl2, (B) 10 μm CdCl2, or (C) 50 μmCdCl2. 5-day-old worms were immobilized in buffer containing 5 mm sodium azide and photographed within 5 min.

Moreover, although other gene products have been inferred to contribute to Cd2+ tolerance in C. elegans, CePCS1 is the first for which a firm biochemical basis has been established for the effects seen at the whole organism level. Elegant studies of C. elegans mutants for a multidrug resistance-associated protein subclass ATP binding cassette transporter gene (19Broeks A. Gerrard B. Allikmets R. Dean M. Plasterk R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6132-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and for a mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK1) gene (20Koga M. Zwaal R. Guan K.-L. Avery L. Ohshima Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5148-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have revealed an increase in sensitivity to Cd2+ versus wild type, but the effects seen were less acute and/or less specific than those reported here for CePCS1-deficient worms and in neither case could be attributed to a specific biochemical process or event."
https://openalex.org/W1993320180,"Visual abilities change over the visual field. For example, our ability to detect movement is better in peripheral vision than in foveal vision, but colour discrimination is markedly worse. The deterioration of colour vision has been attributed to reduced colour specificity in cells of the midget, parvocellular (PC) visual pathway in the peripheral retina. We have measured the colour specificity (red-green chromatic modulation sensitivity) of PC cells at eccentricities between 20 and 50 degrees in the macaque retina. Here we show that most peripheral PC cells have red-green modulation sensitivity close to that of foveal PC cells. This result is incompatible with the view that PC pathway cells in peripheral retina make indiscriminate connections ('random wiring') with retinal circuits devoted to different spectral types of cone photoreceptors. We show that selective cone connections can be maintained by dendritic field anisotropy, consistent with the morphology of PC cell dendritic fields in peripheral retina. Our results also imply that postretinal mechanisms contribute to the psychophysically demonstrated deterioration of colour discrimination in the peripheral visual field."

Newly synthesized E-cadherin is targeted to the basolateral cell surface. We analyzed targeting information in the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin by utilizing chimeras of E-cadherin fused to the ectodomain of the interleukin-2α (IL-2α) receptor expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney and LLC-PK1epithelial cells. Chimeras containing the full-length or membrane-proximal half of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail were correctly targeted to the basolateral domain. Sequence analysis of the membrane-proximal tail region revealed the presence of a highly conserved dileucine motif, which was analyzed as a putative targeting signal by mutagenesis. Elimination of this motif resulted in the loss of Tac/E-cadherin basolateral localization, pinpointing this dileucine signal as being both necessary and sufficient for basolateral targeting of E-cadherin. Truncation mutants unable to bind β-catenin were correctly targeted, showing, contrary to current understanding, that β-catenin is not required for basolateral trafficking. Our results also provide evidence that dileucine-mediated targeting is maintained in LLC-PK1 cells despite the altered polarity of basolateral proteins with tyrosine-based signals in this cell line. These results provide the first direct insights into how E-cadherin is targeted to the basolateral membrane.

We analyzed targeting information in the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin by utilizing chimeras of E-cadherin fused to the ectodomain of the interleukin-2α (IL-2α) receptor expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney and LLC-PK1epithelial cells. Chimeras containing the full-length or membrane-proximal half of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail were correctly targeted to the basolateral domain. Sequence analysis of the membrane-proximal tail region revealed the presence of a highly conserved dileucine motif, which was analyzed as a putative targeting signal by mutagenesis. Elimination of this motif resulted in the loss of Tac/E-cadherin basolateral localization, pinpointing this dileucine signal as being both necessary and sufficient for basolateral targeting of E-cadherin. Truncation mutants unable to bind β-catenin were correctly targeted, showing, contrary to current understanding, that β-catenin is not required for basolateral trafficking. Our results also provide evidence that dileucine-mediated targeting is maintained in LLC-PK1 cells despite the altered polarity of basolateral proteins with tyrosine-based signals in this cell line. These results provide the first direct insights into how E-cadherin is targeted to the basolateral membrane.

The cadherins in adherens junctions have central roles in establishing and maintaining cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity in epithelia and participate in morphogenesis during development (1Takeichi M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The continual expression and function of E-cadherin is important in its role as a tumor suppressor and the loss of E-cadherin function contributes to tumor invasion and progression in carcinomas (5Yap A.S. Cancer Invest. 1998; 16: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Mature, human E-cadherin is a 728-amino acid, single pass transmembrane protein (6Rimm D.L. Morrow J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1754-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The E-cadherin ectodomain is involved in Ca2+-dependent homotypic binding to E-cadherins on adjacent cell membranes, and its cytoplasmic tail is involved in a series of protein interactions providing a link to the actin cytoskeleton. The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin is bound directly to β-catenin or plakoglobin, and thereby to α-catenin and actin (reviewed in Ref. 2Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The binding site for β-catenin has been mapped by deletion mutagenesis to the distal 76 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of E-cadherin (7Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), with critical residues found in the last 30 amino acid domain (8Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Aside from its participation as a member of the cadherin-bound adherens junction complex, β-catenin is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway through its interactions with a cytoplasmic adenomatous polyposis coli complex and with the Lef/Tcf transcription factors in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 9Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Epithelial cells are morphologically and functionally polarized with distinct complements of cell surface proteins and lipids at the apical or basolateral poles. Maintenance of this polarity requires that newly synthesized proteins are sorted and targeted to specific membrane domains (10Brown D. Stow J.L. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 245-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Sorting of proteins to the apical domain of polarized cells occurs via lipid raft interactions or through oligosaccharides (13Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar, 14Benting J.H. Rietveld A.G. Simons K. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas specific amino acids motifs act as sorting signals to target membrane proteins to the basolateral cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 16Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, tyrosine-based motifs target the low density lipoprotein receptor to the basolateral domain of polarized cells (17Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereas a dileucine motif is utilized by other proteins, like the Fc receptor (18Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Both types of signals can also be used to direct endocytosis from the plasma membrane, although the structural requirements for each pathway may differ (19Lin S. Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26300-26305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Yet other amino acid motifs can be used by selected proteins for basolateral targeting (23Le Gall A.H. Powell S.K.

Previous studies on adhesion molecules have defined a dileucine signal that functions in the basolateral targeting of the Lutheran glycoprotein (26El Nemer W. Colin Y. Bauvy C. Codogno P. Fraser R.H. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31903-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and a similar dihydrophobic signal in CD44 (27Sheikh H. Isacke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12185-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The basolateral targeting of neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) has been attributed to a cytoplasmic tail sequence without classic motif homology (23Le Gall A.H. Powell S.K. Yeaman G.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4559-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Detailed information and further insights are needed into how other classes of adhesion proteins, including cadherins, are sorted and trafficked in polarized cells.Recently, the polarized epithelial cells of the pig kidney LLC-PK1 line have been distinguished as having aspects of inverted polarity. Roush et al. (28Roush D.L. Gottardi C.J. Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) noted that some typically basolateral proteins, such as the H,K-ATPase β subunit, are delivered to the apical pole of LLC-PK1 cells. Mis-sorting of basolateral proteins in LLC-PK1 cells led to subsequent analysis of their AP-1 adaptor complexes. Most polarized epithelial cells express a special μ1B subunit, which directs polarized sorting to the basolateral surface (29Ohno H. Tomemori T. Nakatsu F. Okazaki Y. Aguilar R.C. Foelsch H. Mellman I. Saito T. Shirasawa T. Bonifacino J.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It has now been shown that LLC-PK1 cells express a μ1A subunit but not the μ1B subunit and that this results in aberrant sorting of proteins with tyrosine-based signals, a defect that can be overcome by expression of recombinant μ1B protein (30Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Cadherin staining in LLC-PK1 cells appears to be basolateral (31Lechner J. Krall M. Netzer A. Radmayr C. Ryan M.P. Pfaller W. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2178-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although the trafficking of these proteins in this cell line has not been studied in detail.The correct placement of E-cadherin on the plasma membrane is required from an early stage to help establish and maintain cell polarity (32Tanentzapf G. Smith C. McGlade J. Tepass U. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that mediate the sorting and polarized delivery of E-cadherin to the surface have not been elucidated. Previous studies have shown that β-catenin binds to E-cadherin early in the biosynthetic pathway, implying that the two proteins, and perhaps others, are transported to the cell surface together as a complex (33Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). More recently, it was suggested that β-catenin plays an essential role in the trafficking of E-cadherin, based on observations that mutagenized proteins, with reduced binding to β-catenin, were not efficiently delivered to the surface (34Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It has also been previously noted that the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin does contain motifs with homology to known targeting signals (34Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 35Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), which could potentially function to guide its trafficking. In this study we set out to test putative signals in the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin for possible basolateral targeting information. Our experiments also addressed the role of β-catenin in this targeting. We utilized a series of chimeras to express the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail, or mutagenized versions thereof, using Tac (the α subunit of the IL-2 receptor) as an ectodomain marker. Tac is a 273-amino acid protein that has previously been used as a reporter protein for trafficking studies (36Rajasekaran A.K. Humphrey J.S. Wagner M. Miesenbock G. Le Bivic A. Bonifacino J.S. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 37Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These constructs were expressed in MDCK1 cells, in which the basolateral surface expression of E-cadherin is well established, and in another epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 cells. Using these model systems we have identified a positive targeting signal in E-cadherin that is responsible for basolateral delivery. Our results provide new insights into the trafficking of E-cadherin and its accessory proteins (catenins), and the findings are also significant to our understanding of cell polarity and sorting pathways in epithelia.DISCUSSIONE-cadherin is one of the proto-typical polarized membrane proteins in epithelia. It is delivered to the basolateral membrane and is concentrated in adherens junctions where it participates in cell-cell adhesion. To address how E-cadherin is trafficked and targeted in polarized cells, we made use of Tac/E-cadherin chimeras expressed in two epithelial cell lines. Our findings show that chimeras containing full-length or truncated cytoplasmic tails of E-cadherin were effectively sorted and trafficked to the basolateral surface domain in MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells. Furthermore, this polarized targeting was lost after deletion of a single, dominant targeting motif in the proximal region of the tail. Three main conclusions emerged from these experiments; (i) that a single dileucine motif at 587 is able to convey basolateral targeting information in Tac/E-cadherin chimeras and that this signal is necessary for basolateral sorting; (ii) that LLC-PK1 cells are able to correctly sort and traffic E-cadherin using a dileucine-based mechanism, in contrast to proteins sorted by tyrosine-based signals that are mis-trafficked in these cells, and (iii) that β-catenin is not required for basolateral targeting and surface delivery of E-cadherin.Chimeras containing the full cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin, Tac/Ecad-(578–728) and Tac/Ecad-(554–728), were efficiently targeted and trafficked to the basolateral domain of MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells in a similar manner to that of endogenous E-cadherin or GFP-E-cadherin in either cell line. The Tac ectodomain did not interfere with the intracellular trafficking or processing in the full-length tail constructs, because there was no evidence of less efficient membrane delivery or retention within the secretory pathway. The transmembrane domain has been implicated in mediating lateral association and adhesive strength of cadherins in the plasma membrane, without affecting surface delivery (43Huber O. Kemler R. Langosch D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4415-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences within transmembrane segments can, however, be involved in targeting as exemplified by the apical targeting signal in one of the transmembrane segments of the α-subunit of the gastric parietal H,K-ATPase (44Dunbar L.A. Aronson P. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our experiments directly tested the E-cadherin transmembrane domain, with the finding that this region of the protein has no role in basolateral targeting nor in sorting or membrane delivery of Tac/E-cadherin chimeras. Overall the results obtained with the Tac/E-cadherin chimeras point to the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin as having positive basolateral sorting information, in keeping with many other type I membrane proteins.The correct basolateral targeting of the Tac/Ecad-(578–653) construct first indicated that the membrane-proximal tail region alone is sufficient for membrane targeting and that distal regions of the tail are not required for targeting or surface delivery. In our hands, mutants with the truncated tail of E-cadherin, Tac/Ecad-(578–653), were processed, targeted, and delivered to the basolateral cell surface, albeit at a slower rate than constructs with the full cytoplasmic tail. Transient accumulation of Tac/Ecad-(578–653) in the biosynthetic pathway, seen as intracellular staining in LLC-PK1 cells, indicated that it was trafficked less efficiently than the full-length tail. Partial accumulation of Tac/Ecad-(578–653) was similarly noted in MDCK cells, although the truncated tail mutants did eventually reach the cell surface. Our findings are in contrast to those of a previous study in which a series of chimeras representing truncation mutants of the E-cadherin tail fused to a GP-2 ectodomain, were found to be very poorly trafficked (34Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Only about 10% of the truncated GP-2 chimeric proteins in that study reached the surface of MDCK cells and were randomly sorted, whereas the majority of the proteins were blocked or degraded early in the secretory pathway (34Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). On the basis of the correct targeting and delivery of Tac/Ecad-(578–653), which contains similar tail regions to some of the mutants in the previous study, we hypothesize that the poor processing and trafficking of those chimeras may have been due to the influence of the GP-2 ectodomain rather than being a function of E-cadherin trafficking or accessory proteins (see below).The membrane-proximal tail region of E-cadherin has been implicated in a number of functions. Cadherin clustering and adhesive strength were shown to be affected by mutations in the membrane-proximal region of the C-cadherin tail (45Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Binding of the p120ctn protein has also been shown to occur in this region (45Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 46Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and some of the amino acid sequences mapped by two-hybrid analysis, as being specifically involved in the binding of p120ctn (47Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadisa P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), overlap with the dileucine targeting signal identified in this study. It is therefore likely that this membrane-proximal region of the tail is involved in multiple, temporally regulated protein interactions that are important, initially for E-cadherin transport, and then for adhesive function at the cell surface. Positive sorting mediated by the Tac/Ecad-(578–653) membrane-proximal tail allowed us to focus on putative sorting signals in this region. The dileucine motif at 587 was chosen here as a candidate targeting signal. Despite being in the non-conserved region of the tail, sequence alignments revealed that the dileucine consensus motif is highly conserved throughout cadherins of type I or II cadherin families (42Nollett F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). We therefore predict that this dileucine will function to target all similar transmembrane cadherins to basolateral domains of polarized epithelial cells. Cadherins in which the dileucines are not conserved include cadherins 5 (VE-cadherin) and 20. The glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored cadherin 13 (T-cadherin), as expected, does not have a dileucine motif (48Doyle D.D. Goings G.E. Upshaw-Earley J. Page E. Ranscht B. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6937-6943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Our experimental results, therefore, confirmed that the dileucine motif in E-cadherin does function as a targeting signal. Replacing the leucines with alanines in the full-length or truncated tail constructs resulted in a complete loss of basolateral targeting. The dileucine signal in E-cadherin has an acidic amino acid cluster on its carboxyl-terminal side that is highly conserved throughout dileucine-containing cadherins and is similar to targeting motifs in other basolateral proteins, including furin (49Simmen T. Nobile M. Bonifacino J.S. Hunziker W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3136-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), invariant chain (50Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and low density lipoprotein receptor (22Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In some cases, such as for furin, these acidic clusters have been shown to be important for the function of dileucine signals in basolateral targeting (49Simmen T. Nobile M. Bonifacino J.S. Hunziker W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3136-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Dileucine signals functioning in endocytosis typically have an acidic residue at the −4 position (D/EXXXLL) (21Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 51Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 52Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cadherin dileucine signal typically has a basic lysine or arginine in the −4 position. It is, therefore, unlikely that this motif will also function as an endocytosis motif.There are additional motifs sharing consensus with targeting signals encoded in the E-cadherin tail. Tyrosines at two places within the tail, one being in the membrane-proximal region and another at the carboxyl terminus, were deleted in a previous study and found to have no role in targeting of E-cadherin (34Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). There is a combined YXXφ tyrosine and dileucine motif (673), similar in structure to the overlapping motif, which has been shown to be responsible for basolateral targeting of the pIg F receptor in MDCK cells (53Orzech E. Schlessinger K. Weiss A. Okamoto C.T. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2201-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There is also a motif belonging to the YXXφ group, with a tyrosine at the second X position (705). Both of these latter signals are adjacent to, or within, the β-catenin binding domain and are thus predicted to be sequestered when E-cadherin is complexed to β-catenin. The possibility remains open, however, that any of these additional signals might be uncovered during dynamic protein interactions and therefore could act as targeting signals during further trafficking of surface E-cadherin. One or more of these signals could, for instance, target E-cadherin to clathrin-coated vesicles for endocytosis and recycling (35Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) after it reaches the basolateral plasma membrane. Overall, analysis of targeting motifs points to a dileucine signal rather than tyrosine-based signals being responsible for the polarized sorting and basolateral delivery of E-cadherin.Both MDCK and LLC-PK1 cell lines form polarized epithelial monolayers in culture that show patent basolateral trafficking and secretion of soluble proteoglycans (54de Almeida J.B. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C691-C700Crossref Google Scholar, 55Stow J.L. de Almeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E.J. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Due to the reported inverse polarity of LLC-PK1 (28Roush D.L. Gottardi C.J. Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), it was of interest to also analyze E-cadherin trafficking in these cells. Our findings verify that E-cadherin is trafficked correctly to the basolateral surface of the LLC-PK1 cells, and we show that this targeting, as in MDCK cells, is directed by a dileucine motif. This provides new evidence to confirm that basolateral targeting via dileucine-based mechanisms functions correctly in LLC-PK1 cells. The correct targeting of endogenous E-cadherin, GFP-E-cadherin, and Tac/Ecad constructs suggests that dileucine-based sorting is fully sufficient to direct basolateral trafficking in these cells. LLC-PK1 cells are defective in targeting of tyrosine-based motifs due to the absence of the μ1B chain (30Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, the sorting of dileucine motifs occurs through interaction with the β subunits of the adaptor complex (56Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), allowing correct sorting of proteins such as T cell receptor sub-unit (CD3γ), Fc receptor, and E-cadherin. The correct targeting of endogenous E-cadherin and Tac/Ecad constructs in LLC-PK1 cells acts as further evidence that this targeting does, in fact, rely on dileucine rather than tyrosine motifs. The full nature of the adaptor complexes or that required for post-Golgi transport of E-cadherin in either LLC-PK1 or MDCK epithelial cells have yet to be characterized.Finally, the current study also provides new insights into the role of β-catenin in E-cadherin trafficking. β-Catenin is a cytoplasmic protein with affinity for the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin, it binds to E-cadherin early in the biosynthetic pathway, forming a stable complex that is transported to the cell surface (33Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Chen and colleagues (34Chen Y.T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) concluded that β-catenin is required for the biosynthetic processing and trafficking of E-cadherin, based on a correlation between deletion of residues within or near the β-catenin binding domain and loss of surface delivery in GP-2-E-cadherin chimeras and other constructs. However, our current results suggest a different scenario. We showed that full-length tail chimeras co-precipitated β-catenin in similar proportion to that seen in endogenous E-cadherin-β-catenin complexes. Upon expressing the Tac/Ecad-(578–653) chimera, which clearly did not bind β-catenin, we found it was correctly targeted and transported to the cell surface, suggesting that β-catenin is not required for sorting or delivery under these conditions. β-Catenin may have a role in facilitating or optimizing the transport, processing, or folding of newly synthesized E-cadherin. All of these factors might well contribute to the slower processing and transient accumulation of Tac/Ecad-(578–653) that we noted in the absence of β-catenin. Recent biophysical and biochemical analyses further suggest that β-catenin binding might also serve to protect the E-cadherin tail from degradation (57Huber A.H. Stewart D.B. Laurents D.V.

Our finding, that β-catenin is not required for basolateral targeting or surface delivery, sheds new light on β-catenin as having a role in facilitating, but not directing, cadherin trafficking.The polarized targeting of E-cadherin is of seminal importance to the maintenance of epithelial polarity and function. Targeting signals and mechanisms must ensure the accurate basolateral delivery of newly synthesized E-cadherin and of internalized and recycled E-cadherin for its incorporation into adherens junctions. In this study we demonstrate one such mechanism, basolateral sorting directed via a dileucine signal. Future studies will address specific roles for additional signals and perhaps for some of the accessory proteins in cadherin/catenin complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2140698769,"Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) is responsible for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis from l-arginine in response to inflammatory mediators. To determine the degradation pathway of iNOS, human epithelial kidney HEK293 cells with stable expression of human iNOS were incubated in the presence of various degradation pathway inhibitors. Treatment with the proteasomal inhibitors lactacystin, MG132, and N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal resulted in the accumulation of iNOS, indicating that these inhibitors blocked its degradation. Moreover, proteasomal inhibition blocked iNOS degradation in a dose- and time-dependent manner as well as when NO synthesis was inhibited by N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. Furthermore, proteasomal inhibition blocked the degradation of an iNOS splice variant that lacked the capacity to dimerize and of an iNOS mutant that lacks l-arginine binding ability, suggesting that iNOS is targeted by proteasomes, notwithstanding its capacity to produce NO, dimerize, or bind the substrate. In contrast to proteasomal inhibitors, the calpain inhibitor calpastatin and the lysosomal inhibitors trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-4-guanidino butane, leupeptin, pepstatin-A, chloroquine, and NH(4)Cl did not lead to significant accumulation of iNOS. Interestingly, when cytokines were used to induce iNOS in RT4 human epithelial cells, the effect of proteasomal inhibition was dichotomous. Lactacystin added prior to cytokine stimulation prevented iNOS induction by blocking the degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha, thus preventing activation of NF-kappaB. In contrast, lactacystin added 48 h after iNOS induction led to the accumulation of iNOS. Similarly, in murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, lactacystin blocked iNOS degradation when added 48 h after iNOS induction by lipopolysaccharide. These data identify the proteasome as the primary degradation pathway for iNOS."

The precise mechanism that p75NTR uses to promote cell death is not certain, but one possibility is that p75NTR-dependent ceramide accumulation inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated Akt activation. To test this hypothesis, we developed a system for examining p75NTR-dependent apoptosis and determined the effect of p75NTR on Akt activation. Surprisingly, p75NTR increased, rather than decreased, Akt phosphorylation in a variety of cell types, including human Niemann-Pick fibroblasts, which lack acidic sphingomyelinase activity. The p75NTR expression level required to elicit Akt phosphorylation was much lower than that required to activate the JNK pathway or to mediate apoptosis. We show that p75NTR-dependent Akt phosphorylation was independent of TrkA signaling, required active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and was associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 and Shc and with reduced cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity. Finally, we show that p75NTR expression increased survival in cells exposed to staurosporine or subjected to serum withdrawal.

Nerve growth factor (NGF),1 the prototypic neurotrophin, is the best characterized member of this family, which in mammals, also includes brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5 (1Lewin G.R. Barde Y.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The signal transduction systems that mediate the diverse biological functions of the neurotrophins are initiated by two categories of cell-surface receptors: the Trk receptors and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). One of the main survival pathways for neuronal cell survival is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and involves activation of the Akt serine/threonine kinase (2Dudek H. Datta S.R.

Increased phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) production results primarily from relocalization of PI3K from the cytosol to a juxtamembrane location that provides access to PIP substrates. This redistribution of PI3K requires the association of the SH2 domain within the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K with phosphorylated tyrosines present on activated cell-surface receptors or on receptor-associated adaptor proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Accumulation of PIP3 and its phospholipid phosphatase product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, in the plasma membrane creates docking sites for the pleckstrin homology domains of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and Akt.

Several findings indicate that NGF binding to p75NTR can initiate a cell death cascade in some cell types.

Activation of cell death cascades can result from suppression of signaling pathways that normally support survival. In some systems, sphingomyelinase activation results in a ceramide-dependent decrease in the generation of PIP3 and a subsequent reduction in Akt activity (42Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 43Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar); and in others, ceramide reduces Akt activity through specific dephosphorylation of serine 473 (44Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13330-13335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Since p75NTR activates sphingomyelinase in a neurotrophin-dependent manner, we have determined if p75NTR activation can suppress Akt and thereby facilitate apoptosis. Our results show that p75NTR does indeed regulate Akt; but contrary to our expectations, we found that p75NTR increases Akt activation through a Trk-independent pathway that requires PI3K and show that p75NTR expression suppresses apoptosis. Although high levels of p75NTR will mediate cell death, the p75NTR expression level required to elicit Akt phosphorylation is much lower than that required to activate the JNK pathway or to mediate apoptosis. The effect of p75NTR on Akt correlates with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and of Shc adaptor proteins, suggesting that PTPase inhibition may play a role in this effect. Consistent with this, p75NTR expression results in reduced cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity. These data indicate that a physiological role of p75NTR is to enhance cell survival through an Akt-dependent pathway.

Crude viruses derived from viral plaques were used to infect 293A cells. p75NTR expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis, and positive plaques were repurified twice by limiting dilution. Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified in 293A cells, purified on sucrose gradients, and titered by plaque assay in 293A cells. Control recombinant adenoviruses expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) or green fluorescent protein were generated using the same viral backbone and purification techniques as for the p75NTR viruses.

Blocking and secondary antibody incubations of immunoblots were performed in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% (w/v) dried skim milk powder. Primary antibody incubations were performed in Tris-buffered saline/Tween supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin. For 4G10, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was used for the blocking step. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells were transfected with a control plasmid or with plasmid encoding the p75NTR intracellular domain or the p75NTR intracellular domain modified to contain a myristoylation tag. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were scraped from plates in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g, and then resuspended in 15 ml of HES buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized in a glass-on-Teflon homogenizer with 10 strokes at 1200 rpm and then triturated twice using a 25-gauge needle. An aliquot was set aside as the initial lysate. The lysate was centrifuged at 19,000 ×g for 20 min; the resulting pellet was designated membrane, and the supernatant was designated cytosol. All fractions were resuspended in HES buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and analyzed for protein concentration, and equivalent amounts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Analysis of cell survival was performed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, which was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 4 h following a 48-h infection. The reaction was ended by the addition of 1 volume of solubilization buffer (20% SDS, 10% dimethylformamide, and 20% acetic acid). After overnight solubilization, specific and nonspecific absorbances were read at 570 and 630 nm, respectively. Each condition was tested six times, and results were analyzed for statistical significance by multiple analysis of variance. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were washed in cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C using polyclonal anti-pan-Trk 203 antibody (gift of David Kaplan, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada), polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (gift of Jane McGlade, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), or polyclonal anti-p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.).

For wheat germ agglutinin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precipitation, beads were added to Nonidet P-40-extracted protein samples for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation and multiple washes. Samples were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Apoptotic cell death was quantified using annexin V binding and FACS analyses. Briefly, cells were harvested using PBS with 2 mm EDTA and washed twice in PBS supplemented with 2% BCS. After the last wash, the cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS containing 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. PBS (0.3 ml) was added to each tube, and cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson-Pharmingen). For FACS analysis of cells with sub-G1 DNA content, cells were harvested and resuspended in 50% ethanol and PBS and left on ice for 15 min. An underlayer of 1 volume of cold BCS was added, and cells were spun at 250 × g for 5 min. Cells in the resulting pellet were resuspended in blocking buffer consisting of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% BCS and then incubated for 30 min on ice. Antibody p75NTR-B1 was added at a dilution of 1:500, and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Cells were washed three times in blocking buffer and then incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer supplemented with a 1:500 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Cells were washed three times and resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A for 15 min at room temperature. PBS (0.3 ml) with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide was added to the cells, incubated for 15 min, and then analyzed on a FACScan. Each condition was tested in triplicate, and results were analyzed for statistical significance by multiple analysis of variance. Twenty-four hours after infection, PC12nnr5 cells were washed twice in cold HEPES-buffered saline to remove free phosphate and then harvested in 1 ml of suspension buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and spun at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove intact mitochondria and nuclei. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by spinning at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended for 30 min in 1 ml of suspension buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and then spun at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble contaminants. Endogenous phosphate was removed from membrane and cytosolic fractions by buffer exchange in Centricon-10 columns (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Protein assays were performed on the resulting fractions, and the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate END(pY)INASL was added to 25 μg of protein to a final concentration of 100 μm. The reaction was stopped after 30 min at room temperature by the addition of 1 volume of stopping solution (0.02% malachite green, 0.5% ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, and 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol). Absorbance at 630 nm was read after a 60-min incubation. As a control, sodium orthovanadate was added to a parallel set of samples to ensure the presence of specific tyrosine phosphatase activity. Background absorbance for parallel samples that did not receive the substrate was subtracted as contaminating free phosphate. Each condition was tested in triplicate, and results were analyzed for statistical significance by multiple analysis of variance. The actions of p75NTR are complex and not well understood. This is due in part to the lack of cellular systems in which p75NTR-dependent signaling events can be reliably observed. Previous work from our group (46Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D. Fawcett J. Miller F.D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6988-6998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (50Boldin M. Mett I. Varfolomeev E. Chumakov I. Shemeravni Y. Camonis J. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) has shown that overexpression of the intracellular domain of TNFR superfamily members will constitutively activate downstream signaling pathways. To reliably activate p75NTR signaling cascades in a variety of cellular circumstances, recombinant adenoviruses encoding full-length p75NTR, the intracellular domain of p75NTR (p75ICD), or a myristoylated form of the intracellular domain of p75NTR that is targeted to the plasma membrane (p75mICD) (Fig.1 B) were produced. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding LacZ or green fluorescent protein were used as controls for all studies. To validate signaling properties of these p75NTR recombinant viruses, we initially tested their effects on the survival of PC12nnr5 cells (which express endogenous p75NTR, but not TrkA). Fig. 1 A shows that LacZ virus had no effect on cell survival, whereas viruses encoding p75NTR or p75ICD were cytotoxic at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 200. Overexpression of p75mICD induced cytotoxicity at lower multiplicities of infection than that of p75NTR or p75ICD, suggesting that membrane localization of the intracellular domain may be important for p75NTR-dependent apoptosis. p75NTR-dependent cell death was not an artifact of protein overexpression or viral infection since equivalent quantities of LacZ adenovirus had no effect on cell survival. Several reports have shown that p75NTR activation can lead to JNK activation (26Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 27Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and consistent with this, we found that expression of p75mICD (Fig.1 C), p75ICD, and p75NTR increased phosphorylation of JNK on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 and increased c-Jun phosphorylation on serine 73. Equivalent levels of LacZ virus did not alter JNK or c-Jun phosphorylation (data not shown). The level of c-Jun protein was also elevated at high p75NTR expression levels, likely due to autoregulation of c-jun transcription (51Cochran B.H. Natl. Inst. Drug Abuse Res. Monogr. 1993; 125: 3-24Google Scholar) during the relatively long infection period (48 h). To demonstrate the specificity of the JNK activation initiated by p75NTR, we analyzed phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, which lies downstream of protein kinase A, and assessed the phosphorylation status of MKK3/6, which activates p38 MAPK. Neither CREB (Fig. 1 C) nor MKK3/6 (data not shown) phosphorylation was altered by p75NTR expression . These results show that p75NTR signaling results in specific activation of the JNK pathway and promotes cell death and therefore demonstrate that the p75NTR recombinant adenoviruses show the expected constitutive signaling properties. Recent reports have shown that ceramide inhibits PI3K activity, reduces cellular PIP3 levels, and thereby inhibits Akt activity (42Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 43Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that p75NTR could facilitate apoptosis by attenuating PIP3 production and reducing Akt activity. To determine if p75NTR alters Akt activity, PC12nnr5 cells were infected with recombinant virus expressing each of the three p75NTR isoforms or LacZ and analyzed for Akt activation using phospho-specific antibodies directed against Akt serine 473 (Ser473), an Akt autophosphorylation site that correlates with Akt kinase activity (5Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, expression of full-length p75NTR, p75ICD (Fig.2), or p75mICD (see Figs. 3 Band 6 B) resulted in significant increases in the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473, whereas control adenovirus expressing LacZ had no effect on Akt Ser473phosphorylation. As noted above, relatively high levels of p75NTR expression were required to observe JNK activation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and apoptosis, but much lower levels of p75NTR expression were sufficient to induce Akt phosphorylation. p75NTR-mediated reduction of Akt phosphorylation was never observed, even in cells exposed to high titers of p75NTR recombinant adenovirus. The effects of ligand binding to p75NTR on Akt activation in the presence and absence of virus were also tested; treatment of control and infected cells with NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or neurotrophin-3 at various concentrations and time courses had no effect on the p75NTR adenovirus-induced phosphorylation of Akt in PC12nnr5 cells (data not shown). Therefore, these data indi"

It participates in the development of Parkinson's disease, in which the nerve cell lesions, Lewy bodies, accumulate α-synuclein filaments. The synaptic neurotransmitter release is primarily dependent on Ca2+-regulated processes. A microdialysis technique was applied showing that α-synuclein binds Ca2+ with an IC50 of about 2–300 μm and in a reaction uninhibited by a 50-fold excess of Mg2+. The Ca2+-binding site consists of a novel C-terminally localized acidic 32-amino acid domain also present in the homologue β-synuclein, as shown by Ca2+binding to truncated recombinant and synthetic α-synuclein peptides. Ca2+ binding affects the functional properties of α-synuclein. First, the ligand binding of 125I-labeled bovine microtubule-associated protein 1A is stimulated by Ca2+ ions in the 1–500 μm range and is dependent on an intact Ca2+ binding site in α-synuclein. Second, the Ca2+ binding stimulates the proportion of125I-α-synuclein-containing oligomers. This suggests that Ca2+ ions may both participate in normal α-synuclein functions in the nerve terminal and exercise pathological effects involved in the formation of Lewy bodies. α-Synuclein is a protein normally involved in presynaptic vesicle homeostasis.

Parkinson's disease bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate α-synuclein microtubule-associated protein Parkinson's disease (PD)1 and other common neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. dementia with Lewy bodies and the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by the development of the proteinaceous inclusions called Lewy bodies in the degenerating nerve cells (1McKeith I.G. Perry E.K. Perry R.H. Neurology. 1999; 53: 902-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lewy bodies comprise α-synuclein (AS)-containing filaments, and purified AS readily forms amyloid-like filaments in vitro (2Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee W.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M.

Moreover, missense mutations in the AS gene cause heritable autosomal dominant PD (6Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R.

Transgenic animal models support the direct link between AS and neurodegeneration because overexpression of AS leads to neuronal loss, nerve terminal pathology, and formation of Lewy body-like inclusions (8Masliah E.

Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by AS rely on structural changes occurring during the transition from the monomeric to the β-folded filamentous state (12Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). AS is a member of the synuclein family, which, in man, is dominated by α-, β-, and γ-synuclein (13Duda J.E. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The synucleins are acidic proteins of about 140 amino acids that display a “natively unfolded” structure (14Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the proteins is highly conserved and contains several KTKEGV consensus repeats, whereas the C-terminal portion is less well conserved and possesses no known structural elements (15Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The differences in its primary structure are reflected in segregated functional domains, e.g. brain vesicles bind to the N-terminal part, whereas the microtubule-associated proteins tau and microtubule-associated protein 1B bind to the C-terminal part (16Jensen P.H.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The AS gene is dispensable for normal development and breeding as demonstrated in AS knockout mice (19Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N.

However, these mice do exhibit subtle changes in the contents of certain neurotransmitters and in synaptic transmission (19Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E.

Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that AS plays a role in the cellular signaling events, an observation that is in agreement with biochemical studies demonstrating that AS can affect phospholipase D2 and protein kinases and modulate phosphorylation of nerve cell proteins (17Jensen P.H.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ ions regulate a plethora of cellular processes. This functionality has been refined in neurons, where the propagation of action potentials over long distances and the fine-tuned neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals represent such Ca2+-regulated processes (23Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 24Goda Y. Südhof T.C. Curr. Opin.

The actions of Ca2+ ions are mediated by several mechanisms. The Ca2+-calmodulin complex and its diverse downstream signaling pathways represent common cellular mechanisms (26Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). More neuron-specific Ca2+-regulated proteins are represented by synaptic vesicle-associated proteins and abundant Ca2+-binding neuronal proteins like parvalbumin and calbindin (27Baimbridge K.G. Celio M.R. Rogers J.H. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The latter group may function as a slow buffer that modulates synaptic plasticity (28Caillard O. Moreno H. Schwaller B. Llano I. Celio M.R. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13372-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The importance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis is highlighted by the central role of Ca2+ ions in apoptotic processes and neuronal excitotoxicity (29Choi D.W. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1261-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 30Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the binding of Ca2+ to AS to ascertain whether Ca2+ can regulate normal and pathological AS functions. 45Ca and 125I were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All reagents were of analytic grade, unless stated otherwise. The synthetic peptide AS-(109–140), corresponding to amino acid residues 109–140 in human AS, was from Shaefer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark). The novel deletion mutants AS-(1–110) and AS-(1–125) were produced by PCR-based mutagenesis as described previously for AS-(1–95) and AS-(55–140) (18Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J.M. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified essentially as described for wild type AS (31Jensen P.H. Hojrup P. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen L. Olesen O.F. Gliemann J. Jakes R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The peptides were more than 95% pure as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2, middle panel, A, inset), and their identities were verified by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Purified bovine microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-1A was kindly provided by Dr. Khalid Islam (32Pedrotti B. Islam K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12463-12470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It consisted essentially of the pure ∼360-kDa heavy chain (Fig. 3 , top panel, inset, lane 1). The MAP-1A was iodinated to a specific activity of about 250 mCi/mg using chloramin T as the oxidizing agent, as described previously for MAP-1B (18Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J.M. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic migration of the iodinated MAP-1A consisted of a single slow-migrating band corresponding to the nonlabeled protein (Fig. 3 , top panel, inset, lane 2). All protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard.Figure 3Ca2+ binding to AS regulates the interaction with MAP-1A.

The columns in Aand B represent the mean ± 1 S.D. of four replicates in one of three similar experiments. The equal immobilization of the different AS peptides was verified by their similar binding of the125I-labeled ASY-3 antibody that recognizes the N terminus of AS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) First buffers and protein stock solutions were passed through a Chelex 100 column (Bio-Rad) to remove Ca2+ ions to negligible levels (33Vorum H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Etzerodt M. Svendsen I. Celis J.E. Honoré B. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1787-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Next, solutions containing 1 mm45Ca2+ and different concentrations of unlabeled Ca2+ were prepared with and without a constant concentration of AS-(1–140), AS-(1–125), AS-(1–110), AS-(1–95), β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein. All experiments were performed at 4 °C in a solution containing 150 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The concentration of the synucleins varied from 20 to 300 μm. Binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis. For equilibrium dialysis, 30-μl plexiglass chambers were used (34Kragh-Hansen U. Vorum H. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each chamber was divided into two equal compartments by a cellulose membrane cut from dialysis tubing (Spectrum, Houston, Texas; cutoff, 3,500 Da). The left-side compartments contained 25 μl of calcium-containing samples, with or without the synucleins, and the right-side compartments contained 25 μl of buffer. Control experiments showed that equilibrium was established within 2 h (data not shown). Accordingly, the chambers were emptied after 9 h, before the samples were assayed for radioactivity and protein. The Ca2+ concentration was determined by liquid scintillation counting with a LKB Wallac 1209 Rackbeta counter (Turku, Finland). No quenching of the radioactivity of45Ca2+ by the synucleins was observed. The recovery of 45Ca2+ was 97%, demonstrating that no significant adsorption of calcium to the cellulose membrane or dialysis chamber had occurred. The radioactivity of Ca2+-containing solutions that had not been dialyzed was taken to represent the known concentration of total Ca2+. In the binding experiments, the concentrations of bound and free Ca2+ were calculated by using the radioactivity samples taken from the synuclein-containing chambers (representing bound plus free Ca2+) and the corresponding synuclein-free chambers (representing free Ca2+). The concentrations of the synucleins were measured by spectroscopy at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient calculated for each of them. The protein content in the isolated samples was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining to assure the absence of degradation and leakage through the membrane. The 125I-MAP-1A binding to AS peptides immobilized in Polysorb microtiter plates (Nunc, Copenhagen, Denmark) was performed essentially as described previously for tau (17Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Højrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The binding buffer consisted of 150 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% extensively dialyzed bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA supplemented with various concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2. The even immobilization of the C-terminally truncated AS peptides was verified by their similar specific binding of a 125I-labeled affinity-purified antibody (ASY-3) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 31 residues of AS (data not shown). AS and C-terminal-truncated peptides (1 μm) supplemented with 500 pm of the corresponding 125I-labeled AS were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mmdithioerythreitol in the absence and presence of Ca2+. The distribution of monomers, oligomers, and higher aggregates was subsequently stabilized by the addition of a short-length hydrophilic chemical cross-linker, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (1 mm), for 15 min, and then the cross-linker was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of Tris-containing SDS, dithioerythreitol loading buffer. The samples were subsequently resolved by reducing gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by visualization by autoradiography. 45Ca2+ equilibrium dialysis was performed to determine whether AS is a Ca2+-binding protein. Fig. 1 demonstrates that human recombinant AS binds Ca2+ with a half-saturation of about 300 μm. The saturation of the binding approaches 0.5 mol Ca2+/mol AS at 1 mm Ca2+, which indicates the presence of a single binding site. Mg2+ (8 mm) fails to inhibit the 45Ca2+tracer binding (1 μm) significantly as compared with the ∼85% inhibition obtained by 1.5 mm unlabeled Ca2+. Hence, the binding site displays a Ca2+selectivity among the dominating intracellular divalent cations (Fig.2, middle panel, A). Truncated recombinant AS peptides with deletions of the N-terminal 29- and 54-amino acid residues and the C-terminal 45-amino acid residues were used for initial localization of the Ca2+-binding site. Fig. 2, middle panel, B demonstrates that only the C-terminal truncation inhibited the binding, whereas the N-terminal truncation has no effect. No inhibition of the Ca2+ binding is observed when testing the mutations causing PD (A30P and A53T) (Fig.2, middle panel, A). Acidic amino acid residues often participate in the binding of Ca2+ ions as noted in the EF-hand, C2-domain and the low-affinity Ca2+-binding sites in S100 proteins (35Branden C. Tooze J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 37Tjoelker L.W. Seyfried C.E. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Calderon J. Schreiber R.B. Gray P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and such residues account for 33% of the C-terminal 45 residues. Fig. 2,top panel, demonstrates a striking identity in the spacing of 10 of the 12 acidic residues in the C-terminal 32 residues of α- and β-synuclein. γ-Synuclein, however, shows no such similarity. The similarity in the spacing of acidic residues is reflected at the functional level, where α- and β-synuclein, but not γ-synuclein, bind Ca2+ (Fig. 2, middle panel, A). The acidic residues in the C terminus of α- and β-synuclein are organized as a tandem repeat of 16 amino acids (Fig. 2, top panel), and the integrity of this structure may be required for the binding of Ca2+ ions. This hypothesis was explored by examining the expression and purification of recombinant truncated AS peptides lacking (i) the C-terminal repeat AS-(1–125) and (ii) both repeats AS-(1–110) and AS-(1–95) (Fig. 2, middle panel, B, inset). Fig. 2, middle panel, B shows that removal of the single C-terminal repeat in AS-(1–125) inhibits the Ca2+ binding to the level of the peptides lacking both repeats or the entire 45 C-terminal residues. Moreover, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the tandem repeat structure, AS-(109–140), binds 45Ca2+ to the same extent as wild type AS (Fig. 2, middle panel, B), and its binding isotherms reveal indistinguishable affinities for Ca2+ (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Accordingly, the C-terminal repeat structure in α- and β-synuclein is necessary and sufficient to bind Ca2+ and represents a bona fide Ca2+-binding domain. The propensity of Ca2+ ions to modulate ligand binding to AS was analyzed in terms of the effect of such binding of (i) the amyloidogenic Aβ(1–40) peptide and (ii) the microtubule-associated proteins tau and MAP-1B. Ca2+ ions have no significant effect on these interactions (data not shown). MAP-1A is a novel AS ligand, as demonstrated by the binding of125I-labeled bovine MAP-1A to immobilized AS (Fig.3, top panel). The association of 50 pm125I-MAP-1A reaches a plateau within 9 h at 4 °C (data not shown), and all incubations are therefore performed for 16 h. The interaction is specific, as demonstrated by the inhibition of 125I-MAP-1A binding by both unlabeled MAP-1A and AS, and it exhibits a high affinity (IC50 ∼ 30 nm; Fig. 3, top panel). The binding of MAP-1A to AS is enhanced by Ca2+ ions (Fig.3, middle panel), and a maximal stimulatory effect of about 90% is obtained at concentrations greater than 0.5 mm(Fig. 3, middle panel), with a half-maximal stimulation at about 0.3 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3, middle panel). Both Mg2+ and Ca2+ (1.5 mm) stimulate MAP-1A binding to AS, but the effect of Ca2+ alone is about 60% greater than that for Mg2+ ions alone; when combined, their effect is synergistic (Fig. 3, bottom panel, A). Disruption of the Ca2+-binding domain in AS obtained by removal of the C-terminal 15, 30, and 45 amino acid residues completely abrogates the Ca2+-stimulatory effect on MAP-1A binding (Fig. 3,bottom panel, B) and demonstrates that the Ca2+effect was indeed based on the AS moiety. Removal of the Ca2+-binding site in AS increases the binding of MAP-1A to the truncated AS peptide (data not shown), but it abrogates the stimulatory Ca2+ effect (Fig. 3, bottom panel, B). This indicates a negative regulatory effect of the C-terminal segment of AS on the MAP-1B interaction that is alleviated by binding of Ca2+ ions. The stimulatory effect of Mg2+ ions on MAP-1A binding may thus be mediated via the MAP-1A moiety. Many Ca2+ effects are mediated through the binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin, but AS does not bind to calmodulin-Sepharose in either the absence or presence of Ca2 (data not shown). Abnormal filamentous AS is a characteristic of diseased brain tissue, and AS aggregation represents a nucleation-dependent process, where the nucleation by oligomeric AS species may represent a rate-limiting step. We used the short-length hydrophilic chemical cross-linker BS3 to covalently stabilize AS oligomers in the absence and presence of Ca2. This analysis is likely to underestimate the oligomeric content because the cross-linking efficiency is <100%. However, the method has the advantage of visualizing molecules associated through low-affinity interactions. Gel filtration methods and other time-consuming procedures for separating oligomerized and monomeric species may not be able to reveal such interactions due to dissociation during the procedures. No significant AS-(1–140) oligomers are present without cross-linking (Fig. 4). The same applies to AS-(1–125) and AS-(1–110) (data not shown). Supplementing the AS solution with 1 mm BS3 for 15 min before reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis causes the formation of125I-labeled bands compatible with AS dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers with a higher oligomeric content among the C-terminal-truncated peptides (Fig. 4). Saturation of the Ca2+ binding site (1.5 mm) increases the oligomeric content of AS-(1–140) 2-fold for dimers and 2.5-fold for trimers, and higher aggregates, whereas no Ca2effect is observed for the truncated peptides. The oligomers are not an artifact of the iodination of AS because the distinct oligomeric pattern is absent without the presence of 1 μm unlabeled AS. Accordingly, Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal tandem repeat domain favors the formation of AS oligomers. The present study identifies a novel Ca2+-binding motif in the C terminus of AS. The binding of Ca2+ alters the interactions between AS molecules in the process of oligomerization and between AS and certain nerve cell proteins as exemplified by MAP-1A. AS binds Ca2+ ions selectively as compared with the predominant cytosolic divalent cation Mg2+, which suggests that AS functions can be regulated by Ca2+ ions in a cellular context. Several synuclein genes are expressed in man; the most predominant of these are AS, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein (15Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The localization of α- and β-synuclein in normal nervous tissue is restricted to the nerve terminals (38Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 39Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), in contrast to γ-synuclein, which is localized in the somatodendritic compartment (40Buchman V.L. Adu J. Pinõn L.G.P. Ninkina N.N. Davies A.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The nerve terminal localization parallels the Ca2+ binding properties of the proteins because α- and β-synuclein, but not γ-synuclein, bind Ca2+. We therefore wish to suggest a functional significance of Ca2+ binding to AS in the nerve terminals where high local Ca2+ concentrations are reached (41Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and AS regulates complex nerve terminal processes related to neurotransmitter homeostasis and maintenance of the distal pool of synaptic vesicles (19Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding motif is localized to the C-terminal 32 residues of AS and comprises an acidic tandem repeat rich in proline residues. This structure is sufficient and necessary to confer Ca2+ binding activity and requires the presence of both repeats as demonstrated both by the full binding activity of the synthetic peptide AS-(109–140) and the absence of binding to AS-(1–125). The Ca2+-binding domain does not resemble any of the hitherto recognized Ca2+-binding structures such as the EF-hand, the C2-domain, or the less defined low-affinity binding sites in the SH-100 class of proteins, with the exception of the clustering of negatively charged residues (35Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, New York1991: 22-23Google Scholar, 36Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 37Tjoelker L.W. Seyfried C.E. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Calderon J. Schreiber R.B. Gray P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AS is natively unfolded, and circular dichroism spectroscopy does not reveal any structural changes in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (14Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). However, it is not always necessary for Ca2+ ions to cause gross structural changes for functional effects to arise, as shown for the C2A domain in synaptotagmin I, where Ca2+ works as an electrostatic switch that facilitates binding to syntaxin I and acidic phospholipids (42Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 43Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IC50 for the Ca2+ binding to AS is about 300 μm, and Ca2+ concentrations close to this magnitude are only encountered in normal nerve cells close to Ca2+ channels at the plasma membrane during propagation of action potentials and at neurotransmitter release (41Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, cofactors may increase the Ca2+ affinity and thus increase the potential significance of the Ca2+ binding in analogy with the approximate 1000-fold increase in the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the synaptotagmin C2A domain upon phospholipid binding (43Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Candidate cofactors are the kinases casein kinase-1, casein kinase-2, src, and fyn that have been implicated in the phosphorylation of Ser129 and Tyr125 (44Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Hass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 45Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3879-3884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Tyr125 is conserved from fish and birds to man. Such phosphorylation will increase the negative charge of the Ca2+-binding domain and thereby potentially increase the Ca2+ affinity. α-Synuclein and β-synuclein are soluble proteins with vesicle-binding properties that are localized to nerve terminals. Their local concentration is very high because they constitute about 0.1% of the total protein in rat brain extracts (47Shibayama-Imazu T. Okahash I. Omata K. Nakajo S. Ochiai H. Nakai Y. Hama T. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Brain Res. 1993; 622: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and this may make them suited to be presynaptic Ca2+ buffers. The Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal domain in AS stimulates binding of the novel ligand MAP-1A, and this domain probably plays a negative regulatory role because its removal increases MAP-1A binding (data not shown) but abrogates the stimulatory Ca2+ effect. MAP-1A belongs to the same group of microtubule-associated proteins as the AS ligands tau and microtubule-associated protein-1B (17Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Højrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 18Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J.M. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and several characteristics favor a physiological interaction between MAP-1A and AS. First, their developmental expression profiles are parallel with a low to absent expression in the fetal period, followed by increased expression during postnatal development (48Hsu L.J. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L.J. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 49Petersen K. Olesen O.F. Mikkelsen J.D.

Second, both proteins are predominantly carried as part of the slow component b of axonal transport, indicating subcellular contacts to the same transporting structures (52Jensen P.H. Li J.-Y. Dahlström A. Dotti C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 53Nixon R.A. Fischer I. Lewis S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Third, a significant part of the transported proteins is incorporated into stationary axonal structures (52Jensen P.H. Li J.-Y. Dahlström A. Dotti C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 53Nixon R.A. Fischer I. Lewis S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The functional significance of such a putative interaction remains unsolved, but AS is known to change the functional properties of its ligands (17Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Højrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 21Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). AS-containing filaments accumulate in Lewy bodies during the year-long process of neurodegeneration in PD. In vitro, filament formation is a nucleation-dependent process, as demonstrated, where preformed oligomers/filaments can seed the growth of filaments (54Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Accordingly, if oligomer formation represents a rate-limiting step, then even a small increase in their rate of formation, regulated by pathogenic factors, may enhance filament growth significantly (12Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Known factors with this property are: (i) AS mutations linked to familial Parkinson's disease (5Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), and (ii) proteolytic activities directed against the AS C-terminal because C-terminally truncated AS preparations more readily form fibrils (4Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), contain a higher proportion of oligomers, as revealed by chemical cross-linkers (Fig. 4), and such peptides are recovered from pathological brain tissue and isolated Lewy bodies (3Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J.M. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Increased Ca2+ concentrations represent a novel fibrillogenic factor, as demonstrated by the increased oligomeric content upon binding of Ca2+ to the tandem repeat domain in AS. This makes AS resemble synaptotagmin VII whose oligomerization is stimulated by Ca2+(55Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28180-28185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). High levels of AS filaments have been reported in preparations of recombinant protein (56Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, this study was performed with prolonged incubation, elevated temperature, and acidic pH as compared with our 2-h incubation at pH 7.4. The low oligomeric content in Ca2+-stimulated wild type AS is, by contrast, in accordance with gel filtration experiments demonstrating oligomers with low solubility (<10%) even after 66 days of incubation at pH 7.4 (5Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). The inhibitory role of the C-terminal part of AS on fibril formation may rely on an electrostatic repulsion from these negatively charged segments. The molecular mechanism exploited by proteolysis and Ca2+ binding would then be similar because both remove negative charges from the C terminus. Conclusively, our study extends our knowledge of AS functions in relation to both normal and pathological nerve cell paradigms by linking AS functions to the important cellular messenger Ca2+. This may facilitate future studies on the still poorly understood mechanisms underlying the gain in toxic function by AS in neurodegenerative disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2139644513,"Three-dimensional structures of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reveal a narrow and deep active site gorge with two sites of ligand binding, an acylation site at the base of the gorge, and a peripheral site near the gorge entrance. Recent studies have shown that the peripheral site contributes to catalytic efficiency by transiently binding substrates on their way to the acylation site, but the question of whether the peripheral site makes other contributions to the catalytic process remains open. A possible role for ligand binding to the peripheral site that has long been considered is the initiation of a conformational change that is transmitted allosterically to the acylation site to alter catalysis. However, evidence for conformational interactions between these sites has been difficult to obtain. Here we report that thioflavin T, a fluorophore widely used to detect amyloid structure in proteins, binds selectively to the AChE peripheral site with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.0 μm. The fluorescence of the bound thioflavin T is increased more than 1000-fold over that of unbound thioflavin T, the greatest enhancement of fluorescence for the binding of a fluorophore to AChE yet observed. Furthermore, when the acylation site ligands edrophonium or m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)trifluoroacetophenone form ternary complexes with AChE and thioflavin T, the fluorescence is quenched by factors of 2.7–4.2. The observation of this partial quenching of thioflavin T fluorescence is a major advance in the study of AChE for two reasons. First, it allows thioflavin T to be used as a reporter for ligand reactions at the acylation site. Second, it indicates that ligand binding to the acylation site initiates a change in the local AChE conformation at the peripheral site that quenches the fluorescence of bound thioflavin T.

Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) have revealed a narrow active site gorge some 20 Å deep with two separate ligand binding sites. During catalytic hydrolysis, the substrate acyl group is transferred briefly to residue Ser-200 2Throughout this paper we number residues according to the Torpedo AChE sequence. For example, Trp-84 and Ser-200 in this sequence correspond to Trp-86 and Ser-203, respectively, in mammalian AChE. in the acylation site at the bottom of the gorge. This site contains residues involved in a catalytic triad (His-440, Glu-327, Ser-200) and Trp-84, which binds to the trimethylammonium group of acetylcholine. The peripheral site near the mouth of the gorge includes, among others, residues Asp-72 and Trp-279. Recent investigations have shown that the peripheral site contributes to catalytic efficiency by transiently binding substrates on their way to the acylation site (4Szegletes T. Mallender W.D.

The question of whether the peripheral site plays additional roles in the catalytic process has long been of interest. Changeux (7Changeux J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1966; 2: 369-392PubMed Google Scholar) was among the first to appreciate that AChE contained two distinct ligand binding sites and that there may be allosteric interactions between ligands bound at these sites involving conformational changes in the protein molecule. Ligands bound to the peripheral site can inhibit or accelerate reactions at the acylation site, and these effects have often been attributed to conformational interactions between the sites (8Hucho F. Jarv J. Weise C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 422-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Barak D. Ordentlich A. Bromberg A. Kronman C. Marcus D. Lazar A. Ariel N. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15444-15452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for such conformational interactions has been difficult to obtain. For example, three-dimensional structures of AChE complexes with two ligands specific for the acylation site, edrophonium and the cationic trifluoromethylketone TMTFA, showed no changes in the structure of the peripheral site (10Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report we show that thioflavin T (Fig. 1) binds specifically to the AChE peripheral site and is one of the most useful fluorescent probes of AChE yet discovered. This fluorophore frequently is used to detect amyloid structure in proteins (12LeVine III, H. Wetzel R. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1999: 274-284Google Scholar), but the three-dimensional structure of the AChE peripheral site shows no indication of the extensive β sheet structure characteristic of amyloid. The intense fluorescence of thioflavin T bound to AChE is partially quenched by the binding of acylation site ligands in ternary complexes, and this quenching appears to result from a conformational interaction between the two sites.

Our conventional spectrophotometric assay at 412 nm is conducted in pH 7 buffer with 0.5 mm acetylthiocholine, conditions that result in 4.8 ΔA412 nm/min with 1 nm AChE (or about 76% of the maximal activity). Thioflavin T chloride (Sigma) concentrations were assigned as 70% of the dry weight. Thioflavin T chloride recrystallized from water gave an extinction coefficient ε412 nm of 36,000m−1 cm−1. Concentrations of propidium iodide (Calbiochem) were determined with an extinction coefficient ε493 nm of 5900m−1 cm−1(2Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and concentrations of edrophonium chloride (ethyl(3-hydroxyphenyl)dimethylammonium chloride; Sigma) were determined with ε271 nm of 3400m−1 cm−1from the dry weight (14Sharp T.R. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1982; 6: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TMTFA (kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Quinn, University of Iowa) concentrations were calibrated by titration with AChE. Substrate hydrolysis rates ν were measured in buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate and 0.02% Triton X-100 at pH 7.0) at 25 °C after addition of small aliquots of thioflavin T, acetylthiocholine, and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (to a final concentration of 0.33 mm) in a total volume of 1.0 ml. An Ellman assay (15Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres J.V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21516) Google Scholar) was used to measure formation of the thiolate dianion of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm (Δε412 nm = 14.15 mm−1cm−1; (16Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar)) for 1–3 min on a Varian Cary 3A spectrophotometer, and substrate concentrations were corrected for substrate depletion resulting from hydrolysis during this interval. It was assumed that acetylthiocholine concentrations were maintained at low enough values (<1.0 mm) to ignore substrate inhibition in the absence of inhibitors (4Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this case, a simplified scheme for inhibition by peripheral site ligands is given in Scheme FS1. In this scheme, inhibitor (I) can bind to each of the three enzyme species: E, ES, and EA. For example, ESIP represents a ternary complex with substrate (S) at the acylation site and I at the peripheral site (denoted by the subscript P). The acylation rate constantk2 is altered by a factor a in this ternary complex. Reciprocal plots of ν−1versus [S]−1 at all I concentrations here were linear, a result consistent with Scheme FS1 (4Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and slopes of these plots were calculated by weighted linear regression analyses that assumed that ν has a constant percent error. Plots of these slopesversus inhibitor concentration were fitted to Equation 1 by nonlinear regression analyses (Fig.P (BioSoft) version 6.0) with slope values weighted by the reciprocal of their variance (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). slopeν−1vs.[S]−1Kapp/Vmax=1+[I]KI1+α[I]KIEquation 1 KI is the equilibrium dissociation constant for I with E, and the experimental parameter α is simply the ratio of the second order rate constant with saturating I to that in the absence of I (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If thioflavin T (I1) can form a ternary complex with a second inhibitor (I2) and AChE, the residual concentration of free enzyme [E] in the presence of both inhibitors relative to the concentration of free enzyme ([E][I2]=0) when only I1 is present is given by Equation 2 (18Camps P. Cusack B. Mallender W.D. El Achab R. Morral J. Muñoz-Torrero D. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar). [E][E][I2]=0=K21+[I1]K1K21+[I1]K1+[I2]1+[I1]K12Equation 2 In this equation, K1 is the equilibrium dissociation constant for I1 with E,K2 is the equilibrium dissociation constant for I2 with E, and K12 is the equilibrium dissociation constant for I1 with the EI2 complex. The concentrations [E] and [E][I2] = 0 are proportional to the second order rate constants for substrate hydrolysis. Their ratio here was estimated from the relative ν at 19 μm acetylthiocholine, a concentration sufficiently below the Kapp of 50 μm for acetylthiocholine (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to justify the approximation that substrate hydrolysis was second order. The fluorescence of either thioflavin T or propidium is enhanced when these ligands bind to the AChE peripheral site. Fluorescence was monitored on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.02% Triton X-100 thermostated at 23 ± 1 °C. Thioflavin T fluorescence was measured with excitation at 450 nm and emission from 470 to 500 nm with excitation and emission slits of 10 nm. Propidium fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 500 nm and emission from 590 to 630 nm with slits of 10 nm (2Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 18Camps P. Cusack B. Mallender W.D. El Achab R. Morral J. Muñoz-Torrero D. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar). Total areas under the fluorescence emission curves (F) were calculated (unless otherwise noted), and fluorescence contributions from scatter in the buffer and enzyme were subtracted. In some experiments values of F were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis (Fig.P) to Equation 3 (18Camps P. Cusack B. Mallender W.D. El Achab R. Morral J. Muñoz-Torrero D. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar). F=fLLtot+0.5fEL−fLD−D2−4EtotLtotEquation 3 In Equation 3, fL is the fluorescence intensity coefficient for free ligand, fEL is the fluorescence intensity coefficient for bound ligand,Etot is the total enzyme concentration, Ltot is the total ligand concentration,KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant, and D = Etot + Ltot +KD. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis (Fig.P) to Equation 3, either with Ltot as the independent variable and Etot fixed or with the calculated Etot as the independent variable and Ltot fixed, to give KD,fEL, and in some casesfL. In these analyses, values of F were weighted by assuming constant percent error. In other experiments, Scheme FS2 was employed to evaluate interactions in ternary complexes involving thioflavin T and a second ligand in fluorescence assays. In this scheme the affinity of thioflavin T (L) at the peripheral site (denoted by subscript P) of AChE (E) is characterized by the dissociation constant KL in the absence of an acylation site ligand (I) and byKL2 when I occupies the acylation site. When I was edrophonium, the binding of I to E andELP was assumed to reach equilibrium instantaneously with dissociation constants KI andKI2, respectively. Binding of I to Eand ELp was much slower when I was TMTFA and occurred with association rate constants kIand kI2 and dissociation rate constantsk−I and k−I2, respectively. The program SCoP (Simulation Resources, Inc., Redlands, CA; version 3.51) was applied directly to the rate equations corresponding to Scheme FS2 (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This program solves differential equations with numerical solvers and allowed fitting of F at various inhibitor concentrations and/or times. The total concentrationsEtot, Ltot, and Itot, as well as fL, were inserted into the program as fixed input parameters. With edrophonium, the program simultaneously fit the fluorescence areas F to the edrophonium concentrations to determine five parameters: the three equilibrium constants (KL, KI, andKL2), fEL, andfEIL, the fluorescence intensity coefficient for the ternary complex. With TMTFA, KI also was fixed, and the program simultaneously fit the time courses of fluorescence emission intensity at 480 nm (F480) to the time after mixing to determine KL,KL2, fEL, andfEIL plus two additional parameters,kI and kI2. A conventional steady state analysis of thioflavin T inhibition of AChE is shown in Fig.2. Increasing concentrations of thioflavin T increase the slopes of the reciprocal plots in Fig.2 A, and a plot of these slopes versus thioflavin T concentration shows a slight curvature (Fig. 2 B), consistent with a nonzero value of α in Equation 1. In the classical equilibrium analysis of Scheme FS1, α is less than 1 when aKS/KS2< 1. However, we have recently shown that a nonequilibrium analysis provides a more accurate interpretation, and in this analysis α is less than 1 when kS2 <kS (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate association rate constantkS2 becomes smaller thankS when the bound peripheral site ligand slows the entry of substrate to the acylation site, an effect we have termed steric blockade. The value of α of 0.05 obtained for thioflavin T here is similar to those found for the prototypic peripheral site inhibitors propidium and gallamine (α = 0.02) (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that with bound thioflavin TkS2/kS is less than 0.05. In addition to demonstrating a substantial steric blockade by thioflavin T, the data in Fig. 2 indicate a competitive inhibition constant KI for thioflavin T of 0.90 μm. To demonstrate that thioflavin T binds to the peripheral site, we measured the ability of two ligands to competitively inhibit thioflavin T binding in a substrate hydrolysis assay (18Camps P. Cusack B. Mallender W.D. El Achab R. Morral J. Muñoz-Torrero D. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar). Propidium is specific for the AChE peripheral site (2Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), whereas edrophonium is specific for the AChE acylation site (10Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), and both inhibited substrate hydrolysis in the absence of thioflavin T, as shown by the open circlesand dashed lines in Fig. 3. If either of these ligands was completely competitive with thioflavin T such that no ternary complex could form, the decrease in ν would correspond to the dotted lines in Fig. 3. This is essentially the case with propidium in Fig. 3 A. The affinity of thioflavin T in the ternary complex decreased by a factor of 35 relative to its affinity in the free enzyme, a large change that was not significantly different from complete competition at the ligand concentrations employed. In contrast, the affinity of thioflavin T was no different in the ternary complex with edrophonium and in the free enzyme, and the fitted line with both inhibitors was superimposed on the dashed line for edrophonium alone in Fig. 3 B. These data indicate that thioflavin T binds to the AChE peripheral site in a fashion that is essentially competitive with propidium. The fluorescence of thioflavin T was strikingly enhanced when it bound to AChE. An excitation peak at 448 nm and an emission peak at 486 nm became apparent, spectral characteristics similar to those of thioflavin T bound to Aβ amyloid (excitation maximum at 448 nm; emission maximum at 480 nm) (also see Ref. 12LeVine III, H. Wetzel R. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1999: 274-284Google Scholar). To appreciate the fluorescence enhancement of thioflavin T when bound to the peripheral site of AChE, we compared it to the fluorescence enhancement observed with propidium bound to AChE. Prior to this report, propidium has been the fluorophore with the best reported fluorescence enhancement with AChE, and it is widely used as a reporter of ligand affinity at the AChE peripheral site (2Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 9Barak D. Ordentlich A. Bromberg A. Kronman C. Marcus D. Lazar A. Ariel N. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15444-15452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Camps P. Cusack B. Mallender W.D. El Achab R. Morral J. Muñoz-Torrero D. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar). However, when AChE was titrated with varying concentrations of the two fluorophores (Fig.4), the fluorescence enhancementfEL/fL for thioflavin T bound to AChE was greater than 1000, whereas that for propidium was about 7 (in agreement with a value of 10 obtained for propidium withTorpedo AChE (19Taylor P. Lwebuga-Mukasa J. Lappi S. Rademacher J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 703-708Google Scholar)). Clearly, thioflavin T will be a more sensitive and versatile fluorescent reporter of ligand interactions with AChE than propidium has been. The titration in Fig. 4 Aalso gave a KD for thioflavin T binding of 0.89 μm, in good agreement with the KIobtained in Fig. 2. Repeating this titration and analysis with a higher fixed concentration of AChE (10 μm) confirmed a 1:1 stoichiometry in the AChE-thioflavin T fluorescent complex (data not shown). Titrations also were conducted with a fixed concentration of thioflavin T (0.2 μm) and varying concentrations of AChE (10 nm–20 μm), and analysis with Equation 3(18Camps P. Cusack B. Mallender W.D. El Achab R. Morral J. Muñoz-Torrero D. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar) again indicated a KD of 0.8–0.9 μm (data not shown). Propidium (100 μm) was strongly competitive with thioflavin T in this titration protocol, because the apparent KD for thioflavin T increased by at least a factor of 50. According to Fig. 3 B, a ternary complex of thioflavin T and edrophonium can form with AChE without a loss in affinity of either ligand for its AChE site. We therefore asked whether the binding of an acylation site ligand altered the fluorescence of bound thioflavin T. We first examined the effect of increasing edrophonium concentrations and observed a decrease in the fluorescence as edrophonium saturated the acylation site (Fig.5). Fitting of the data to Scheme FS2 gave values ofKL for thioflavin T andKI for edrophonium that were in agreement with those from Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and again indicated almost no change in the affinities of these ligands for AChE in the ternary complex (KL2/KL = 1.12 ± 0.02, in agreement withK12/K1 = 1.01 ± 0.05 from Fig. 3 B). However, the binding of edrophonium decreased the fluorescence of thioflavin T in the ternary complex by a factor of 2.8. The observation of this partial quenching of thioflavin T fluorescence is a major advance in the study of AChE for two reasons. First, it allows thioflavin T to be used as a reporter for ligand reactions at the acylation site. Second, it indicates that ligand binding to the acylation site alters the environment or the configuration of thioflavin T bound to the peripheral site, a point that we return to below. To illustrate the first point we examined TMTFA, which forms a hemiketal with Ser-200 in the acylation site that is an analog of the transition state formed by acetylcholine (11Harel M. Quinn D.M. Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 20Brodbeck U. Schweikert K. Gentinetta R. Rottenberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Nair H.K. Lee K. Quinn D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9939-9941Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The high affinity of TMTFA in this complex allows the time course of its binding to be monitored over a wide range of TMTFA concentrations. Fluorescence traces for nine combinations of TMTFA and thioflavin T concentrations were recorded, and three representative reactions are shown in Fig.6. The nine reaction time courses were fitted simultaneously to Scheme FS2 with the SCoP program. Over this range of association rates the TMTFA concentrations were too high to evaluate KI for TMTFA; soKI was fixed at 49 pm as determined previously (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and six remaining parameters were determined. A wealth of information was obtained. First, a KL of 1.0 μm for thioflavin T and an enhancement in fluorescence of bound thioflavin T (fEL/fL) of 1600 were obtained, consistent with data in Figs. 4 and 5. Second, the affinities of thioflavin T and TMTFA in the ternary complex with AChE were at least as high as the affinities in their respective binary complexes (KL2/KL =KI2/KI = 0.56), in agreement with the previous observations for edrophonium in Figs. 3 and5. Third, steric blockade of TMTFA binding by bound thioflavin T was evident (kI/kI2 = 60), although the magnitude of the blockade was somewhat smaller than the nearly 400-fold decrease in association rate constant for TMTFA when propidium was bound to the peripheral site (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, the binding of TMTFA decreased the fluorescence of thioflavin T in the ternary complex by a factor of 4.2. The extent of this quenching appears to be somewhat larger than that observed with edrophonium in Fig. 5, suggesting that the quenching of bound thioflavin T in ternary complexes with AChE may depend on the structure of the acylation site ligand. A quenching smaller than that obtained with either edrophonium or TMTFA was observed when Ser-200 was acylated with a methylethoxyphosphonyl group (data not shown), indicating that the acylation site ligand need not be cationic to quench the fluorescence of bound thioflavin T. The discovery that the fluorescence of the AChE-thioflavin T complex is partially quenched when a ligand binds to the acylation site is of both practical and conceptual importance. In practical terms, this fluorescence change can be monitored to report on reactions at the acylation site. We illustrate this with TMTFA in Fig. 6, but similar protocols should allow the reactions of acylating agents like organophosphates to be measured over time courses as short as milliseconds. Conceptually, the partial quenching on the binding of acylation site ligands is the strongest evidence to date of conformational interaction between the peripheral and acylation sites of AChE. Although such conformational interaction has been widely invoked to account for a range of experimental data, close analysis indicates that previous evidence for such interactions is inconclusive. A frequent assertion is that ligand binding to the peripheral site alters the conformation of the acylation site to reduce the efficiency of acylation or deacylation by substrates. This explanation has been offered to account for inhibition of substrate hydrolysis by peripheral site ligands (9Barak D. Ordentlich A. Bromberg A. Kronman C. Marcus D. Lazar A. Ariel N. Velan B. Shafferman A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15444-15452Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and, when the substrate itself can bind to the peripheral site, for substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations (22Radic Z. Reiner E. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 98-104PubMed Google Scholar). As noted by Taylor and Radic (23Taylor P. Radic Z. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 281-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), ligand association with the peripheral site also may prevent access of a cationic substrate to the acylation site by physically obstructing substrate entry or by charge repulsion between ligand and substrate. Before an allosteric interaction can be invoked, contributions from these other factors must be eliminated. Over the past 3 years, we have demonstrated that bound peripheral site ligands do physically obstruct the entry of substrates as well as of other ligands into the acylation site. Bound propidium decreases the association and dissociation rate constants for the acylation site ligands huperzine A and TMTFA by factors of 10–400. We have termed this effect steric blockade (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shown that similar decreases in the association rate constants for substrates and the dissociation rate constants for the alcohol products of substrate hydrolysis (e.g. thiocholine) are sufficient to account for the inhibition of substrate hydrolysis by peripheral site ligands (4Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as for substrate inhibition (4Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Steric blockade in our terminology is strictly a kinetic effect, and it can have no influence on substrate affinity or hydrolysis by slowly reacting substrates like organophosphates that equilibrate with AChE before acylation. However, 5- to 10-fold decreases in organophosphate affinity for propidium-bound AChE were observed with both a cationic and a neutral organophosphate, indicating an additional type of interaction (6Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7753-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8491-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling calculations indicate that an organophosphate with a large leaving group would overlap with propidium if both ligands were placed in their expected sites in free AChE (13Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8491-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and we have attributed these decreases in affinity to adjustments that accommodate both ligands in the ternary complex (6Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7753-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8491-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Modeling calculations indicate that such steric overlap is not a factor in ternary complexes involving propidium-AChE and either huperzine A or TMTFA; yet ligand affinities in the ternary complexes also are 5- to 7-fold lower than in the corresponding binary complexes (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have suggested that the decreased affinities arise from electrostatic interactions between these cationic ligands (17Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, experimental data indicate that the binding of a peripheral site ligand to AChE can result in steric blockade, steric overlap, and/or electrostatic interaction that inhibits substrate hydrolysis or reduces ligand affinity at the acylation site. With small peripheral site ligands like propidium and gallamine, we see no evidence of an additional allosteric conformational effect that contributes to inhibition. More compelling indications of conformational interaction between the peripheral and acylation sites of AChE have come from two other experimental approaches. First, the spectral properties of a pyrenebutyl methylphosphono group attached to Ser-200 in the acylation site are altered slightly by the binding of gallamine to the peripheral site (24Berman H.A. Becktel W. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The authors attributed these alterations to an increase in polarizability of the pyrenebutyl environment, perhaps due to torsional movements of aromatic side chains in the vicinity of the pyrenebutyl moiety induced by the binding of the peripheral site ligand. Second, bound peripheral site ligands can accelerate the reaction of acylating agents with Ser-200 in the acylation site. Gallamine accelerated the acylation of AChE by dimethylcarbamyl fluoride (25Kitz R.J. Braswell L.M. Ginsburg S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1970; 6: 108-121PubMed Google Scholar), and peripheral site inhibitors including propidium and gallamine increased the first order phosphorylation rate constants for neutral organophosphates with AChE (6Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7753-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8491-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Radic Z. Taylor P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This rate constant reflects the transfer of the organophosphate group to Ser-200 in the binary or ternary complexes (equivalent to k2 andak2, respectively, in Scheme FS1). Before these effects can be attributed to a conformational change in the acylation site induced by ligand binding to the peripheral site, however, other explanations again must be eliminated. Foremost among alternative explanations is steric overlap as denoted above. One of the neutral organophosphates with accelerated first order phosphorylation when propidium is bound was also shown by molecular modeling to bind with AChE in a way that partially overlapped with the propidium binding site (13Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8491-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have argued that movement of the organophosphate to eliminate this overlap in the ternary complex could potentially induce strain in the bond to the organophosphate leaving group and thereby increase the phosphorylation rate constant (6Mallender W.D. Szegletes T. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7753-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In like fashion, preliminary molecular modeling suggests that the pyrenebutyl methylphosphono group attached to Ser-200 is bulky enough to overlap partially with the peripheral site. Although the affinities of gallamine and propidium were similar for this modified AChE and for free AChE, a large thermodynamic interaction between the ligands is not necessary for there to be spectral changes due to the ligand proximity. Steric overlap thus remains a concern when conformational interactions between the peripheral and acylation sites are proposed. However, several pairs of peripheral site ligands and organophosphates (some with quite small leaving groups) showed the acceleration phenomenon (26Radic Z. Taylor P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because steric overlap is unlikely to generate the acceleration in all of these cases, it appears reasonable to infer a conformational change that promotes phosphorylation on ligand binding to the peripheral site. Our data here are the first to indicate that ligand binding to the acylation site can alter the conformation of the peripheral site. The partial quenching of the fluorescence of bound thioflavin T when a ligand binds to the acylation site cannot result from fluorescence resonance energy transfer, because there is no spectral overlap between thioflavin T and either of the acylation site ligands edrophonium or TMTFA. However, the fluorescence of thioflavin T has been shown to depend on solvent viscosity (27Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10223-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), with a relationship previously described for a class of fluorescent dyes called molecular rotors (28Kung C.E. Reed J.K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6114-6121Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar,29Loutfy R.O. Arnold B.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1982; 86: 4205-4211Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These dyes show increased fluorescence when introduced into high viscosity media, due to a decreased torsional relaxation. Binding to the AChE peripheral site could reduce the torsional mobility of thioflavin T and account for its enhanced fluorescence. It is less clear how the binding of an acylation site ligand could partially quench this fluorescence in the ternary complex, but the quenching would appear to require an increase in the torsional mobility of bound thioflavin T induced by a change in the local AChE conformation that is initiated in the acylation site. The exact location of thioflavin T when bound to the AChE peripheral site remains to be determined, but it is unlikely that simple proximity to the acylation site ligand could account for the quenching. Crystal structures of bound edrophonium and bound TMTFA show that both ligands bind near the base of the acylation site, well away from the region that defines the peripheral site (10Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar,11Harel M. Quinn D.M. Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these ligands show no decrease in affinity in their ternary complexes with propidium-AChE, indicating no steric overlap. Ideally, one would like to support this proposed conformational interaction with additional data, but the conformational changes involved appear to be very small. Crystal structures of AChE and the TMTFA-AChE complex show a root mean square deviation of only 0.4 Å between equivalent Cα positions and no changes in the structure of the peripheral site (11Harel M. Quinn D.M. Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance of AChE labeled with a spin-labeled organophosphate at Ser-200 gave no change in signal when propidium was bound to the peripheral site, although a small change was observed with monoclonal antibodies or the neurotoxin fasciculin, both of which bind to a larger surface area extending beyond the peripheral site (30Sentjurc M. Pecar S. Stojan J. Marchot P. Radic Z. Grubic Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the quenching of the fluorescence of AChE-bound thioflavin T by acylation site ligands is the only method to date that is sensitive enough to reveal a conformational interaction between the two sites. This interaction may provide a mechanism for bound peripheral site ligands to accelerate acylation site reactions. We express our gratitude to Samuel Pickett for maintenance of cell cultures and purification of recombinant human AChE and to Dr. Joseph Johnson and Matthew Davies for assistance with TMTFA reactions."

WW domains form a new family of protein-protein interaction modules targeted to proline residues, analogous to the Src homology (SH) 3 domains (5Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar).Based on their proline-rich sequence binding specificities, WW domains are classified into five distinct groups (6Bedford M. Sarbassova D. Xu J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10359-10369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The N-terminal WW domain of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, an essential regulator at mitotic entry, is grouped among class IV domains, which bind peptides containing a proline residue preceded by a phosphoserine or a phosphothreonine (pSer/pThr-Pro motif) (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This latter motif is found in several mitotic Pin1-binding phosphoproteins (8Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the microtubule-associated tau (τ) protein (11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that Pin1 binds phosphoproteins through its N-terminal WW domain and that the binding site mainly implicates the conserved residues Tyr18 and Trp29 (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), which constitute a nearly flat hydrophobic area on the molecular surface of the WW domain. WW domains interacting with the core sequence PPXY, like Yes-associated protein, use the same hydrophobic surface for molecular recognition (3Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.-J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14338-14351Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, this hydrophobic binding site alone is not likely to explain the phospho-dependent character of the ligand binding to the Pin1 WW domain.Recently the x-ray crystal structure of the full Pin1 protein bound to a doubly phosphorylated peptide (YpSPTpSPS) from the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II was reported (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The protein-peptide interactions are essentially limited to two regions on the WW domain surface. First, a phosphate binding pocket, encompassing the side chains of Ser11, Arg12, and the backbone amide of Arg12, anchors the interacting phosphate moiety via several hydrogen bonds. Second, the aromatic pair Tyr18-Trp29 forms a molecular clamp that constrains the proline at position +1 of the interacting phosphoserine. The peptide ligand binds to the Pin1 WW domain in a N- to C-terminal orientation, in contrast to the C- to N-terminal orientation that is found for two other proline-rich peptides in complex with a group I WW domain (3Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Other proline recognition domains, such as the SH3 domain of the Caenorhabditis elegans signaling adaptor protein Sem5, can bind peptidic ligands in both orientations (15Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It therefore remains an open question whether the group IV WW domain of Pin1 is capable of binding different ligands in different orientations or whether a unique orientation is preferred.Furthermore it is of major interest to consider the conformation of the recognized motif and, more specifically, the isomerization state of the peptide bond in the pSer/pThr-Pro motif. In the crystal structure of Pin1 complex (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the peptide ligand binds with both pSer-Pro peptide bonds in trans conformation. The cis conformation of the peptide would require major rearrangements of the binding site and is therefore not very probable. However, for a related adaptor module, the 14-3-3 domain, a recent crystallography study showed that peptide substrates can be bound with both isomerization states (cis and trans) (16Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).Here we have investigated by solution NMR the binding interactions between a synthetic Pin1 WW domain and two biologically relevant monophosphorylated substrates, a Cdc25 peptide model (EQPLpTPVTDL) and a peptide of the τ protein (KVSVVRpTPPKSPS). Based on the structures of both complexes in solution, we found a similar binding mode as the one observed in the crystal structure of Pin1 bound to a peptide isolated from the CTD of RNA polymerase II (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This observation gives experimental evidence to a unique binding scheme for Pin1 WW domain to its multiple substrates. Finally, we found the bound peptides to be in a trans conformation and discuss the implication of this aspect in regard of recent data concerning Pin1 molecular function (17Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe reversible protein phosphorylation on Ser/Thr-Pro motifs acts as an important molecular switch in the cell cycle and is operated by a number of Pro-directed protein kinases (such as Cdc2, Cdk2, Wee1, and Myt1; for a review, see Ref. 33Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar) and phosphatases, such as Cdc25 and PP2A (34Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 35Karaiskou A. Jessus C. Brassac T. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3747-3756PubMed Google Scholar). Although atomic level structural data of all substrates in their phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated state are still lacking, one example of the structural influence of phosphorylation is given by Cdk2 itself, where addition of a phosphate group on the Thr160 side chain completes the reorganization of the substrate binding site that was started by cyclin binding (36Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A second mechanism of imposing structural changes is brought about by the isomerization of the prolyl peptide bond, and a prolylcis/trans isomerase, Pin1, has been shown to be essential to achieve a cell cycle (37Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 38Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A remarkable fact of both Cdk2 and Pin1 is that they associate with small binding modules that are believed to help targeting the catalytic domain more efficiently to their substrates. Cdk2 recruits the CKS, that indeed binds through its anion binding site to the pThr-Pro motif of a Cdc25 peptide (39Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas human Pin1 contains in its sequence itself already such a binding protein, the WW domain (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 37Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Both functional (40Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and structural (39Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) data indicated a molecular competition of both of binding modules for the same Cdc25 substrate, and this competition indeed might be part of the tight regulation of the cell cycle.In a related cellular process, both Cdk2 and Pin1 interact with the τ protein. Cdk2 phosphorylates τ proteins, in an Alzheimer-like way, leading to microtubule depolymerization (41Baumann K. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Piwnica-Worms H. Mandelkow E. FEBS lett. 1993; 336: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Conversely, Pin1 can restore the tubulin polymerization function of these hyperphosphorylated τ before they aggregate into filaments in Alzheimer neuronal tangles (11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). τ contains about 17 Thr/Ser-Pro motifs, which can all be phosphorylated in the cellular context (42Delacourte A. Buée L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amazingly, however, only the τ pThr131-Pro132motif was found to be recognized by Pin1, with a high affinity of 40 nm (11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). This unusual high affinity for a binding module was not confirmed by our NMR titration data, because we obtained similar dissociation equilibrium constants in the order of 100 μm for both Cdc25 and τ ligands. Except for differences in methodology, the reason for these differences inK d values could be due to the fact that we used the isolated WW in our binding experiments, instead of the full-length PIN1. An NMR titration on WW domain-τ peptide samples without 100 mm NaCl yielded an increase of binding affinity (K d = 29 μm), stressing the importance of ionic strength on the binding affinity of Pin1 related WW domains. Still, considering the ionic concentration in the cell, our calculatedK d appears more relevant, and confirms that the interaction of Pin1 with Cdc25 and τ are related molecular processes.Despite the reported selectivity of Pin1, we found that both Cdc25 and τ phosphopeptides bind to Pin1 WW domains in a similar manner, close to the described binding pattern in the CTD peptide-Pin1 x-ray model (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, the crystal complex of the CTD peptide-Pin1 protein shows a larger contact surface between protein and ligand than what was observed in our NMR models. The anchoring zone of the Cdc25 and τ peptide ligands to the WW domain was only composed of the phospho-residue and residues +1 and +2 (Figs. 5 and 6). We did not observe any significant interaction with the Tyr18 of the WW domain, neither in the chemical shift perturbation assay, nor by the observation of intermolecular NOEs.The three-dimensional NMR complex model shows that the phosphopeptide ligands are principally fixed by a charge-charge interaction and a proline-aromatic stacking. The participation of the backbone amide group in complexation of the phosphate moiety could explain partly why the mutant Arg12 → Ala persists to fix ligand. The same argument could help to interpret the phosphopeptide binding properties of other Pin1-related WW domains, such as Nedd4 or Rsp5 proteins, that lack a basic residue in the β1-β2 loop. In addition, it must be stressed that the intermolecular stacking structure between Trp29 and the proline at position +1 of pThr ligand is analogous to the intramolecular stacking between conserved residues Trp6 and Pro32 of domain WW (Fig. 6). Because several mutagenesis studies (10Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 43Koepf E.K. Petrassi H.M. Sudol M.

Biol. 2000; 7: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have established the importance of the Trp6-Pro32 interaction for the folding and the stability of WW domains, we think that a similar strong intermolecular Trp-Pro interaction is used to promote protein-protein interactions between the WW domain and its substrates (46Shoemaker B.A. Portman J.J. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8868-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms of the Pin1 function very recently became clearer through an elegant study by Zhou et al. (17Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), who showed that Pin1 enhances in vitro the dephosphorylation of Cdc25C by the major transPro-directed phosphatase PP2A. Moreover, they showed that overexpression of the catalytic domain alone can be sufficient for cell survival, whereas at lower levels of expression this is not the case (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, Pin1 would catalyze the conversion of the cis bond in the pThr-Pro motif of Cdc25C, turning the peptide into a suitable substrate of PP2A. Although direct evidence of such a cis peptide bond in the complete Cdc25 or τ lacks, their biochemical evidence that Pin1 up-regulates the dephosphorylation of both Cdc25 and τ convincingly sustains this hypothesis. However, the results of our NMR study unambiguously define the pThr-transPro motif in both Cdc25 and τ peptide ligands as the binding surface recognized by the Pin1 WW domain, in agreement with the earlier crystal structure of full Pin1 with a doubly phosphorylated CTD peptide (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Moreover, because our NMR results confirm the absence of interaction between the Pro residue in the cis conformation and the WW domain, it is unlikely that the latter would assist the catalytic domain by targetting it to its pThr/Ser-cisPro substrate, be it on Cdc25, τ or other protein targets.The available data can be combined into several scenarios. The WW domain could specifically target Pin1 to the pThr231 of τ or pThr47 and pThr68 of Cdc25, followed by isomerization of neighboring pThr-Pro bonds through the catalytic domain (47Zhou X.Z. Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Lu K.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In another scenario, the catalytic domain could induce the conformational transition from cis to trans of the pThr-Pro motif prior to any WW binding. Before a return to thecis/trans equilibrium situation, the WW domain could then immediately bind to the pThr-trans conformation, thereby stabilizing this conformation and simultaneously increasing the local concentration of Pin1. Both scenarios solve the dilemma that the WW domain has an at least 10-fold higher affinity as does the catalytic domain for the same substrates (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and, consequently, would bind first to the epitope before catalysis could happen. Further studies will be necessary to investigate this possibility of prolylcis/trans isomerization anterior to WW binding. Trp-Trp (WW1) domains are compact modules of 38–40 amino acids long, folded into a three-stranded β sheet, and found in single or tandem repeats in over 25 unrelated cell-signaling proteins (1Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 2Staub O. Rotin D.

WW domains form a new family of protein-protein interaction modules targeted to proline residues, analogous to the Src homology (SH) 3 domains (5Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Based on their proline-rich sequence binding specificities, WW domains are classified into five distinct groups (6Bedford M.

The N-terminal WW domain of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, an essential regulator at mitotic entry, is grouped among class IV domains, which bind peptides containing a proline residue preceded by a phosphoserine or a phosphothreonine (pSer/pThr-Pro motif) (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This latter motif is found in several mitotic Pin1-binding phosphoproteins (8Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), including the mitotic phosphatase Cdc25 (9Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 10Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the microtubule-associated tau (τ) protein (11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that Pin1 binds phosphoproteins through its N-terminal WW domain and that the binding site mainly implicates the conserved residues Tyr18 and Trp29 (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), which constitute a nearly flat hydrophobic area on the molecular surface of the WW domain. WW domains interacting with the core sequence PPXY, like Yes-associated protein, use the same hydrophobic surface for molecular recognition (3Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.-J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14338-14351Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, this hydrophobic binding site alone is not likely to explain the phospho-dependent character of the ligand binding to the Pin1 WW domain. Recently the x-ray crystal structure of the full Pin1 protein bound to a doubly phosphorylated peptide (YpSPTpSPS) from the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II was reported (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The protein-peptide interactions are essentially limited to two regions on the WW domain surface. First, a phosphate binding pocket, encompassing the side chains of Ser11, Arg12, and the backbone amide of Arg12, anchors the interacting phosphate moiety via several hydrogen bonds. Second, the aromatic pair Tyr18-Trp29 forms a molecular clamp that constrains the proline at position +1 of the interacting phosphoserine. The peptide ligand binds to the Pin1 WW domain in a N- to C-terminal orientation, in contrast to the C- to N-terminal orientation that is found for two other proline-rich peptides in complex with a group I WW domain (3Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Other proline recognition domains, such as the SH3 domain of the Caenorhabditis elegans signaling adaptor protein Sem5, can bind peptidic ligands in both orientations (15Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It therefore remains an open question whether the group IV WW domain of Pin1 is capable of binding different ligands in different orientations or whether a unique orientation is preferred. Furthermore it is of major interest to consider the conformation of the recognized motif and, more specifically, the isomerization state of the peptide bond in the pSer/pThr-Pro motif. In the crystal structure of Pin1 complex (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the peptide ligand binds with both pSer-Pro peptide bonds in trans conformation. The cis conformation of the peptide would require major rearrangements of the binding site and is therefore not very probable. However, for a related adaptor module, the 14-3-3 domain, a recent crystallography study showed that peptide substrates can be bound with both isomerization states (cis and trans) (16Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated by solution NMR the binding interactions between a synthetic Pin1 WW domain and two biologically relevant monophosphorylated substrates, a Cdc25 peptide model (EQPLpTPVTDL) and a peptide of the τ protein (KVSVVRpTPPKSPS). Based on the structures of both complexes in solution, we found a similar binding mode as the one observed in the crystal structure of Pin1 bound to a peptide isolated from the CTD of RNA polymerase II (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This observation gives experimental evidence to a unique binding scheme for Pin1 WW domain to its multiple substrates. Finally, we found the bound peptides to be in a trans conformation and discuss the implication of this aspect in regard of recent data concerning Pin1 molecular function (17Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe reversible protein phosphorylation on Ser/Thr-Pro motifs acts as an important molecular switch in the cell cycle and is operated by a number of Pro-directed protein kinases (such as Cdc2, Cdk2, Wee1, and Myt1; for a review, see Ref. 33Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar) and phosphatases, such as Cdc25 and PP2A (34Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 35Karaiskou A. Jessus C. Brassac T. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3747-3756PubMed Google Scholar). Although atomic level structural data of all substrates in their phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated state are still lacking, one example of the structural influence of phosphorylation is given by Cdk2 itself, where addition of a phosphate group on the Thr160 side chain completes the reorganization of the substrate binding site that was started by cyclin binding (36Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A second mechanism of imposing structural changes is brought about by the isomerization of the prolyl peptide bond, and a prolylcis/trans isomerase, Pin1, has been shown to be essential to achieve a cell cycle (37Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 38Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A remarkable fact of both Cdk2 and Pin1 is that they associate with small binding modules that are believed to help targeting the catalytic domain more efficiently to their substrates. Cdk2 recruits the CKS, that indeed binds through its anion binding site to the pThr-Pro motif of a Cdc25 peptide (39Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas human Pin1 contains in its sequence itself already such a binding protein, the WW domain (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 37Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Both functional (40Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and structural (39Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) data indicated a molecular competition of both of binding modules for the same Cdc25 substrate, and this competition indeed might be part of the tight regulation of the cell cycle.In a related cellular process, both Cdk2 and Pin1 interact with the τ protein. Cdk2 phosphorylates τ proteins, in an Alzheimer-like way, leading to microtubule depolymerization (41Baumann K. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Piwnica-Worms H. Mandelkow E. FEBS lett. 1993; 336: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Conversely, Pin1 can restore the tubulin polymerization function of these hyperphosphorylated τ before they aggregate into filaments in Alzheimer neuronal tangles (11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). τ contains about 17 Thr/Ser-Pro motifs, which can all be phosphorylated in the cellular context (42Delacourte A. Buée L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amazingly, however, only the τ pThr131-Pro132motif was found to be recognized by Pin1, with a high affinity of 40 nm (11Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). This unusual high affinity for a binding module was not confirmed by our NMR titration data, because we obtained similar dissociation equilibrium constants in the order of 100 μm for both Cdc25 and τ ligands. Except for differences in methodology, the reason for these differences inK d values could be due to the fact that we used the isolated WW in our binding experiments, instead of the full-length PIN1. An NMR titration on WW domain-τ peptide samples without 100 mm NaCl yielded an increase of binding affinity (K d = 29 μm), stressing the importance of ionic strength on the binding affinity of Pin1 related WW domains. Still, considering the ionic concentration in the cell, our calculatedK d appears more relevant, and confirms that the interaction of Pin1 with Cdc25 and τ are related molecular processes.Despite the reported selectivity of Pin1, we found that both Cdc25 and τ phosphopeptides bind to Pin1 WW domains in a similar manner, close to the described binding pattern in the CTD peptide-Pin1 x-ray model (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, the crystal complex of the CTD peptide-Pin1 protein shows a larger contact surface between protein and ligand than what was observed in our NMR models. The anchoring zone of the Cdc25 and τ peptide ligands to the WW domain was only composed of the phospho-residue and residues +1 and +2 (Figs. 5 and 6). We did not observe any significant interaction with the Tyr18 of the WW domain, neither in the chemical shift perturbation assay, nor by the observation of intermolecular NOEs.The three-dimensional NMR complex model shows that the phosphopeptide ligands are principally fixed by a charge-charge interaction and a proline-aromatic stacking. The participation of the backbone amide group in complexation of the phosphate moiety could explain partly why the mutant Arg12 → Ala persists to fix ligand. The same argument could help to interpret the phosphopeptide binding properties of other Pin1-related WW domains, such as Nedd4 or Rsp5 proteins, that lack a basic residue in the β1-β2 loop. In addition, it must be stressed that the intermolecular stacking structure between Trp29 and the proline at position +1 of pThr ligand is analogous to the intramolecular stacking between conserved residues Trp6 and Pro32 of domain WW (Fig. 6). Because several mutagenesis studies (10Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 43Koepf E.K. Petrassi H.M. Sudol M. Kelly J.W. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 841-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 44Crane J.C. Koepf E.K. Kelly J.W. Gruebele M. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 7: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have established the importance of the Trp6-Pro32 interaction for the folding and the stability of WW domains, we think that a similar strong intermolecular Trp-Pro interaction is used to promote protein-protein interactions between the WW domain and its substrates (46Shoemaker B.A. Portman J.J. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8868-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms of the Pin1 function very recently became clearer through an elegant study by Zhou et al. (17Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), who showed that Pin1 enhances in vitro the dephosphorylation of Cdc25C by the major transPro-directed phosphatase PP2A. Moreover, they showed that overexpression of the catalytic domain alone can be sufficient for cell survival, whereas at lower levels of expression this is not the case (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, Pin1 would catalyze the conversion of the cis bond in the pThr-Pro motif of Cdc25C, turning the peptide into a suitable substrate of PP2A. Although direct evidence of such a cis peptide bond in the complete Cdc25 or τ lacks, their biochemical evidence that Pin1 up-regulates the dephosphorylation of both Cdc25 and τ convincingly sustains this hypothesis. However, the results of our NMR study unambiguously define the pThr-transPro motif in both Cdc25 and τ peptide ligands as the binding surface recognized by the Pin1 WW domain, in agreement with the earlier crystal structure of full Pin1 with a doubly phosphorylated CTD peptide (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Moreover, because our NMR results confirm the absence of interaction between the Pro residue in the cis conformation and the WW domain, it is unlikely that the latter would assist the catalytic domain by targetting it to its pThr/Ser-cisPro substrate, be it on Cdc25, τ or other protein targets.The available data can be combined into several scenarios. The WW domain could specifically target Pin1 to the pThr231 of τ or pThr47 and pThr68 of Cdc25, followed by isomerization of neighboring pThr-Pro bonds through the catalytic domain (47Zhou X.Z. Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Lu K.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In another scenario, the catalytic domain could induce the conformational transition from cis to trans of the pThr-Pro motif prior to any WW binding. Before a return to thecis/trans equilibrium situation, the WW domain could then immediately bind to the pThr-trans conformation, thereby stabilizing this conformation and simultaneously increasing the local concentration of Pin1. Both scenarios solve the dilemma that the WW domain has an at least 10-fold higher affinity as does the catalytic domain for the same substrates (7Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and, consequently, would bind first to the epitope before catalysis could happen. Further studies will be necessary to investigate this possibility of prolylcis/trans isomerization anterior to WW binding. The reversible protein phosphorylation on Ser/Thr-Pro motifs acts as an important molecular switch in the cell cycle and is operated by a number of Pro-directed protein kinases (such as Cdc2, Cdk2, Wee1, and Myt1; for a review, see Ref. 33Morgan D.O.

Further studies will be necessary to investigate this possibility of prolylcis/trans isomerization anterior to WW binding. We thank A. Kasprowiak, J.-S. Fruchart, and C. Smet for peptide synthesis.

Here, we identified a molecular interaction between Asp633 in transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and Asn674 in TM7 of the TSHr that is crucial to maintain the inactive state through conformational constraint of the Asn. We show that these residues are perfectly conserved in the glycohormone receptor family, except in one case, where they are exchanged, suggesting a direct interaction. Molecular modeling of the TSHr, based on the high resolution structure of rhodopsin, strongly favors this hypothesis. Our approach combining site-directed mutagenesis with molecular modeling shows that mutations disrupting this interaction, like the D633A mutation in TM6, lead to high constitutive activation. The strongly activating N674D (TM7) mutation, which in our modeling breaks the TM6-TM7 link, is reverted to wild type-like behavior by an additional D633N mutation (TM6), which would restore this link. Moreover, we show that the Asn of TM7 (conserved in most G protein-coupled receptors) is mandatory for ligand-induced cAMP accumulation, suggesting an active role of this residue in activation. In the TSHr, the conformation of this Asn residue of TM7 would be constrained, in the inactive state, by its Asp partner in TM6.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11874-11880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These ectodomains are made essentially of leucine-rich repeats, a protein fold frequently found to be involved in protein-protein interactions (3Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The serpentine portion of these receptors, responsible for signal transduction, comprises seven transmembrane helices, showing significant similarity with the transmembrane portions of rhodopsin-like GPCRs; they are therefore grouped with them into family 1 of GPCRs. The glycohormone receptors thus present a clear dichotomy between the agonist-binding and signal-transduction domains, with the mechanism of interaction between the two domains, responsible for receptor function, remaining largely unknown. Sequences displaying strong similarities with the glycohormone receptors have been identified inAnthopleura elegantissima, Drosophila, andCaenorhabditis elegans (6Hauser F. Nothacker H.P.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Related receptors have also been discovered in mammals (10Hsu S.Y. Liang S.G. Hsueh A.J. Mol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). But for all of these cases, the nature of the agonists remains to be identified. Several characteristics make the TSH receptor an interesting system to study the mechanisms of receptor activation: (i) the wild type receptor has been shown to display significant basal activity (12Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 13Duprez L. Parma J. Van Sande J. Allgeier A.

Shenker A. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24153-24156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) mutations involving more than 20 different residues have been shown to increase its constitutive activity, causing autonomous thyroid adenomas or non-autoimmune hereditary hyperthyroidism (15Refetoff S.

McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 4029-4076Google Scholar); (iii) loss of function mutations have also been described, abolishing basal activity (16Biebermann H. Schoneberg T. Schulz A. Krause G. Gruters A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or affecting agonist-induced response (17Sunthornthepvarakui T. Gottschalk M.E. Hayashi Y. Refetoff S.

Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 4229-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, naturally occurring activating mutations are more rarely found in the LH/CGr (19Themmen A.P.N. Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 551-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and almost never found the FSHr (20Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Indeed, no spontaneous activating mutation has been identified in the FSH receptor except for a single case with an unusual phenotype (21Gromoll J. Simoni M. Nieschlag E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1367-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These data reflect a difference in the structural constraints keeping the various glycoprotein hormone receptors in the inactive state. The wild type TSH receptor displaying constitutive activity and being easily activated by mutations would be the less constrained, followed by the LH receptor, devoid of constitutive activity but susceptible to activation by mutations. The FSH receptor would be the most constrained, as it is silent in the absence of stimulation by agonist and difficult to activate by mutations. The high resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin determined recently (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T.I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5033) Google Scholar) provides for the first time a detailed atomic description of a GPCR molecule in an inactive conformation, and represents a solid basis for modeling the structures of other rhodopsin-like GPCRs. Such models can then be used to help rationalize the many observations made on the relations between conserved sequence feature and functional properties. Conservation of functionally important sequence motifs within this receptor family has been interpreted as meaning that the basic characteristics of the rhodopsin fold, as well as the molecular mechanisms leading to receptor activation are similar in the different receptor subtypes. Among such conserved sequence motifs are prolines in transmembrane helices (TM) 6 and 7 and charged residues in TM2 and TM3 (the Asp and Arg of the canonical “DRY” motif). However, considering the extreme diversity of the natural agonists of the different receptors it has also been accepted that different receptor subtypes may have evolved quite specific structural and functional features, probably reflected in the specific sequence signatures of each subtype. Multiple alignments of the glycohormone receptor sequences reveal one such signature: a conserved Asp residue in TM6 at position6.44 633 (corresponding to residue 633 in the TSHr sequence; see “Experimental Procedures”). Most other GPCRs harbor a Phe or a Tyr at this position. Natural mutations of residue6.44 633 in the TSHr and LH/CGr were shown to lead to constitutive activation, causing autonomous toxic thyroid adenomas (12Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) and male limited pseudoprecocious puberty (23Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), respectively. This suggested that D6.44 633 might play a role in the mechanism of receptor activation. Recent ex vivo transfection studies suggested that this residue is important for maintaining the inactive conformation of the LH receptor (24Angelova K. Narayan P. Simon J.P. Puett D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in agreement with earlier molecular modeling studies, according to which the inactive form of the LH receptor would require the formation of H-bonds between TM6 and TM7, involving residues Thr6.43, Asp6.44, Asn7.45, and Asn7.49(25Lin Z. Shenker A. Pearlstein R. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the multiple alignments of 44 glycohormone and closely related receptors. This lead to the observation that residues D6.44 and N7.49 (the Asn of the conserved NPXXY motif in TM7) are both conserved in glycohormone receptors, except in one of two Drosophilareceptors (6Hauser F. Nothacker H.P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1002-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), where they are exchanged (this receptor bearing N6.44 and D7.49). Since such coordinated mutations may reflect spatial interactions between the residues (26Chelvanayagam G. Eggenschwiler A. Knecht L. Gonnet G.H. Benner S.A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,27Larson S.M. Di Nardo A.A. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), our observation was interpreted as indicating the existence of an interaction between D6.44 and N7.49. Considering the activating effect of amino acid substitutions at position6.44, we formulate the hypothesis that this interaction is required in order to maintain the TSH receptor in an inactive conformation. We then investigated this hypothesis by combining computational and experimental approaches. Molecular modeling techniques were used to derive the atomic coordinates of the transmembrane region of the TSHr, using as template the corresponding region of the high resolution structure of rhodopsin. To analyze the conformational properties of residues 6.44and 7.49 and their surroundings in the resulting model, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in the presence of explicit methane molecules, mimicking the non-polar environment of the membrane. This was done for both the wt receptor and for several substitution mutants of residues that are likely to affect the proposed interaction. In parallel, the same mutants were engineered into human TSHr using site-directed mutagenesis and their effects on receptor expression, hormone binding, and activation were measured. The results provide compelling evidence that D6.44 and N7.49 do interact in the inactive TSHr and that disruption of this interaction, by mutating either the 6.44 or the7.49 residues, results in constitutive activation. Furthermore, combining our observations with data from other GPCRs is shown to yield new insights into the general mechanism of GPCR activation The standardized numbering system of Ballesteros and Weinstein (28Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2471) Google Scholar) was used throughout to identify residues in the transmembrane segments of different receptors. Each residue is identified by two numbers: the first (1 through 7) corresponds to the helix in which it is located; the second indicates its position relative to the most conserved residue in that helix, arbitrarily assigned to 50. For instance, N7.49 is the asparagine in transmembrane helix 7 (TM7), located 1 residue before the highly conserved proline P7.50. Residue D2.50corresponds to Asp460 in the TSHr numbering; S3.36 to Ser505; S3.39 to Ser508; T6.43 to Thr632; D6.44 to Asp633; N7.45 to Asn670, and N7.49 to Asn674. The atomic model of the transmembrane domain of the TSHr was built by comparative modeling techniques, using as template the atomic coordinates of the transmembrane domain of bovine rhodopsin (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T.I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5033) Google Scholar). The sequences of the 2 proteins in this region were aligned so as to equivalence the positions of the following conserved residues: Asn55-Asn1.50 432 (the superscripts represent the residue numbering in rhodopsin structure PDB code 1F88, and human TSHr sequence, respectively, and 1.50 is the numbering in the standardized nomenclature), Asp83-Asp2.50 460, Arg135-Arg3.50 519, Trp161-Trp4.50 546, Pro215-N5.50 590, Pro267-Pro6.50 639, and Pro303-Pro7.50 675. The conformations of these side chains were kept as in the rhodopsin crystal structure. Those of the non-conserved amino acids were built using a rotamer library specific for α-helices. (29McGregor M.J. Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 20 (; 295–310): 198Google Scholar). Ionizable groups in the helices were modeled as uncharged except for Asp2.50, Glu3.37, Glu3.49, Arg3.50, Asp6.30, and Asp6.44. To relieve residual strain resulting from suboptimal positioning of the side chains, the resulting model was first subjected to energy minimization (1000 steps), and then to a simulated annealing procedure, using molecular dynamics. This involved heating to 600 K for 30 ps (1 ps = 10−12 s), equilibration for 120 ps at 600 K, cooling to 300 K for 60 ps, and equilibration for 90 ps at 300 K. During this processes the Cα atoms and the side chains of conserved residues were kept fixed at their positions in the rhodopsin crystal structure. Molecular models for the mutant receptors containing the single substitutions D6.44N, D6.44A, N7.49D, and N7.49A and double substitution D6.44N-N7.45D and D6.44N-N7.49D, were built using, as the starting point the final model derived for the wt TSHr and optimizing the conformations of the substituted side chains using an analogous procedure to that described above. This procedure was deemed reasonable, since the considered substitutions were either isosteric, replacement of Asn by Asp, or vice versa, or side chain deletion (replacement by Ala). To investigate the structural properties of the modeled conformations, room temperature molecular dynamics simulations were used. In order to mimic the hydrophobic environment of the membrane, these simulations were carried out in the presence of explicit methane molecules, and using periodic boundary conditions. The periodic box was ∼73 Å × 63 Å × 52 Å in size, and contained between 4219 and 4241 methane molecules in addition to the transmembrane domain. Similar conditions have been recently used to mimic the membrane environment in molecular dynamics simulations of the potassium channel (30Aqvist J. Luzhkov V. Nature. 2000; 20 (, 881–884): 404Google Scholar). To start the simulation protein portion was kept fixed while the methane molecules were energy minimized (500 steps), then heated to 300 K for 15 ps and equilibrated for another 35 ps. Following this, the same procedure was repeated on the entire protein-solvent system but with an equilibration run of 250 ps; a 250 ps production trajectory was then generated at constant volume using the Particle Mesh Ewald method for computing electrostatic interactions (31Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20940) Google Scholar). For analysis purposes, structures were collected every 2 ps. The simulations were performed with the Sander module of AMBER 5 (32Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J. Crowley M. Ferguson D.M. Radmer R.J. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER5. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar), the all-atom force field (33Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11569) Google Scholar), SHAKE bond constraints on all bonds, a 2 fs integration time step, and constant temperature of 300 K coupled to a heat bath. Plasmids encoding the various TSHr mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using two subsequent PCR amplifications rounds. This procedure requires two partially overlapping complementary primers containing the mutation and two external primers. Two distinct PCRs are performed on TSHr template by using in one tube the direct mutagenic primer and the external reverse primer and in the other tube the reverse mutagenic primer and the external direct primer. One μl of each PCR product was mixed and used as template in a subsequent PCR amplification with the two external primers. The resulting amplified fragment contains the mutation and can be cloned after digestion withBsu36I and BamHI into the pSVL expression vector (Amersham Pharmarcia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) containing the wild type TSHr (34Libert F. Lefort A. Gerard C. Parmentier M. Perret J. Ludgate M. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1250-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) using standard procedures. All PCR-generated receptor fragments were verified by sequencing before transfection. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml). Cells were seeded at a density of 150,000 or 300,000 cells/3-cm dish. One day later, they were transfected (250 or 500 ng of DNA/dish, respectively) by the DEAE-dextran method followed by a dimethyl sulfoxide shock (35Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Hermans J. Rocmans P. Van Vliet G. Costagliola S. Rodien P. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 2695-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were used for flow immunocytofluorometry, cAMP and 125I-TSH binding studies. Duplicate dishes were used for each assay. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Cells transfected with pSVL alone were always run as controls. Cells were detached from the plates with phosphate-buffered saline containing EDTA and EGTA (5 mm each) and transferred into Falcon tubes (2052). Cells were centrifuged at 500 × g, at 4 °C for 3 min and the supernatant was removed by inversion. They were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin (0.1%) containing the BA8 monoclonal antibody, obtained from genetic immunization with the wild type TSH receptor cDNA (36Costagliola S. Rodien P. Many M.C. Ludgate M. Vassart G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1458-1465PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed with 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin (0.1%) and centrifuged as above. They were incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark with fluoresceine-conjugated γ-chain-specific goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in the same buffer. Propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) was used for detection of damaged cells which were excluded from the analysis. Cells were washed once again and resuspended in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin (0.1%). The fluorescence of 10,000 cells per tube was assayed by a FACScan Flow Cytofluorometer (Beckton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium). Cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (KRH isotonic, pH 7.4). After a preincubation in KRH at 37 °C for 30 min, cells were incubated in the same buffer supplemented with Rolipram 25 μm (a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, gift from the laboratory of J. Logeais, Paris, France), in the absence or presence of various bTSH concentrations (Sigma). One hour later, the medium was removed and 0.1 m HCl was added to the cells. The cellular extracts were dried overnight in a vacuum concentrator (Savant) and intracellular cAMP was determined exactly as described previously (37Van Sande J. Parma J. Tonacchera M. Swillens S. Dumont J. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2577-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal cAMP was normalized to cell surface expression for each of the constructs. To this end, specific cAMP accumulation (= cAMP of receptor-transfected cells − cAMP of the pSVL-transfected cells) is divided by the specific FACS value (= fluorescence of receptor-transfected cells − fluorescence of pSVL-transfected cells), which can be summarized as: specific basal activity = (cAMP(receptor) −cAMP(pSVL))/(FACS(receptor) − FACS (pSVL)). The values are then expressed as percentage of specific basal activity of the wt TSHr. Two days after transfection, cells were washed twice with NaCl-free Hank's buffer supplemented with 280 mm sucrose. Cells were incubated at room temperature in this medium (supplemented with low fat milk, 2.5%) containing about 100,000 counts/ml 125I-TSH (TRAK Assays, BRAHMS Diagnostica, Berlin; 58 μCi/μg, 50–60 units/mg) and various concentrations of unlabeled TSH (Sigma). Four hours later, the cells were rinsed twice with chilled Hank's buffer and solubilized by 1n NaOH. Bound radioactivity was determined in a γ-scintillation counter. Under our conditions, the radioactivity nonspecifically bound to COS cells expressing the TSH receptor (defined as the radioactivity bound to the dish in the presence of 100 milliunits/ml unlabeled TSH) was identical to that bound to mock-transfected cells. In the absence of a consensus about the bioactivity of pure bovine TSH, we have expressed all TSH or TSH receptor concentrations in milliunits/ml, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for TSH binding to its receptor. The competition binding curves have been fitted by nonlinear regression, assuming a single receptor site, using the Prism3 program (GraphPad Softwares). Multiple sequence alignment of the sixth and seventh transmembrane helices of 44 glycohormone and closely related receptors was performed. Fig. 1 shows the alignment of representative sequences, together with that of bovine rhodopsin. Inspection of this alignment reveals two key sequence motifs characteristic of the rhodopsin-like family: the P6.50 in TM6 and the NPXXY motif in TM7. A noteworthy difference is the presence of Asp at position 6.44 instead of the more common Phe or Tyr, which represent more than 81% of the rhodopsin-like receptors found in the GPCRDB (38Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M.W. Horsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen O. Campagne F. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). D6.44 is completely conserved throughout the glycohormone family of GPCR, from C. elegans to human, with only a single exception, theDrosophila DLGR1 sequence (accession number U47005 (6Hauser F. Nothacker H.P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1002-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)), which contains an Asn residue. Interestingly, this change is correlated with the replacement of the highly conserved Asn at position7.49 by Asp. Swapped mutations of this kind suggest interaction between the corresponding residues in the three-dimensional structures (26Chelvanayagam G. Eggenschwiler A. Knecht L. Gonnet G.H. Benner S.A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Larson S.M. Di Nardo A.A. Davidson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We could indeed verify that in the rhodopsin structure, the Cα of Phe6.44 and Asn7.49 (the conserved N of the NPXXY motif) were facing each other at a distance of 11 Å, sufficient to allow direct interaction between the side chains. Given that a series of amino acid substitutions at D6.44 found in thyroid adenomas result in a significant increase in the constitutive activity of the TSHr, we then made the hypothesis that interactions between the D6.44 and N7.49 side chains are important in maintaining the receptor in its inactive conformation. In order to investigate the proposed interaction between D6.44 and N7.49 in the context of the entire helix bundle, the molecular model of the transmembrane domain of the TSHr was built, based on the high-resolution structure of bovine rhodopsin. This model was then subjected to unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of explicit methane molecules mimicking the apolar membrane environment (see “Experimental Procedures”). Having ascertained that the helical segments conserved their secondary structure and that the bundle remained well packed and maintained the rhodopsin fold throughout the trajectory, we analyzed the polar interactions made between TM6 and TM7. In particular, we computed the average hydrogen-acceptor distances in conformations along the trajectory, and the fraction of the conformations in which the bond was formed. All throughout the simulation D6.44 and N7.49were seen to form a hydrogen bond between the D6.44Oδ1 and N7.49 Nδ2H atoms, with an average O-H distance of 1.9 Å (see Fig.2 for a representative structure). The TM6-TM7 interaction involved in addition a more complex hydrogen bond network. N7.45, located one helix turn prior to N7.49, formed 2 H-bonds. One, with D6.44(Nδ27.45 H-Oδ26.44; average distance 2.0 Å) and another with N7.49(Nδ27.45 H-Oδ17.49; average distance of 1.9 Å). The hydrogen bond between D6.44and N7.45, thus provides a second polar interaction between TM6 and TM7. In addition, the D6.44 Oδ2 was seen to form and H-bond with OγH group of the conserved S3.39, in TM3 (average distance of 1.8 Å), establishing a polar interaction between TM3 and TM6 as well. The existence and functional role of this predicted TM6-TM7 interaction was probed by mutating the residues involved and testing the functional consequences after transfection of the mutant constructs in COS-7 cell. The following mutants were engineered: (i) the D6.44N/N7.49D double mutant, made in order to mimic the situation of the Drosophila receptor in the context of the human TSHr; (ii) D6.44N and N7.49D single mutants, introduced in order to explore the effects of the individual mutations; (iii) D6.44A and N7.49A side chain deletion mutants engineered to test the effects of eliminating altogether the interactions between these side chains and any other residue. Following observations made from our molecular dynamics simulation of the TSHr and other studies on the LH/CG receptor (24Angelova K. Narayan P. Simon J.P. Puett D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) we designed two additional mutants, the single N7.45D substitution and the double substitution D6.44N/N7.45D. This was done in order to explore the possibility of a direct interaction between D6.44 and N7.45. Cell surface expression of the mutated receptors was measured by FACS analysis using the BA8 monoclonal antibody (36Costagliola S. Rodien P. Many M.C. Ludgate M. Vassart G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1458-1465PubMed Google Scholar). As the epitope of the BA8 antibody is located in the NH2-terminal region of the TSHr (1Costagliola S. Khoo D. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we do not expect a modification"
https://openalex.org/W2019544860,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Erv2p was identified previously as a distant homologue of Erv1p, an essential mitochondrial protein exhibiting sulfhydryl oxidase activity. Expression of the ERV2 (essential for respiration and vegetative growth 2) gene from a high-copy plasmid cannot substitute for the lack of ERV1, suggesting that the two proteins perform nonredundant functions. Here, we show that the deletion of theERV2 gene or the depletion of Erv2p by regulated gene expression is not associated with any detectable growth defects. Erv2p is located in the microsomal fraction, distinguishing it from the mitochondrial Erv1p. Despite their distinct subcellular localization, the two proteins exhibit functional similarities. Both form dimersin vivo and in vitro, contain a conserved YPCXXC motif in their carboxyl-terminal part, bind flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor, and catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds in protein substrates. The catalytic activity, the ability to form dimers, and the binding of FAD are associated with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein. Our findings identify Erv2p as the first microsomal member of the Erv1p/Alrp protein family of FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidases. We propose that Erv2p functions in the generation of microsomal disulfide bonds acting in parallel with Ero1p, the essential, FAD-dependent oxidase of protein disulfide isomerase.

Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The encoded protein Erv1p is required for maintenance of intact mitochondria in the cell (2Becher D. Kricke J. Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, Erv1p was demonstrated to function as a sulfhydryl oxidase (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity is associated with the carboxyl-terminal part that harbors a YPCXXC motif and noncovalently bound FAD. Yeast contains a distant homologue of Erv1p termed Erv2p (4Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1998; 14: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sequence similarities are restricted to the carboxyl-terminal part of the proteins, including a highly conserved YPCXXC motif. The functions of Erv1p and Erv2p seem to be nonredundant, because overexpression of Erv2p complemented neither a conditional mutant of ERV1 nor a deletion mutant of this gene (4Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1998; 14: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, a few other proteins have been identified containing a domain with homology to the carboxyl-terminal portion of Erv1p. This part is the hallmark of the new Erv1p/Alrp protein family and comprises 80–100 amino acid residues. It contains a CXXC motif that is responsible for disulfide bond formation activity. In mammals, members of this protein family have been characterized as important growth factors. The human ALR (augmenter of liver regeneration) gene encodes a hepatotrophic growth factor (5Hagiya M.

The human and chicken Q6 inhibitors of cell growth have a function in the reversible silencing of the division of fibroblasts and also contain a domain homologous to Erv1p and Alrp (10Coppock D.L.

The chicken Q6 protein is the enzymatically best-characterized sulfhydryl oxidase of the Erv1p/Alrp protein family (10Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S.

Recently, the viral protein E10R has been identified as a component of a new pathway of cytosolic disulfide bridge formation (16Senkevich T.G. White C.L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12068-12073Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Remarkably, these enzymes are found in different subcellular compartments. Yeast Erv1p was identified mostly inside mitochondria (2Becher D. Kricke J. Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,9Hofhaus G. Stein G. Polimeno L.

The sequence similarities and the conserved YPCXXC motif in the carboxyl-terminal domain indicate that Erv2p is a novel member of the Erv1p/Alrp protein family. However, the subcellular localization and enzymatic function of Erv2p have not been determined hitherto. In this study, we identify Erv2p as a constituent of the microsomal fraction. Erv2p exhibits an FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase activity that is associated with a conserved YPCXXC motif in the carboxyl-terminal region. Thus, Erv2p resembles the enzymatic function of mitochondrial Erv1p (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) but seems to be involved in a specific disulfide bond formation pathway in microsomes. Erv2p may act in parallel to Ero1p, an FAD-dependent essential enzyme involved in disulfide bond formation in protein disulfide isomerase of the endoplasmic reticulum (17Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, both the molecular function of these two enzymes and their protein targets appear to be distinct. For the subcellular localization experiments the S. cerevisiae strain W303 (MATa, ura3-1, ade2-1, trp1-1, his3-11, 15, leu2-3, 112) was used as wild type. Deletion of the ERV2 gene was performed by a PCR-based method using the histidine auxotrophic marker (18Wach A. Brachat A. Poehlmann R. Phillipsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 19Kaut A. Lange H. Diekert K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol.

Exchange of the endogenous promoter of the ERV2 gene for a galactose-inducible promoter (strain Gal-ERV2) was performed as described previously (20Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R.

Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). PCR fragments corresponding to the coding region (nucleotides 1–536) and the 5′ upstream region (nucleotides −1 to −600) of ERV2 were cloned into theBamHI-HindIII orHindIII-AvaI restriction sites of the YEp51 vector carrying the GAL10 promoter. Cells were grown as detailed previously using rich (YP) or minimal media (22Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 23Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the required carbon sources. The yeast ERV2 gene was amplified from cloned genomic DNA (4Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1998; 14: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by standard protocols (26Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White TJ PCR Protocols-A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990Google Scholar) using the listed primers. Restriction sites used for cloning are given in bold letters. For expression of Erv2p in Escherichia coli with a hexahistidinyl tag at the carboxyl terminus, the complete yeastERV2 gene and a shorter fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal domain were amplified from the genomic copy ofERV2 (4Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1998; 14: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were cloned into the hexahistidinyl-tag vector pET-24a(+) (Novagen). Primers were as follows: primer 1 (ATG of ERV2/NdeI), 5′-GGAACGAACATATGAAACAGATAGTCAAAAG-3′; primer 2 (ATG of ERV2/NdeI), 5′-AGCAAACCCATATGCCATTGATGGGCGATGAC-3′; and primer 3 (stop codon of ERV2/HindIII), 5′-CCTTAAGCTTACCGTGCTGTTTAGCCTCCTTC-3′. The disruption cassette to generate the Δerv2 strain was amplified by the following primers: primer 4 (Del-ERV2-1), 5′-GTCGGACAGATTGTVCAAGGAACGAAGGGATGAAACAGATAGTCAAAAGCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′; and primer 5 (Del-ERV2-2), 5′-GATTAATGTAATCTTTCTTTGTTCAACCGTGCTGTTTAGCCTCCTTCTCGATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′. For amplification of PCR fragments corresponding to the coding region of ERV2 (nucleotides 1–536), the following primers were used: primer 6 (ERV2-BamHI), 5′-GGATCCATGAAACAGATAGTCAAAAG-3′; and primer 7 (rERV2-HindIII), 5′-AAGCTTCTACATCCACAATCGTAGTC-3. For amplification of the 5′ upstream region of ERV2 (nucleotides −1 to −600) the following primers were used: primer 8 (ERV2-HindIII), 5′-AAGCTTATTCCTGCGAGTTCAAAATG-3′; and primer 9 (rErv2-AvaI), 5′-CTCGAGCCCTTCGTTCCTTGCACAAT-3′. The two PCR constructs encoding the complete protein and a carboxyl-terminal fragment of Erv2p were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (CLONTECH). Only the shorter protein fragment was successfully expressed in E. coli, because induction of expression of full-length Erv2p-6His resulted in cell lysis. The 16-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment was termed C-Erv2p-6His. The presence of the hexahistidinyl tag at the carboxyl terminus of this protein allowed rapid purification with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the standard protocol for the isolation under native conditions in NaCl-phosphate buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5; Qiagen). Proteins were bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and eluted with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmKH2PO4, and 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Purification to homogeneity was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In a final step, the proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and used for spectroscopy with a S-10 diode-array photometer (Zeiss). The reduction of lysozyme and the spectroscopic determination of disulfide bridge formation were done as described earlier (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The following published methods were used: manipulation of DNA and PCR (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), purification of mitochondria by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation (31Diekert K. deKroon A.I.P.M. Kispal G. Lill R.

Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against Erv2p were raised using the carboxyl-terminal peptide CKRVSLEKEAKQHG after coupling to maleimide-activated ovalbumine (Pierce; Ref. 32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The strains Δerv2 and Gal-ERV2 served to verify the antibody specificity.E. coli strain DH5-α (33Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) was used for cloning experiments and amplification of plasmid DNA. To initiate the functional analysis of Erv2p, we constructed a yeast strain in which the entire ERV2 gene was deleted (Δerv2 cells). The mutant cells did not display any detectable growth defects when grown on glucose- or glycerol-containing rich or minimal media (results not shown). Identical results were obtained using a strain allowing the depletion of the Erv2p protein by regulated gene expression with a galactose-inducible promoter (Gal-ERV2 cells). This excluded the possibility that a phenotypical consequence of the defect in Erv2p was suppressed during construction of the Δerv2 cells. Hence, in striking contrast to the essentialERV1, inactivation of ERV2 is not associated with any detectable growth defects. The subcellular localization of Erv2p was investigated by fractionation experiments using an antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acid residues of the protein. In extracts derived from wild-type cells, a protein of 22 kDa was recognized by the Erv2p-directed antiserum (Fig.1 A). This finding is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 22.1 kDa for Erv2p. No immunoreactive protein in the 22-kDa region was detected in extracts derived from the Gal-ERV2 strain grown in the absence of galactose (Fig. 1 A) or in Δerv2 cells (cf. Fig.5 A), demonstrating the specificity of the antiserum for Erv2p. The majority of Erv2p was found in the postmitochondrial supernatant, whereas only a minor portion of Erv2p was associated with the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1 A).Figure 5The carboxyl-terminal portion of Erv2p is responsible for dimer formation. A, the postmitochondrial supernatants of wild-type (wt) and Δerv2 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol (βME) in the sample buffer. Erv2p was visualized by immunostaining. A band of 44 kDa corresponds to a homodimer, and a band of 22 kDa corresponds to the monomer. A nonspecific protein recognized by the anti-Erv2p antiserum is present in both wild-type and Δerv2 (∗). MW, molecular masses of marker proteins. B, aliquots of 20 ng of C-Erv2p-6His (16 kDa) purified from E. coli were analyzed on a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with or without 10 mmdithiothreitol in the sample buffer. The positions of the 32-kDa dimer and the 16-kDa monomer are indicated. Protein bands were visualized by antibodies specific for the hexahistidinyl tag of C-Erv2p-6His.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because isolated mitochondria are usually contaminated with other cellular membranes, the organelles were further purified by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation (30Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 31Diekert K. deKroon A.I.P.M. Kispal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of Erv2p in purified mitochondria was at least 10-fold reduced, whereas mitochondrial Tim44p was not depleted (Fig. 1 B). The depletion of Erv2p in purified mitochondria was virtually identical to the reduction of the endoplasmic reticulum protein Sbh1p. These results suggest that in contrast to Erv1p, Erv2p is not a mitochondrial protein. In accordance, Erv2p was enriched in the microsomal membrane fraction, which was nearly free of contaminating mitochondrial protein as verified by immunostaining analysis for Tim44p of the inner membrane (Fig. 1 B). Erv2p appeared to be exclusively associated with a particulate fraction, because the protein was detected in the pellet of a high-speed centrifugation of the postmitochondrial supernatant (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the cytosolic protein Pgk1p was recovered in the supernatant. In conclusion, our fractionation studies identified Erv2p as a protein associated with microsomes. Yeast Erv1p belongs to a new class of sulfhydryl oxidases (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that use a special YPCXXC motif in the carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig.2) and FAD as a cofactor (11Hoober K.L. Glynn N.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because the sequence similarities between Erv1p and Erv2p are highest for the carboxyl-terminal domains, we tested whether this domain of Erv2p exhibits the same enzymatic function as Erv1p. For this purpose, Erv2p was expressed in E. coli with a hexahistidinyl tag attached to the carboxyl terminus. In contrast to Erv1p, the full-length protein of Erv2p was toxic for E. coli under all investigated conditions. Induction of expression of full-length Erv2p in E. coli immediately resulted in cell lysis. Therefore, a carboxyl-terminal fragment was expressed that starts with methionine at position 70 (Fig. 2). This fragment contains the conserved YPCXXC motif of Erv2p and was successfully expressed and purified to homogeneity by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The 16-kDa carboxyl-terminal protein fragment of Erv2p was termed C-Erv2p-6His. Solutions of C-Erv2p-6His were analyzed by spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The absorption spectrum showed the typical characteristics of a protein-bound FAD moiety and exhibited the small but distinct differences from free FAD (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The absorbance maximum of free FAD at 450 nm was shifted by ∼5 nm in Erv2p spectra. The FAD content of the protein was estimated from the absorption at 460 nm by using an extinction coefficient of 10 mm/cm, a value that is typical for flavin-containing proteins (11Hoober K.L. Glynn N.M. Burnside J. Coppock D.L. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31759-31762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Hoober K.L. Thorpe C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Determination of the protein concentration revealed that ∼0.8 FAD per molecule of C-Erv2p-6His were bound. Treatment of C-Erv2p-6His with 6 m urea completely removed the FAD moiety without resulting in major differences in the absorption, confirming that free and protein-bound FAD do not differ significantly in their extinction coefficients (results not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that C-Erv2p-6His carries FAD in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The cofactor is firmly attached but not covalently linked to the protein.

Reduced lysozyme was used as a substrate (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding the purified yeast proteins to the substrate mixture. At different time points, aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed for their thiol content (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). C-Erv2p-6His was able to oxidize the substrate in a time-dependent manner. Increasing amounts of protein gave a corresponding increase in enzyme activity (Fig.4). The enzyme turnover number (4.5/min) of C-Erv2p-6His was comparable with that of Erv1p (6.2/min; Ref. 3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Taken together, the carboxyl-terminal domain of Erv2p exhibits FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase activity. Extracts from wild-type and Δerv2 yeast cells were prepared under nonreducing conditions. Aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of reducing agents in the loading buffer of the sample (Fig. 5). Immunostaining analysis with the Erv2p-reactive antibody revealed a 44-kDa protein in the absence of reducing agent, suggesting that Erv2p forms a homodimer (Fig. 5 A). Addition of reducing agent to the sample resulted in the detection of a single band of 22 kDa, corresponding to the monomeric form of Erv2p. Only the wild-type strain displayed the Erv2p-specific protein bands. Comparable analyses with a recombinant C-Erv2p-6His fragment demonstrated that this fragment also formed dimers under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5 B). This result indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Erv2p, in addition to the enzymatic sulfhydryl oxidase activity, harbors the information for dimerization. In this communication, we report on the identification of Erv2p, the first member of the Erv1p/Alrp sulfhydryl oxidases in the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzymatic activity of Erv2p is associated with the conserved carboxyl-terminal part of the protein, which consists of ∼100 amino acid residues. This domain is present in a number of other proteins and is the characteristic hallmark of the new Erv1p/Alrp protein family involved in the introduction of disulfide bridges in protein substrates. Members of this family include mammalian Alrp and vertebrate quiescin Q6 (5Hagiya M. Francavilla A. Polimeno L. Ihara I. Sakai H. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Porter K.A. Starzl T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This enzyme depends on noncovalently bound FAD, uses O2 for oxidation, and contains a CXXC motif that is functionally involved in the redox reaction (13Hoober K.L. Sheasley S.L. Gilbert H.F. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All currently known members of this protein family are involved in distinct disulfide bond formation pathways localized outside the endoplasmic reticulum (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Hoober K.L. Glynn N.M. Burnside J. Coppock D.L. Thorpe C. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 12068-12073Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This is remarkable because most of the oxidative protein folding normally takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (36Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 37Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 4: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). So far, the only other FAD-linked disulfide bond-forming enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum is Ero1p (17Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Erv2p and Ero1p share no sequence homologies and display several distinct features. Ero1p is a membrane-bound protein of 65 kDa that performs an essential task in protein folding (17Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 36Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 37Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition, Ero1p functionally interacts with protein disulfide isomerases and the homologous protein Mpd2p, another class of disulfide bridge-forming enzymes in microsomes (17Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of disulfide bonds by Ero1p and sulfhydryl oxidases of the Erv1p/Alrp type are radically different. An interesting homologue of Erv2p in yeast is the essential protein Erv1p, which is localized mostly in mitochondria (2Becher D. Kricke J. Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hofhaus G. Stein G. Polimeno L. Francavilla A. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The characteristics of both yeast proteins are remarkably similar. Erv1p and Erv2p can oxidize thiol groups in a protein substrate and contain noncovalently bound FAD and a special YPCXXC motif in the carboxyl-terminal domain. The enzyme turnover numbers of C-Erv2p-6His and Erv1p with lysozyme as an in vitro substrate are nearly identical and are both substantially lower than that of native chicken egg white sulfhydryl oxidase (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This suggests that Erv1p and Erv2p may not serve as generic sulfhydryl oxidase enzymes but, rather, may be specific for a narrow range of substrates. This notion is consistent with the fact that glutathione and dithiothreitol are not used as substrates by both proteins. 2J. Gerber, U. Mühlenhoff, G. Hofhaus, R. Lill, and T. Lisowsky, unpublished data. Both yeast proteins form dimers in vivo that are stable in nonreducing SDS gels, arguing for covalent disulfide bridges between the monomers. However, current evidence suggests that Erv1p and Erv2p use different strategies for dimer formation. The carboxyl-terminal fragment of Erv2p still efficiently forms dimers even when the amino-terminal part of the protein is removed, whereas the amino-terminal domain of Erv1p is indispensable for dimer formation (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This indicates that the cysteine residues used for dimer formation are localized in different positions of the two proteins. Inspection of the two protein sequences indeed identifies a pair of cysteine residues in the amino-terminal part of Erv1p (Fig. 2), whereas Erv2p lacks cysteine residues within the first 70 residues. Instead, Erv2p contains additional cysteine residues near the carboxyl terminus that are not found in Erv1p (4Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1998; 14: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The different compartmentation of Erv1p and Erv2p is of particular interest. Although Erv1p was found mostly in mitochondria (2Becher D. Kricke J. Stein G. Lisowsky T. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Hofhaus G. Stein G. Polimeno L. Francavilla A. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), our subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrate that Erv2p is not a mitochondrial component but, rather, highly enriched in the microsomal preparations. The small portion of Erv2p that is still associated with the mitochondrial fraction corresponds well with the amount of contaminating microsomes. This residual fraction of Erv2p may well reflect the tight association of a fraction of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum with mitochondria (39Achleitner G. Gaigg B. Krasser A. Kainersdorf E. Kohlwein S.D. Perktold A. Zellnig G. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data indicate that most if not all of Erv2p is localized inside microsomes. Presently, it is unclear in which microsomal fraction Erv2p might be localized. Even though localization in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum seems to be most likely, it has to be noted that the protein does not harbor a carboxyl-terminal HDEL retrieval motif typical of soluble components of this compartment. The different subcellular localization of Erv2p and Erv1p might result from targeting information contained within the highly divergent amino termini (9Hofhaus G. Stein G. Polimeno L. Francavilla A. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, neither Erv1p nor Erv2p contains sequences that are typical for targeting to mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum. The unusual characteristic of subcellular targeting of both proteins is further supported by the fact that neither Erv1p nor Erv2p is apparently proteolytically processed at its amino termini. Subcellular distribution is only one function associated with the amino-terminal domains of the Erv1p/Alrp family. In some members these domains are also involved in dimer formation (3Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and most likely also in substrate interactions. To date, Erv1p is the only disulfide bond formation activity identified inside mitochondria. Even though the substrates for Erv1p are presently unknown, substrates of Erv1p seem to perform an essential function in yeast cells. In contrast, the microsomal compartment contains several other enzymes that are essential for oxidative protein folding (17Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 36Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol.

The most prominent member of these proteins is the already mentioned Ero1p (17Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). One important difference between these enzymes and FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidases is the finding that the latter have no protein disulfide isomerase function and use oxygen in the redox reaction (12Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple systems for disulfide bridge formation in the microsomal fraction could explain the nonessential function of Erv2p in yeast. One implication of this finding is that Erv2p has been adapted to specific but nonessential substrates inside microsomes. The latest interesting case of a protein harboring the sulfhydryl oxidase domain is the viral member of the Erv1p/Alrp protein family termed E10R (16Senkevich T.G. White C.L. Koonin E.V. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12068-12073Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to be essential for disulfide bond formation in a virus-encoded glutaredoxin. In turn, glutaredoxin introduces disulfide bridges into viral coat proteins that are essential for virus assembly in the cytosol of the infected cell. Thus, the E10R protein functions as a specific sulfhydryl oxidase in the cytosol, a compartment that is devoid of disulfide bond-forming enzymes. Our current data characterize Erv2p as a new member of the Erv1p/Alrp protein family with a specific function in the oxidative protein-folding pathway inside microsomes. Therefore, identification of the natural target proteins of Erv2p in yeast represents an important future goal. We thank Jeung-Eun Lee for support in the enzyme assays."

It is likely that changes in gap junction permeability are determined by the interaction between these two proteins. Cx43 interacts with ZO-1, which may be involved in trafficking of Cx43 or facilitating interactions between Cx43 and other proteins. In this study we sought to identify proteins that associate with Cx45 by coprecipitation in non-denaturing conditions. Cx45 was isolated with a 220-kDa protein that we identified as ZO-1. Under the same conditions, Cx43 also was isolated with anti-Cx45 antiserum from Cx45-transfected ROS cells (ROS/Cx45 cells). Cx43 antiserum could also coprecipitate ZO-1 in the transfected and untransfected ROS cells. Double label immunofluorescence studies showed that ZO-1, Cx43, and Cx45 colocalized at appositional membranes in ROS/Cx45 cells suggesting that all three proteins are normally associated in the cells.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 502Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). At least 14 different connexin isoforms have been identified in the mouse. Different tissues express different combinations of connexins, which might allow the formation of heteromeric or heterotypic channels and facilitate the modulation of gap junction permeability in these cells (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 502Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Alterations in gap junction permeability affect many biological phenomena including cellular differentiation and development, metabolic homeostasis, and electrotonic coupling of excitable tissue (2Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), Cx43 and Cx45 are expressed on the plasma membrane and form gap junction channels. Cx43 and Cx45 have different molecular permeabilities, and changes in the relative expression of Cx43 and Cx45 in bone cells can alter the permeability of gap junctions and the expression of bone matrix proteins (2Lecanda F.

These results suggest that interactions among different gap junction proteins might alter cell-cell communication in cell networks thereby modulating the expression of bone matrix proteins and cell activities. However little is known about the processes through which different gap junction proteins interact. One protein that may be involved in the trafficking or organization of gap junction proteins is the tight junction-associated protein ZO-1. Cx43 associates with ZO-1 (6Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Oysu K.

Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated guanylate kinases bind to the carboxyl termini of membrane proteins and to internal domains of other membrane-associated guanylate kinases, thereby organizing these proteins into two-dimensional multi-protein complexes at cell-cell boundaries (9Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the interaction between Cx43 and ZO-1 suggests that the second PDZ domain of ZO-1 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal region of Cx43 (6Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Oysu K. Kusuya T.

To understand the interactions between Cx43 and Cx45 in osteoblastic cells, in the current work we sought to identify proteins that interact with Cx45 and in particular wished to determine whether ZO-1 interacts with Cx45 as well as with Cx43. We found that ZO-1 could be isolated with Cx45 from ROS/Cx45 cells using a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Immunofluorescence studies showed that Cx45 colocalized with ZO-1 and Cx43 in the transfected cells. We found that in vitrotranslated ZO-1 bound to an oligopeptide corresponding to the final 12 amino acids in Cx45, suggesting that ZO-1 recognizes the carboxyl-terminal of Cx45.

The media was removed, and the cells were harvested by scraping and subsequently were solubilized in mildly dissociating conditions with an IP buffer containing PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (1:100 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The antigen-antibody complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose. In most experiments the antigen-antibody complexes were washed with IP buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In some experiments the antigen-antibody complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose and then washed in RIPA buffer, PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.6% SDS, and protease inhibitors after they were collected with protein A-Sepharose. This immunoprecipitated material was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In some experiments the cells were not radioactively labeled, and the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-Cx45-antibodies were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal antibody directed against Cx43 (Chemicon) or ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). All blots were then probed with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA)) and developed with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence system (Pierce). ROS cells were cultured on coverslips to 60–80% confluence and fixed in 50% methanol/50% acetone for 2 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100/PBS. The cells were blocked with PBS/1% Triton X-100/2% normal goat serum overnight and then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody. We used monoclonal anti-ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a 1:1000 dilution, monoclonal anti-Cx43 (Chemicon) at a 1:1000 dilution, or rabbit anti-Cx45 antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution (alone or in combination) as primary antibodies. The coverslips were washed and then incubated for an hour in secondary antibody. In these experiments we used a 1:2000 dilution of CY3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) and a 1:2000 dilution of Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were viewed by epifluorescence on a Nikon Eclipse E600FN microscope using a 60× (numerical aperture 1.4) or a 40× (numerical aperture 1.3) objective, and the images were processed using Tillvision software (Martinsried, Germany). Confocal images were collected on a Bio-Rad MRC10–24 microscope with LaserShop software, and the images were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop software. To mimic the carboxyl-terminal of Cx45, peptides consisting of amino acids 383–394 of chicken Cx45 (CSKSGDGKNSVWI), which we call Cx45CT, were synthesized (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL.) and conjugated to SulfoLink Gel (Pierce) through the added amino-terminal cysteine. Control peptides used in this study included the amino acids 373–382 of rat Cx43 (CSRPRPDDLEI), which we call Cx43 CT, and amino acids 367–378 on chicken Cx45 (CSREKKSKAGSNK), which we call Cx45OC (which is 41.7% identical with amino acids 479–490 in rat occludin), and amino acids 252–271 of rat Cx43 (CGPLSPSKDCGSPKYAYFNGC), which we call Cx43PET, were synthesized by Research Genetics and coupled to SulfoLink Gel (Pierce) through the added amino-terminal cysteine. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 317–329 on rat Cx40 (CQPKEQPSGASAGH), which we call Cx40I, were synthesized previously and coupled to SulfoLink Gel through the added amino-terminal cysteine. ZO-1myc was translated in a TNT T7 quick transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI) and divided into eight equal portions, which were incubated with 50 μl of the peptide-coupled SulfoLink Gels, protein A-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose and anti-ZO-1 polyclonal antibody. The gels were extensively washed with RIPA buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. We found that washing the resins with less stringent buffers, such as IP buffer, produced an unacceptably high level of nonspecific binding. We identified proteins that associate with Cx45 in ROS/Cx45 transfectants by immunoprecipitation of Cx45-containing complexes in mild detergent conditions (Fig.1 A). Detergent lysates were made from [35S]methionine-labeled cells solubilized with IP buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.1% SDS). Anti-Cx45 antibodies were added to the lysate, antigen-antibody complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, and the immunoprecipitated material was extensively washed with IP Buffer or the more stringent RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.6% SDS) (Fig. 1 A) prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the immunoprecipitated material derived from ROS/Cx45 cells revealed a 45-kDa band in both IP buffer-washed and RIPA buffer-washed samples. However, the IP buffer-washed samples also contained a 220-kDa band that was not detected in the RIPA buffer washed precipitates. As expected, nothing was detected in the IP or RIPA buffer-washed precipitates from the untransfected ROS cells (Fig. 1 A). To confirm that this 220-kDa coprecipitated band occurred in cells expressing endogenous Cx45 as well as in the ROS/Cx45 transfectant, we isolated Cx45 immunoprecipitates from the osteoblastic cell line UMR 106–01, which expresses endogenous Cx45, and again detected a band that migrated at ∼220 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The molecular mass of this polypeptide is similar to that of ZO-1, a protein that is known to bind to Cx43. We next asked whether the 220-kDa protein that coisolated with Cx45 was ZO-1. In the experiments shown in Fig.2 A, ROS cells, ROS/Cx45 cells, and UMR cells were harvested and solubilized in IP buffer, and the soluble material was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cx45 antiserum. The antigen-antibody complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, and the precipitated material was washed with either IP buffer or RIPA buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against ZO-1. ZO-1 was found in IP buffer-washed anti-Cx45 immunoprecipitates derived from ROS/Cx45 cells but not in the RIPA buffer-washed immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A). As expected, the anti-Cx45 antibody did not precipitate detectable ZO-1 from ROS cells. Because Cx43 is a known binding partner of ZO-1 and our previous data suggest an interaction between Cx43 and Cx45 in cells expressing both connexins (14Koval M. Geist S.T. Kemendy A.E. Westphale E.M. Civitelli R. Beyer E.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we asked whether Cx43 was also precipitated by Cx45 antiserum in ROS/Cx45 cells. Proteins immunoprecipitated from transfected ROS cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against Cx43, showing that Cx43 was associated with the anti-Cx45 immunoprecipitate from the ROS/Cx45 cells (Fig.2 B). The anti-Cx45 antiserum did not immunoprecipitate Cx43 from the untransfected ROS cells. Similarly there was no Cx43 in the RIPA buffer-washed immunoprecipitates derived from either cell line. To confirm the interactions identified above, we performed coimmunoprecipitations from radioactively labeled ROS and ROS/Cx45 cells using anti-Cx43 serum. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig.3 A). Anti-Cx43 precipitated both 45-kDa and 220-kDa radioactively labeled polypeptide proteins from both cell lines. There were more of both proteins in the ROS/Cx45 cells than in the ROS cells. Another striking feature of these immunoprecipitates is that other than the 45-kDa and 220-kDa proteins there are no other [35S]methionine-labeled proteins that copurify with Cx43 on these gels. To confirm that the anti-Cx43 antiserum also immunoprecipitated ZO-1, anti-Cx43 immunoprecipitates that were derived from unlabeled ROS and ROS/Cx45 were subject to immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against ZO-1. ZO-1 was found in anti-Cx43 immunoprecipitates derived from each cell type (Fig. 3 B). The immunoprecipitates derived from ROS/Cx45 cells had more ZO-1 than the immunoprecipitates derived from ROS cells. These data confirm that anti-Cx43 antiserum can isolate ZO-1 in the ROS cells. Subsequently we examined the localization of Cx45, ZO-1, and Cx43 in the transfected ROS cells by confocal microscopy of immunofluorescently stained ROS/Cx45 cells. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a monoclonal antibody directed against ZO-1 and a polyclonal antiserum against Cx45. These cells were than examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy. And as seen in Fig.4, there was little staining for Cx45 in the ROS cells, whereas the ROS/Cx45 cells exhibited punctate and linear appositional membrane staining for Cx45. There was plentiful linear staining for ZO-1 at appositional membranes in both cell lines. Merging the Cx45 (Alexa-488) and ZO-1 (CY3) micrographs revealed areas where the two signals colocalized. While plasma membrane Cx45 was associated with ZO-1, some of the ZO-1 at the plasma membrane was not associated with Cx45. In contrast there was very little Cx45 staining seen in the ROS cells. Thus Cx45 at the cell surface colocalized with ZO-1, consistent with the data above suggesting that these proteins could associate. We next confirmed that Cx43 also colocalized with Cx45 in these cells as was seen previously (14Koval M. Geist S.T. Kemendy A.E. Westphale E.M. Civitelli R. Beyer E.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Cx45-transfected cells were simultaneously stained with an antibody directed against Cx43 and Cx45 as seen in Fig. 5. In ROS cells not expressing Cx45, Cx43 was present at cell-cell boundaries and some staining in cytoplasmic vesicles, while minimal staining was seen with the Cx45 antibody. The anti-Cx45 antiserum and the anti-Cx43 antibody stained the ROS/Cx45 cells in discrete spots along the plasma membrane, and a significant amount of staining was evident in a perinuclear region as well. The merged image shows that there is substantial colocalization of Cx43 and Cx45 in the ROS/Cx45 cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that transfected Cx45 associates with Cx43 in the ROS/Cx45 cells. ZO-1 binding usually occurs via interactions with the carboxyl terminus of membrane proteins. To determine whether ZO-1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal of Cx45 oligopeptides corresponding to the final 12 amino acids in Cx45 (Cx45CT), the carboxyl-terminal nine amino acids of Cx43 (Cx43CT), and internal peptides from Cx45 (Cx45OC) and Cx40 (Cx40I) were synthesized and conjugated to SulfoLink Gel through an added amino-terminal cysteine. Equal portions of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled ZO-1myc were incubated with the peptide-derivatized gel beads, protein A-Sepharose, or anti-ZO-1 antibody and protein-A-Sepharose, and these beads were then extensively washed with RIPA buffer. As can be seen in the resulting gel (Fig.6), the Cx45CT peptide and the Cx43CT peptide bind significant amounts of ZO-1myc. In contrast to this, protein A-agarose, the Cx40I peptide-coupled agarose, and Cx45OC peptide-coupled agarose do not bind ZO-1myc. The multitude of bands on this gel are probably due to incomplete transcription of the relatively lengthy ZO-1myc mRNA as inclusion of the Sigma protease inhibitor mixture did not significantly alter the presence of these bands (data not shown); nonetheless they were recognized by the anti-ZO-1 antibody (data not shown), and thus they are portions of the ZO-1myc polypeptide. In a parallel experiment ZO-1myc did not bind to amino acids 252–271 of rat Cx43 that had been coupled to agarose (data not shown). All of these results suggest that ZO-1 recognizes the carboxyl-terminal of Cx45. These studies demonstrate that ZO-1 interacts with Cx45, and that this Cx45/ZO-1 interaction probably requires recognition of the carboxyl terminus of Cx45. The primary evidence of this is that Cx45 and ZO-1 can be coprecipitated from lysates of ROS/Cx45 cells. Furthermore Cx45 and ZO-1 colocalize in transfected ROS cells as seen by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy suggesting that these proteins may be in close proximity to each other at the plasma membrane. We also found that in vitro translated ZO-1 binds specifically to the 12 most carboxyl-terminal amino acids in Cx45. The interaction between the carboxyl terminus of Cx45 and ZO-1 is likely to occur via binding to a ZO-1 PDZ domain in the same manner as Cx43 carboxyl-terminal. Work in other laboratories has shown that Cx43 binds to the second PDZ domain in ZO-1 (6Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Oysu K. Kusuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 7Giepmans B.N. Moolenar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Both groups isolated the second ZO-1 PDZ domain in a yeast two-hybrid assay using the carboxyl-terminal of Cx43 as bait. Giepmans and Moolenar showed that the absolute carboxyl-terminal of Cx43 is needed to bind ZO-1; masking the carboxyl-terminal with a Myc epitope or removing the absolute carboxyl-terminal isoleucine abrogated this interaction (7Giepmans B.N. Moolenar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a canonical PDZ domain-carboxyl-terminal interaction. The carboxyl-terminal sequence of Cx45 (NSVWI) is somewhat different from Cx43 (DDLEI), which raises the possibility that the Cx43 and Cx45 carboxyl termini might bind to different domains in ZO-1. Indeed the carboxyl termini of claudins (XXXYV), a known binding partner for the first PDZ domain in ZO-1, seem to be more similar to the Cx45 carboxyl-terminal (NSVWI). Additionally the presence of Cx43, ZO-1, and Cx45 in the same immunoprecipitates suggests that it is unlikely that Cx43 and Cx45 bind to the same PDZ domain. It is still unclear what role ZO-1 plays in the life cycle of a connexin. One hypothesis is that ZO-1 makes a scaffold that temporarily secures the different connexins in gap junction plaques at the cell-cell boundary. The amino acid sequences of the carboxyl-terminal of all of connexins, with the exception of Cx32, end in a hydrophobic residue suggesting that they might bind to PDZ domains in ZO-1 (18Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). This might indicate that sets of connexins that bind to ZO-1, like Cx45 and Cx43, could be found in the same gap junctions along with ZO-1. In contrast Cx32 and Cx43 sort to different plasma membrane locales in thyroid epithelial cells, and only Cx43 colocalized with ZO-1 (19Guerrier A. Fonlupt P. Morand I. Rabilloud R. Audebet C. Krutovskikh V. Gros D. Rousset B. Munari-Silem Y. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that interaction with a ZO-1 scaffold stabilizes the connexin at the gap junction. Recent data from Toyofuku et al. are consistent with this notion as Cx43 that cannot interact with ZO-1 (due to mutation or phosphorylation by c-Src) turns over much more rapidly than Cx43 that can interact with ZO-1 (10Toyofuku T. Zhang H. Akamatsu Y. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1780-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In a scaffolding model, the different domains of ZO-1 serve as docking modules for kinases and phosphatases that interact with the different connexin polypeptides. ZO-1 could then serve a common function in the life cycle of a number of different connexins by providing a docking platform for these signaling molecules.

In an attempt to define the molecular basis of the S100B action, we have identified the giant phosphoprotein AHNAK as the major and most specific Ca2+-dependent S100B target protein in rat embryo fibroblast cells. We next characterized AHNAK as a major Ca2+-dependent S100B target protein in the rat glial C6 and human U-87MG astrocytoma cell lines. AHNAK binds to S100B-Sepharose beads and is also recovered in anti-S100B immunoprecipitates in a strict Ca2+- and Zn2+-dependent manner. Using truncated AHNAK fragments, we demonstrated that the domains of AHNAK responsible for interaction with S100B correspond to repeated motifs that characterize the AHNAK molecule. These motifs show no binding to calmodulin or to S100A6 and S100A11. We also provide evidence that the binding of 2 Zn2+ equivalents/mol S100B enhances Ca2+-dependent S100B-AHNAK interaction and that the effect of Zn2+ relies on Zn2+-dependent regulation of S100B affinity for Ca2+. Taking into consideration that AHNAK is a protein implicated in calcium flux regulation, we propose that the S100B-AHNAK interaction may participate in the S100B-mediated regulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 370-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, such as calmodulin, troponin C, parvalbumin, and S100, are implicated in calcium transduction pathways (3Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 473-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These proteins bind Ca2+through their EF-hand motifs, and in their Ca2+-bound conformation they interact with secondary effector proteins. S100 proteins constitute one of the largest subfamilies of EF-hand proteins (4Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). To date, 17 different proteins have been assigned to the S100 protein family. The S100 proteins are small proteins (10 kDa) that are generally expressed in tissue- and cell-specific manners. They show different degrees of homology, ranging from 25% to 55% identity at the amino acid level. In vivo, the S100 proteins associate as noncovalent homodimers but may also heterodimerize with other individual S100 species (5Tarabykina S. Kriajevska M. Scott D.J. Hill T.J. Lafitte D.

Some S100 protein members including S100B, S100A1, S100A3, S100A6, S100A7, and S100A11 are not only calcium-binding proteins but also bind Zn2+ ions (9Schafer B.W. Fritschy J.M. Murmann P. Troxler H.

The interaction of S100B protein with Zn2+ may be important in its biological function. Unlike Ca2+ binding, Zn2+ binding to S100B has a minimal effect on the conformation of the overall protein structure but profoundly increases affinity for calcium (10Baudier J. Glasser N. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important question related to Zn2+ binding to S100 proteins in general is how Zn2+ regulates the functions of S100. S100B is abundant in the brain, where it localizes to astrocytes. This protein has attracted much interest over the past few years because, like other proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (e.g.%-amyloid and superoxide dismutase), its gene is located on chromosome 21, which is trisomic in Down's syndrome (11Allore R.

Overexpression of S100B in the brain of patients with Down's syndrome or Alzheimer's disease (12Griffin W.S.T. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J. White C.L. Araoz C. Proc. Natl.

Griffin W.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) has led to the hypothesis that S100B plays a contributory role in several neuropathologies associated with these diseases. Outside the central nervous system, expression of S100B protein is increased in many tumors (15Cochran A.J. Lu H.F. Li P.X. Saxton R. Wen D.R. Melanoma Res. 1983; 3: 325-330Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes, S100B synthesis is induced in response to hypoxia (16Tsoporis J.N. Marks A. Kahn H.J. Butany J. Liu P.P.

S100B null mice are viable and exhibit no behavioral abnormalities up to 12 month of age (18Xiong Z. O'Hanlon D. Becker L.E. Roder J. MacDonald J.F. Marks A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, astrocytes derived from S100B null mice show abnormal calcium elevation in response to agents that normally induce a transient Ca2+increase (18Xiong Z. O'Hanlon D. Becker L.E. Roder J. MacDonald J.F. Marks A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These results suggest that S100B plays a role in the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis within cells. The identification of in vivo S100B target proteins is essential for determination of the exact contribution of the S100B-dependent signaling pathways to cellular functions. Several putative S100B target proteins have already been characterized, including cytoplasmic cytoskeletal-associated proteins (19Baudier J. Cole R.D. J. Biol.

Most of these putative target proteins are also able to interact with the other S100 species and/or calmodulin. We show here that a major and specific target protein for S100B is the giant phosphoprotein AHNAK. AHNAK/desmoyokin (molecular mass, 700 kDa) is a protein originally identified by Shtivelman et al. (27Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and Shtivelman and Bishop (28Shtivelman E. Bishop M.J. J.

In epithelial cells, AHNAK/desmoyokin is present mainly in the cytoplasm when cells are kept in low Ca2+medium but translocates to the plasma membrane after an increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration or protein kinase C activation (30Hashimoto T. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Kitajima Y. Nishikawa T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More recently, AHNAK has been found in cardiomyocytes associated with l-type calcium channels. In these cells, AHNAK may play a role in cardiac calcium signaling by modulatingl-type calcium channels in response to %-adrenergic stimulation (31Haase H. Podzuweit T. Lutsch G. Hohaus A. Kostka S. Lindschau C. Kott M. Kraft R. Morano I. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2161-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A recent report also identified AHNAK as a protein that binds and activates phospholipase C-γ1 in the presence of arachidonic acid to generate inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, two second messengers that control intracellular calcium flux (32Sekiya F.

A possible role for AHNAK in S100B-mediated regulation of cell calcium homeostasis is discussed. REF1 cells (clone 6) (44Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M.

Purified S100B monoclonal antibody S16 was a generous gift from Dr. M. Takahashi (Skye PharmaTech Inc.). S100B polyclonal antibodies were from DAKO. KIS/AHNAK polyclonal antibodies (28Shtivelman E.

Shtivelman (University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA). p53-specific monoclonal antibody PAb421 was purified from hybridoma supernatants by protein A-agarose chromatography. Anti-tubulin was a gift from Dr. L. Paturle and D. Job (CEA-Grenoble). Myc epitope-specific monoclonal antibody 9e10 and MyoD monoclonal antibody 5.8A were from H. Weintraub (Fred Utchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). S100B and CaM were purified from bovine brain to homogeneity (10Baudier J. Glasser N. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S100B- and CaM-Sepharose were prepared by reaction of bovine brain S100B and CaM with CnBr-Sepharose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, and 0.5 mmCaCl2. Both S100B- and CaM-Sepharose contained 2 mg protein/ml beads. Recombinant human S100B, S100A1, S100A6, and S100A11 were coupled to CnBr-Sepharose (1 mg protein/ml beads) as described above. The bacterial expression plasmid for the production of His-tagged M2-DY (AHNAK amino acids 2589–3059) was constructed by cloning anEcoRV/HindIII fragment from Z83 (27Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) intoEcoRV/HindIII sites of pet32b (Novagen). For His-tagged M3-DY (AHNAK amino acids 3730–4188) expression inEscherichia coli, the corresponding SspI DNA fragment from Z80 (27Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was cloned into EcoRV site of pet32a (Novagen). His-tagged U1-DY (AHNAK amino acids 3730–3878) and His-tagged U2-DY (AHNAK amino acids 3730–3972) expression plasmids were obtained by deleting the carboxyl-terminal part of the AHNAK fragment of M3-DY. M3-DY expression vector was digested byBspMI/XhoI or AatII/XhoI for the production of U1-DY or U2-DY expression vector, respectively, blunted, and then self-ligated. Recombinant protein expression was carried out in E. coli strain AD494(DE3)pLYsS (Novagen). Bacteria were grown toA600 = 0.6 in 100 ml of Luria-Bertani broth medium supplemented with 15 μg/ml kanamycin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 40 μg/ml leucine, and 50 μg/ml carbemicillin. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-%-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm %-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 2 μg/ml of each protease inhibitor (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and AEBSF)). After one freeze/thaw cycle, bacterial lysates were cleared (100,000 × g for 20 min) and kept on ice or stored at −20 °C. His-tagged M3-DY, U2-DY, and U1-DY were purified by Ni3+ affinity chromatography. For binding assays using recombinant AHNAK fragments expressed in rabbit reticulocytes (TNTquick; Promega), 20 μl of reaction lysates were diluted in 500 μl of TTBS supplemented with either 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA or 0.3 mm CaCl2 and 10 μm ZnSO4 and mixed with 20 μl of affinity beads equilibrated in the same buffers. After mixing at 4 °C for 10 min, the beads were spun down, and the supernatant was removed. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffers and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. For binding assays using recombinant AHNAK fragments expressed in bacteria, soluble extracts (50 μl) were diluted in 500 μl of TTBS supplemented with either 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA or 0.3 mm CaCl2 and 10 μm ZnSO4 and treated as described above. For binding assays using crude cell extracts, cells were first labeled in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mix (50 μCi/ml) for 8 h. Cells were lysed in TTBS buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, AEBSF, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal; 10 μg/ml each) and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The lysates were precleared by incubation for 10 min with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Aliquots (500 μl) of precleared supernatant were mixed with 500 μl of TTBS supplemented with either 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA or 0.3 mm CaCl2 and 10 μm ZnSO4 and mixed with 20 μl of affinity beads equilibrated in the same buffers. After mixing at 4 °C for 10 min, the beads were spun down, and the supernatant was removed. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffers. At the last wash, the beads were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. For co-immunoprecipitation of AHNAK and S100B, NIH-3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes were first transfected with control plasmid or S100B plasmid (4 μg) using FuGENETMreagent (12 μl) as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche). Cells were lysed after 36 h. For co-immunoprecipitation of p53 and AHNAK, confluent REF cells were labeled in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium, 5% fetal calf serum, supplemented with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mix (100 μCi/ml) for 6 h. NIH-3T3 and REF cells were lysed in TTBS buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, AEBSF, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal; 10 μg/ml each). The lysates were precleared by a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, and the supernatant was further incubated for 15 min with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Aliquots (500 μl) of precleared supernatant were mixed with 500 μl of TTBS supplemented with either 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA or 0.3 mmCaCl2 and 10 μm ZnS04 and mixed with appropriate antibodies (5 μg) plus 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffers. After mixing at 4 °C for 15 min, the beads were centrifuged briefly (5 s, 13,000 rpm), and the supernatant was removed. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffers. At the last wash, the beads were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. The protein bands were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gels and washed with 50% acetonitrile. Gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reswollen in 20 μl of 25 mmNH4HCO3 containing 0.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, a 0.5 μl aliquot was removed for MALDI time of flight analysis and spotted onto the MALDI sample probe on top of a dried, 0.5 μl mixture of 4:3 saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid in acetone/10 mg/ml nitrocellulose in acetone/isopropanol 1:1. Samples were rinsed by placing a 5 μl volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on the matrix surface after the analyte solution had dried completely. After 2 min, the liquid was blown off by pressurized air. MALDI mass spectra of peptide mixtures were obtained using a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analityk, Bremen, Germany). Internal calibration was applied to each spectrum using trypsin autodigestion peptides (MH+ 842.50, MH+ 1045.55, and MH+ 2211.11). Protein identification was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry experiments. After in-gel tryptic digestion, the gel pieces were extracted with 5% formic acid solution and then extracted with acetonitrile. The extracts were combined with the original digest, and the sample was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. The residues were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and desalted using a Zip Tip (Millipore). Elution of the peptides was performed with 5–10 μl of 50% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid solution. The peptide solution was introduced into a glass capillary (Protana) for nanoelectrospray ionization. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a quadrupole time of flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, United Kingdom) to obtain sequence information. Collision-induced dissociation of selected precursor ions was performed using argon as the collision gas and with collision energies of 40–60 eV. Protein identification was achieved using both MALDI peptide mass fingerprints and tandem mass spectrometry sequence information. Mass spectrometric data were compared with known sequences using the programs MS-Fit and MS-Edman from the University of California San Francisco. Real-time binding experiments were performed on a BIAcore biosensor system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. AHNAK peptides in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5, were coupled directly through their amino groups to the sensor surface activated by N-hydroxy-succinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's instructions. The remaining reactive groups were then inactivated with 1 mm ethanolamine. For control experiments, the sensor surface was treated as described above in the absence of peptide or coupled to His-tagged importin α1. All interaction experiments were done using a running buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl in the absence or presence of CaCl2 as indicated. Between injections, the sensor chip was washed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA and equilibrated with the appropriate running buffer. For Zn2+-dependent binding experiments, the S100B protein was incubated with ZnS04 before injection on the sensor chip. Sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 program (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). Ectopic expression of the calcium- and zinc-binding S100B protein in mouse embryo fibroblasts and REFs expressing the temperature-sensitive p53val135 mutant cooperates with Ca2+ to promote nuclear accumulation of the wild-type p53val135 conformational species and rescue wild-type p53 functions at the nonpermissive temperature (33Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Scotto C. Delphin C. Deloulme J.C. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7168-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To begin to characterize the mechanism behind this effect, we chose to characterize Ca2+-dependent S100B target proteins in REF clone 6 cells. REF cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, after which protein extracts were incubated with S100-Sepharose beads in the absence or presence of Ca2+/Zn2+. To control for specificity of protein interactions, the pattern of protein binding was compared with that of CaM-Sepharose (Fig.1 A). The most abundant and specific calcium-dependent S100B target protein in REF cells is a large protein heavily labeled with [35S]methionine that migrates at the top of the gel (Fig.1 A). The corresponding human protein from HeLa cell extract was next isolated by Ca2+-dependent interaction with S100B-Sepharose beads and further characterized by mass spectrometry. Protein identification was achieved using both MALDI peptide mass fingerprints and tandem mass spectrometry sequence information (Fig. 2). Results revealed that the large molecular mass protein corresponds to the human protein AHNAK (27Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A physical Ca2+-dependent interaction between S100B and AHNAK was also demonstrated by exploiting the observation that AHNAK co-immunoprecipitates with the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody PAb421 from clone 6 cell extracts (Fig. 1 B and Fig.1 C, lanes 1 and 4). AHNAK is not precipitated by the control monoclonal anti-MyoD antibody, showing that AHNAK co-immunoprecipitation with PAb421 is specific (Fig. 1 B). If clone 6 cell extracts are supplemented with purified S100B (5 μm) before immunoprecipitation with PAb421, S100B prevents co-precipitation of AHNAK only when calcium is present (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 1 and 2). In the absence of calcium, AHNAK is unable to interact with S100B (lanes 6), and S100B does not dissociate AHNAK from PAb421 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 4 and5). S100B does not antagonize p53val135immunoprecipitation by PAb421 (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 1 and 4 with lanes 2 and 5), confirming that the dissociation of AHNAK from PAb421 immunoprecipitate results from direct interaction between S100B and AHNAK. Finally, we confirmed a strict Ca2+-dependent interaction between S100B and AHNAK by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.3). NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing S100B cDNA, and complex formation was assayed by co-immunoprecipitation. AHNAK co-immunoprecipitates with S100B from cell lysates containing Ca2+ and Zn2+ (Fig. 3, lane 5) but not in the presence of EGTA/EDTA (Fig. 3, lane 4). The co-immunoprecipitation of AHNAK with S100B was specific because it was not observed in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and3). In humans, the S100B protein is abundant in the adult central nervous system, where it accumulates in glial cells. We therefore evaluated the presence of AHNAK in two human astrocytoma cell lines (U373-MG and U87-MG) (Fig.4 A) and one rat glioma cell line (C6) (Fig. 4 B). Western blot analysis of crude cell extracts revealed that only human U-87-MG cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) and rat C6 cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) show strong AHNAK immunoreactivity. AHNAK was absent in the human astrocytoma cell line U-373-MG (Fig. 4 A, lane 2; see also Fig.5 A). Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B) as well as affinity batch interaction studies using [35S]methionine-labeled cells (Fig. 5) confirmed the strict calcium-dependent interaction of the AHNAK protein in U-87-MG cells and glial C6 cells with S100B-Sepharose beads. Note, here again, that most of the proteins that bound to S100B-Sepharose also bound to CaM-Sepharose and that AHNAK is the only protein that specifically bound to S100B-Sepharose beads in a strict Ca2+/Zn2+-dependent manner (Fig.5 B, lanes 3 and 4).Figure 5AHNAK is a major and specific calcium-dependent target for S100B in glial cell lines C6 and U87-MG. A, comparison of soluble proteins in human astrocytoma U373-MG (lanes 1 and 2) and U87-MG cells (lanes 3 and 4) that bound to Sepharose (lanes 1 and 3) or to S100B-Sepharose (lanes 2 and 4) in the presence of calcium.B, comparison of soluble proteins in glial C6 extract that interact with CaM-Sepharose (lanes 1 and 3) or S100B-Sepharose (lanes 2 and 4) in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence of calcium (lanes 3 and 4). In A andB, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 8 h before lysis. Cell extracts (1 ml) were incubated with 20 μl of either Sepharose or Sepharose coupled to CaM or S100B in the absence or presence of calcium. The bound proteins were electrophoresed on 5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A three-domain structure was predicted for AHNAK in which the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the protein flank a large internal domain (Fig. 6 A). The internal domain is composed of 30 repeated motifs, each of which is 128 residues long (27Shtivelman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The 128-residue motifs are, on average, ∼80% identical to each other with respect to amino acid sequence. The 128-residue repeat is characterized by underlying heptad repeats that are also found in the first portion of the carboxyl terminus. To investigate which domains of AHNAK are responsible for specific binding to S100B, the amino terminus (residues 1–251, N-DY), four complete repeating units of the central domain (residues 820–1330, M1-DY), and the carboxyl-terminal 1002 amino acids (C-DY) tagged with a Myc epitope were translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The interaction of the Myc-tagged AHNAK domains with anti-Myc and with S100B- or CaM-Sepharose was evaluated. The amino terminus was unable to bind to S100B- or CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 6 B). The carboxyl terminus was found to bind to S100B-Sepharose and, to a much lesser extent, to CaM-Sepharose in a strictly Ca2+/Zn2+-dependent manner (Fig. 6 C). The M1-DY domain showed absolutely no binding to CaM-Sepharose but interacted strongly with the S100B-Sepharose in a Ca2+/Zn2+-dependent manner (Fig.6 C). The specificity of the interaction of S100B with the M1-DY domain was confirmed by comparison with three other S100 proteins, S100A1, S100A6, and S100A11 (Fig. 6 D). Only S100A1-Sepharose showed a faint Ca2+-dependent interaction with M1-DY, albeit with a much lower avidity than S100B. To confirm the contribution of the AHNAK repeat units to S100B binding, we next analyzed the interaction of two bacterial recombinant fusion AHNAK domains containing different repeating units from the central domain (M2-DY and M3-DY, see Fig. 6 A) with S100B- and CaM-Sepharose. Both M2-DY and M3-DY specifically bound to S100B in a calcium-dependent manner but did not bind to CaM (Fig.7). The interaction between S100B and A"

Seventeen mutants with less than 50% of wild-type (WT) thrombin FV activation were identified and mapped to anion-binding exosite I (ABE-I), anion-binding exosite II (ABE-II), the Leu45-Asn57 insertion loop, and the Na+ binding loop of thrombin. Three ABE-I mutants (R68A, R70A, and Y71A) and the ABE-II mutant R98A had less than 30% of WT activity. The thrombin Na+ binding loop mutants, E229A and R233A, and the Leu45-Asn57 insertion loop mutant, W50A, had a major effect on FV activation with 5, 15, and 29% of WT activity, respectively. The K52A mutant, which maps to the S′ specificity pocket, had 29% of WT activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cleavage reactions using the thrombin ABE mutants R68A, Y71A, and R98A, the Na+ binding loop mutant E229A, and the Leu45-Asn57insertion loop mutant W50A showed a requirement for both ABEs and the Na+-bound form of thrombin for efficient cleavage at the FV residue Arg709. Several basic residues in both ABEs have moderate decreases in FV activation (40–60% of WT activity), indicating a role for the positive electrostatic fields generated by both ABEs in enhancing complex formation with complementary negative electrostatic fields generated by FV. The data show that thrombin activation of FV requires an extensive interaction interface with thrombin. Both ABE-I and ABE-II and the S′ subsite are required for optimal cleavage, and the Na+-bound form of thrombin is important for its procoagulant activity.

This functional versatility of thrombin is revealed by its structure (1Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Thrombin has the characteristic serine protease fold but differs in having a deep narrow active site cleft occluded by the Leu45-Asn57 (60 insertion loop) and Leu144-Gly155 (149 insertion loop) surface loops. Unique to thrombin are two cationic surface domains termed anion-binding exosite I (ABE-I)1 and II (ABE-II) that are important for the binding of ligands to overcome the steric hindrance of the occluded active site cleft. ABE-I is important for the binding of fibrinogen (2Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R.

The specific proteolytic cleavage of human factor V (FV) by the serine protease thrombin generates factor Va (FVa), which acts as a cofactor with factor Xa, prothrombin, and Ca2+ ions to form the prothrombinase complex on the surface of anionic phospholipids. This leads to the amplification of the coagulation pathway at the sites of vascular injury. FV, a single chain 330,000-kDa cofactor protein, is activated to FVa with the release of the B domain activation products (E fragment and C1 fragment) by cleavage at the residues Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 (21Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). FVa is composed of the 105-kDa heavy chain (A1-A2 domain) and the 74-kDa light chain (A3-C1-C2 domains) held together by a calcium ion (22Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Suzuki K. Dahlback B. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the light chain C2 domain implies a Ca2+-independent mode of binding to the phospholipid membrane via immersion of hydrophobic residues into the laminar membrane core, with direct interactions between the basic C2 domain residues and the negatively charged phosphatidylserine head groups and generalized complementary electrostatic interactions (24Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P. Nature. 1999; 402: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The heavy chain interacts with prothrombin, whereas both chains interact with factor Xa. As part of the prothrombinase complex, factor Xa has a 300,000-fold increase in catalytic efficiency in thrombin generation from prothrombin (25Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 6: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar). Specific cleavage of FV occurs preferentially first at Arg709, giving rise to the heavy chain, followed by cleavage at Arg1018 and then by the rate-limiting cleavage at Arg1545, which gives rise to the light chain. Cleavage of both Arg709 and Arg1545 is important for the full cofactor activity of factor Va, and the cleavage of Arg1018 enhances the rate of cleavage of Arg1545 (26Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, we used 53 mutant thrombins in which solvent-accessible polar and charged residues were substituted with alanine to fully define thrombin residues important in the recognition and cleavage of FV. This provided insights into the roles of the anion-binding exosites for specificity toward FV and of residues involved in substrate recognition and cleavage within the active site cleft. Purified human FV and FVa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. Factor V-deficient plasma and thromboplastin were purchased from Sigma. The expression and purification of wild-type (WT) and alanine-substituted mutant thrombins from Chinese hamster ovary cells and of the mutant R62Q from insect cells have been described in detail previously (27Hall S.W.

The concentration of active thrombin molecules was determined by titration with d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone using the chromogenic substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2266, Chromogenix, Sweden). The catalytic activity of the purified recombinant WT and mutant thrombins toward H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2238, Chromogenix, Sweden), fibrinogen, protein C, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) has been described (27Hall S.W.

Cleavage assays were performed in 50-μl volumes containing 300 nmhuman FV and 100 pm thrombin in assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 6000) at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reactions were then placed on ice. The concentration of FVa generated in the cleavage assay was determined by a one-stage clotting assay. Cleavage reactions were diluted 1000-fold in assay buffer on ice, and 50 μl was then added to 50 μl of FV-deficient plasma and left at room temperature for 10 min. The clotting assay was started with 100 μl of thromboplastin (containing 5 mm CaCl2 and equilibrated at room temperature), and the clotting reaction was monitored over time at 600 nm in a Softmax™ plate reader (Molecular Dynamics) at room temperature until maximum clotting was achieved (no further change in absorbance at 600 nm). The t 12 value was recorded as the time at which 50% clot formation occurred. The effective concentration of diluted human factor Va from the cleavage reaction in the clotting assay was determined from a calibration curve using various concentrations of purified human FVa versus thet 12 value for clotting. For mutants showing decreased clotting ability, dose-response curves were constructed over a range of thrombin concentrations using the above protocol. Cleavage reactions containing 300 nm human FV and 0.5 nm thrombin in assay buffer were incubated from 1 to 120 min before being terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis on 5–18% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then stained with biosafe Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). The intensity of Coomassie Blue-stained bands was determined by direct scanning of stained SDS-PAGE gels using the UMAX Astra 4000U scanner and Umax VistaScan 3.5.2 software. Scanned images were saved as TIFF files at a resolution of 600 dots per inch. Pixel densities were calculated for each band from TIFF files imported into Scion Image 1.62c. The x-ray crystal structure of thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5) bound with the active site inhibitord-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (entry 1PPB). Thrombin is depicted as a space-filling (CPK) model with solvent removed using the RasMol V2.5 software package. A site-directed mutagenesis strategy was used to determine residues on thrombin important for the interaction between thrombin and human FV necessary for activation of FV to FVa. Fifty-three thrombin mutants (Table I), where solvent-exposed polar and charged residues were mutated to alanine (27Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), were used in a two-stage clotting assay using purified human FV to assay FV activation. Seventeen thrombin mutants with ∼50% or less FV activation compared with WT thrombin were identified and mapped to ABE-I, ABE-II, the Leu45-Asn57insertion loop, and the Na+ binding loop (Fig.1, TableII). ABE-I had six residues (K21A, K65A, H66A, R70A, R73A, K77A) with less than 50% of WT activity. Two mutant thrombins showed less than 15% of WT activity (R68A, Y71A) (Fig. 1, Table II). The double mutant K106A/K107A showed only 24% of the WT type activity, indicating that the effects of the single mutations (K106A, 62%; K107A, 52%) were additive for the double mutant. Interestingly, substitution of Arg62 with Gln gave a greater decrease in clotting activity (23% of WT activity) compared with the alanine-substituted form of Arg62 (65% of WT activity). ABE-II showed one mutant (R98A) with greatly reduced FV activation (27% of WT activity), whereas two triple mutants (with a total of six residues substituted) showed less than 50% of WT activation (R89A/R93A/E94A and R245A/K248A/Q251A). Both the ABE-I and ABE-II mutants have normalk cat/K m values toward the chromogenic substrate S-2238, suggesting that the reduced activity is due to impaired binding to the exosites rather than to an effect on catalysis (Table I). The residues Glu229, Arg233, and Asp234 form part of a surface-exposed Na+ binding loop that modulates the activity of thrombin (29Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutation of each residue resulted in 5, 15, and 32% of WT activity, respectively. Interestingly, the E229A mutant shows a 13-fold reduction in thek cat/K m for S-2238 (K m = 36.3 μm;k cat = 33.2 s−1) compared with WT thrombin (K m= 4.7 μm; k cat = 55.9 s−1), whereas the remaining two mutants have normal catalysis toward S-2238, suggesting that substitution of Glu229 affects substrate binding within the active site cleft. Two residues, situated on the Leu45-Asn57 loop, also have reduced FV activation. Trp50 forms part of a hydrophobic “YPPW lid” that restricts the specificity of thrombin by occluding the active site, and Lys52 protrudes and contributes to the specificity of the S′ subsite (30Le Bonniec B.F. Myles T. Johnson T. Knight C.G. Tapparelli C. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7114-7122Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution at these residues showed FV activation of 29%. The mutant thrombin W50A has a 5-fold reduction in k cat/K m for S-2238, reflected by a 6-fold increase in K m , whereas K52A has normal catalysis toward S-2238. Mutation of Trp50, like Glu229, appears to alter the active site cleft, affecting substrate binding.Table IThrombin nomenclature and S-2238 amidolytic activities of purified thrombin mutantsMutation1-aNumbering of thrombin is based on human α-thrombin.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For mutants with a marked decreased in FV activation (less than 20% of WT activity), dose-response curves were constructed, because these responses in the screening assay may not be in the linear range for cleavage (Fig. 2). The mutants R68A and R233A had 12.5 and 15.4% of WT activity in the initial screen, each requiring 6-fold more thrombin to generate the same amount of human FVa generated by cleavage with 100 pm WT thrombin. The 6-fold more thrombin required for cleavage by the mutants corresponded well with the initial screen of the clotting assays. Consistent with this, the 5.2% of WT activity of E229A in the initial screen also corresponded well in requiring 12-fold more thrombin to generate the same amount of FVa obtained by 50 pm WT thrombin. The mutant W50A required 4-fold more thrombin to generate the same amount of FVa compared with 100 pm WT thrombin. Of all the mutants tested, Y71A appears to have had the greatest effect on cleavage of FV. Even at a concentration of 600 pm, only 25 nmol of FVa were produced in 30 min by Y71A, which is equivalent to a 30-fold decrease in FV activation by Y71A as compared with WT thrombin. SDS-PAGE analysis of cleavage reactions on FV by representative thrombin mutants of the major interaction interfaces (ABE-I, ABE-II, the Na+binding loop, and the Leu45-Asn57 loop) was employed to assess their role in the differential cleavage of the three thrombin cleavage sites Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 (Fig. 3, Aand B). Cleavage of FV at Arg709 by WT thrombin occurred within 1 min, with the appearance of the heavy chain (VaH). The 75-kDa band appearing within 2–5 min represents both the light chain (VaL) and the E fragment (generated by cleavage at Arg709 and Arg1018), which are difficult to resolve under these conditions. Within 5 min the majority of the 330-kDa FV was converted into VaH and other intermediate protein species. Within 30 min there was almost complete conversion to the VaL and VaH species. For the mutant thrombins W50A, R68A, and R98A, the VaH appeared to be delayed by 1–2 min compared with WT thrombin, with the intact protein persisting for 10 min, suggesting that cleavage at Arg709 is delayed. Generation of the VaH protein species in cleavage reactions for the mutants Y71A and E229A was further delayed, requiring 5–10 min before detection of the heavy chain. The appearance of the VaH chain by specific cleavage at Arg709 between WT and mutant thrombins was assessed by running cleavage products from 1-min and 5-min reactions on the same gel. This was performed to avoid making comparisons between several gels showing differing degrees of staining. The amount of VaH generated was quantified by scanning stained gels directly, the mean pixel density for each band was determined, and the results are presented as a percentage of the VaH band intensity generated by cleavage with WT thrombin (Fig.4). The effect of the Y71A and E229A substitutions on cleavage at Arg709 was most prominent, with almost undetectable levels of VaH at 1 min compared with WT thrombin (0.2 ± 0.5 and 2.4 ± 2.4% band intensity, respectively). After 5 min, the Y71A and E229A mutants generated only 5.1 ± 1.1 and 24.9 ± 3.0% of the VaH compared with WT thrombin. The effects of the R68A, W50A, and R98A substitutions were less severe, showing 26.0 ± 2.8, 34.8 ± 2.1, and 43.8 ± 2.7%, respectively, of the VaH band intensity respective to WT thrombin within 1 min. Cleavage reactions with the mutant thrombin W50A showed persistence of the E-C1-VaL protein species over the entire time course, suggesting impairment of cleavage at Arg1018. To confirm this, cleavage reactions of WT and W50A were run on the same gel (Fig. 3C), which clearly shows the persistence of the E-C1-VaL fragment over 120 min.Figure 4Comparison of human FV heavy chain release by WT and mutant thrombins. The intensity of Coomassie Blue-stained FV heavy chain bands (VaH) generated from cleavage reactions at 1 and 5 min for WT and thrombin mutants (W50A, R68A, Y71A, R98A, and E229A) was determined by direct scanning of stained SDS-PAGE gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The band intensity for each mutant is presented on the bar graph as the percent VaH band intensity with respect to WT thrombin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The appearance of the VaL species for the cleavage reactions by all the mutant thrombins was difficult to interpret, because cleavages at Arg709 and Arg1018 generate the E fragment, which comigrates with the VaL chain. In addition, cleavage at Arg1018 enhances cleavage at Arg1545 (32Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hence, it is difficult to assess the effect of the substitutions on cleavage at Arg1545. Using a total of 53 mutant thrombins, which have a total of 78 alanine substitutions, we were able to map the interaction interface between thrombin and FV using a two-stage clotting assay. This revealed an extensive binding surface that utilizes ABE-I, ABE-II, the Na+ binding loop, and the Leu45-Asn57 insertion loop (Fig.5). The ABE-I of thrombin is a surface patch with a high density of surface-exposed basic amino acids. This region extends away from the active site cleft and is essential for the binding of fibrinogen (2Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Eur. J.

Basic residues in ABE-I have a dual role in binding its many ligands. Studies with PAR1 (33Myles T. Le Bonniec B.F. Stone S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and hirudin (34Myles T. Le Bonniec B.F. Betz A. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4972-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) show that the ABE-I residues contribute to a positive electrostatic field that extends into the solvent. This is important for enhancing the rate of complex formation with complementary electrostatic fields generated by its ligands (electrostatic steering). Secondly, basic residues are used for direct interactions in complex formation (ionic tethering), although which residue is involved differs between the various ligands (33Myles T. Le Bonniec B.F.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4972-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ABE-I also has a number of hydrophobic residues important for hydrophobic interactions with PAR1 (9Mathews I.I.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), thrombomodulin (35Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and hirudin (14Grütter M. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R.

Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution of the ABE-I residues Arg68, His66, Arg70, and Tyr71 significantly reduced FV activation, which was due to impaired binding within ABE-I rather than to a direct effect on catalysis. The mutations either affect direct interactions with FV or indirectly affect local protein structure. Both Arg68 and Arg70 have been shown to form direct interactions with ligands in the crystal structure of thrombin bound to either a peptide based on the N-terminal domain of the PAR1 receptor (Arg68) (9Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Ishii M. Chen J. Turck C.W. Coughlin S. Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or the C-terminal tail of hirudin (Arg68 and Arg70) (14Grütter M. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W.

Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that these residues may also be in direct interactions with FV. Likewise, the residue Tyr71 is important for hydrophobic interactions with the C-terminal tail of hirudin (14Grütter M. Priestle J.P. Rahuel J. Grossenbacher H. Bode W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2361-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 15Rydel T.J. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton J.W.

Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The substitution of residue His66 has a large effect on FV activation; however, this residue does not make any direct interactions as seen in the published crystal structures of thrombin bound with various ligands. Furthermore, the H66A mutation has a large effect on the thrombomodulin-dependent activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and protein C (27Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, the crystal structure of thrombin bound with the 4–5-6 epidermal growth factor-like domains of thrombomodulin showed that this residue makes no direct major interactions (35Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Together with the observation of normal catalysis toward S-2238, would suggest that the H66A substitution has a local effect on the binding in ABE-I. Interestingly, the effect of substitution of Arg62 with Gln is more severe than that seen with Ala. The effect of the R62Q mutation is similar to that of the dysthrombin Quick I (R62C), where the cysteine substitution appears to distort the 60–70 autolysis loop, affecting the binding of hirudin (36Stone S.R. Schmitz T. Henriksen R.A. Hofsteenge J. Dodt J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6392-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), fibrinogen (37Henriksen R.A. Mann K.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3321-3327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) within ABE-I. Hence, it appears that alanine substitution does not affect loop structure to the same degree as glutamine or cysteine substitutions. The role of ABE-I in the recognition and cleavage at the thrombin cleavage sites within FV was difficult to determine because of the complexity of cleavage patterns on SDS-PAGE. What is clear from cleavage studies using the ABE-I mutants of Arg68 and Tyr71 is the importance of ABE-I in the recognition and cleavage of FV at Arg709. These studies suggest a major interaction with a hirudin-like domain N-terminal to the Arg709 cleavage site (21Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J.

The ABE-II, which is located on the opposite side of the molecule, is involved in the binding of glycosaminoglycan-bound serpins antithrombin III (6Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J.

The mutant thrombins R98A and R89/R93/E94A have an effect on the activation of FV (27–40% of WT activity), suggesting an important role for the interaction of ABE-II with human FV. The importance of these three residues has been shown by Esmon and Lollar (19Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13882-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using the triple thrombin mutant R89A/R93A/R98A, which had a greatly reduced ability to activate bovine FV. The residues Arg89 and Arg98 lie in close proximity (4 Å), whereas Arg93 is over 12 Å away from these residues (Fig.5). Mutation of these residues impairs heparin binding and heparin-ATIII-accelerated inhibition of thrombin (41Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chondroitin sulfate-enhanced affinity of thrombomodulin to ABE-II (41Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R98A substitution has a major effect on cleavage of Arg709on FV, and this effect compares well with cleavage studies of bovine FV using the thrombin triple mutant RA (R89A/R93A/R98A), suggesting a role of ABE-II for cleavage of human FV at Arg709 (19Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13882-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is less clear whether both ABE-I and ABE-II are important for cleavage at Arg1018 and Arg1545. Studies by Thorelli et al. (26Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) show that cleavage at Arg1018 facilitates cleavage at Arg1545. Therefore, the late appearance of the VaL could be a direct consequence of poor cleavage of Arg1018 delaying the appearance of the C1-VaL species and subsequent cleavage at Arg1545, or the mutations may directly affect recognition and cleavage at the individual cleavage sites. The effect of the ABE-I and ABE-II mutations on cleavage of Arg1018 and Arg1545 was difficult to determine because of comigration of the E-fragment and VaL on SDS-PAGE. Several residues in both ABE-I and ABE-II have reduced FV activation ranging from 52% (K107A) to 65% (R62A). However, the magnitude in reduction suggests that these residues are unlikely to participate in major interactions. Mutagenesis studies support the hypothesis that ABE-I basic residues, not involved in direct interactions with hirudin (33Myles T. Le Bonniec B.F. Stone S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or PAR1 (34Myles T. Le Bonniec B.F. Betz A. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4972-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), make small but collectively important contributions to the localized positive electrostatic field generated by ABE-I. Hence, it is likely that both ABE-I and ABE-II positive electrostatic fields are important in enhancing complex formation through the interaction of complementary electrostatic fields with FV (42Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 43Karshikov A. Bode W. Tulinsky A. Stone S.R. Protein Sci. 1992; 6: 727-735Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both Arg709 and Arg1545 have sequences N-terminal to the cleavage site with a high density of acidic residues, which, if exposed to the solvent, could contribute to a negative electrostatic potential, allowing rate enhancement by electrostatic steering with complementary electrostatic fields of thrombin ABE-I and -II. The residues Glu229 and Arg233 make ion pair interactions with residues Lys236 and Asp146, respectively, which are important for maintaining the structural integrity of the Na+ binding loop (44Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 45Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11185-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutation of either residue leads to a conformational change of the Na+binding loop, favoring the anticoagulant form of thrombin (46Lai M.T. Di Cera E. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30275-30282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, E229A and R233A showed markedly reduced FV activation, suggesting that efficient recognition and cleavage of FV requires the Na+ form of thrombin. The thrombin substitution W50A appears to have an effect on recognition and cleavage at Arg709, but the persistence of the E-C1-Val species shows that recognition and cleavage at Arg1018 is also impaired. Trp50 is spatially well separated (17 Å) from the Na+-binding site; however, mutation of Trp50 may have an indirect effect on the Na+binding loop. Substitution of Trp50 with serine appears to affect Na+ binding and favors the anticoagulant form of thrombin with enhanced protein C specificity (45Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11185-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Likewise, it is possible that alanine substitution of Trp50 could favor the anticoagulant form of thrombin with reduced ability to activate FV. Specificity of the thrombin S1′ substrate binding site is restricted to small polar P1′ residues, due in part to occlusion by the Lys52 side chain (1Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution of this residue resulted in a decrease in FV activation, suggesting a role for this residue and the S1′ subsite in defining the specificity of thrombin toward FV. Alanine substitution of this residue has also been shown to be important in defining the specificity of thrombin toward antithrombin III (31Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and fibrinogen (12Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In summary, thrombin activation of human FV requires an extensive interaction interface involving ABE-I, ABE-II, the Leu45-Asn57 loop, and the Na+binding form of thrombin. It will be interesting to analyze and compare the structural requirements for the activation of human factor VIII, which is homologous to human FV and important for the assembly of the intrinsic tenase enzyme complex."

In vitro, ATBF1-A was expressed in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts, but its expression levels decreased upon induction of myogenic differentiation in low serum medium.

Several groups of muscle-specific and ubiquitous regulatory proteins play major roles in establishing these processes. The MyoD family of muscle regulatory factors (MRFs),1 which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix class of transcription factors act in a hierarchic manner with MyoD and myf5 involved in the determination of the myogenic lineage and myogenin and MRF4 in the execution of the differentiation program (for review, see Refs. 1Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar and2Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). These MyoD family MRFs form heterodimers with ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix proteins, known as E proteins, to bind and regulate E-box elements found in the regulatory regions of muscle-specific genes (1Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 2Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Forced expression of MyoD in certain non-muscle cells drives these cells to the myogenic lineage leading to activation of muscle-specific genes (3Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 4Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Myogenic activity of the MyoD family genes has been shown to be enhanced by the myocyte enhancer factor-2 proteins, which belong to the MADS-box family of transcription factors (5Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These proteins are expressed at the onset of myogenic differentiation and interact physically with MyoD family MRFs and bind to AT-rich elements often positioned in close proximity to E-boxes in the control regions of muscle-specific genes (6Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 7Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to positive action of the MyoD-MRFs described above, myogenesis is controlled by proteins acting in a negative manner. The Id family of proteins, which contain the helix-loop-helix motif but lack the basic DNA binding domain, interacts with E proteins or the MyoD family proteins forming complexes incapable of binding to E-boxes (8Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 9Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Id genes are expressed in proliferating myoblasts but not in differentiating myotubes, and forced expression of Id in myoblasts can delay myogenic differentiation (11Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, there are several transcription factors that inhibit myogenic differentiation through active transcriptional repressive mechanisms. MyoR and Mist1, which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, form heterodimers with E proteins and bind to E-box elements in the promoters of myogenic genes to repress their transcription actively (12Lu J. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Lemercier C. To R.Q. Swanson B.J. Lyons G.E. Konieczny S.F. Dev.

MyoR and Mist are expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts, but their expression is down-regulated during differentiation to allow the MyoD family MRFs to execute the myogenic program. A zinc finger homeodomain protein, ZEB, also binds to E-box elements and inhibits transcription of muscle-specific genes (15Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Postigo, A. A., Ward, E., Skeath, J. B., and Dean, D. C. (1999) 19, 7255–7263.Google Scholar). ZEB is expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts, and as muscle differentiation is induced, the MyoD family MRF proteins accumulate to high levels to displace ZEB from E-boxes alleviating the transcriptional repression (15Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, progression of muscle differentiation depends on a balance between the positive and negative regulatory factors. ATBF1 belongs to a family of proteins containing both homeodomains and zinc finger motifs that are believed to play roles in the growth and differentiation of mesoderm and neuroectoderm tissues in both vertebrates and invertebrates (15Postigo A.A.

ATBF1-B binds to an AT-rich element in the enhancer and promoter of the human α-fetoprotein (AFP) gene and down-regulates their activities (25Yasuda H. Mizuno A. Tamaoki T. Morinaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of ATBF1-A expression in developing mice showed that ATBF1-A mRNA levels are high in the 13.5-day fetal brain and decrease subsequently through postnatal development (26Watanabe M. Miura Y. Ido A. Sakai M. Nishi S. Inoue Y. Hashimoto T. Tamaoki T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells, ATBF1-A is not detected in undifferentiated cells but is expressed when neuronal differentiation is induced by treatment with retinoic acid (22Ido A. Miura Y. Tamaoki T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Miura Y. Tam T. Ido A. Morinaga T. Miki T. Hashimoto T. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26840-26848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Induction of muscle cells from P19 cells by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide is also accompanied by ATBF1-A mRNA expression (22Ido A. Miura Y. Tamaoki T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although this expression is not as prominent as that observed in neural differentiation, this raised the possibility that ATBF1-A is also involved in myogenesis. This is of interest considering that muscle and neuronal differentiation employ similar regulatory mechanisms, such as the use of a hierarchy of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, the myocyte enhancer factor-2 family of cofactors (2Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Black B.L. Ligon K.L. Zhang Y. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26659-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and likely Id proteins (28Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of ATBF1 isoforms in myogenesis using C2C12 myoblasts, which can be induced to undergo terminal differentiation by low serum conditions. We found that forced expression of ATBF1-A and ATBF1-B in C2C12 cells resulted in inhibition and promotion of myogenic differentiation of these cells, respectively. In addition we show that ATBF1-A extinguishes MyoD and myogenin expression and inhibits MyoD-induced activation of the MRF4 promoter. Our results suggest that ATBF1-A is an inhibitor of myogenesis, and its down-regulation is essential for terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells. pPOP-ME(F), ATBF1-A expression vector, and pPOP-ME(R) antisense ATBF1 expression vector were constructed by cloning the full-length human ATBF1-A cDNA into pPOP (29McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Jardine K. Sutherland L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ATBF1-B expression vectors, pPOP-E and pcATBF1, were constructed by cloning the full-length human ATBF1-B cDNA into pPOP and pcDNA1 (Invitrogen), respectively. pPOP, pgkMyoD (mouse MyoD expression vector), and p65-7 (rat myogenin cDNA) were kind gifts from Dr. M. W. McBurney (University of Ottawa). pcDNA3.1-Id3 (human Id3 expression vector) was kindly provided by Dr. B. A. Christy (University of Texas), pRCCycD (human cyclin D1 cDNA) by Dr. K. Riabowal (University of Calgary), and pMRF4-CAT by Dr. E. N. Olson (University of Texas). pBX151 and pMD14 ATBF1 cDNAs used to prepare riboprobes for RNase protection assays of mouse and human ATBF1 mRNA, respectively, have been described previously (24Miura Y. Tam T. Ido A. Morinaga T. Miki T. Hashimoto T. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26840-26848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The plasmid pMRF4-luc was prepared from pMRF4-CAT, kindly provided by Dr. E. N. Olson, by digestion of pMRF4-CAT withXbaI and HindIII, which liberated the mouse MRF4 promoter element, end-filled with Klenow, and sublconed into pUBT-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid. C2C12 myoblasts and 10T1/2 fibroblasts were maintained in growth medium (GM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To induce myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, subconfluent cultures were switched from GM to differentiation medium (DM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum. Total RNA was isolated by the acid-phenol procedure (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of total RNA was analyzed by RNase protection assay as described previously (24Miura Y. Tam T. Ido A. Morinaga T. Miki T. Hashimoto T. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26840-26848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane (22Ido A. Miura Y. Tamaoki T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and hybridized with the following 32P-labeled probes: a 695-base pair EcoRI-PstI fragment of p65-7 for myogenin mRNA, a 2.2-kb BamHI fragment of pgkMyoD for MyoD mRNA, a 550-base pair EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3.1-Id3 for Id3 mRNA and a 1.1-kilobase pairHindIII-NotI fragment of pRCCycD for cyclin D1 mRNA. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the T7 Quickprime random primer labeling system as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In all cases, cDNA was synthesized from 8 μg of RNA using random hexamers and a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ATBF1-A cDNA was amplified for 24 cycles using 5′-TCGGATGCCCAGTTCATGATGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGCAGCTTGCACTGGTAAG-3′. For ATBF1-B, cDNA amplification was performed in two steps, first with 5′-TTTCGGGATTAAAAGCGCCGCCAGCTC-3′ and 5′-CGGCAGCTTGCACTGGTAAG-3′ as primers and 20 cycles of reaction and then using 5′-CCGCCGGAGAAGCAACCGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCGCTCCACGTTCATGTG-3′ as primers and 21 cycles of reaction. Glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was amplified using 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ and 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′ as primers and 23 cycles of reaction. For stable transfections, 20 μg of pPOP-ME, pcATBF1, pPOP, or pcDNA1 along with 4 μg of pCI-NEO (Strategene) were transfected into C2C12 cells using the high efficiency calcium phosphate method (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in GM containing 400 μg/ml G418, and colonies were isolated and propagated. For myogenic conversion assays, 10T1/2 fibroblasts in GM were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pPGK-MyoD and 1 μg of pPOP-ME, pPOP-E, or pPOP-MER using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, transferred to DM, and incubated for 4 days. For MRF4 promoter assays, 10T1/2 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pMRF4-luc, 0.5 μg of pPGK-MyoD, 0.5 μg of pCH110, and 0.5 μg of the respective ATBF1 expression vector using Superfect, as described above. Cells were transferred to DM, incubated for 2 days, and analyzed for luciferase and β-galatosidase activities using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and β-galactosidase assay system (Promega), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols. The yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4DB) was fused in-frame to the N terminus of human ATBF1-A and -B proteins to generate the vectors ATBF1-A-Gal4DB and ATBF1-B-Gal4DB, respectively. In addition the Gal4DB was attached to the ATBF1-A N terminus to create N-term-Gal4DB. G4tk-luc contains four Gal4 binding sites upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter. C2C12 cells were transfected in GM with 0.5 μg of G4tk-luc, 0.5 μg of Gal4DB fusion protein, 0.5 μg of pCH110, and 0.5 μg of empty pPOP expression vector. Cells were incubated in GM for 48 h, and luciferase activity was analyzed as described above. Cells were grown on 6- or 24-well plates, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then fixed in a 70% ethanol, 10% formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid solution at −20 °C for 10 min. The cells were rehydrated with PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with a monoclonal antibody against myosin heavy chain (MHC) (MF-20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) (32Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in PBS supplemented with 5% goat serum. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 37 °C. After two washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with 0.3% diaminobenzidine and 0.15% H2O2 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS for 5 min and stained with 0.05% Cresyl Violet. ATBF1-A cDNA fragments were subcloned in-frame with the histidine tag sequence into pET30 (a, b, or c) vectors (Novagen). The recombinant proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3LysS), and the expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyanoside. Three hours after induction, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Ni2+-column binding buffer containing 2 mmMgCl2, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 1 μmleupeptin, 2 μm benzamide, 20 μmpA-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin, and lysed by freezing and thawing in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. The host DNA was digested with 5 mg/ml DNase I on ice for 20 min. The bacterial lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-nitrilotriatic acid-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). One ml of the eluted protein solution was concentrated to 50 μl with a Centricon-30 microfiltration column (Amicon) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The recombinant protein was stored at −80 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared from C2C12 and 10T1/2 fibroblasts essentially as described by Lassar et al. (33Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) or bacterially expressed proteins (5 ng) were incubated in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for 10 min at room temperature. The appropriate probes were added at a concentration of 5 pg/μl (30,000 cpm total), and the reaction mixture was incubated further for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in of 50 mm Tris, 50 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. The probe used was A/E1, 5′-ACGTTAATTAAATGCCATCTGGGTG-3′, corresponding to the region of the mouse MRF4 promoter containing an E-box (underlined) and an AT rich sequence (double underlined) (39Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2889-2892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with a 4-base pair overhang to facilitate labeling with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow. For supershift assays, 1 μl of α D4, a rabbit polyclonal raised against the fourth homeodomain of ATBF1, 1 μl of C20, a MyoD polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 5 μl of F5D myogenin hybridoma supernatant (7Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was added to the reaction mixtures prior to the addition of probe DNA. AHindIII-XbaI fragment of the MRF4 promoter was subcloned from pMRF4-CAT vector into in pBluescipt KS(+). The AT-rich element, located at positions 11–19, was mutated in the pBSMRF4 construct by PCR mutagenesis. The MRF4/AT mutant was created by replacing nucleotides 11 (T→G), 16 (A→G), and 17 (A→C) using mMRF4/AT primer 5′-(GGGTCGACTTATGTCACCGCACgAATTgcATGC-3′) and the T7 primer. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. The mutations were verified by sequencing. The wild-type and mutant MRF4 promoter constructs were digested with SalI and XbaI, [32P]dCTP labeled with Klenow polymerase, and used as probes in gel mobility shift assays. Analysis of ATBF1-A mRNA by RNase protection assay showed that ATBF1-A mRNA was expressed in C2C12 myoblasts proliferating in GM (Fig. 1A). Upon transfer of the cells to DM to induce myogenic differentiation, ATBF1-A mRNA expression declined markedly within 24 h and remained low for 72 h (Fig. 1A). Consistent with these observations, ATBF1-A mRNA was barely detectable in differentiated skeletal muscle tissue isolated from a 7-day-old mouse (Fig.1B). These results, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that ATBF1-A is expressed preferentially in undifferentiated muscle and suggest that down-regulation of its expression may be required for terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle. ATBF1-B mRNA could not be detected by Northern blotting or RNase protection assay either before or after differentiation of C2C12 cells. We therefore performed RT-PCR analysis of ATBF-B mRNA levels in undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells. We found that ATBF1-B mRNA levels were essentially unchanged after differentiation compared with 90% decrease in ATBF1-A mRNA levels after differentiation (Fig. 1C). These results show that the relative levels of ATBF1-B increase during myogenic differentiation and suggest that the ATBF1 isoforms may play opposing roles in this differentiation pathway. To examine further whether ATBF1-A regulates myogenic differentiation, we transfected C2C12 cells with a vector expressing the human ATBF1-A cDNA. Three stably transfected clones, A2, A6, and A19, which expressed high, medium, and low levels of ATBF1-A mRNA, respectively (Fig. 2A), were selected and then analyzed for their ability to undergo myogenic differentiation in DM. After 4 days of incubation in DM, control C2C12 cells that were not transfected or transfected with the empty expression vector showed extensive formation of multinucleated myotubes, positive for MHC expression (Fig. 2B, panels b and c). In contrast, ATBF1-A-transfected cells showed either no MHC-positive cells (Fig. 2B, panels dand e) or only a small number of mononucleated MHC-positive cells (Fig. 2B, panel f). In terms of the fusion index, representing the percentage of nuclei present in multinucleated myotubes per field of view (34Yoshida S. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Taki T. Arai K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), myogenic differentiation was reduced 99, 90, and 80% in A2, A6, and A19 cells, respectively, compared with control cells (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that forced expression of ATBF1-A inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. The progression of myogenic differentiation is accompanied by the induction of positive-acting MRFs including MyoD and myogenin (2Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 35Walsh K. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas expression of the inhibitory factor Id3 is down-regulated (9Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1815-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In control C2C12 cells, after transfer from GM to DM, levels of MyoD and myogenin mRNA increased, whereas Id3 mRNA levels decreased as differentiation proceeded (Fig. 3,lanes 1–4). In A6 cells, MyoD and myogenin mRNA were not expressed in cells grown in GM, and no increase in MyoD and myogenin mRNA levels was observed after the transfer of the cells to DM to induce differentiation (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and6). Expression of Id3 mRNA in A6 cells in GM was much higher than that in control cells (Fig. 3, lane 5), and although its expression level was reduced after transfer to DM, it remained comparable or higher than that in undifferentiated, control cells in GM (Fig. 3, lane 6). The initiation of C2C12 differentiation is also accompanied by changes in expression cell cycle regulatory factors, including the induction of p21CIP1/WAF1 and the reduction of cyclin D1 mRNA levels (36Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 37Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C.

Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). We confirmed that levels of p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA were elevated, and cyclinD1 mRNA levels were reduced in control cells following transfer from GM to DM (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4). No induction of p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA was observed in A6 cells when transferred from GM to DM (Fig. 3, lane 6). In addition, cyclin D1 mRNA levels remained elevated in A6 cells compared with those in control cells in DM (Fig. 3, lane 6). These results show that forced expression of ATBF1-A in C2C12 cells affects the expression of the regulatory factors that control the cell cycle progression as well as myogenic differentiation. The ATBF1-B isoform differs from ATBF1-A in that it lacks 920 amino acid residues at the N terminus (24Miura Y. Tam T. Ido A. Morinaga T. Miki T. Hashimoto T. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26840-26848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To analyze whether this isoform has any function in myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, we stably transfected C2C12 cells with a vector expressing the human ATBF1-B cDNA. Three clonal cell lines, B3, B5, and B6 (Fig.4A), were selected and analyzed for the ability to differentiate in DM. We found that these cells exhibited enhanced myogenic differentiation, showing 25–40% higher fusion indices than control cells after 4 days in DM (Fig.4B). Time course analysis of MHC expression showed that B6 cells generated multinucleated MHC-positive cells within 24 h after the transfer to DM (Fig. 4C, middle right panel) and formed well advanced myotubes at 36 h (Fig.4C, bottom right panel). In contrast, control cells transfected with the empty vector were devoid of MHC-positive cells at 24 h (Fig. 4C, middle left panel) and formed early myotubes at 36 h (Fig. 4C,bottom left panel). These results show that the ATBF1-B isoform promotes myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. 10T1/2 fibroblasts transdifferentiate to the myogenic lineage when transfected with MyoD (3Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). To examine whether ATBF1-A or -B affects MyoD-dependent myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 cells, we transfected these cells with a MyoD expression vector with or without the ATBF1-A or -B expression vector. The cells were then transferred to DM, incubated for 4 days, and stained for MHC expression (Fig.5A). We found that transfec"

Thrombin is a critical enzyme of the clotting cascade initiating platelet activation and conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Prothrombin is activated to thrombin on cell surfaces by the prothrombinase complex, a calcium-dependent macromolecular complex consisting of factor Xa, factor Va, and phospholipid membranes. Factor Xa alone is capable of catalyzing this conversion. However, the protein cofactor, factor Va, and phospholipid membranes significantly enhance the rate of this reaction, facilitating prothrombin activation at a physiological rate (1Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this enhancement is due to co-localization of the enzyme, cofactor, and substrate on the membrane surface (2Furie B. Furie B.C.

A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the metal-free and calcium-bound conformers of the prothrombin, factor IX, and factor X Gla domains demonstrate that following calcium binding most of the Gla residues become internalized, resulting in the solvent exposure of three hydrophobic amino acids within a calcium-induced N-terminal loop (ω-loop) from residue 1 to residue 11 (18–20). These residues have been implicated in the binding of vitamin K-dependent proteins to phospholipid membranes (18Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.H. Tulinsky A.

However, the importance of the ω-loop hydrophobic amino acids in the phospholipid binding of Gla domain-containing proteins has recently been challenged (15Nelsestuen G.L. Shah A.M. Harvery S.B.

The current study investigates the role of the ω-loop region in phospholipid binding using a synthetic peptide, PT-(1–46)F4W, in which Phe-4 is replaced with Trp. This modification provides a fluorescent probe within this region. PT-(1–46)F4W possesses all the anticipated properties of the prothrombin Gla domain, including the ability to undergo calcium-induced conformational changes, interact with anionic phospholipid vesicles and inhibit activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex. We demonstrate that Trp-4 interacts within the interfacial region of anionic phospholipid vesicles, consistent with the general finding that tryptophan residues involved in membrane binding are predominantly positioned at the membrane interface (27Ghosh A.K. Rukmini R. Chattopadhyay A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14291-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Chattopadhyay A. Mukherjee S. Rukmini R. Rawat S.S. Sudha S. Biophys.

These data indicate that the ω-loop region of the prothrombin Gla domain participates in a specific interaction with anionic phospholipid membranes and likely inserts into the interfacial membrane region.RESULTSA peptide based on the N-terminal 46 residues of human prothrombin, PT-(1–46), was previously synthesized and characterized (26Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38120-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have synthesized an analog of PT-(1–46), PT-(1–46)F4W, with Phe-4 replaced by Trp (Table I). PT-(1–46)F4W has an intrinsic fluorescence probe within the hydrophobic ω-loop (residues 1–11) allowing us to probe the interaction of this region of the peptide with phospholipid vesicles. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was confirmed by automated Edman degradation and amino acid analysis (data not shown). The molecular mass of the peptide, determined by MALDI mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode, was 5308 daltons, which corresponds with the theoretical molecular mass of the decarboxylated peptide (5308.2 daltons).Table IAmino acid sequences of prothrombin peptidesPeptideSequencePT-(1–46)NH2-ANTFLγγVRKGNLγRγCVγγTCSYγγAFγALγSSTATDVFWAKYTA-COOHPT-(1–46)F4WNH2-ANTWLγγVRKGNLγRγCVγγTCSYγγAFγALγSSTATDVFWAKYTA-COOH Open table in a new tab PT-(1–46)F4W was characterized as described for PT-(1–46) (26Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C.

Initially, we assessed the ability of the peptide to undergo a calcium-dependent conformational alteration using intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig.1 A). The peptide was excited at 280 nm, and the emission was monitored at 340 nm. PT-(1–46)F4W contains two tryptophan residues and two tyrosine residues; however, the intrinsic fluorescence is predominantly attributed to Trp-4 and Trp-41, as demonstrated by excitation and emission scans. Quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of PT-(1–46)F4W was observed with increasing CaCl2 concentration with a maximal quenching of 19 ± 3%. Half-maximal quenching occurred at 1.1 ± 0.1 mm CaCl2. In control experiments performed with PT-(1–46), in which all intrinsic fluorescence is attributed to Trp-41, maximal quenching of 35 ± 5% was observed with half-maximal quenching at 1.0 ± 0.1 mmCaCl2. The calcium-induced quenching of both peptides was reversed upon the addition of EDTA (Fig. 1 A). These results demonstrate that PT-(1–46)F4W undergoes a calcium-induced conformational alteration, similar to that described previously for PT-(1–46), FIX-(1–47), prothrombin fragment 1, and prothrombin (26Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38120-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that PT-(1–46)F4W binds phospholipid membranes in a calcium-dependent manner, analogous to PT-(1–46). This binding was measured using 90° light scattering. Titration of incremental amounts of PT-(1–46)F4W or PT-(1–46) into 80% PC/20% PS phospholipid vesicles in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2demonstrated saturable binding (Fig. 1 B). The binding was shown to be calcium-dependent and reversible by the addition of EDTA (Fig. 1 B). In our experiments the light scattering intensity of peptide alone counts for <10% of the total scattering intensity; therefore, no correction was needed for changes in the light refractive index. These data were fit to a bimolecular equilibrium model (35Gilbert G.E. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dissociation constants,Kd, values of 260 ± 80 nm and 220 ± 90 nm were calculated for PT-(1–46)F4W and PT-(1–46), respectively, which are in good agreement with literature values (26Blostein M.D. Rigby A.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38120-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The ability of PT-(1–46)F4W to inhibit the prothrombinase reaction was investigated and compared with PT-(1–46) (Fig. 1 C). PT-(1–46)F4W inhibited thrombin generation when incubated with prothrombin, factor Xa, and factor Va in the presence of 80% PC/20% PS phospholipid vesicles and 2 mm CaCl2. Thrombin generation was completely inhibited at 50 μmPT-(1–46)F4W.PT-(1–46)F4W has a maximum emission wavelength of 350 nm, suggesting that the fluorescence emission is primarily due to Trp-4 and Trp-41. The addition of 80% PC/20% PS phospholipid vesicles to PT-(1–46)F4W resulted in a modest blue shift of 5 nm (Fig.2 A). This blue shift was calcium-dependent, as evident from the reversal of the blue shift upon the addition of EDTA (data not shown). Under identical experimental conditions, no blue shift was seen with PT-(1–46) (Fig.2 B). Similarly, no blue shift was seen for either peptide in the presence of phospholipid vesicles composed entirely of PC (100% PC) that do not bind prothrombin. In control experiments we measured the light scattering effects of these phospholipid vesicles on a reference fluorophore, l-tryptophan (33Ladokhin A.S. Sajith J. White S.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This is of particular importance when measuring fluorescence in the presence of 100% PC vesicles, which are prone to aggregation (36Lentz B.R. Alford D.R. Jones M.E. Dombrose F.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6997-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The addition of 100% PC vesicles resulted in a 20–30% decrease in both the fluorescence of the peptide and reference sample (data not shown). Based on these results, the emission spectra were corrected for light scattering effects (33Ladokhin A.S. Sajith J. White S.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the environment of Trp-41 is unaltered by the addition of PS-containing phospholipid vesicles to the Gla domain peptides in the presence of calcium ions, whereas Trp-4 is in a less polar, more hydrophobic environment in the presence of these vesicles, suggesting that Trp-4 has partitioned into the phospholipid membrane. These results are consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of calcium-bound bovine prothrombin fragment 1, containing the Gla domain, aromatic amino acid stack domain, and kringle 1 domain of prothrombin (18Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.H. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this structure Trp-42 (equivalent to Trp-41 in human prothrombin) is juxtaposed to the disulfide bond in the Gla domain and is buried in the interior of the protein. The position of Trp-4 relative to the membrane surface strongly governs its fluorescent properties (37Ren J. Lew S. Wang J. London E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The modest blue shift observed for Trp-4 suggests that it is within the interfacial region. In addition to the observed blue shift, the 80% PC/20% PS vesicles caused an increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of both peptides (Fig.2, A and B). This fluorescence enhancement is most likely due to an increased lifetime of the tryptophan fluorescence following binding to the phospholipid vesicles as described previously.Figure 2Fluorescence emission spectra of PT-(1–46) or PT-(1–46)F4W in the presence or absence of phospholipid vesicles. The emission spectrum of 1 μm peptide in the presence or absence of 100 μm 80% PC/20% PS or 100 μm 100% PC vesicles was monitored. The fluorescence emission spectra of PT-(1–46)F4W alone (○), in the presence of 100% PC vesicles (●) or in the presence of 80% PC/20% PS vesicles (▾) were compared. Panel B, the fluorescence emission spectra of PT-(1–46) alone (○), in the presence of 100% PC vesicles (●) or in the presence of 80% PC/20% PS vesicles (▾) were compared.

Spectra were normalized with respect to the fluorescence of the peptides alone and corrected for attenuation of the fluorescence signal due to light scattering effects upon the addition of phospholipid vesicles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the interaction of PT-(1–46)F4W with membranes, we used wavelength-selective fluorescence spectroscopy or red-edge excitation shift spectroscopy, which provides an additional approach for monitoring the environment and dynamics of fluorophores in complex biological systems (27Ghosh A.K. Rukmini R. Chattopadhyay A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14291-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 34Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 227-289Google Scholar, 38Demchenko A. Essays Biochem. 1986; 22: 120-157PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of the tryptophan residues in PT-(1–46)F4W and PT-(1–46) as a function of excitation wavelength are shown in Fig.3. No shift in the fluorescence maximum was seen for PT-(1–46) or PT-(1–46)F4W in the presence of 100% PC phospholipid vesicles, which do not support prothrombin binding or function. Upon the addition of 80% PC/20% PS vesicles, the emission maximum for PT-(1–46) was not shifted, whereas the emission maximum for PT-(1–46)F4W was shifted from 350 to 378 nm. The 28 nm shift in emission maximum with increasing excitation wavelength for PT-(1–46)F4W indicates that Trp-4 of PT-(1–46)F4W is localized in a motionally restricted environment in the presence of 80% PC/20% PS vesicles. Red-edge excitation shifts primarily result from a decreased rate of solvent relaxation for those solvent molecules around the excited state fluorophore. This is due to motional restrictions imposed on these solvent molecules by their environment (27Ghosh A.K. Rukmini R. Chattopadhyay A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14291-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 34Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14291-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The significant red-edge effect demonstrated for PT-(1–46)F4W argues that Trp-4 interacts with the heterogeneous motionally restricted interfacial region of the phospholipid membrane (27Ghosh A.K.

Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), to assess the ability of PS-containing membranes to effectively shield tryptophan quenching of PT-(1–46)F4W and PT-(1–46). In the absence of phospholipid vesicles, iodide quenched PT-(1–46)F4W and PT-(1–46) intrinsic fluorescence 80% at the highest concentration of quenching agent used (Figs.4, A and B). In the presence of 80% PC/20% PS phospholipid vesicles, we observed 45% quenching of PT-(1–46)F4W fluorescence intensity. At the same KI concentration (0.2 m), PT-(1–46)F4W fluorescence was not protected from quenching in the presence of 100% PC vesicles (Fig.4 A). The presence of vesicles of either composition did not protect PT-(1–46) fluorescence from quenching by 0.2 m KI (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that PS-containing vesicles effectively shield one population of tryptophan residues in PT-(1–46)F4W and that Trp-4 is protected from KI quenching due to a specific interaction with PS-containing vesicles. To assure that the anionic nature of I− did not influence the experimental results through electrostatic interaction of the quenching agent with charged moieties on the peptide or the vesicles, these experiments were repeated with a cationic aqueous quenching agent, Co2+, added as CoCl2 (44Morris S.J. Bradley D. Blumenthal B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 818: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained (data not shown).Figure 4Potassium iodide quenching of PT-(1–46) and PT-(1–46)F4W intrinsic fluorescence in the absence or presence of phospholipid vesicles.

All spectra were normalized with respect to the fluorescence of the peptides alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A quantitative examination of PT-(1–46)F4W fluorescence quenching due to KI was performed using the Stern-Volmer equation. Initial data collected in the absence of phospholipid vesicles were analyzed using the standard Stern-Volmer equation (Equation 1). The KI quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of PT-(1–46)F4W in the absence of phospholipid vesicles generated a straight line with aKSV of 5.5 ± 0.5m−1 (Fig.5 A). However, in the presence of 80% PC/20% PS vesicles, the Stern-Volmer plot showed a negative deviation from linearity, indicative of two independent fluorophore populations possessing different accessibility coefficients for the aqueous quenching agent (Fig. 5 B). These results were analyzed using a modified version of the Stern-Volmer equation (Equation 2). One class of fluorophores was readily accessible to potassium iodide and possessed a KSV of 9.0 ± 2.0 m−1, whereas the other class of fluorophores was effectively shielded from potassium iodide quenching and had a KSV of 1.7 × 10−8 ± 2.9 × 10−8m−1. The fractional accessibilities were 0.63 ± 0.18 and 0.37 ± 0.18, respectively. A decrease in KSV reflects a decrease in solvent exposure of the tryptophan or a decrease in tryptophan lifetime (45Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar, 46Wang S.X. Cai G.P. Sui S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9477-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, lifetime is often associated with fluorescence intensity upon binding lipid vesicles (46Wang S.X. Cai G.P. Sui S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9477-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We demonstrated an increase in intensity (Fig. 2 A) reflecting an increased lifetime. Thus, the observed decrease inKSV is most likely due to tryptophan shielding from the quenching agent. The data presented in Figs. 4 and 5demonstrate that in the presence of PS-containing vesicles ∼50% of the tryptophan residues are effectively shielded from iodide and hence associated with the anionic phospholipid vesicle. TheKSV values of 9.0 ± 2.0m−1 and 1.7 × 10−8 ± 2.9 × 10−8m−1are consistent with Trp-41 being accessible and Trp-4 being protected from potassium iodide quenching in the presence of"

Taken together, these data demonstrate that FSH binding requires elements within the leucine-rich repeat motifs that form a central region of hFSHR ECD, and a conformational change occurs upon hormone binding. follicle stimulating hormone circular dichroism extracellular domain FSH receptor glycoprotein hormone GPH, receptor human luteinizing hormone LH receptor leucine-rich repeat monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polymerase chain reaction Tris-buffered saline with Tween ribonuclease inhibitor single chain thyroid-stimulating hormone amino acid(s) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),1 together with luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin, belongs to the group of pituitary or placental glycoprotein hormones (GPH). Members of this group belong to the cysteine knot fold family. A common α-subunit and a hormone-specific β-subunit, each sharing the same fold, form the functional heterodimer. FSH plays a central role in the regulation of mammalian reproduction. In females, it is essential for ovarian and follicular development and maturation, whereas in males it regulates spermatogenesis (1Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 2Chappel S.C. Howles C. Hum. Reprod. 1991; 6: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).FSH binds specifically to follicle-stimulating hormone receptors (FSHR) on granulosa cells in the ovary or Sertoli cells in the testis. Binding of FSH to its receptor induces signal transduction by stimulation of adenylate cyclase, which leads to a specific cell response through protein kinase A-dependent pathways (3Reichert Jr., L.E. Dattatreyamurty B. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 40: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The FSHR belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors and consists of an uncharacteristically large extracellular domain (ECD) and a seven-pass helical transmembrane domain (reviewed by Simoniet al. (1Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar)). Sequence analysis suggests that the ECD of the glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHR) contains 8–9 imperfect leucine-rich repeats (LRR) like the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), a member of the LRR family. Crystal structure analysis showed that RI consists of 15 LRR, which have a β-α hairpin unit structure, where the units are aligned parallel to a common axis (4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The resulting structure resembles a horseshoe with β-strands forming the inner circumference, whereas the α-helices form the outer circumference. This kind of structure shows high flexibility in structure, and binding of RNase A results in a conformational change of the RI (4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 8Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 9Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Based on this structure, theoretical models have been proposed for the GPHR, where the hormone presumably mainly interacts with the inner circumference of the receptor LRR motifs (5Jiang X.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4558-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) could show the involvement of several residues between aa 40 and 206 in hormone binding, located in the concave surface of the LRR model of the LHR. More recently, mutational analysis of the LRR of the FSHR and LHR indicated that several regions within this domain of the receptor are involved in binding (12Song Y.S. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N.W. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Song Y.S. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N.W. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibody inhibition combined with peptide binding studies gave rise to evidence that the most N-terminal part of the FSHR, aa 9–30, is also important in the interaction of receptor and hormone (14Dattatreyamurty B. Reichert Jr., L.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1593-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Dattatreyamurty B. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The specificity of binding, however, seems to be located differently in the LHR and FSHR. Fragments of the LHR ECD as short as 206 aa are able to bind LH with little reduction in affinity, and chimera studies demonstrate the importance of aa 1–164 for the specificity of the LHR, whereas aa 1–257 are needed for specific FSH binding, with the main part of the specificity being located after LRR5, beyond aa 165 (17Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar,18Thomas D. Rozell T.G. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these data indicate that the binding domain of FSHR is composed of multiple regions of the ECD, but exactly which elements of the receptor interact and whether the FSHR exhibits the same flexibility as the RI and changes upon ligand binding has not yet been determined.It has been difficult to address this issue because the full-length receptor is located within the membrane and, thus, might be sterically restricted and less accessible to antibodies or peptides, and no biophysical data have been provided yet for the receptor-hormone interaction. We reasoned that using solely the ECD might provide a suitable solution for this problem. Over the past several years there have been several attempts to express the ECD of the GPCR to analyze issues like glycosylation (19Thomas D.M. Segaloff D.L.

However, expression in Escherichia coli or mammalian or insect cells yielded ECD trapped in the cell, with none or just a little secretion of the recombinant protein (19Thomas D.M. Segaloff D.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Peterson A.J. Lindau-Shepard B. Brumberg H.A. Dias J.A. Mol. Cell.

This form of the hFSHR ECD allowed analysis of hormone binding independently of a cell system, providing a highly accessible protein. The objective of this study was to utilize this model system to locate the specific elements of the FSHR interacting with the hormone and to collect biophysical data of the interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsIodination grade human pituitary LH and human pituitary TSH were from the National Pituitary Hormone Program. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Pierce, and Bio-Rad.Expression of hFSHR ECD in Hi 5 Insect CellsThe expression vector used was kindly provided by Ares Advanced Technologies (Randolph, MA). Briefly, plasmid pACgp67-FSHR-ECD contains the hFSHR ECD cDNA (aa 1–349) under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The secretion of the ECD is facilitated by the signal sequence of the baculovirus gp67 envelope surface glycoprotein fromAutographa californica (25Murphy C.I. McIntire J.R. Davis D.R. Hodgdon H. Seals J.R. Young E. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This creates a fusion protein with three additional amino acids beyond the consensus cleavage site at the N-terminal end, resulting in a secreted protein with the N terminus ADQCHHR. Recombinant baculovirus was amplified in Sf9 cells maintained in TMN-FH medium and titered by a plaque assay (26King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman & Hall, London1992Crossref Google Scholar). For large scale production of hFSHR ECD, 24 h after seeding in roller bottles 2 × 108 Hi 5 cells (Invitrogen) were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2–4 × 108 for 3 days. The media was collected, cell debris was spun out for 30 min at 10,000 rpm, and the media was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. After the addition of 0.001 mprotease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.02% sodium azide, the media was either stored at 4 °C or frozen at −20 °C until further use.hFSHR ECD PurificationSecreted hFSHR ECD was purified from insect cell media using affinity chromatography. The protein A-purified monoclonal antibody (mAb) 106.105, which is directed against aa 300–315 of the hFSHR (27Lindau-Shepard B.A. Brumberg H.A. Peterson A.J. Dias J.A. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2000; 49: 1-19Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then blocked and washed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The column was loaded with secreted hFSHR ECD-containing media until saturated, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After the column was extensively washed with 1% Triton X-100 in wash buffer (0.1 m phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.2) followed by wash buffer, a short wash in 1% octoglucoside in wash buffer, and an extensive wash with wash buffer overnight, ECD was eluted in 0.1 m glycine, 1% acetic acid, pH 2.2. The addition of 30% glycerol to the elution buffer decreased the pH-related loss of biological activity of the purified hFSHR ECD.Expression and Purification of Single Chain (sc) hFSHPreparation of the schFSH expression plasmid was performed as follows. The hFSHβ cDNA was inserted into the mutagenesis vector pKR5.2 as previously described (28Roth K.E. Dias J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A mutagenesis oligo to the β-subunit 3′-end was designed to replace the stop codon with the amino acid alanine. The hFSH α-subunit with 5′-spacer was produced by PCR; the 5′-α-PCR primer was designed with a SalI site followed by a Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser spacer linked to nucleotide 121 of the α-subunit, thus excluding the signaling sequence of the α-subunit. The 3′-α-PCR primer was designed with aPstI-cloning site at the 3′-end and a silent mutation at Cys-84 to delete an undesired PstI site. The PCR product was then digested with restriction enzymes SalI andPstI and cloned into theSalI-PstI-site of pKR5.2. The construct was sequenced to ensure that the tandem FSH subunits were in frame and that no PCR error was introduced. The single chain FSH cDNA was then cloned into the EcoRI-PstI sites of the baculovirus vector pVL 1393. Single chain FSH virus was amplified in Sf9 cells, and Hi 5 cells were infected for expression using a titer of 5–10 multiplicity of infection (see above). Purification of expressed schFSH from media was performed by affinity chromatography using a 46.3H6.B7 column as previously described (29Dias J.A. Zhang Y. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25289-25294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified schFSH was dialyzed against 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and stored either frozen or lyophilized.Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot AnalysisTo analyze the expression of hFSHR ECD, media was collected as described above, and aliquots were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were stained either by Coomassie blue or silver staining (Bio-Rad) or electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Milipore, Bedford, MA) using a Transblot semi-dry electrophoresis transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) and 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 1.3 mm SDS, pH 9.2, transfer buffer. The membranes were blocked overnight in TBST (10 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C. The following day, blots were probed with 5 μg of protein A-purified anti-FSHR mAb 106.105 (27Lindau-Shepard B.A. Brumberg H.A. Peterson A.J. Dias J.A. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2000; 49: 1-19Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) diluted in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed (4× for 10 min) in TBST and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST + 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed (4× for 10 min), and signals were developed using ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Pierce Super Signal kit.Polyclonal Anti-peptide AntibodiesSome of the antibodies used in this study have been described in other studies (30Liu X. Depasquale J.A. Griswold M.D. Dias J.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbits were immunized with synthetic peptides encompassing nearly the entire FSHR ECD primary sequence. Antisera were tested in Western blot and in ELISA assays for their specificity of reaction with both immunizing peptides and hFSHR ECD. Antisera testing positive (see Table I) were precipitated with ammonium sulfate according to the protocol of Harlow and Lane (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 298-299Google Scholar) and dialyzed against PBS with 0.02% sodium azide.Table ISynthetic peptide and resulting specific polyclonal antibodiesResidue number in hFSHRAntiserum (name)1–15X80315–44W971, W96345–7255872–100513150–183W953, W970183–220562221–254X180265–296W955, X179 Open table in a new tab Solid-phase Radio Receptor AssayTo analyze the binding characteristics of secreted hFSHR ECD, a new solid-phase radio receptor assay format was developed. Nunc® tubes (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were coated with 1 μg of mAb 106.105 in 200 μl of coating buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 9.5) at 4 °C overnight. The tubes were washed once with 1 ml of wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% azide and 0.05% Tween 20; all the following washes were done in this wash buffer) and blocked with 500 μl of 10% nonfat milk, 2% bovine serum albumin in coating buffer for 3 h at 37 °C. After the tubes were washed (3× 1 ml of wash buffer), 200 μl of insect media containing hFSHR ECD diluted in binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.127 mm EDTA, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C.To analyze the binding affinity of hFSHR ECD, the tubes were washed three times, and radiolabeled purified pituitary hFSH (125I-FSH, 150,000 cpm) as well as unlabeled pituitary hFSH in increasing concentrations was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The specificity of binding was analyzed in competitive displacement assays utilizing unlabeled purified pituitary LH, TSH, and FSH. Counts bound were measured in a γ-counter and plotted using the PRISM3 program. Affinity constants were calculated based on the ED50 from data sets with limiting amounts of captured hFSHR ECD using National Institutes of Health radioimmunoassay software.To assess the effect of binding of the anti-peptide antibodies on125I-FSH binding to ECD, captured hFSHR ECD was incubated with different dilutions of antibodies (dilutions ranging from 1:3 to 1:100) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by washing and incubating with125I-FSH as described above. Radioactivity counts were compared with the addition of normal rabbit serum.ELISAThe ELISA format was used not only to determine the relative concentration of hFSHR ECD in media but also to examine the effects of FSH-hFSHR·ECD complex formation on the accessibility of hFSHR ECD epitopes for the anti-peptide antibodies. Two complementary approaches were used for protein footprinting in which either hFSHR ECD (see the next paragraph, “hFSHR ECD-capture ELISA”) or hormone (see “FSH-capture ELISA,” below) was captured by specific monoclonal antibodies.hFSHR ECD-capture ELISAImmulon 4HBX 96-well plates (DYNEX Technologies Inc., Alexandria, VA) were coated with 500 ng of mAb 106.105 in 100 μl of coating buffer at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed thoroughly (4–6 times) with wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% azide and 0.05% Tween 20; all the following washes are done with this buffer) between all of the following steps. Plates were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 μl of 5% nonfat milk in coating buffer, and hFSHR ECD from 100 μl of insect media was captured on the antibody for 1 h at 37 °C (Hi 5 cell-conditioned media was used as control). To detect hFSHR ECD captured, plates were incubated with polyclonal anti-peptide antibody W970 (1:1000 in 100 μl of binding buffer; anti-hFSHR 150–183) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000 in 100 μl of binding buffer, BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). For detection, 100 μl of development substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethylamine buffer, Bio-Rad) was added, and absorbance at 410 nm was measured after 30–60 min at room temperature using as Dynatech MR700 plate reader.The effect of FSH binding on epitope accessibility was assessed by protein footprinting. Excess purified schFSH (1 μg/well) or binding buffer as control was added to the captured ECD and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C. After being washed extensively, the captured ECD was challenged with different polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies (1:25–1:100 in binding buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase followed by substrate incubation as described above.FSH-capture ELISATo confirm the footprinting results achieved with the ECD-capture ELISA, a complementary approach was developed. Immulon 4HBX 96-well plates were coated with 500 ng of βFSH-specific mAb 46.3H6.B7 in 100 μl of coating buffer at 4 °C overnight. The plate was blocked and washed (see above), and 500 ng of purified schFSH was bound to the antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing extensively, the plate was incubated with 100 μl of either hFSHR ECD or conditioned insect cell media (control) for 1 h at 37 °C. To determine the accessibility of hFSHR ECD bound to captured schFSH, the plate was then challenged with each polyclonal anti-peptide antibody (1:25–1:100 in binding buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase followed by substrate incubation as described above.Circular Dichroism StudiesExperiments were carried out on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter at 20 or 6 °C using a cell with a path length of 0.05 cm. Proteins were dialyzed against 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, overnight before the measurements. Spectra were measured with the following settings: 1.0 nm bandwidth, 20-nm/min speed, 0.2-nm resolution, wavelength between 260 and 180 nm with 3–9 accumulations per measurement. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Spectra were determined for the schFSH (3.4–5.8 μm in 0.01 m phosphate buffer) and hFSHR ECD (0.5–0.8 μm in 0.01 m phosphate buffer) individually as well as for a mixture containing 3.4–5.8 μm schFSH and 0.5–0.8 μm hFSHR ECD, thereby containing exactly the same concentration of each protein as in the individually measured samples. schFSH was thus used in a 4–12-fold molar excess to ECD in separate experiments. Before obtaining the spectra, the individual proteins as well as a mixture of both were incubated at room temperature or 37 °C for 0.5–2 h.Individual spectra were analyzed using the JASCO software to subtract the background and smooth the spectra. The computer program SELCON 3 was used to calculate the secondary structure estimates for schFSH and hFSHR ECD utilizing two data bases containing 37 and 42 proteins, respectively, enabling an analysis in the wavelength range from 185 to 260 nm (32Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 33Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y.

For comparison of the spectra (in molar ellipticity) of the hFSHR ECD·schFSH complex versus theoretically calculated ECD + FSH spectra, the individual spectra of FSH and ECD were added after background subtraction and smoothed, and the molar ellipticity (mean residue ellipticity [Θ]) was calculated. This sum of the individual spectra, representing a mixture of noninteracting schFSH and hFSHR ECD, was compared with the spectra experimentally determined for the hFSHR ECD·schFSH complex. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),1 together with luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin, belongs to the group of pituitary or placental glycoprotein hormones (GPH). Members of this group belong to the cysteine knot fold family. A common α-subunit and a hormone-specific β-subunit, each sharing the same fold, form the functional heterodimer. FSH plays a central role in the regulation of mammalian reproduction. In females, it is essential for ovarian and follicular development and maturation, whereas in males it regulates spermatogenesis (1Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr.

FSH binds specifically to follicle-stimulating hormone receptors (FSHR) on granulosa cells in the ovary or Sertoli cells in the testis. Binding of FSH to its receptor induces signal transduction by stimulation of adenylate cyclase, which leads to a specific cell response through protein kinase A-dependent pathways (3Reichert Jr., L.E. Dattatreyamurty B. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 40: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The FSHR belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors and consists of an uncharacteristically large extracellular domain (ECD) and a seven-pass helical transmembrane domain (reviewed by Simoniet al.

Sequence analysis suggests that the ECD of the glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHR) contains 8–9 imperfect leucine-rich repeats (LRR) like the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), a member of the LRR family. Crystal structure analysis showed that RI consists of 15 LRR, which have a β-α hairpin unit structure, where the units are aligned parallel to a common axis (4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J.

The specificity of binding, however, seems to be located differently in the LHR and FSHR. Fragments of the LHR ECD as short as 206 aa are able to bind LH with little reduction in affinity, and chimera studies demonstrate the importance of aa 1–164 for the specificity of the LHR, whereas aa 1–257 are needed for specific FSH binding, with the main"

Outer membrane proteins of the spirochete Treponema denticola, a periodontal pathogen, inhibit agonist-induced Ca2+ release from internal stores in gingival fibroblasts, but the mechanism is not defined. We determined here that the major surface protein (Msp) of T. denticola perturbs calcium signaling in human fibroblasts by uncoupling store-operated channels. Msp localized in complexes on the cell surface. Ratio fluorimetry showed that in cells loaded with fura-2 or fura-C18, Msp induced cytoplasmic and near-plasma membrane Ca2+ transients, respectively. Increased conductance was confirmed by fluorescence quenching of fura-2-loaded cells with Mn2+ after Msp treatment. Calcium entry was blocked with anti-Msp antibodies and inhibited by chelating external Ca2+ with EGTA. Msp pretreatment reduced the amplitude of [Ca2+]itransients upon challenge with ATP or thapsigargin. In experiments using cells loaded with mag-fura-2 to report endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, Msp reduced Ca2+ efflux from endoplasmic reticulum stores when ATP was used as an agonist. Msp alone did not induce Ca2+ release from these stores. Msp inhibited store-operated influx of extracellular calcium following intracellular Ca2+ depletion by thapsigargin and also promoted the assembly of subcortical actin filaments. This actin assembly was blocked by chelating intracellular Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester. The reduced amplitude of agonist-induced transients and inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry due to Msp were reversed by latrunculin B, an inhibitor of actin filament assembly. Thus, Msp retards Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores, and it inhibits subsequent Ca2+ influx by uncoupling store-operated channels. Actin filament rearrangement coincident with conformational uncoupling of store-operated calcium fluxes is a novel mechanism by which surface proteins and toxins of pathogenic microorganisms may damage host cells.

They would disturb a critical signaling pathway by which eukaryotic cells respond to external stimuli (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 1604-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and would impair crucial downstream functions by which cells maintain homeostasis. For example, calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i)1regulates the assembly and turnover of actin filaments (2Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), which in turn controls cell shape, volume regulation, locomotion, and phagocytosis. These are essential functions for maintaining tissue integrity, for promoting wound healing, and for mediating protection from infection. Many human cells regulate calcium homeostasis using store-operated calcium fluxes, a system in which Ca2+ influx through store-operated channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane is stimulated by the depletion of Ca2+ in internal stores in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (3Putney J.W. Bird G.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 4Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). A variety of potential cytotoxins of insects, reptiles, and microorganisms affect ion channel function (5Kourie J.I. Shorthouse A.A. Am. J.

These toxins may include the surface molecules of opportunistic or overtly pathogenic bacteria, including some that cause cytoskeletal perturbation or that form ion channels in the host cell plasma membrane. Several microbial products have been reported to alter ion transport, but none is known to uncouple Ca2+ ER stores and SOCs. Although the mechanisms by which transient Ca2+ depletion in the ER triggers Ca2+ influx through SOCs are not well understood, one compelling model is based on the physical proximity between the plasma membrane and the ER (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 1604-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This system may involve the inositol trisphosphate receptor on the ER as a mediator of the functional coupling of ER store depletion and Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane (8Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Notably, the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments subjacent to the plasma membrane is a major determinant of reversible coupling of the ER and plasma membrane and thereby modulates the signals that regulate Ca2+ influx through SOCs (8Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

Whole cells and outer membrane proteins of the oral spirocheteTreponema denticola exert profound effects on actin assembly in cultured human gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells (11Baehni P.

These properties may contribute to bacterial pathogenicity by impeding actin-dependent functions that are crucial for homeostasis of gingival tissues (15Battikhi T. Lee W. McCulloch C.A.G. Ellen R.P.

Since actin assembly is highly sensitive to fluctuations in calcium concentration (2Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), it is notable that outer membrane fractions of T. denticola inhibit inositol phosphate and intracellular calcium responses of fibroblasts to chemical agonists (14Yang P.F.

Since cortical actin and the inositol trisphosphate receptor are evidently important in the regulation of store-operated calcium channels in a variety of cell types (8Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

We examined the effects of Msp on calcium homeostasis in gingival fibroblasts and report that Msp mediates calcium transients and inhibits SOC activation by promoting assembly of subcortical actin filaments. These filaments in turn uncouple the ER from SOCs. Our results provide a novel mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria may subvert host cell signaling systems and thereby contribute to loss of tissue homeostasis in chronic infections such as periodontitis. Bovine serum albumin, Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, thapsigargin, ATP, ionomycin, latrunculin B, and valinomycin were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2/AM, mag-fura-2/AM, fura-C18, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, bis-[1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid]trimethineoxonol, and rhodamine phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) was obtained from Calbiochem. Msp is an immunogenic surface protein ofT. denticola that complexes with a serine protease, PrtP, in the outer sheath of the bacterium. Msp was prepared from T. denticola type strain ATCC 35405, as previously described (21Egli C. Leung W.K. Müller K.-H. Hancock R.E.W. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1694-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Mathers D.A. Leung W.K. Fenno J.C. Hong Y. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2904-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The starting material was ∼8 g, wet weight, per 4-liter bacterial culture in late logarithmic growth phase. After the deoxycholate and the n-octylpolyoxyethylene extraction steps and ultracentrifugation, the enriched Msp solution was incubated for 7 days at 37 °C until peptidase activity could no longer be detected by the chromogenic peptidesN-succinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanyl-l-prolyl-l-phenylalanine nitroanilide and N-benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) (23Ellen R.P. Song M. McCulloch C.A.G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enriched protein solution was concentrated ∼30-fold by Amicon ultrafiltration (Amicon Concentricon plus 80, Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). After washing with 5 liters of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), five washings with double-distilled water, and ultracentrifugation for 2 h to remove trace amounts of detergent, the Msp was dissolved and dialyzed against double-distilled water. The protein content was determined by Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For all experiments (except dose-response experiments), a 1:100 dilution of Msp in calcium buffer was used. This preparation contained 0.41 mg of protein (dry weight) per ml. A final concentration of 30 μg of protein/ml, corresponding to ∼160 nm, was used for most challenge assays of cells. When pretreatment with Msp was specified, the Msp remained in the cell culture wells for the duration of the experiment unless mentioned. In some experiments, Msp was boiled for 10 min to denature proteins or heated at 60 °C for 30 min. In other experiments, the cells were pretreated with a mixture of Msp and anti-Msp antibodies at a 2:3 ratio (protein concentration) that had been preincubated for 60 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described in 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels with a current of 200 V (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206631) Google Scholar, 25Ellen R.P. Ko K.S.-C. Lo C.-M. Grove D.A. Ishihara K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 581-586PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins or peptides were solubilized in sample buffer either at room temperature or heated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (26Scopes R.K. Smith J.A. Ausubel F.N. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 10.8.1-10.8.17Google Scholar). Following transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 0.5m NaCl, pH 7.6) and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against Msp of ATCC 35405, kindly provided by B. C. McBride and P. Hannam (27Fenno J. Müller K.-H. McBride B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2489-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at appropriate dilutions, enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect the signal. Human gingival fibroblasts were derived from primary explant cultures as described (28Pender N. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from passages 6–15 were grown as monolayers in T-75 flasks in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells from these cultures were harvested and replated onto glass coverslips 2 days before each experiment, as described previously (17Ko K.S. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluence prior to all experiments except when sparse cultures were used as indicated. For measurement of whole cell intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), cells on coverslips were loaded with 3 μm fura-2/AM (a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye) for 20 min at 37 °C (17Ko K.S. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of near-plasma membrane Ca2+ concentration, cells attached to coverslips were briefly permeabilized with saponin and incubated with 2 μm fura-C18, pentapotassium salt (29Etter E.F. Kuhn M.A. Fay F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 25 °C for 10 min followed by three washes with PBS. For estimation of [Ca2+]ER, cells on coverslips were incubated with mag-fura-2/AM (4 μm) (30Hofer A.M. Landofi B. Debellis L. Pozzam T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for 150 min at 37 °C, in α-minimal essential medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%) (31Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The calcium-free buffer consisted of a bicarbonate-free medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmd-glucose, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 with an osmolarity of 291 mosm. For experiments requiring external calcium, 1 mm CaC12 was added to the buffer; for experiments requiring chelation of external Ca2+, 2 mm EGTA was added. Fmax andFmin were determined using ionomycin and EGTA as described previously (17Ko K.S. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with fura-2/AM, inspection of cells by fluorescence microscopy demonstrated no vesicular compartmentalization of fura-2, suggesting that the dye loading method permitted measurement of cytosolic [Ca2+]i. Visual inspection of fura-C18-loaded cells and mag-fura-2-loaded cells showed fluorescent labeling of the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, respectively. Estimates of whole cell [Ca2+]i and near plasma membrane [Ca2+]i were calculated according to the equation of Grynkiewicz (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) from the emitted fluorescence measurements, using a Nikon Diaphot II inverted microscope optically interfaced to a Deltascan 4000, dual beam, epifluorescence spectrofluorimeter and analysis system (Photon Technology Int., London, Ontario, Canada), as described previously (17Ko K.S. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Msp on internal release of Ca2+, ATP (100 μm; Sigma) and thapsigargin (1 μm; Sigma) were used as agonists and added to resting cells in calcium-free buffer with EGTA (17Ko K.S. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells that were pretreated with Msp for 40 min at 25 °C were compared with untreated cells. To compare the function of SOCs in these cells, the influx of extracellular calcium following depletion of intracellular stores was also studied. Fibroblasts were exposed to 1 μm thapsigargin in 1 mm EGTA buffer for 30 min to deplete internal Ca2+ and to chelate residual extracellular Ca2+. CaCl2 (2 mm) was added, and [Ca2+]i increases due to calcium influx were measured. These experiments were repeated in cells pretreated with 1 μm latrunculin B (30 min, 25 °C), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. In some experiments, the influx pathway was examined after the addition of Msp or water vehicle in cells loaded with fura-2. We measured the fluorescence of single cells at the isosbestic point (356 nm) in the presence of MnCl2 (1 mm) in the standard Ca2+-containing buffer (33Bibby K.J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1639-C1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For indirect assessment of general cation permeability of the plasma membrane to monovalent cations, we measured membrane potential using flow cytometry and the bisoxonol dye bis-[1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid]trimethineoxonol (3Putney J.W. Bird G.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) as described (34Seidl J. Knuechel R. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To examine the location of Msp binding to cells, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on Msp-pretreated cells using polyclonal anti-Msp-antibodies as the primary antibody. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, blocked with 1:1000 mouse serum in PBS for 10 min, incubated with primary antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibodies (1:100). The coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted with an antifade mounting medium (ICN, Montreal, Canada). The fibroblasts were examined using a × 40, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective under epifluorescence optics (Leica CLSM, Heidelberg, Germany). Laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Leica CLSM) was used to examine actin filament assembly induced by Msp. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with rhodamine phalloidin (35Arora P.D. Manolson M. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35432-35441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The excitation filter used was 530/20 nm, and emitted fluorescence was collected through an emission filter (620/40 nm). Cells were imaged with a × 63 oil immersion lens, 1.4 NA, and transverse optical sections were obtained in 1-μm steps from the level of cell attachment at the substratum to the dorsal surface of the cell (33Bibby K.J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1639-C1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the fluorescence intensity of rhodamine phalloidin staining was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Leitz MVP; Wetzlar, Germany) (28Pender N. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in square sampling zones (25 μm2) immediately beneath the cell membrane. Propidium iodide staining was used to determine if Msp was toxic to cells during the duration of the experiments. Flow cytometry analyses were performed as described (36Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and suspended in PBS, pelleted, resuspended in PBS to a cell concentration of 1 × 106/ml, and stained with propidium iodide (10 μl/ml; Calbiochem). After a 5-min incubation, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Means and S.E. values were calculated for [Ca2+]i measurements. Calcium measurements were restricted to (i) base-line [Ca2+]i; (ii) percentage change of the transient [Ca2+]i above base-line; (iii) net change in [Ca2+]i above base line; and (iv) time to peak [Ca2+]i. For continuous variable data, means and S.E. of [Ca2+]i were computed, and, when appropriate, comparisons between two groups were made with the unpaired Student's t test with statistical significance set atp < 0.05. The Msp preparation was highly enriched by sequential detergent extraction and autoproteolysis of T. denticola extracts. We isolated a fraction that contained primarily Msp oligomers, which migrated as a single ∼190-kDa band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Egli C. Leung W.K. Müller K.-H. Hancock R.E.W. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1694-1699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Boiled samples demonstrated a 53-kDa polypeptide that is known to be the monomer (27Fenno J. Müller K.-H. McBride B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2489-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Haapasalo M. Müller K.-H. Uitto V.-J. Leung W.K. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 95-kDa chymotrypsin-like protease that usually associates with Msp in the outer membrane was not detected in the gels; nor was its peptidase activity detected. Immunoblots of the preparation using anti-Msp antibodies showed almost exclusive staining of the prominent 190-kDa oligomer and the 53-kDa monomer in native and heat-denatured preparations, respectively (Fig. 1 B), confirming that these bands contained the authentic Msp from T. denticola. Previous studies demonstrated that Msp binds to fibronectin, fibrinogen, and laminin and associates with epithelial cell surfaces and cytoplasmic membrane proteins (22Mathers D.A. Leung W.K. Fenno J.C. Hong Y. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2904-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Haapasalo M. Müller K.-H. Uitto V.-J. Leung W.K. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the Msp preparation was incubated with fibroblasts, immunostaining showed that Msp associated with the fibroblast surface (Fig. 1 C). After a 30-min incubation, intense Msp staining was clustered in one area of the cell, indicating a capping phenomenon and possible aggregation of ligand-bound receptors. Single cell ratio fluorimetry was used to test whether the association of Msp with the fibroblast plasma membrane caused perturbation of calcium homeostasis. For all experiments, [Ca2+]i was stable in untreated cells, even over prolonged time course experiments (>120 min). In calcium buffer, exposure of cells to Msp induced a robust Ca2+ transient that often returned to a level ∼15–30% higher than base-line within 90 s of the peak (Fig.2, A–C); subsequent smaller transients could also be detected over a period of 30 min in some cells (Fig. 2 B, inset). Treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of Msp (1, 10, 30 μg/ml) showed a dose-response relationship with the amplitude of the calcium peak (Fig.2 H). In control cells treated with the vehicle (distilled H2O added to cell culture buffer), there was no Ca2+ response (Fig. 2 D), indicating that the Msp-induced Ca2+ responses were not simply due to physical disturbance or an anisosmotic change. Further, only cells with bright fura-2 staining in the cytoplasm were included in analyses to overcome the possibility of measuring dead or dying cells (see data on cell death below). In cells challenged with Msp that was preincubated with anti-Msp antibodies, there was no Ca2+ response detected upon the addition of Msp (Fig. 2 E), indicating that the Msp-induced transient was due to a specific interaction between Msp and the cells. Boiling the Msp eliminated the Ca2+ response (Fig. 2 F); the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient was much lower than controls when the Msp was heated to 60 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2 G). Thus, the ability of Msp to interact with cells and to generate Ca2+ responses evidently depends on the undenatured protein complex. Finally, cells that were incubated repeatedly with fresh doses of Msp showed progressively diminished calcium responses (Fig. 2 I). To determine if Msp could induce Ca2+ transients subjacent to the cell membrane, cells were loaded with fura-C18. In these experiments Msp evoked large amplitude calcium transients, demonstrating a sharp elevation of [Ca2+]i near the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 J). These transients occurred more rapidly than the cytoplasmic calcium signals following Msp treatment (n = 10 experiments; p < 0.05), indicating that Msp may stimulate Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane-permeable channels. We determined the source of Ca2+ for the observed rise in [Ca2+]i. Fura-2-loaded cells were incubated in Ca2+-free buffer containing EGTA. The cells were rapidly switched to the EGTA buffer prior to the addition of Msp to avoid depletion of intracellular stores. Under these conditions, Msp treatment failed to evoke a defined Ca2+ transient (Fig.2 K), indicating that most of the Ca2+ for the robust intracellular response was probably derived from influx through plasma membrane-permeable channels. We examined the influx pathway further by performing quenching experiments in which the extracellular bathing buffer was supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2and the fluorescence of fura-2 was excited at 356 nm (the isosbestic or calcium-insensitive point) (33Bibby K.J. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1639-C1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When single emission photon counts were measured, cells demonstrated a drop in fluorescence ∼90 s after Msp was added to the culture medium, probably due to influx of Mn2+ and fluorescence quenching of fura-2 (Fig.2 L). These results indicate that the Msp-induced Ca2+ transient is due to entry from the extracellular medium. To assess whether Msp causes a general increase in cation permeability, we measured the membrane potential with the bisoxonol dye bis-[1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid]trimethineoxonol and flow cytometry. Measurement of bis-[1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid]trimethineoxonol fluorescence after vehicle or Msp treatment showed only a 2% reduction of fluorescence, while KCl depolarization in the presence of valinomycin (3 μm) produced large reductions (∼25% reductions after each of the sequential additions of 50 mmKCl; 5000 cells/run). Experiments conducted with calcium buffer and ionomycin (2 μm) treatments indicated that cells preincubated with Msp or vehicle responded with an equivalent increase in [Ca2+]i (p > 0.2;n = 5 cells each). These data indicated that the cell membranes of Msp-treated cells were intact. Consistent with these observations, the basal [Ca2+]i was unchanged in Msp-treated and vehicle-treated cells (∼150 nm). We determined if Msp is cytotoxic to fibroblasts in the short term (i.e. under the conditions used for these experiments) because of a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (38Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Propidium iodide staining experiments were done as described under “Exp"

The large subunit (BphA1) of Bph Dox plays a crucial role in determination of substrate specificity of biphenyl-related compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Functional evolution of Bph Dox ofPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 was accomplished by random priming recombination of the bphA1 gene, involving two rounds of in vitro recombination and mutation followed by selection for increased activity in vivo. Evolved Bph Dox acquired novel and multifunctional degradation capabilities not only for PCBs but also for dibenzofuran, dibenzo-p-dioxin, dibenzothiophene, and fluorene, the compounds scarcely attacked by the original KF707 Bph Dox. The modes of oxygenation were angular and lateral dioxygenation for dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin, sulfoxidation for dibenzothiophene, and mono-oxygenation for fluorene. These enzymes also exhibited enhanced degradation abilities for PCB congeners, retaining 2,3-dioxygenase activity and gaining 3,4-dioxygenase activity, depending on the chlorine substitution of PCB congeners. Further mutation analysis revealed that the amino acid at position 376 in BphA1 is significantly involved in the acquisition of multifunctional oxygenase activities and mode of oxygenation.

Rev. 1992; 56: 677-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biphenyl-utilizing bacteria have been widely isolated (5Bedard D.L. Unterman R. Bopp L.H. Brennan M.J. Habert M.L. Johnson C. Appl. Environ.

These bacteria have been studied extensively with respect to the degradation of PCBs,1 a family of xenobiotic compounds that is one of the major environmental pollutants. Considerable differences are found in the congener selectivity patterns and in the range of activity of various PCB-degrading bacteria (5Bedard D.L. Unterman R. Bopp L.H. Brennan M.J. Habert M.L.

Both the relative rates of primary degradation of PCBs and the mode of the ring attacked are dependent on the bacterial strains (9Furukawa K. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Bedard D.L. Haberl M.L. Microb. Ecol. 1990; 20: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Furukawa K.

Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 andBurkholderia cepacia LB400 exhibit distinct differences in substrate ranges for PCBs (12Gibson D.T. Cruden D.L. Haddock J.D. Zylstra G.J. Brand J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4561-4564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Erickson B.D. Mondello F.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that these twobph operons are nearly identical in gene organization and the amino acid sequences of the corresponding enzymes (14Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mondello F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biphenyl and PCBs are oxidized to the dihydrodiol compound by Bph Dox (Fig. 1). The dihydrodiol is dehydrogenated to the dihydroxy compound by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (encoded by bphB), and the dihydroxy compound is thenmeta-cleavaged to form 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate (ringmeta-cleavage yellow compound) by 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (encoded by bphC). Subsequently, the ringmeta-cleavage yellow compound is hydrolyzed to benzoic acid by hydrolase (encoded by bphD). Bph Dox is a three-component enzyme consisting of terminal dioxygenase and a short electron transport chain. The former comprises BphA1 (an iron sulfur protein encoded by bphA1) and BphA2 (a small subunit encoded bybphA2). The latter is composed of a ferredoxin (encoded bybphA3) and a ferredoxin reductase (encoded bybphA4). BphA1 and BphA2 are associated as an α3β3 heterohexamer and catalyze the direct introduction of two atoms of oxygen into the biphenyl ring. BphA1 contains the motif Cys-Xaa-His-Xaa-17-Cys-Xaa-2-His, which forms a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster. Bph Dox requires Fe(II) for activity, and oxygen activation is supposed to occur at the mononuclear iron center (14Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase act as an electron transfer system from NADH to reduce the terminal dioxygenase. Among these four subunits, we found that BphA1 is crucially responsible for recognition and binding of substrates and hence for substrate specificity (1Furukawa K. Hirose J. Suyama A. Zaiki T. Hayashida S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5224-5232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hirose J. Suyama A. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We constructed a variety of chimericbphA1 genes between KF707 and LB400 using three common restriction sites (17Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 12: 3936-3943Crossref Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that a relatively small number of amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal half of BphA1 are involved in the recognition of the chlorinated ring and the site of dioxygenation and are therefore responsible for the degradation of PCB. We also recombined the two bphA1 genes using DNA shuffling (18Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Some clones expressing the evolved Bph Dox exhibited enhanced abilities for PCB degradation. In this report, we engineered the KF707 bphA1 gene by a method of random priming recombination (19Shao Z. Zhao H. Giver L. Arnold F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and obtained some novel Bph Dox that exhibited multifunctional oxygenase activities not only for PCB but also for dibenzofuran, dibenzo-p-dioxin, dibenzothiophene, and fluorene. The biphenyl-utilizing strain P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 was grown in basal salt medium as described previously (20Furukawa K. Miyazaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 392-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium or on Luria-Bertani agar medium (1.5% agar). Antibiotics (50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) were added when needed to select for the presence of plasmid in E. coli transformants. pJHF18ΔMluI containing disrupted bphA1(ΔbphA1) was constructed as described previously (18Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). pJHF18ΔMluI was used for the replacement of ΔbphA1 with the bphA1 gene variants. The pRPF1000 series plasmids contain bphA1(evolved)-bphA2A3A4BC and were used to assay the production of ring meta-cleavage products from PCBs and biphenyl-related compounds. The pRPF2000 series plasmids were constructed by removing bphBC genes from pRPF1000 series plasmids by digestion with PpuMI and religation and used for the production of dihydrodiol compounds. pSSF2202T and pSSF2202N were pRPF2202 variants constructed by site-directed mutagenesis.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 127: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), were provided by Toshio Ohmori (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). For the template for random priming recombination, the KF707 bphA1 DNA was amplified from plasmid pKTF18 (14Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CCGAATTCAAGGAGACGTTGAATCATG-3′ (#18) for the forward sequence (the EcoRI site is underlined, and the start codon is in bold) and 3′-TCTAGACAGTTGGCCTTCTTAAGTT-5′ (#20) for the reverse primer (the EcoRI site is underlined, and the BglII site is italicized), which includes the intervening region between bphA1 andbphA2. Twenty-five cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 52 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min) were run with 2.5 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, PCR buffer, and 20% Q-solution (Qiagen GmbH) with Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The PCR product was digested by EcoRI and inserted at the EcoRI site of pHSG396 (Takara Shuzo) to obtain pRPF707. The EcoRI fragment containing the bphA1 gene was cut from pRPF707, electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose gels, and recovered by a DNA purification kit (TOYOBO). Random priming recombination was performed by the method of Shao et al.(19Shao Z. Zhao H. Giver L. Arnold F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, the KF707 bphA1 DNA (40 pmol) was mixed with 6.7 nmol of dp(N)6 random primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After denaturation at 100 °C for 5 min, 10 μl of 10× reaction buffer (900 mm HEPES, pH 6.6, 0.1 mMgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate) was added, and the total volume of the reaction was brought to 95 μl with H2O. Ten units (in 5 μl) of the Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase I (TOYOBO) was added. Furthermore, 10 pmol of the primers with sequences to anneal regions such as the [2Fe-2S] cluster and Fe(II) binding site essential for the enzymatic function of BphA1 were added (Fig. 2). The polymerase reaction was carried out at 16 °C for 8 h. After purification of 50–150-bp fragments, self-priming was carried out in the absence of primers (18Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) using the following thermocycler program: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min + 5 s/cycle). Finally, PCR amplification was carried out for the primerless PCR products using primers #18 and #20 (18Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 52 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min). Cloning, expression, and screening of the bphA1 mutant genes were carried out as follows. The PCR products were digested bySacI and BglII and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Because the SacI site is present at the 5′-end of bphA1 overlapping start codon ATG, and theBglII site is present at the flanking region betweenbphA1 and bphA2, the mutants of bphA1were double-digested with SacI and BglII and ligated at the same site of pJHF18ΔMluI, replacingbphA1 with the mutant ΔbphA1. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli JM109 and plated onto Luria-Bertani agar containing ampicillin and 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). For the first screening, colonies producing the ring meta-cleavage yellow pigment from biphenyl vapor were picked up. Subsequently, positive colonies for biphenyl were checked for the production of yellow compound from dibenzofuran. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a Quickchange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (STRATAGENE) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pSSF1202, which contains bphA1 from pRPF1202 (described below), was used as the template for mutagenesis. This plasmid was amplified by PCR using two complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-CACAACATCCGCACCTTCTCCGCAGGCGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTGCGGAGAAGGTGCGGATGTTGTGCCG-3′ for amino acid change V376T, and 5′-CACAACATCCGCAACTTCTCCGCAGGCGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTGCGGAGAAGTTGCGGATGTTGTGCCG-3′ for V376N (the codon of the amino acid to be changed is underlined). After mutations were confirmed by a DNA sequencer (model 4000L; LI-COR), theSacI-BglII fragments were cloned intoSacI-BglII-digested pJHF18ΔMluI for the functional analyses. The recombinant E. coli JM109 cells expressing the original and mutant Bph Dox were grown to logarithmic phase (turbidity of 0.8–1.2 at 600 nm), washed twice in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH7.5), and resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer to adjust the turbidity to 1.0. PCBs (AccuStandard Inc.) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide were added at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Biphenyl-related compounds dissolved in ethanol were added at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. After being shaken at 200 rpm for predetermined periods (1–8 h), aliquots (1 ml) were centrifuged, and the formation of ringmeta-cleavage products from various aromatic compounds was monitored with the supernatants at the following absorption maxima: biphenyl, 434 nm (ε = 33,200m−1); diphenyl methane, 395 nm (ε = 20,200 m−1); dibenzofuran, 465 nm (ε = 37,500m−1); and 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl, 398 nm (ε = 211,400m−1). The molar extinction coefficient of those ring meta-cleavage compounds was determined experimentally and used for the calculation of compound formation. The dihydrodiol products from PCBs were derivatized with 100 μg of n-butylboronic acid in 10 μl of acetone-dimethyl formamide (23Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin were subjected to the trimethylsilylation with N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-acetate. The samples were analyzed by GC-MS (model QP5000; Shimadzu) with a coiled capillary glass column (0.33 mm, inner diameter; 25 m long) packed with methyl silicon CBP1 as described previously (17Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 12: 3936-3943Crossref Google Scholar). Amounts of substrate depletion were calculated by normalization to the recovery of 2,4,6,2′,4′-pentachlorobiphenyl, a nondegradable internal standard extracted from heat-treated control cells, and quantified by use of a standard curve (5Bedard D.L. Unterman R. Bopp L.H. Brennan M.J. Habert M.L. Johnson C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1986; 51: 761-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The KF707-bphA1 gene was subjected to random priming recombination as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It was determined that the Rieske center and mononuclear iron binding motif in BphA1 are equivalent to Cys-100, His-102, Cys-120, and His-123 and to Glu-225, Asp-230, Tyr-232, His-233, and His-239, respectively (24Jiang H. Parales R.E. Lynch N.A. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers with the sequence to anneal the above-mentioned essential regions for this enzyme were added to protect against ablation of oxygenase activity (Fig. 2). On the other hand, Thr at position 376, which could be involved in the substrate specificity and mode of oxygenation (17Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 12: 3936-3943Crossref Google Scholar, 25Suenaga H. Nishi A. Watanabe T. Sakai M. Furukawa K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 87: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was intentionally altered by using random primers that certainly provide random mutation. In the presence of protective primers for the essential sequences of Rieske center and mononuclear iron binding motif, the rate of positive clones was increased to 60%, as compared with 42% in the absence of primers. The bphA1 variants obtained were digested withSacI and BglII and inserted into just upstream site of bphA2A3A4BC of the SacI- andBglII-digested pJHF18ΔMluI. Colonies forming the ring meta-cleavage yellow products from both biphenyl and dibenzofuran were screened, and the extended function of these evolved enzymes was analyzed with PCBs and biphenyl-related compounds. After the primary round of cycle and selection, E. colicarrying pRPF1113 exhibited enhanced degradation ability for dibenzofuran (Fig. 3C). One additional round of cycle and selection using both pRPF1113 and KF707-bphA1 as template DNA resulted in the emergence of evolved Bph Dox encoded by pRPF1202 and pRPF1217. E. colicells expressing the original and evolved Bph Dox were examined in some detail for the degradation of biphenyl-related compounds. All E. coli transformants tested expressed almost the same amounts of Bph Dox as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). They were incubated with biphenyl, 4-methylbiphenyl, diphenylmethane, dibenzofuran, and 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl (Fig.3). E. coli [pRPF1707] expressing the original Bph Dox degraded biphenyl, diphenylmethane, and 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl, forming yellow pigments via 2,3-dihdroxy compounds (2,3-dioxygenation mode) (17Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 12: 3936-3943Crossref Google Scholar). E. coli harboring pRPF1113, pRPF1202, and pRPF1217 exhibited enhanced production of yellow compounds from biphenyl, diphenylmethane, and dibenzofuran to different degrees, as compared with E. coli [pRPF1707] expressing the original Bph Dox. Among these clones, E. coli[pRPF1202] exhibited highest activities of 182% for biphenyl and 190% for diphenylmethane, compared with E. coli[pRPF1707]. More interestingly, these three evolved clones exhibited degradation activities for both dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin, compounds that were scarcely attacked by the original Bph Dox, as described later. To examine the mode of oxygenation of these evolved Bph Dox for PCBs, the bphB and bphC genes were deleted from plasmids pRPF1707, pRPF1113, pRPF1202, and pRPF1217, generating pRPF2707, pRPF2113, pRPF2202, and pRPF2217, respectively. UsingE. coli cells carrying pRPF2000 series plasmids, the metabolites produced from 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl, 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl, 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl, and 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl were analyzed by GC-MS (Table I). E. coli [pRPF2707] expressing the original KF707 Bph Dox introduced O2 at the 2,3 position for 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl and 2,5,4′- trichlorobiphenyl but hardly attacked 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl as described previously (17Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 12: 3936-3943Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, KF707 Bph Dox recognizes primarily a 4′-chlorinated ring to introduce O2 at the 2,3 position. Bph Dox expressed from pRPF2113, pRPF2202, and pRPF2217 exhibited 2,3-dioxygenase activity for 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl, as does the original KF707 Bph Dox. On the other hand, the same evolved Bph Dox preferentially introduced O2at the 3,4 position of the 2,5-dichlorinated ring for 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl and 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl. For 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl, the same clones produced 2-chloro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, indicating that the dioxygenase-catalyzed reaction occurred at the 2,3 position of a 2-chlorinated ring, resulting in dechlorination, as does B. cepacia LB400 (23Haddock J.D.

E. coli cells expressing the original and the evolved Bph Dox were investigated for the degradation of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin. To detect the metabolites, E. coli JM109 [pUCARA] carryingcarAaAcAd coding for carbazole 1,9 a-dioxygenase and JM109 [pQR156] carrying the genes nahAaAbAcAd coding for naphthalene dioxygenase were used, confirming that JM109 [pUCARA] produced 2,3,2′-trihydroxydiphenyl and 2,3,2′-trihydroxydiphenyl ether and that JM109 [pQR156] producedcis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzofuran andcis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzo-p-dioxin from dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin, respectively (21Sato S. Nam J.-W. Kasuga K. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Omori T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4850-4858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Resnick S.M. Gibson D.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4073-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli [pRPF2707] scarcely attacks both dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin (Table I). On the other hand, E. coli cells carrying pRPF2113, pRPF2202, and pRPF2217 attacked dibenzofuran. The GC-MS profile of the metabolites from dibenzofuran byE. coli [pRPF2202] is presented in Fig.4. These metabolites peaks were assigned to be monohydroxydibenzofuran (M+, m/z 256; DF-I), cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzofuran (M+, m/z 346; DF-II), and 2,3,2′-trihydroxydiphenyl (M+, m/z 418; DF-III).E. coli carrying pRPF2113 and pRPF2217 also produced the same compounds (DF-I, DF-II, and DF-III), but to lesser extents. For dibenzo-p-dioxin, two major peaks were detected fromE. coli cells carrying pRPF2113 and pRPF2202. Shown in Fig.5 is the GC-MS profile of the metabolites from dibenzo-p-dioxin by E. coli [pRPF2202] that exhibited the highest activity in evolved Bph Dox. These compounds were determined to be monohydroxydibenzo-p-dioxin (M+, m/z 272; DD-I) and 2,3,2′-trihydroxydiphenyl ether (M+, m/z 434; DD-III). One minor peak (M+, m/z 360; DD-II) was also detected, which was determined to becis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzo-p-dioxin. Monohydroxy compounds of DF-I and DD-I were considered to be dehydration products of cis-1,2-dihydrodiol compounds that can be spontaneously converted to 1-hydroxy and 2-hydroxy compounds in the acid extraction procedure.Figure 5GC-MS analysis of the metabolites from dibenzo-p-dioxin by E. coli[pRPF2202]. A, dibenzo-p-dioxin was scarcely converted to 2,3,2′-trihydroxydiphenyl ether by E. coli [pRPF1707]. B, E. coli [pRPF2202] converted dibenzo-p-dioxin to 2,3,2′-trihydroxydiphenyl ether (DD-III) andcis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzo-p-dioxin (DD-II), which was spontaneously converted into the 1-hydroxy and/or 2-hydroxy compounds (DD-I) of dibenzo-p-dioxin in the acid extraction procedure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was shown that dibenzothiophene and fluorene were converted to dibenzothiophene-5-oxide and 9-hydroxyfluorene, respectively, by carbazole 1,9 a-dioxygenase (30Nojiri H. Nam J.-w. Kosaka M. Mori K. Takemura T. Furihata K. Yamane H. Omori T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No metabolites were detected from dibenzothiophene and fluorene by E. coli carrying pRPF2707, pRPF2113, and pRPF2217. On the other hand, one major peak corresponding to dibenzothiophene-5-oxide (M+, m/z 200) was detected from E. coli [pRPF2202]. The same clone also produced 9-hydroxyfluorene (M+, m/z 254) from fluorene (date not shown). The nucleotide sequences of the evolved bphA1 of pRPF1113, pRPF1202, and pRPF1217 were determined. The base substitutions in the evolvedbphA1 genes and the amino acid changes are shown in Fig.3B. The nucleotide sequences of evolved bphA1genes indicated that the random recombinations took place successfully. Sequence analysis of the bphA1 from pRPF1113 revealed that seven bases were changed, resulting in the two amino acid substitutions at Val-172 to Ile (V172I) and Thr-376 to Val (T376V). The variants from the second round of mutagenesis with both pRPF1113 and the original KF707-bphA1 as the template DNA were also analyzed. Substitutions of V172I in pRPF1217 were maintained from pRPF1113, likewise, some base substitutions were inherited from pRPF1113. One mutation leading to amino acid substitution at position 376 was found in all of the recombined clones with degradation ability for dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin. Thus, it is considered that Thr-376 to Asn or Val are functional mutations for alteration of substrate specificity. All these clones converted 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl and 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl to 3,4-dihydrodiol compounds by 3,4-dioxygenase activity, recognizing the 2,5-dichlorinated ring. Furthermore, the E. coli clones carrying pRPF2113 and pRPF2202 exhibited both angular and lateral oxygenation for both dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin (Table I). In these two enzymes, Val was situated at position 376.E. coli [pRPF2217] exhibited only angular oxygenation for these compounds, in which Thr was changed to Asn at position 376. Furthermore, the oxygenation ability of this enzyme was much lower than those of Val-376 variants. Thus, lateral oxygenation of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin emerged for Bph Dox variants with Val-376. Rieske center and mononuclear iron binding in KF707-BphA1 were all conserved in the evolved BphA1. The sequencing of the evolved BphA1 allowed us to conclude that amino acid at position 376 in BphA1 is significantly involved in the oxygenation activity in Bph Dox. We therefore carried out site-directed mutagenesis for pRPF1202 BphA1, which exhibits the most extended activities. To investigate the importance of Val at position 376, two mutants of pSSF1202T and pSSF1202N were generated, in which Val-376 was replaced by Thr in pSSF1202 and by Asn in pSS1202N by site-directed mutagenesis. Bph Dox from pRPF1202, pSSF1202T, and pSSF1202N did not show any significant differences for the degradation of biphenyl, 4-methylbiphenyl, diphenylmethane, and 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl (data not shown). However, there were remarkable differences for the degradation of some other compounds tested. E. coli [pSSF1202T] hardly degraded dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin and accumulated yellow compounds from 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl, as does E. coli [pRPF1707] expressing the original Bph Dox (Table I).E. coli [pSSF1202N] exhibited 3,4-dioxygenase activity for 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl and 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl and retained high activity for dibenzofuran, as does E. coli[pRPF2202], but the degradation activity for dibenzo-p-dioxin was extremely reduced. Based on these findings, we changed Thr-376 of the original KF707 Bph Dox (pRPF2707) to Val (pSSF2707V) or Asn (pSSF2707N), respectively. The results are presented in Table I. The enzymatic properties (degradation capabilities and modes of oxygenations) from pSSF2707V enzyme were similar to those of pRPF2202 enzyme, but the enzymatic activities for the substrates tested were much higher in pRPF2202 (Table I). Likewise, the enzymatic properties from pSSF2707N were similar to those of pSSF2202N enzyme, but the enzymatic activities were higher in pSSF2202N than in pSSF2707N. Mondello et al. (31Mondello F.J. Turich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that PCB-degradative strains fell into two categories according to their degradation abilities. The strains categorized as having broad substrate specificity tend to attackortho-meta-substituted congeners such as 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl, which are oxidized at the 3,4 position. This 3,4-dioxygenase activity is relatively rare among PCB-degrading bacteria. However, they had poor activity for doublepara-substituted congeners such as 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl. In contrast, strains having a relatively narrow range of PCB substrates, including P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707, were superior with respect to the degradation of 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl but were unable to degrade 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl. Between these two categorized PCB-degradative strains, the strains with broad specificity contain Asn at 376 position in BphA1, whereas the strains with narrow specificity contain Thr at this site. It was also reported that chlorobenzene dioxygenase of Burkholderia sp. strain PS12, which utilizes 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene, attacks dibenzo-p-dioxin preferentially by lateral dioxygenation (32Beil S. Happe B. Timmis K.N. Piper D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The same enzyme converts dibenzofuran intocis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrobenzofuran as a single metabolite. Dioxygenases from carbazole-utilizingPseudomonas sp. CA10, naphthalene-utilizingPseudomonas sp. strain NCIB9816-4, and 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzen-utilizing Burkhorderia sp. strain PS12 also have broad substrate ranges (29Resnick S.M. Gibson D.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4073-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nojiri H. Nam J.-w. Kosaka M. Mori K. Takemura T. Furihata K. Yamane H. Omori T. J.

In this study, we have successfully engineered Bph Dox of P. pseudoacaligenes KF707 by rational enzyme design and random priming mutagenesis. The resulting evolved enzymes exhibited a wider range of oxygenation capabilities not only for PCBs but also for various biphenyl-related compounds. According to the method described by Shao et al. (19Shao Z. Zhao H. Giver L. Arnold F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), random hexamers were used to generate a large number of short DNA fragments complementary to different sections of the template sequences. Due to base misincorporation and mispriming, these short DNA fragments contain a low level of point mutations over template gene(s). In this work, the point mutations were intentionally introduced at the critical position of Thr-376, which is supposed to be involved in the substrate specificity (17Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 12: 3936-3943Crossref Google Scholar, 25Suenaga H. Nishi A. Watanabe T. Sakai M. Furukawa K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 87: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the essential regions for the activity, i.e. Rieske center and the mononuclear iron binding motif, were protected using the primers annealed with these regions (Fig. 2). Two rounds of random priming recombination and selection resulted in the emergence of novel Bph Dox that acquired novel degradation capabilities. The functional BphA1 exhibited specific point mutations at position 376, in which Thr was changed to Val or Asn. It was previously shown that the change of Thr-376 to Asn permits KF707-Bph Dox to acquire 3,4-dioxygenase activity for 2,5,4′-trichlorobiphenyl and 2,5,2′,5′-teterachlorobiphenyl (17Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 12: 3936-3943Crossref Google Scholar, 25Suenaga H. Nishi A. Watanabe T. Sakai M. Furukawa K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 1999; 87: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Among the evolved Bph Dox obtained in this work, the one from pRPF1202 exhibited the highest activities for all substrates, in which four amino acids of Ile-24, His-66, Lys-89, and The-376 were changed to Val-24, Tyr-66, Arg-89, and Val-376, respectively. The evolved Bph Dox from pRPF2202 exhibited remarkable relaxation in the modes of dioxygenation, i.e.angular dioxygenation and lateral dioxygenation for dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin and 2,3-dioxygenation and 3,4-dioxygenation for PCB congeners. In addition, these evolved Bph Dox catalyzed sulfoxidation of dibenzothiophene to dibenzothiophene-5-oxide and convert fluorene to 9-hydroxyfluorene. In this evolved enzyme from pRPF2202, the functional importance of Val-376 was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis for pRPF2202. The alteration of Val-376 to Thr in pSSF2202T abolished 3,4,-dioxygenase activity for PCBs and lateral dioxygenation activity for dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin. On the other hand, the alteration of Val-376 to Asn in pSSF2202N retained 3,4-dioxygenase activity for PCBs but hardly showed dioxygenase activity for dibenzo-p-dioxin. pSSF2202T and pSSF2202N also failed to attack dibenzothiophene and fluorene. Thus, Val-376 is significantly important in multifunctional oxygenase activities. The change of Thr-376 to Val (Bph Dox from pSSF2707V) in the original KF707 Bph Dox also dramatically improved the degradation capacity for various biphenyl-related compounds that include some PCB congeners, dibenzofuran, and dibenzo-p-dioxin. However, the degradation capability of Bph Dox from pRPF2202 was superior to that of Bph Dox from pSSF2707V, indicating that three other alterations of I24V, H66Y, and K89R in the pRPF2202 enzyme were also involved in the enhancement of degradation capability together with the change of T376V. The three-dimensional structure of naphthalene dioxygenase ofPseudomonas sp. NCIB9816-4 was determined and identified amino acids near the active site iron atom in the catalytic domain of the large subunit (35Kauppi B. Lee K. Carredano E. Parales R.E. Gibson D.T. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. Structure. 1998; 6: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Analysis of site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Phe-352 appears to play a major role in controlling both the stereochemistry and regioselectivity, suggesting that the novel catalytic ability can be generated by introducing a single mutation or multiple mutations near the active site (36Parales R.E. Lee K. Resnick S.M. Jiang H. Lessner D.J. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 37Parales R.E. Resnick S.M., Yu, C.-L. Boyd D.R. Sharma N.D. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of KF707 BphA1 shows ∼30% identity with the naphthalene dioxygenase large subunit (NahAc). However, the amino acids of essential regions for its activity are highly conserved (24Jiang H. Parales R.E. Lynch N.A. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it is conceivable that the Thr-376 of KF707 BphA1 lies near the active site and plays a role similar to that of Phe-352 of NahAc in the recognition of substrates. In accordance with this observation, the change of Thr-376 in BphA1 is critical to expand the substrate range of KF707 Bph Dox. The role of three other amino acids changed in the pRPF2202 enzyme remain to be elucidated, but these amino acids may be involved in the binding of substrates. Aromatic compound-utilizing bacteria are ubiquitously distributed in natural environment, suggesting that they are involved in the degradation of plant lignin at the final stage (8Chung S.-Y. Maeda M. Song E. Horikoshi K. Kudo T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 2111-2113Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is also true that oxygenase genes share different degrees of homology, suggesting that they are descendants from a common ancestry. This implies that these enzymes can be engineered for enhanced activities and expanded substrate ranges. Directed evolution can be one of the most effective tools for this purpose.

Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) has long been a prototype for ligand-gated ion channels. This receptor is involved in excitatory synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and also plays an important role in the nervous system. The nAChRs are pentameric complexes composed of homologous subunits with subunits arranged around the central channel in a symmetrical manner. The muscle-type nAChR contains two α1 subunits and one each of the β1, γ(ε), and δ subunits. The ligand binding sites are situated at the αγ(ε) and αδ subunit interfaces. The muscle-type nAChR serves as an important model for the study of the structures and functions of related ligand-gated ion channels (for review, see Ref.1Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The snake venom-derived α-neurotoxins fall into two categories, short and long neurotoxins, and act as high affinity competitive antagonists at the nAChR. Short neurotoxins (e.g. erabutoxina) contain 60–62 amino acid residues and 4 conserved disulfide bridges. Long neurotoxins have 66–74 residues and 5 disulfide bonds, including four in a core region that are homologous in position to those found in the short neurotoxins. α-Bungarotoxin (Bgtx), obtained from the snake venom of Bungarus multicinctus, is a long α-neurotoxin that over the years has provided a powerful tool for the study of muscle-type nAChRs and which has come to be viewed as somewhat of a gold standard among the α-neurotoxins. A number of the α-neurotoxins have been heterologously expressed in recent years, allowing for investigations using site-directed mutagenesis (2Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol.

Previous NMR structural studies indicate that the solution structure of Bgtx, although generally consistent with the x-ray structure, does reveal some differences (7Basus V.J. Billeter M. Love R.A. Stroud R.M. Kuntz I.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Notably, the side chain of Trp28 in the two structures resides on opposite sides of the major plane of the molecule. In the solution structure, the Trp side chain is on the concave surface, as seen with most other α-neurotoxins containing this highly conserved residue. In contrast, the Trp side chain is located on the opposite face in the crystal structure (6Love R.A. Stroud R.M. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The structures of several other snake venom α-neurotoxins have been studied with NMR techniques (8Labhardt A.M. Hunziker-Kwik E.H. Wüthrich K. Eur. J.

Previous work indicates that the main determinants for Bgtx binding to the muscle-type nAChR lie between residues 173 and 204 of the α1 subunit (13Wilson P.T. Lentz T.L. Hawrot E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8790-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), a region that coincides with one of three segments of the α subunit that have been implicated in agonist binding (for review, see Ref. 1Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Tyr190, along with Cys192, Cys193, and Tyr198 are selectively cross-linked with a variety of site-directed photoaffinity reagents (14Grutter T. Ehret-Sabatier L. Kotzyba-Hibert F. Goeldner M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This region, termed segment C, contains a conserved pair of adjacent Cys residues, Cys192-Cys193, that form an unusual disulfide. Studies of synthetic peptides with sequences matching those in segment C have identified several peptides that bind Bgtx with affinities in the micromolar to submicromolar range (15Kachalsky S.G. Jensen B.S. Barchan D. Fuchs S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10801-10805Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Wilson P.T. Hawrot E. Lentz T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 643-650PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide fragment (α18-mer) with a sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 181–198 (α-Y181RGWKHWVYYTCCPDTPY198) from theTorpedo californica nAChR binds Bgtx with an apparentKD of ∼65 nm (17Pearce S.F.A. Preston-Hurlburt P. Hawrot E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Replacing the Tyr at position 190 with a Phe leads to a 60-fold decrease in Bgtx binding affinity for the altered peptide, suggesting an important role for this aromatic residue in complex formation (17Pearce S.F.A. Preston-Hurlburt P. Hawrot E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutations of Tyr190, when assessed in heterologous expression systems, also result in large decreases in α-neurotoxin binding (3Malany S. Osaka H. Sine S.M. Taylor P.

McLaughlin J.T. Jurman M.E. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 721-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Galzi J.L. Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F.

Studies with recombinant receptor fragments corresponding to the α subunit from the mongoose nAChR, which is resistant to α-neurotoxins, suggest two subsites in the binding domain for Bgtx; one is a proline subsite consisting of Pro194 and Pro197, and the other is an aromatic subsite involving positions 187 and 189 (15Kachalsky S.G. Jensen B.S. Barchan D. Fuchs S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10801-10805Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We previously described some of the structural features revealed by an NMR analysis of Bgtx complexed with a 12-amino acid peptide fragment (α12-mer) of the Torpedo nAChR α1 subunit (α-K185HWVYYTCCPDT196), which has an apparentKD of ∼1.4 μm (17Pearce S.F.A. Preston-Hurlburt P. Hawrot E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Basus V.J. Song G. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12290-12298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We now describe a more expansive NMR structural analysis of the higher affinity complex formed with the α18-mer. The structure of this complex may provide valuable information on the orientation of the contact residues in the native nAChR and may help in elucidating the essential interactions that direct the ability of the α-neurotoxins to recognize receptor sequences with remarkable affinity and specificity. We designed an oligonucleotide sequence to encode for residues 181–198 (YRGWKHWVYYTCCPDTPY) of the α1 subunit from the nAChR of T. californica. Three copies of this expression cassette were inserted downstream of a 125-amino acid ketosteroid isomerase gene and upstream of a His-tag sequence in plasmid pET-31b(+) (23Kuliopulos A. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4599-4607Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The final construct, ketosteroid isomerase-Met-(α18-mer-Met)3-His-tag, contained single Met residues separating the three cassettes from each other, from ketosteroid isomerase, and from the C-terminal His tag. The oligonucleotide sequence of this construct is available upon request. The plasmid, whose insert sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, was used to transform cells of the expression strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). Cell cultures were grown in standard M9 medium except that 15NH4Cl was used as a replacement for normal NH4Cl. All cultures were supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (M9/Amp). A single colony from a fresh agar plate containing ampicillin was used to inoculate 100 ml M9/Amp medium and grown overnight at 37 °C. The overnight culture was added to 2 liters of M9/Amp medium in a VirTis benchtop fermentor. This culture was grown at 37 °C with stirring at 600 rpm until theA600 was 0.7–0.8. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm to initiate induction of the fusion protein. After 3 h, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation. After resuspension in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9), cells were passed through a French pressure cell (SLM Instruments) at 15,000 p.s.i. Inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in “binding buffer” (6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.5 mNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)), and applied to a column containing Ni2+-charged His-Bind resin (Novagen) prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. After washing the resin with 10 column volumes of binding buffer and 5 column volumes of wash buffer (6 mguanidine-HCl, 40 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9), the ketosteroid isomerase fusion protein was eluted in 5 column volumes of elution buffer (6m guanidine-HCl, 0.3 m imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). The fusion protein prepared as described above was dialyzed against water, and the insoluble fusion protein was isolated by centrifugation. The pellet was then resuspended in 20 ml of 80% formic acid in a round-bottom flask and mixed with 1 g of cyanogen bromide (CNBr). After flushing the solution with helium, the flask was sealed, and the reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted 1:1 with water and applied to a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters). The peptide was eluted with 4 ml of 35% acetonitrile in water and dried using a SpeedVac (Savant). The dry peptide was resuspended in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 2 days to deformylate the products. The peptide sample prepared as described above was diluted 1:1 with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A) and applied to a C18 reverse phase Discovery column (Supelco). The peptides were eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min with buffer B (25% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Peak fractions were collected and then dried using a SpeedVac (Savant). Isolated peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Yale Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Resource and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory). The disulfide form of the peptide with a C-terminal homoserine lactone was chosen for further structural analysis. The15N-labeled disulfide homoserine lactone form of the Torpedo α18-mer was resuspended in 50 mm perdeuterated potassium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) with 5% D2O and 0.05% sodium azide. Bgtx (from Sigma) was prepared in the same buffer at a concentration of 5 mm. Bgtx from this stock solution was added to the α18-mer to form a 1:1 Bgtx·α18-mer complex. The final concentration of the Bgtx·α18-mer complex was 2.1 mm. The “free Bgtx” NMR sample was diluted from stock Bgtx into the same buffer to a final concentration of 2.0 mm. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz NMR spectrometer at a temperature of 35 °C. Chemical shifts at this temperature were calibrated with respect to internal 3-(trimethylsilyl) tetradeutero sodium propionate (0.0 ppm). The formation of the Bgtx·α18-mer complex was followed in a mole-ratio titration using a two-dimensional 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (1H-15N HSQC) (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V.

Engl. 1993; 32: 1489-1491Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 60 ms. The assignments of the NH protons and CαH protons of the amino acid spin systems of the peptide were further confirmed by a three-dimensional HNHA experiment (32Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 33Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional HNHA experiment provides the correlation between the 15NH proton and the CαH proton of the same amino acid; these data help confirm the identification of the NH and CαH protons. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlations (sequential, medium-range, and long range NOEs) were identified by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar, 25Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. Ser.

Engl. 1993; 32: 1489-1491Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 120 ms. Spectra from these experiments were also collected at 25 °C to facilitate the assignment of resonances. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed with XwinNmr (Bruker), NMRPipe (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar), and SPARKY (35Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3.95. University of California, San Francisco, CA2000Google Scholar). In comparing our results with earlier, more preliminary assignments involving an unlabeled α18-mer peptide bound to Bgtx (36Gentile L.N. Basus V.J. Shi Q.-L. Hawrot E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 757: 222-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we found that most Bgtx assignments are the same or similar (chemical shifts change less than 0.05 ppm) after calibration. However, the assignments of Val2, His4, Ser9, Ile11, Lys26, Cys29, Cys33, Val40, Lys51, Lys52, Lys70, Gln71, Arg72, and Gly74 were significantly different; in most cases no comparable resonances were observed in our two-dimensional NOESY spectra. On the other hand, new resonance peaks appear elsewhere in the spectra. All these new resonances involving these residues were re-assigned based on sequential NOE connectivity. We think it most likely that the observed chemical shift differences between the two samples are caused by a difference in the ionic strength of the two samples even though both were prepared at pH 4.0 and spectra were acquired at 35 °C. Our present sample is dissolved in 50 mm potassium acetate, whereas the earlier sample was simply adjusted to pH 4.0 with the addition of HCl. A change in the ionic environment could have significant effects on electrostatic interactions between side chains of charged residues, leading to changes in the chemical environment of a subset of spins. Similarly, it was necessary to re-assign most of the α18-mer peptide resonances. Of the eight previously assigned peptide residues, only Asp195and Thr196 are unchanged between the two samples. However, the CαH proton and CβH proton of Thr196 were erroneously assigned previously (36Gentile L.N. Basus V.J. Shi Q.-L. Hawrot E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 757: 222-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The new swapped assignments incorporate the results from the three-dimensional HNHA experiment. The cross-peak volumes in the two-dimensional NOESY spectra were integrated by the Gaussian fitting protocol using SPARKY. The cross-peaks were classified into three categories: strong, medium, and weak, with corresponding distance ranges of 1.8–3.0, 1.8–4.0, and 1.8–5.0 Å, respectively. The HN-Hα3 J coupling constants of the α18-mer peptide were obtained from the three-dimensional HNHA experiment (37Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The 3 Jcoupling constants were converted to dihedral angle restraints using previously described methods (38Thompson G.S. Leung Y.-C. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Redfield C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For 3 J< 6 Hz, the dihedral angle restraint was assigned to −60° ± 30°; for 3 J > 8 Hz, the dihedral angle restraint was −120° ± 40°. All structures were calculated with distance geometry and simulated annealing protocols using the dg_sa.inp script of the NMR structure calculation program, CNSsolve (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The following is the potential energy function used in these calculations:Ftotal = Fbon +Fang + Fimp +Fvdw + Fnoe +Fcdih, where Fbon relates to bond length, Fang andFimp to bond angles, Fvdwrelates to the van der Waals repulsion term,Fnoe relates to NOE distance constraints, andFcdih relates to dihedral angles. Pseudoatoms were used for protons that could not be stereospecifically assigned. The pseudoatom correction feature of CNSsolve was used to adjust the NOE distance constraint range automatically. In each batch of calculations, a different random seed number was used to initiate the calculation of a set of 50 structures. From the pool of calculated structures, only those structures lacking any NOE violation (>0.5 Å) were selected as “acceptable” for further analysis. As a result of the weighting of the Fnoe term in CNSsolve, none of the other energy terms were as critical asFnoe in determining an acceptable structure. In total, 120 acceptable structures of the Bgtx·α18-mer complex were obtained from 6 batches of independent calculations (i.e.300 total structures), and 122 acceptable structures of free Bgtx were obtained from 8 batches of independent calculations (i.e.400 total structures). The 20 lowest-energy structures out of the acceptable structures for free Bgtx and for the Bgtx·α18-mer complex were selected to form an ensemble of representative final structures. The mean structure corresponding to each ensemble was calculated by a program written by Dr. Christian Rölz (40Rölz C. Mierke D.F. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 89: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The two mean structures (free Bgtx and Bgtx·α18-mer complex) were further partially energy-minimized using DISCOVER (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) to create representative structures complete with side chains. All structures depicted in Fig. 7 have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics. The four files corresponding to the mean and ensemble structures for the Bgtx·α18-mer complex and for free Bgtx have been assigned the identifiers 1IDG, 1IDH, 1IDI, 1IDL. We used Rasmol (41Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar), MOLMOL (42Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), and INSIGHT II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) for the graphical analysis of the calculated structures. The surface charge potentials were calculated using MOLMOL. The contact surface areas of all the final individual Bgtx·α18-mer complex structures were calculated by contacts of structural units (CSU) using CSU software (43Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The energetically significant cation-π interaction analysis of the Bgtx·α18-mer complex structures was performed using the CaPTURE program (44Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). To facilitate the assignment of the α18-mer peptide resonances while complexed with Bgtx, the peptide corresponding to Torpedo nAChR α1 subunit residues 181–198 was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli as part of an insoluble fusion protein under conditions where15NH4Cl was used as sole source of nitrogen. After isolation of the fusion protein, CNBr cleavage at engineered Met sites was used to release the desired peptide, which contained the 18 residues of α1 subunit with an additional C-terminal residue derived from the engineered Met. As expected for CNBr cleavage of Met sites, the peptides isolated are a mix of the C-terminal homoserine form of the peptide and its corresponding dehydrated homoserine lactone form. HPLC analysis revealed three major peptide peaks which were further characterized (Fig. 1). Preliminary solid-phase binding studies indicated that all three peptide fractions bind Bgtx to an extent comparable with that obtained with a similar synthetic α18-mer peptide lacking the C-terminal homoserine (data not shown). All three peptide fractions were resistant to thiol alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide except after prior incubation of the peptide with dithiothreitol. These results suggest that the adjacent cysteines, Cys192 and Cys193, are in the disulfide state in the isolated peptides. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that P2 corresponds to the C-terminal homoserine lactone form of the α18-mer, whereas P1 is the C-terminal homoserine form. The P2 peptide was chosen for the production of a Bgtx·α18-mer complex. The pure α18-mer (P2) was resuspended in 50 mm perdeuterated potassium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and analyzed with a two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiment that is designed to acquire signal only from protons bound to 15N (Fig. 2 A). An equimolar amount of Bgtx was then added, and the sample was again analyzed by HSQC (Fig. 2 B). A comparison of these spectra (Fig. 2) clearly demonstrates the formation of a stoichiometric complex between the α18-mer and Bgtx. The free peptide (Fig. 2 A) appears to be largely unstructured; all the NH resonances are poorly dispersed in chemical shift and vary in intensity. In contrast, after binding to Bgtx (Fig. 2 B), nearly all the NH resonances undergo large chemical shift changes, and there is little evidence of any free peptide remaining based on the disappearance of resonances seen in the free peptide. These observations suggest that the α18-mer adopts a defined structure upon binding to Bgtx. Furthermore, in mole-ratio titration studies with less than stoichiometric concentrations of Bgtx, NH resonances corresponding to both the bound and the free peptide are present, and the chemical shift of the NH resonances for the bound peptide are fixed and do not vary with Bgtx concentrations (data not shown). These results indicate that the Bgtx·α18-mer complex is in slow exchange. Because only the peptide is15N-enriched, 15N three-dimensional NMR experiments can be used to filter out Bgtx proton signals that are not correlated to 15N. Making use of this enrichment, three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC, NOESY-HSQC, and HNHA experiments were obtained to make preliminary amino acid assignments of the α18-mer in its bound form. Fig. 3 illustrates a representative strip analysis used to identify the resonances of Lys185. Three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC analysis is used to identify the resonances correlated by through-bound scalar connectivity to the 15NH (i.e. CαH proton, CβH proton, etc.). Using these three-dimensional NMR experiments, we assigned the observable resonances for all of the amino acid residues in the α18-mer except for the N-terminal Tyr181, which has an exchangeable NH, the C-terminal homoserine lactone, whose mobility may cause its signals to be too weak to be identified, and the two prolines, which lack amide protons (Fig.2 B). These assignments of the peptide resonances greatly facilitated the assignment of the Bgtx resonances in the homonuclear two-"
https://openalex.org/W1964566372,"To interpret the recent atomic structures of the Kv (voltage-dependent potassium) channel T1 domain in a functional context, we must understand both how the T1 domain is integrated into the full-length functional channel protein and what functional roles the T1 domain governs. The T1 domain clearly plays a role in restricting Kv channel subunit heteromultimerization. However, the importance of T1 tetramerization for the assembly and retention of quarternary structure within full-length channels has remained controversial. Here we describe a set of mutations that disrupt both T1 assembly and the formation of functional channels and show that these mutations produce elevated levels of the subunit monomer that becomes subject to degradation within the cell. In addition, our experiments reveal that the T1 domain lends stability to the full-length channel structure, because channels lacking the T1 containing N terminus are more easily denatured to monomers. The integration of the T1 domain ultrastructure into the full-length channel was probed by proteolytic mapping with immobilized trypsin. Trypsin cleavage yields an N-terminal fragment that is further digested to a tetrameric domain, which remains reactive with antisera to T1, and that is similar in size to the T1 domain used for crystallographic studies. The trypsin-sensitive linkages retaining the T1 domain are cleaved somewhat slowly over hours. Therefore, they seem to be intermediate in trypsin resistance between the rapidly cleaved extracellular linker between the first and second transmembrane domains, and the highly resistant T1 core, and are likely to be partially structured or contain dynamic structure. Our experiments suggest that tetrameric atomic models obtained for the T1 domain do reflect a structure that the T1 domain sequence forms early in channel assembly to drive subunit protein tetramerization and that this structure is retained as an integrated stabilizing structural element within the full-length functional channel. To interpret the recent atomic structures of the Kv (voltage-dependent potassium) channel T1 domain in a functional context, we must understand both how the T1 domain is integrated into the full-length functional channel protein and what functional roles the T1 domain governs. The T1 domain clearly plays a role in restricting Kv channel subunit heteromultimerization. However, the importance of T1 tetramerization for the assembly and retention of quarternary structure within full-length channels has remained controversial. Here we describe a set of mutations that disrupt both T1 assembly and the formation of functional channels and show that these mutations produce elevated levels of the subunit monomer that becomes subject to degradation within the cell. In addition, our experiments reveal that the T1 domain lends stability to the full-length channel structure, because channels lacking the T1 containing N terminus are more easily denatured to monomers. The integration of the T1 domain ultrastructure into the full-length channel was probed by proteolytic mapping with immobilized trypsin. Trypsin cleavage yields an N-terminal fragment that is further digested to a tetrameric domain, which remains reactive with antisera to T1, and that is similar in size to the T1 domain used for crystallographic studies. The trypsin-sensitive linkages retaining the T1 domain are cleaved somewhat slowly over hours. Therefore, they seem to be intermediate in trypsin resistance between the rapidly cleaved extracellular linker between the first and second transmembrane domains, and the highly resistant T1 core, and are likely to be partially structured or contain dynamic structure. Our experiments suggest that tetrameric atomic models obtained for the T1 domain do reflect a structure that the T1 domain sequence forms early in channel assembly to drive subunit protein tetramerization and that this structure is retained as an integrated stabilizing structural element within the full-length functional channel. voltage-dependent potassium broad complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac first transmembrane segment, S2, second transmembrane segment size exclusion chromatography green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP Chinese hamster ovary 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid fast protein liquid chromatography phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis activation domain DNA-binding domain pox virus and zinc finger The structural elements of potassium channels have begun to be characterized in atomic detail, allowing much increased sophistication in our understanding of their mechanism of action and biological function. For voltage-dependent potassium (Kv)1 channels, the structure of the highly conserved cytoplasmic N-terminal T1 domain has been determined as a rotationally symmetric tetramer from three different Kv channels and in complex with an auxiliary β-subunit protein (1Kreusch A.

Because the T1 domain structures are determined from isolated soluble protein domains, questions arise as to the relevance of the determined structures to the ultrastructure of the full-length Kv channel and in how the tetrameric domain is integrated into the remainder of the channel. Recent published studies have suggested that the T1 structure within the channel is likely to be very similar to the tetrameric structure of the isolated domain (3Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C.

However, crystallography also has shown that the T1 domain can adopt several different conformations within the channel that may be involved in regulating channel gating properties (3Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Gulbis J. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R.

Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Specifically, there is conformational variability in the C-terminal region that is anticipated to be against the membrane (4Gulbis J. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 6Cushman S. Manao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the T1 domain has been found to adopt a three-dimensional fold, called the BTB/POZ fold, that is observed in other protein complexes (8Choe S. Kreutsch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24 (abstr.): 345-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Prive G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, other BTB/POZ subunits often exist in oligomeric association as monomeric or dimeric subunits, and there are multiple binding faces for other subunit proteins found within this fold as well. This particular domain then affords many possible binding interactions to itself, to other domains of the full-length channel, or to other proteins. Clearly, then, it becomes important to assess the ultrastructure of the T1 domain within the intact channel to formulate models for channel mechanism and biological activity. The T1 domain was identified originally as an important site for regulating intersubunit interactions during channel assembly, such that only a restricted number of heterotetramers are made from the many possible Kv channel subunit proteins that are synthesized within a single cell (5Shen N.V.

Nevertheless, several groups have reported the functional expression of Kv channels after the deletion of the T1 domain in channel overexpression systems (13Lee T.E. Phillipson L.H. Kuznetzov A. Nelson D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 667-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Kobertz W.R. Miller C. Nat. Struct.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Hopkins W.F. Demas V. Tempel B.L. J.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The fact that channels can form without a T1 domain might be expected, because the membrane itself can serve to nucleate secondary structure into incorporated peptides via the hydrophobic effect (25White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), and the transmembrane core of the Kv channel is shared with a large number of homologous and tetrameric channel proteins that lack a T1 domain (26Mackinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 27Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 115-135Google Scholar). However, it does call into question what T1-T1 interactions might add to Kv channel formation and the resultant ultrastructure and whether these conformations might be a dynamic aspect of channel gating. We know from electrophysiological data (3Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Gulbis J. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) that there is a relationship between T1 conformation and gating, even if we do not know the exact details of how the T1 domain integrates into the intact channel ultrastructure, such as the number and nature of its contacts with other channel elements. Point mutations within the T1 domain of two different Shaker channels alter channel electrophysiology, suggesting that there is a very tight energetic and therefore conformational link between T1 and the channel gating elements. Based on the above electrophysiology and the rotational symmetry of the tetrameric T1, we suggest that the T1 domain lies in alignment with the pore and gating elements as has been proposed (3Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Gulbis J. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R.

Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This suggests that the T1 domain C terminus abuts S4 and possibly interacts with S6 and the channel C terminus, but this has not yet been demonstrated. Recent data from the Miller laboratory (7Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10347-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have shown that the atomic structure of the isolated tetramer can be used to correctly predict cross-linking pairs of amino acids in the full-length channel, indicating that the crystal structure of the T1 domain does approximate the ultrastructure in this portion of the full-length channel. Additionally, they suggest that the T1 domain is a “hanging gondola” tethered to the membranous channel portions by “cables” of unknown structural characteristics. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about how the T1 domain is integrated into the remainder of the channel. It is expected that the T1-S1 linkage lies near the outer edge of the channel, because S1 appears to be a lipid-facing transmembrane segment (28Monks S.A. Needleman D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Hong K.H. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but structural details of the linkage between the T1 domain and the first transmembrane segment, S1, are lacking because of solubility problems encountered with crystallization attempts on this construct. In a recent article from the Jan laboratory (31Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a completely distinct tetrameric motif of roughly the same dimensions as the T1 domain was found to provide a scaffolding platform for the efficient and high yield formation of a surface channel even though the permuted channel itself had altered kinetic and gating properties. Based on similarities in the electron micrographs of Kv channels and the nicotinic receptor (32Li M. Unwin N. Stauffer K.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that an aqueous gap exists between the T1 domain and the transmembrane domains in the open channel (33Biggin P.C. Roosild T. Choe S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and that the linkage here corresponds to the cables of the hanging gondola model (7Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10347-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). If it is the primary link from T1 to the membrane integrated channel and itself contains little structure or it folds independently of the T1 domain, this linker may explain why the Jan laboratory successfully substituted a completely separate tetrameric motif for T1. We have taken a mutational approach toward the study of T1 subunit interactions and their role in the structure and stability of the intact channel. We have generated a set of point mutations that affect subunit interactions in T1 and subsequently disrupt tetramer formation. These mutations were generated from a random screen, yet the mutated residues are the very same amino acids that are conserved among either all Kv channels or the Shaker subfamily. We next examined the ability of full length Kv subunit proteins to form channels when the T1 region contained these same mutations and found disruptions in tetrameric channel assembly, as would be expected if T1 tetramer formation drives the assembly and cell surface expression of the intact channel. Within the crystal structure of T1, these mutated amino acids were found either at subunit interfaces or at critical locations for subunit folding, and thus, the perturbations in channel assembly provide independent confirmation of the absolute requirement for correct T1 folding and assembly to occur in the intact channel. We then present further biochemical analysis of these mutants and the native intact channel to examine the role of T1 in the dynamic regulation of channel assembly and in the ultrastructure of the intact channel. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was conducted according to the method of Fields and Song (35Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar), using a Gal4 two-hybrid phagemid vector kit (Stratagene), and the manufacturer's instructions for the quantitative determination of β-galactosidase expression, witho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a colorimetric substrate. Region-specific random mutagenesis was performed using randomly mutagenizing oligonucleotides of ∼90 bases (Ref. 36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.96Google Scholar). (Oligonucleotides are synthesized to a specific region with doped bases, in which each base is doped at the 0.15% level with the other three bases. This doping creates a low probability of misincorporation at every position along the oligonucleotide. If each base has an equal probability of incorporation, then the calculated mutation rate is low enough to produce most full-length oligonucleotides with 0–2 random point mutations per oligonucleotide.) Mutagenizing oligonucleotides were used in primer extension reactions, made double-stranded, and cassette-cloned into Gal4-AD-T1. Libraries of mutant T1 domains were made by transforming the ligations into bacteria and preparing the DNA from >98% colonies in the plate of transformants, taking care to avoid disparity in colony growth. These cDNA libraries were then transformed into Gal4-BD-T1 yeast and plated at a low density to allow clear growth of single colonies. T1 assembly mutants were identified by the inability of a yeast colony containing both vectors to express β-galactosidase. The mutated T1 cassettes, which resulted in white colonies as Gal4-AD-T1 mutants, were swapped into the Gal4-BD-T1 vector and retested against wild-type Gal4-AD-T1. For most mutations, the results were very similar when the mutation was placed in either the AD or BD fusion construct. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing of the entire cassette. Further characterization by in vitro translation of mutant T1 domains and identification of monomer and tetrameric fractions by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed as described previously (21Pfaffinger P.J. DeRubeis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28595-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For making the full-length constructs, mutant T1 domains were cassette-cloned into the Aplysia Shaker Kv1.1 coding sequence either with or without an EGFP tag made by in-frame cloning of EGFP after residue 477 of the aKv1.1 C terminus. To enhance characterization in physiology studies, the first four N-terminal amino acids of aKv1.1 were removed to reduce N-type inactivation. For the analysis of monomer and tetramer fractions of T1 mutant full-length channels proteins were transfected into CHO cells, and membranes were isolated as described below and then solubilized in 1% CHAPS either with or without added SDS at 1%. SEC-FPLC separation was performed with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC over a Superose-6 column with added CHAPS to 0.5%. Full-length constructs were expressed inXenopus oocytes by either microinjection of cytomegalovirus promoter cDNA expression constructs into the nucleus ofXenopus oocytes or injection of cRNA made in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. For each batch of oocytes, a control wild-type construct expression was used to determine the expected amount of channel expression for a given length of time. Recordings were performed from 1 to 3 days after injection as described previously (6Cushman S. Manao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Expression levels were compared by measuring peak current levels in response to a voltage pulse to +60 mV for 100–200 ms. All tissue culture supplies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. except for serum that was purchased from Hyclone, Inc. The microscopic analysis of cells transfected with Kv1.1-EGFP and its mutants was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope, using the recommended settings for EGFP detection, with parallel capturing of the optical image. Serial sections were taken in 0.8-micron steps starting at the cell–coverslip interface using an ×63 oil-immersion objective lens. Representative sections are shown. COS7 cells plated on glass coverslips were transfected with Fugene™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer using the same cDNA constructions that were tested in oocyte expression studies. At 24–30 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 3% formaldehyde (EMS, Ft. Washington, PA) in PBS/0.15 mm Ca2+ for 30 min, washed again with ice-cold PBS, and mounted with VectaShield™ (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Colocalization experiments to demonstrate that the monomeric subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum were conducted using fluorescence immunocytochemistry with antisera to an endoplasmic reticulum protein standard, calnexin, and a secondary antibody tagged with rhodamine (both antisera from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, fixed cells were permeabilized with a CHAPS wash of 0.5% CHAPS in PBS for 30 min, blocked with normal donkey serum (Cappel Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:10 in PBS, reacted with the primary antiserum at a dilution of 1:100 for 30 min, washed with PBS (three changes over 30 min), and finally reacted with the secondary antiserum at a dilution of 1:100 prior to microscopy. Membrane preparations of aKv1.1 (37Pfaffinger P.J. Furukawa Y. Zhoe B. Dugan D. Kandel E.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 918-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from a stable CHO-derived cell line expressing a C-terminal EGFP-tagged aKv1.1 channel were made by low ionic strength lysis of the cells (1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 in a 100-mm dish of cells at >85% confluency with the following protease inhibitors added: 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of EDTA-free protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 0 °C, followed by brief sonication, a low speed spin of 1500 rpm for 2 min to remove organelles, and a high speed spin of 60,000 rpm for 20 min to pellet the membranes. The pellet was resuspended in PBS, sonicated briefly to obtain a uniform opalescent suspension, and subjected to trypsin digestion. Trypsin immobilized onto agarose beads in a 1:1 suspension with H2O added at a ratio of 1:20 (ml of membrane preparation:beads), and the mixture was rotated for 16 h at room temperature. The digested Kv1.1 preparation was passed through a 0.2-micron filter to remove trypsin and membrane-associated proteins before separation on a Superose-12 SEC-FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) run in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. Fractions were acetone-precipitated and run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and the locations of proteins were determined by Western blotting (21Pfaffinger P.J. DeRubeis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28595-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For chemical cross-linking, the released trypsin-resistant tetramer was isolated as described above and compared with the T1 domain purified from bacterial expression. All cross-linking reagents were from Pierce. Tested cross-linkers includedN-α-[maleimidoacetoxy]succinimide ester, bismaleimidoethane, disuccinimidyl glutarate, N-succinimidyl iodoacetate. Cross-linking was carried out for 30 min at room temperature in the FPLC buffer, using 1 mm cross-linking reagent, and then stopped using l-cysteine at 2.5 mm. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar) to determine the extent of cross-linking. We first sought to examine how the formation of the functional channel is affected by T1 domain point mutations that demonstrate altered intersubunit T1 domain interactions. To address this question, we first identified point mutations within the T1 domain that disrupt the ability of the domain to tetramerize. We then determined whether these point mutations disrupt intact Kv channel assembly and the formation of functional channels. To rapidly characterize a large number of such point mutations, we performed a genetic screen for T1 assembly mutations using the yeast two-hybrid system. We first confirmed that the natural specificities for homomeric and heteromeric T1 assembly were reproduced in the standard yeast two-hybrid screen, as previously described (16Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 415-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24761-24768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To identify point mutations of the Shaker T1 domain that disrupt assembly, we created a library of T1 domain mutations, using a randomly doped oligonucleotide-based approach (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.96Google Scholar), fused to Gal4-AD. We then cotransfected this library with a wild-type Gal4-BD-T1 fusion construct and tested it for activation of the LacZ reporter gene using X-gal. White colonies, which are indicative of a failure of the T1 domains to interact in these yeast, were characterized to determine the molecular basis for the deficit. The mutant Gal4-AD-T1 domain clones were isolated and sequenced, and their phenotype was confirmed by retransformation, transfer of the deficiency to the Gal4-BD-T1 construct by subcloning of the mutant T1 domain sequences, and failure of the mutant T1 domains to tetramerize after in vitrotranslation (5Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition to frameshift mutations and stop codons, 12 different missense point mutations that satisfied these criteria were identified (see Fig. 1A). These mutations are distributed throughout the T1 domain from residues 75–168 and are found to encode a variety of changes to conserved amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Based on the T1 structure, these mutations likely produce either steric blocks to subunit tetramerization or alter the packing between layers of secondary structure within the monomer (Table I).Table IResidues important for tetramer formation in Kv1.1 T1 domain generated from a yeast two-hybrid screen used to randomly generate inhibitory mutationsResidueLocation, T1 structureInterpretation for loss of tetramer formation1L75PLayer 1, N terminus, β-strand 2Interrupts β1→β2 loop to β2 strand interaction at subunit interface2F87SLayer 1, interhelical loop α1–α2 conserved among all KvDestabilizes intradomain packing between layers 1 and 33P88LLayer 1, interhelical loop α1–α2 conserved among all Kv1.xChange polypeptide chain angle, destabilizes intradomain packing between layers 1 and 34F110SLayer 1, C terminus, β-strand 4 conserved among all KvDestabilizes intradomain packing within layer 15D119YLayer 2, mid-helix, α3 conserved among all Kv1.x and adjacent to F118, which is conserved among all KvInterrupts polar subunit interface between Asp-119, Arg-115′, Gln-126, and Ser-73′6I121TLayer 2, mid-helix, α3 conserved among all KvInterrupts polar subunit interface betw"

Kinetics of AANAT extracted from 1E7 cells are the same as those of bacterially expressed hAANAT; both preparations of hAANAT are equally sensitive to the inhibitor CoA-S-N-acetyltryptamine. Studies of cAMP regulation indicate that treatment with forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, or isoproterenol activate cellular hAANAT within intact 1E7 cells ∼8-fold without markedly increasing the abundance of AANAT protein or the activity of AANAT in broken cell preparations; and, that forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine and isoproterenol elevate cyclic AMP production. These observations extend our understanding of cAMP regulation of AANAT activity, because it is currently thought that this only involves changes in the steady-state levels of AANAT protein. This previously unrecognized switching mechanism could function physiologically to control melatonin production without changing AANAT protein levels. Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (serotonin N-acetyltransferase, AANAT, EC 2.3.1.87) is the penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis.

Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland. Chapman and Hall, London1995Google Scholar). It is synthesized in the pineal gland and acts as “the hormone of the night.” Hormonal melatonin has been implicated in sleep and circadian clock function in vertebrates in general, and melatonin has been used as a drug to reduce jet lag. In many species it plays an essential role in seasonal reproduction, because seasonal changes in the length of the night are transduced as changes in the duration of the melatonin signal. Retinal melatonin is thought to play a paracrine role in some species by mediating dark-adaptive retinal processes (2Iuvone P.M. Djamgoz M.B.A. Archer S. Vallerga S. Neurobiology and Clinical Aspects of the Outer Retina. Chapman and Hall, London1995: 25-55Crossref Google Scholar). Melatonin is a highly lipophilic compound and is not stored to a significant degree at the sites of synthesis. Hence, the release and circulating levels of melatonin reflect the rate at which melatonin is synthesized (serotonin (5-HT1) →N-acetylserotonin (NAS) → melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine)). The mechanisms that regulate dynamic changes in melatonin synthesis are thought to converge on the penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis, arylalkylamineN-acetyltransferase (serotonin N-acetyltransferase, AANAT, EC 2.3.1.87). Accordingly, this enzyme plays a unique dual regulatory/synthetic role in vertebrate photochemical transduction (3Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M.

Large changes in the abundance of this enzyme, as indicated by measurements of activity in homogenates and immunoreactive protein, are thought to be responsible for the large day/night rhythms in melatonin synthesis in the pineal gland and retina; and, for the rapid light-induced suppression of melatonin production at night (1Arendt J. Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland. Chapman and Hall, London1995Google Scholar, 2Iuvone P.M. Djamgoz M.B.A. Archer S. Vallerga S. Neurobiology and Clinical Aspects of the Outer Retina.

AANAT regulatory mechanisms operate at several levels. One is transcription: in some, but not all, species, changes in AANAT transcription occur on a circadian basis. This is most evident in rodents, in which the night/day difference in pineal AANAT mRNA is >100-fold (5Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Baler R. McCune S.K. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As a result, AANAT synthesis is essentially limited to the period of the night when AANAT mRNA is elevated. A similar, albeit less dynamic, situation exists in the chicken and pike (6Bernard M. Iuvone P.M. Cassone V.M. Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Coon S.L. Bégay V. Deurloo D. Falcón J. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9076-9082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), in which the night/day difference in AANAT mRNA is smaller because of higher day time levels. In ungulates, however, AANAT mRNA is continually elevated and does not exhibit a marked night/day difference, enabling AANAT protein to be synthesized continuously (8Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A second regulatory mechanism involves cAMP control of AANAT protein through inhibition of proteasomal proteolysis (10Gastel J.A. Roseboom P.H. Rinaldi P.A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Science. 1998; 279: 1358-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This appears to be important in all species and explains the increase in AANAT protein seen in ungulate pinealocytes upon noradrenergic stimulation and the disappearance of AANAT protein that occurs when animals or photosensitive pinealocytes are exposed to light during the middle of the night (9Schomerus C. Korf H.W. Laedtke E. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Gastel J.A. Roseboom P.H. Rinaldi P.A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C.

These two mechanisms contribute to steady-state levels of AANAT protein; it is now generally thought that a change in the steady-state levels of AANAT protein is the primary factor regulating changes in AANAT activity and melatonin production. Although most data are consistent with the view that AANAT activity is regulated by controlling the steady-state levels of AANAT protein, limited observations in the literature point to the existence of another regulatory mechanism through which melatonin production might change without altering AANAT protein and AANAT activity as estimated in broken cell preparations (13Namboodiri M.A.A. Sugden D. Klein D.C. Tamarkin L. Mefford I.N. J. Comp. Biochem. 1984; 80B: 731-736Google Scholar, 14Namboodiri M.A.A. Sugden D. Klein D.C. Grady R. Mefford I.N. J.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This hypothetical activation/inactivation mechanism is of special interest, because it may explain the very rapid physiological increase in circulating melatonin seen at the onset of the dark period in humans as well as other species (1Arendt J. Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland. Chapman and Hall, London1995Google Scholar, 16Reppert S.M. Perlow M.J. Tamarkin L. Klein D.C.

Analysis of the regulation of the human form of AANAT (hAANAT) has been difficult for several reasons. In the case of the pineal gland and retina, tissue availability is limited; in the case of the human retinoblastoma-derived Y79 cell line, AANAT expression is very low (19Pierce M.E. Barker D. Harrington J. Takahashi J. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of the regulation of the intracellular activity of AANAT in tissue or primary cell preparations from any species is confounded, because the rate of production of acetylated products, either NAS or melatonin, may reflect changes in the synthesis of serotonin (tryptophan → hydroxytryptophan → 5-HT) or in factors involved in the conversion of 5-HT to melatonin other than AANAT. To overcome these limitations, we established a clonal hAANAT-expressing cell line (1E7) derived from COS7 cells, as described in this report. Expression is comparable to that in homogenates of rat pineal glands obtained at night. It was possible to use this system to monitor the activity of AANAT in intact cells, by providing cells with 5-methoxytryptamine, which was converted by AANAT to melatonin. The highly lipophilic nature of melatonin resulted in it being released, providing an estimate of the intracellular activity of AANAT. Using this approach, it was found that AANAT can be activated in the intact cell without significant changes in AANAT protein or broken cell activity. This advance may have important physiological implications. COS7 cells were obtained from T. Kim, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Cells were maintained at 37 °C, 95% air, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Other details are provided in the figure legends. Sheep pineal glands were obtained from male Ile de France lambs (12–16 weeks old) that had been housed for 2 weeks in a light:dark 12:12 lighting cycle (National Institute of Agricultural Research, Nouzilly, France). Animals were killed by exsanguination; pineal glands were removed and placed on solid CO2. Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY) were housed in a 14:10 lighting cycle for 2 weeks prior to killing. Animals were killed by exposure to CO2, and the pineal glands were removed and placed on solid CO2. Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; ∼300 g, female) were obtained commercially and maintained in the laboratory in oxygenated recycled filtered pond water (12 °C) in a 13:11 lighting cycle. Fish were killed by decapitation, and retinas were dissected and placed on solid CO2. Human pineal glands were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA). For experimental treatments, cells were cultured in tissue culture plates, Petri dishes, or flasks as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were seeded the day prior to the experiment and used at ∼80% confluence. Drugs were added to the media (containing serum) for the times indicated in the figures and tables. The drugs used and their sources were: forskolin (FSK, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma), isoproterenol (ISO, Sigma). Drugs were dissolved in water or ethanol; controls were treated with vehicle only. Broken cell homogenates of cultured cells were prepared as follows: Culture medium was removed, and cells were collected by scraping, transferred to microtubes, and pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 4 °C, 1000 × g). The cell pellet was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and frozen on solid CO2. After thawing, the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (2× PBS containing 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT, Fisher, Fairlawn, NJ), 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, 1 tablet/50 ml;Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN)). In cases where samples were to be analyzed for RNA, the homogenization buffer also contained 200 units/ml RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI). Following resuspension, the preparation was frozen (solid CO2) again, thawed, and either centrifuged immediately (5 min, 4 °C, 16,000 × g), or in cases where RNA was to be isolated, after an aliquot of the homogenate was removed and placed directly into 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies; see details below). Homogenates of rat, ovine, and human pineal glands were prepared in 10 volumes of 30 mm Tris, pH 6.7, containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture and 10 mmNaF (Sigma). The resulting preparation was then centrifuged (20 min, 4 °C, 14,000 × g), and the supernatant fraction was assayed for AANAT activity as described below. Cloning and expression of the recombinant hAANAT and ovine AANAT (oAANAT) in bacteria were done essentially as described previously (20Hickman A.B. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), with modifications detailed here. After centrifugation, bacterial cells from 4 liters of culture were suspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (2× PBS with 10 mm DTT) and stored at −80 °C. After thawing, cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C in the presence of CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture, and supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 48,400 × g for 45 min. Twenty milliliters of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), previously equilibrated in the lysis buffer, was added to the supernatant, and the slurry was mixed at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was then poured into a 100-ml column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and washed with 10 column volumes of the lysis buffer followed by 10 column volumes of Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m sodium citrate, 10 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (Life Technologies). The protein was eluted using 50 ml of 10 mm glutathione (Sigma) dissolved in the Tris buffer used for washing. The eluate was concentrated to about 10 ml and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1m sodium citrate, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. The dialyzed preparation was incubated with thrombin (1 unit/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 12 h. The digested sample was mixed with a suspension of glutathione-Sepharose and benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 2 h with gentle mixing. The gel/enzyme mixture was poured into an empty column, the gel was retained, and the flow-through fraction, which contained enzyme activity, was collected and concentrated. In the case of oAANAT, the concentrated sample was further purified by fractionation on a size-exclusion column (TSK 3000, Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with the buffer used for dialysis. The fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated. Both enzyme preparations were stored in 0.05- to 0.5-ml aliquots at −80 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (see below) revealed that the oAANAT preparation was homogenous and the hAANAT preparation was a mixture of free hAANAT and of a contaminating chaperonin (∼90%). The specific activities based on total protein of three independent preparations of bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase-free hAANAT and oAANAT were 0.81 ± 0.2 (n = 3) and 2.7 ± 0.7 (n = 3) mmol/mg of protein/h, respectively, as measured with 10 mmtryptamine and 1 mm AcCoA. An hAANAT cDNA clone, derived from a λgt11 library (21Coon S.L. Mazuruk K. Bernard B. Roseboom P.H. Klein D.C. Rodriguez I.R. Genomics. 1996; 34: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was cut with MscI and PvuII to release the open reading frame (ORF). This fragment was subcloned into theSmaI site of pGEX-4T-3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The ORF was then shuttled into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) by excising and ligating into EcoRI andXhoI sites, so that it would be constitutively expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resulting clone was termed HNATN3. For development of a stable cell line expressing hAANAT, clone HNATN3 was transfected into COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized, collected, and diluted into plates containing selection medium with 600 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). After 10 days, isolated colonies were selected using 3-mm diameter cloning discs (Labcor, Fredrick, MD) saturated with trypsin. After another 10 days, the largest colonies were tested for their capacity to convert exogenous 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT) to melatonin, as described below in detail. Colony NC30 had the highest rate of melatonin production and was used as a source of cells for producing the clonal cell line. This was done by serial dilution into 96-well plates (22Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 161-178Google Scholar). Clonal lines were assessed for growth characteristics, for conversion of exogenous 5-MT to melatonin by intact cells, and for AANAT activity in broken cell homogenates, as detailed below. 1E7 was one of several clonal lines selected this way. Cells for ICC were grown on two-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and were either treated with FSK for 3 h prior to the end of culture or left untreated. They were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (10 min, room temperature) and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Immunocytochemical detection was done using the ABC method and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen (for details, see Ref. 9Schomerus C. Korf H.W. Laedtke E. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The primary antiserum (3236, anti-hAANAT1–26, bleed: 8/24/98) was immunopurified as described below. In addition, the immunopurified antiserum was pre-absorbed for 6 h at room temperature by incubation with COS7 cells (200,000 cells) that were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and washed twice in PBS; the resulting preparation was used for ICC analysis at a dilution of 1:200. Photographs were taken using a Vidas 2.1 (Kontron) on a Zeiss photomicroscope II or a Zeiss LSM 510. Intact cell AANAT activity 2A critical distinction is made in this study between estimating AANAT activity using intact cell preparationversus broken cell preparations. The broken cell method is the standard method used in the literature and is most closely related to measuring activity in tissue homogenates. In contrast, intact cell measurements determine the intracellular AANAT activity, leaving the cellular milieu in its natural state. was estimated from the conversion of 5-MT to melatonin (N-acetyl-5-MT) and from the conversion of [14C]5-HT to [14C]NAS; details follow. Intracellular AANAT activity in intact cells was assayed by determining the capacity of cells to produce melatonin from exogenously supplied 5-MT (0.1 mm, Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA). 5-MT added to the medium is taken up by cells and converted to melatonin by acetylation; melatonin is highly lipophilic and diffuses through the cell membrane out of the cell. Samples of medium were removed at selected times and frozen at −80 °C until assayed. In preliminary experiments we determined that AANAT was not secreted and that 5-MT was not acetylated in the medium (data not presented). This was done by determining whether 5-MT was acetylated by cell-free conditioned medium obtained from 3-h control or FSK-treated cultures; and, from 24-h control cultures. In some experiments FSK was added to the conditioned medium but did not result in detectable acetylation of 5-MT. This is consistent with the absence of acetyl CoA (AcCoA) from the culture medium and requirement of AcCoA for arylalkylamine acetylation. It was also found that AANAT activity was not detectable in conditioned culture media using a broken cell assay containing saturating concentrations of [3H]AcCoA and tryptamine (see below), which indicates that AANAT is not secreted in this system. These findings established that 5-MT is not being acetylated in the culture medium; rather, it appears that it is taken up by cells and converted to melatonin by acetylation and that the resulting melatonin diffuses through the cell membrane into the medium, where it accumulates. Melatonin in the culture medium was assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA (18Rollag M.D. Niswender G.D. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar)). Radiolabeled ligand was prepared by adding 10 μl of a dioxane solution containing 1 μmol of 5-MT and 1 μmol of tri-n-butylamine to 250 μCi of (0.1 nmol) dried [125I]Bolton-Hunter Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h before purifying the product by disc gel electrophoresis. Duplicate aliquots of 2 μl of each sample and a 2-fold serial dilution of standard melatonin (RBI) concentrations (1–500 pg/2 μl) was incubated with ∼50,000 cpm of radiolabeled ligand and a 1:256,000 dilution of antiserum (R1055, bleed: 9/16/74) in 400 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% gelatin. At the end of the 48-h incubation period, a 3-ml volume of ethanol (4 °C, 95%) was added to each assay tube, and the bound radioactivity precipitated by centrifugation (30 min, 2000 ×g). The supernatant was decanted, and the radioactivity in the precipitate was determined. The amount of immunoreactive melatonin in the samples was calculated by computer (23Davis S.E. Munson P.J. Jaffe M.L. Rodbard D. J. Immunoassay. 1980; 1: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All solutions were maintained at 4 °C throughout the RIA procedure. In the course of these experiments it was determined that chloroform extraction of samples increased the background attributable to 5-MT; therefore, the samples were not extracted. In the absence of extraction, the background immunoreactivity due to 5-MT was equivalent to ∼3 pmol/ml; untreated 1E7 cells converted 5-MT to melatonin at a rate of ∼300 pmol/106 cells/h. Cells were incubated with 0.1 mm [14C]5-HT (specific activity (S.A.) = 50 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for up to 24 h (24Klein D.C. Notides A. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 31: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Culture medium was removed, and a 20-μl sample was mixed with 20 μl of a carrier solution of ethanol containing 0.01 nHCl, 0.1% ascorbic acid, and 1 mm concentrations of 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, creatinine sulfate complex, Sigma), NAS (Sigma), hydroxytryptophol (HTOH, Regis Chemical Co., Chicago, IL), and hydroxyindole acetic acid (HIAA, Calbiochem). A 20-μl sample was applied to an aluminum foil-backed silica gel thin layer chromatography sheet (Whatman No. 4420 222, Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom) and dried under N2. The chromatogram was developed twice in the first dimension (chloroform:methanol:glacial acetic acid, 93:7:1, v/v) and once in the second dimension (ethyl acetate). The carriers were located by fluorescent quenching using ultraviolet light (300 nm) and marked; the region of interest was cut out and transferred to a scintillation vial. Compounds were extracted by agitation with 0.5 ml of either ethanol (NAS, HTOH, and HIAA) or water (5-HT). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. The stability of melatonin was studied in two ways. Melatonin stability in the medium was estimated by incubating labeled melatonin with cells. COS7 or 1E7 cells (104 cells) were incubated (4 or 24 h) in a well of a 96-well plate with 50 μl of culture medium containing 100 nm [3H]melatonin (S.A. = 84 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following incubation, 40 μl of the culture medium was combined with 10 μl of ethanol containing 10 mm each of melatonin, 5-MT, methoxytryptophol (MTOH, Regis), and methoxyindole acetic acid (MIAA, Regis). A sample (25 μl) of this ethanol solution was applied to an aluminum foil-backed silica gel TLC sheet (Whatman #4420 222), dried under N2, and separated by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform:methanol:glacial acetic acid (97:3:1) (24Klein D.C. Notides A. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 31: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Klein D.C. Rall J.E. Kopin I.J. The Thyroid and Biogenic Amines. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1972: 550-568Google Scholar). Regions containing melatonin, MTOH, MIAA, and 5-MT were identified by fluorescent quenching by the carriers. Each sample lane was cut transversely into 5-mm sections from the origin to the solvent front (16.5 cm), each section was transferred to a scintillation vial, and compounds were extracted into 0.5 ml of ethanol; scintillation fluid was then added and radioactivity was determined. Similar experiments were performed with 1 μm (S.A. = 10 Ci/mmol) and 10 μm (S.A. = 1.0 Ci/mmol) of [3H]melatonin. The second examination of melatonin metabolism was designed to detect deacetylation of melatonin in lysates. Cell lysates were incubated with [3H]melatonin (26Grace M.S. Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. 1991; 559: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Trout retinas were used as a positive control for deacetylase activity (26Grace M.S. Cahill G.M. Besharse J.C. Brain Res. 1991; 559: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Yanez J. Meissl H. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1996; 101: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Homogenates of 1E7 and COS7 cells and retinas were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) containing 100 μm ascorbate and 0.5% Triton X-100. [3H]Melatonin was added to 100 nmfinal concentration, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of ethanol (final concentration = 20%) containing 10 mm each of melatonin, 5-MT, MTOH, and MIAA. The samples were analyzed by one-dimensional TLC as described above. Unless otherwise indicated, a 10-μl sample of homogenate or extract was incubated (20 min, 37 °C) in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8 (final volume = 40 μl), containing tryptamine-HCl (final concentration = 10 mm, Research Biochemicals International) and [3H]AcCoA (S.A. = 4 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, final concentration = 0.5 mm); the specific activity of [3H]AcCoA was adjusted by addition of unlabeled AcCoA (Calbiochem). The reaction was ended by addition of 1 ml of chloroform.N-[3H]Acetyltryptamine was extracted into chloroform, which was then washed (2×) with 0.2 ml of 0.1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. A 0.5-ml sample of chloroform was taken to dryness, and the radioactivity was determined. To determine the Km for arylalkylamine substrates, enzyme activity was determined using a radiochemical method similar to that used above. Samples of the enzyme preparations in buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) were incubated (100 or 50 μl, 15 min, 30 °C) with a range of concentrations (≥7) of the arylalkylamine substrate and 1 mm [3H]AcCoA (S.A.= 2 mCi/mmol). Appropriate enzyme concentrations were chosen so that less than 10% of the substrate was consumed. Enzyme activity was estimated by determining the amount of 3H-acetylated product formed. TheN-3H-acetylated product was extracted into chloroform in the case of tryptamine-HCl and phenylethylamine-HCl (Sigma); in"

Previous studies implicated protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated signal transduction in modulating TEF function. We demonstrate that in human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells, the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide reciprocally down- and up-regulate, respectively, TEF-mediated GGAATG core enhancer activity. In vitro TEF-1 phosphorylation with several PKC isozymes and phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed that TEF-1 is a potential PKC substrate. TEF-1·DNA complexes formed by BeWo nuclear extracts are supershifted by phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine- but not phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies, indicating that TEF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo at serine and threonine residues. The TEF-1 phosphorylation domain was localized to the third α-helix of the DNA binding domain and adjacent hinge region by phosphopeptide analysis. TEF-1 phosphorylation significantly reduced its DNA binding activity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a possible mechanism for the inhibitory action of PKC. Finally, BeWo cells contained abundant levels of γ and δ PKC isoforms, and their overexpression resulted in even greater inhibition of GGAATG core enhancer activity after 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate treatment. These data strongly suggest that PKC-mediated phosphorylation is a key factor controlling TEF function."
https://openalex.org/W2095559231,"cDNA cloning and functional analysis of proacrosin from the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi were undertaken. The isolated cDNA of the ascidian preproacrosin consists of 2367 nucleotides, and an open reading frame encodes 505 amino acids, which corresponds to the molecular mass of 55,003 Da. The mRNA of proacrosin was found to be specifically expressed in the gonad by Northern blotting and in the spermatocytes or spermatids byin situ hybridization. The amino acid sequences around His76, Asp132, and Ser227, which make up a catalytic triad, showed high homology to those of the trypsin family. Ascidian acrosin has paired basic residues (Lys56-His57) in the N-terminal region, which is one of the most characteristic features of mammalian acrosin. This region seems to play a key role in the binding of (pro)acrosin to the vitelline coat, because the peptide containing the paired basic residues, but not the peptide substituted with Ala, was capable of binding to the vitelline coat. Unlike mammalian proacrosin, ascidian proacrosin contains two CUB domains in the C-terminal region, in which CUB domain 1 seems to be involved in its binding to the vitelline coat. Four components of the vitelline coat that are capable of binding to CUB domain 1 in proacrosin were identified.

These results indicate that ascidian sperm contains a mammalian acrosin homologue, a multi-functional protein working in fertilization. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction In fertilization, sperm must bind to and penetrate through the extracellular glycoprotein matrix surrounding the egg, which is called the zona pellucida in mammals and the vitelline coat in marine invertebrates. After this process, membrane fusion occurs between the sperm and egg. Upon primary binding of the sperm to the vitelline coat, it undergoes an acrosome reaction, which is an exocytosis of the acrosomal vesicle located on the tip of the sperm head. A lytic agent called lysin is exposed on the surface of the sperm head and partially released into the surrounding seawater during the acrosome reaction. In mammals, it has been believed that a trypsin-like enzyme called acrosin (EC 3.4.21.10) is a zona lysin (1Müller-Esterl W. Fritz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Urch U.A. Wardrip N.J. Hedrick J.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1985; 233: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, recent studies using acrosin-gene knockout mice have revealed that acrosin is not essential for mouse fertilization, although a significant delay (about 30 min) in sperm penetration through the zona pellucida was observed (3Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Adham L.M. Nayernia K. Engel W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). From these results it is currently thought that sperm proteases other than acrosin may participate in sperm penetration through the mammalian egg coat and that acrosin may be involved in the dispersal of the acrosomal matrix (5Yamagata K.

Ascidians (Urochordata) occupy a phylogenetic position between vertebrates and “true” invertebrates. Although all ascidians are hermaphrodites, several ascidians including Halocynthia roretzi are strictly self-sterile. The vitelline-coat lysin system is thought to be activated after the sperm recognizes the vitelline coat of the egg as nonself. To elucidate the roles of sperm proteases in fertilization, we have been studying the sperm proteases of the ascidian H. roretzi, one of the largest ascidians cultivated for food in Onagawa Bay, Japan. From this animal we can obtain a large amount of sperm and eggs by controlling the seawater temperature and light conditions. Fertilization experiments with this broadcast spawning animal are much easier than those with mammals. We have reported previously that the sperm trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases are indispensable for sperm penetration through the vitelline coat in H. roretzi by examining the effects of various protease inhibitors on the fertilization of intact as well as naked eggs (6Hoshi M. Numakunai T. Sawada H. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Hoshi M. Ishii S. Gamete Res. 1982; 5: 291-301Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have purified two trypsin-like proteases (which we designated as ascidian acrosin and spermosin) from H. roretzi sperm, and we showed that these two proteases play key roles in ascidian fertilization (8Sawada H.

The enzymatic properties, including the substrate specificity, of ascidian acrosin are very similar to those of mammalian acrosin. However, to determine whether ascidian acrosin is a mammalian acrosin homologue, information on its amino acid sequence is required. In the present study, cDNA cloning and functional analysis of ascidian proacrosin were carried out. It was found that ascidian proacrosin has homology to mammalian proacrosin and contains interesting sequences or domains, which were demonstrated to be necessary for proacrosin to bind to the vitelline coat of the egg. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the existence of sperm acrosin or a mammalian acrosin homologue in invertebrates. Sperm of the solitary ascidian H. roretzi was collected as described previously (6Hoshi M. Numakunai T. Sawada H. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Hoshi M. Ishii S. Gamete Res. 1982; 5: 291-301Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ascidian acrosin was purified according to the procedure described previously (8Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2900-2904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity was determined usingt-butoxycarbonyl-Val-Pro-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide as a substrate (7Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Hoshi M. Ishii S. Gamete Res. 1982; 5: 291-301Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2900-2904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE1 was carried out in a slab gel (12.5%) according to the method of Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207858) Google Scholar). Purified acrosin was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blotted membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 containing 1% acetic acid and 40% methanol. After washing with 50% methanol, the band was cut off from the membrane. The N-terminal sequence of the purified acrosin was determined using a Procise 492 Protein Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was extracted from one gonad of H. roretzi type C by the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform procedure. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from the total RNA with oligotex-dT30 (Roche). cDNAs were synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase using 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (a template), 1 μg of oligo(dT), and 0.1 μg of random hexamers (primers) according to the protocol of the manufacturer of the SuperScript Choice System for cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNAs thus obtained were subjected to cDNA size-fractionation column chromatography followed by ligation to an EcoRI-digested and dephosphorylated λgt11 vector (Stratagene). Then, in vitro packaging of the DNA was carried out using a Gigapack III Gold kit (Stratagene). The sense primer used for PCR was designed from the N-terminal sequence of ascidian acrosin (5′-GG(T/C/A/G)GA(A/G)TT(T/C)CC(T/C/A/G)TGGCA(A/G)GC-3′). This primer encodes the amino acid sequence of GEFPWQ. The antisense primer was designed from the consensus sequence in the vicinity of the serine residue in the catalytic triad of the trypsin family (5′-GGICCICCI(C/G)(A/T)(A/G)TCIC(C/T)CTG(A/G)CA-3′). The antisense primer encodes the amino acid sequence of CQGDSGGP. The primers, each at a concentration of 10 μm, were mixed in PCR to amplify the ascidian gonad cDNA library. PCR was done in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.5) containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mmdeoxynucleotides, and 5 units/ml AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles were run with annealing at 45 °C for 2 min, elongation at 72 °C for 3 min, and denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min. A DNA band migrating at about 600 base pairs was isolated, cloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and transformed into Escherichia coliDH5α. Ascidian acrosin cDNA clones were picked from 2 × 106 clones of ascidian gonad λgt11 cDNA liberally by phage plaque hybridization using the PCR-amplified DNA fragment encoding acrosin as a probe (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Labolatory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [α32P]dCTP (BcaBEST kit, Takara) by the random-priming procedure. Briefly, the plaque lifts were prehybridized at 42 °C in 5× SSC (1× SSC: 15 mm sodium citrate-HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.02% Ficoll 400, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% SDS, 50% formamide, and 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight in a prehybridization buffer containing a32P-labeled probe. The membranes were washed with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min and twice at 60 °C for 15 min before autoradiography at −80 °C. Three independent positive clones were obtained. The nucleotide sequence of the acrosin cDNA clone was determined by a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) using an ABI 377A DNA sequencing apparatus (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted from each tissue according to the standard acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform procedure. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the total RNA by using oligotex-dT30. Two μg each of poly(A)+ RNA of the ascidian gonad, hepatopancreas, intestine, and gill were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, and RNA bands were transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The stringency used for hybridization and washing and the probe was the same as that used in cloning. After washing, the blotted membranes were autoradiographed at −80 °C (Fuji x-ray film). Ascidian acrosin cDNA was amplified with two primers. The sense primer was 5′-GGTGAAATGGCAAAATTGGGC-3′, which corresponds to GEMAKLG in the N-terminal sequence, and the antisense primer was 5′-TAAATCAGCTGCGTCTGCGCT-3′, which corresponds to SADAADL in the C-terminal sequence. A DNA band migrating at 1010 base pairs was isolated, cloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and transformed intoE. coli DH5α. An acrosin clone in the pCRII vector was reacted with EcoRI. An ∼1020-base pair fragment was gel-purified from an agarose gel and ligated into a pBluescript SK(+) plasmid vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH5α. The sense and antisense cRNAs were synthesized by using T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively. During the synthesis of the cRNAs, digoxigenin-labeled uridine triphosphate was incorporated according to the protocol of Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A gonad ofH. roretzi was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in artificial seawater and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 μm in width were prepared. A subsequent enzyme-catalyzed color reaction was conducted by the addition of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium salt, and the mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. A 14-residue oligopeptide, A2 (RVADLDKTDDTDEG), corresponding to residues 96–109 in the ascidian acrosin sequence was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin according to the method described previously (13Liu F.-T. Zinnecker M. Hamaoka T. Katz D.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). An antibody raised against ascidian acrosin peptide A2 was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by affinity chromatography with peptide A2-immobilized agarose beads (Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad). The activation of ascidian sperm was elicited by gentle stirring at 13 °C for 20 min in alkaline artificial seawater (pH 9.0). After stirring, the sperm suspension was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min to obtain the supernatant, which is called the sperm exudate. Sperm suspension in artificial seawater (pH 8.0) was used as a control. The ascidian eggs were homogenized with 5-fold diluted (20%) artificial seawater containing 0.1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate. The homogenate was filtered through nylon mesh (pore size, 150 μm), and the vitelline coat on the blotting cloth was washed extensively with 20% artificial seawater. The purity of the isolated vitelline coats was examined under a light microscope. The vitelline coats were suspended in artificial seawater containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 30 min to obtain the supernatant as the solubilized vitelline coat. Five hundred μg of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate biotinylating agent (Pierce) was added to 1 ml of the solubilized vitelline coats in artificial seawater (∼20% suspension). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the solubilized vitelline coat was dialyzed against artificial seawater to remove nonreacted sulfosuccinimidyl-6(biotinamido)-hexanoate biotinylating agent. The following two 12-residue oligopeptides corresponding to residues 51–62 in the ascidian proacrosin were synthesized and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography: A1, AAFLYKHVQVCG (residues 51–62) and A1 (KH/AA), AAFLYAAVQVCG. One hundred μl of 1 mm oligopeptide was added to each well of a 96-well plate, and the plate was allowed to stand overnight to adsorb the peptide. After adsorption, each well was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and then treated with the biotinylated solubilized vitelline coat. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the plate was washed four times with artificial seawater and incubated with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Vectastain) in artificial seawater for 30 min according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plate was washed four times with artificial seawater followed by treatment with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.02% H2O2 to develop the color. Finally, the developed color was measured at 490 nm using a Bio-Rad Model 450 microplate reader. Two 15-residue oligopeptides at residues 348–362 in the CUB domain 1 and 443–456 in the CUB domain 2, respectively, of ascidian proacrosin were synthesized: CUB1 (TEFGVEYHTFCWYDD) and CUB2 (CGEFSSKHYPNYYDA). The eggs were incubated previously with each oligopeptide, CUB1 or CUB2, in seawater for 30 min at 13 °C and were then inseminated. The fertilization ratio was determined as described previously (6Hoshi M. Numakunai T. Sawada H. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Hoshi M. Ishii S. Gamete Res. 1982; 5: 291-301Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CUB1 or CUB2 peptide-immobilized agarose was prepared using Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The biotinylated solubilized vitelline coat was incubated with CUB1 or CUB2 peptide-immobilized agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with artificial seawater, the components of the vitelline coat were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequences as described previously. The N-terminal 44-amino acid sequence of the purified acrosin was determined using a protein sequencer (Fig.1). The N-terminal sequence of acrosin was used to design the degenerate oligonucleotide sense primers for PCR of the H. roretzi gonad cDNA library. The antisense primer was designed from the consensus sequence around the active site serine residue of the trypsin family. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PCR product contained the N-terminal peptide sequence of acrosin determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The PCR product was used as a probe for screening the ascidian gonad λgt11 cDNA library to isolate a cDNA clone encoding ascidian acrosin (Fig. 1). The cDNA clone consisted of 2367 nucleotides. A single open reading frame encoded 505 amino acids. The deduced protein sequence contained a sequence from residues 36 to 79, which corresponds to the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined from the isolated acrosin protein. The molecular mass of preproacrosin was estimated to be 55,003 Da. The sequence of the N-terminal 19 residues of preproacrosin contained a highly hydrophobic region, probably corresponding to a signal peptide for a nascent protein destined for initial transfer to the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, the N terminus of proacrosin may start at Asp-20. His, Asp, and Ser, which form a catalytic triad in serine proteases, are located at residues 76, 132, and 227, respectively, in ascidian proacrosin. As compared with mammalian proacrosin, ascidian proacrosin has three consensus sequences for N-linked carbohydrate chain modification in the C-terminal region but not in the region commonly observed in mammalian proacrosin (e.g. mouse acrosin, Cys-Asn211-Ser-Thr; ascidian acrosin, Cys-Leu200-Ala-Thr). Ascidian acrosin also has paired basic residues in the N-terminal region, which are thought to be critical for the binding of acrosin to the zona pellucida (14Richardson R.T. O'land M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24069-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, ascidian proacrosin, but not mammalian proacrosin, has two CUB domains in the C-terminal region. It is known that CUB domains are involved in sperm binding to the zona pellucida in the mammalian spermadhesin molecule (15Calvete J.J. Sanz L. Dostalova Z. Töpfer-Petersen E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Clavete J.J. Mann K. Schafer W. Raida M. Sanz L. Töpfer-Petersen E.

Northern blot analysis was carried out using the same probe as that used for the screening of cDNA. As shown in Fig.2, a single transcript of ∼4.7 kilobases was detected only in the gonads of H. roretzi. The expression of proacrosin mRNA was also investigated by in situ hybridization. A specific signal was observed in spermatids/spermatocytes (spermatids and spermatocytes are indistinguishable in ascidians by light microscopy) but not in mature sperm with the antisense riboprobe. A specific signal was not observed with the sense riboprobe. These results indicate that ascidian proacrosin mRNA is definitely expressed in both or either of spermatids and spermatocytes (data not shown). Western blot analysis of the sperm extract demonstrated the presence of 35-, 40-, and 50-kDa proteins that immunoreacted with the anti-acrosin antibody under nonreducing conditions (Fig.3). Because proacrosin has a molecular mass of 53,052 Da, the 50-kDa protein seems to be proacrosin. It is inferred that proacrosin with a molecular mass of 53 kDa is processed into the 35-kDa acrosin through the 40-kDa protein as an intermediate. Ascidian sperm undergoes sperm reaction, accompanied by vigorous sperm movement and mitochondrial shedding, upon sperm binding to the vitelline coat during fertilization (19Lambert C.C. Epel D. Dev. Biol. 1979; 69: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This sperm reaction is mimicked by increasing the extracellular pH to 9.0. When sperm ofH. roretzi were treated with alkaline artificial seawater (pH 9.0), a similar morphological change was induced. As shown in Fig.4, ascidian acrosin was found to be released from sperm treated with the artificial seawater (pH 9.0). This result suggests that ascidian acrosin is released from sperm during fertilization. In contrast, proacrosin was not detected in the sperm exudate, suggesting that only the active form of acrosin is released from the reacted sperm. Ascidian proacrosin contains two interesting sequences: one is the paired basic residues-containing sequence, and the other is the CUB domain. First, the role of the former sequence was investigated. Peptide A1 containing the paired basic residues of ascidian acrosin and the peptide A1(KH/AA), the paired basic residues of which had been substituted with Ala-Ala, were synthesized and tested for their abilities to bind to the isolated vitelline coats. The binding ability of peptide A1 containing the paired basic residues (Lys-His) to the vitelline coat was found to be 2.5-fold higher than that of peptide A1(KH/AA). Next, the role of the CUB domain was investigated. Ascidian proacrosin contains two CUB domains in the C-terminal region, one being complete and the other being incomplete (Fig. 1). Two peptides called CUB1 and CUB2, which are derived from CUB domains 1 and 2, respectively, were synthesized, and their ability to inhibit fertilization of H. roretzi was tested. As shown in Fig.5 A, the CUB1 peptide inhibited the fertilization more strongly than did the CUB2 peptide. The fact that fertilization is strongly inhibited by the CUB1 peptide suggests that the CUB domain 1 can interact with the vitelline coat. To identify the CUB domain 1-binding components of the vitelline coat, a pull-down assay using CUB1 peptide-immobilized agarose beads was carried out. Five components (90-, 85-, 30-, 28-, and 25-kDa proteins) of the vitelline coat were found to be capable of binding to CUB1 peptide-immobilized agarose beads but not to CUB2 peptide-immobilized agarose beads (Fig. 5 B). The N-terminal sequences of the 90-, 85-, 30-, and 25-kDa proteins were determined (Fig.5 C). However, we could not find homologous or similar proteins to the above proteins, which are involved in cell-cell interaction as determined by FASTA and BLAST search analyses. Here we cloned a cDNA of mammalian acrosin homologue from the solitary ascidian H. roretzi(Urochordata), and also we studied a functional analysis of the ascidian acrosin. This is a first report showing the occurrence of acrosin homologue in nonmammalian species. Ascidian acrosin seems to be synthesized as a preproprotein with 505 amino acid residues and with a signal sequence consisting of 19 putative residues in the N-terminal region. By motif search analysis, it was found that ascidian proacrosin has three consensus sequences of N-linked sugar attachment, paired basic residues in the N-terminal region that are thought to be critical for the binding of acrosin to the zona pellucida (14Richardson R.T. O'land M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24069-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a protease domain in the middle region, and two CUB domains in the C-terminal region. The amino acid sequences around the active site residues in ascidian acrosin, His76, Asp132, and Ser227, showed high homology to those of the trypsin family including mammalian acrosin (Fig.6). Identity in the total amino acid sequence between mammalian proacrosins and ascidian proacrosin is 33–35%. A dendrogram analysis revealed that H. roretziacrosin is most similar to mammalian acrosin family members (see Fig.7). The result that the branching point of ascidian acrosin in the acrosin clade is far from the cluster of mammalian acrosin may reflect the phylogenetic relationship between these two classes (Ascidiacea and Mammalia). In addition to the homology in the amino acid sequences, the ascidian proacrosin is thought to be a homologue of mammalian proacrosin for the following three reasons. First, ascidian proacrosin was expressed in the gonad but not in the other tissues tested. Second, this protease contains vitelline coat-interactable paired basic residues in the N-terminal region, the position of which coincides well with that of mammalian acrosin. Third, the existence of the C-terminal extension (two CUB domains in the case of ascidian proacrosin) of zymogen is a characteristic feature observed in mammalian proacrosin among members of the trypsin family.Figure 7Dendrogram depicting the relationship between ascidian acrosin and the mammalian trypsin family.

By analogy to the mammalian acrosin, it is thought that the processed ascidian acrosin probably consists of a short (16 residues) light chain and a heavy chain, both of which are disulfide linked. Taking into account the conserved positions of the cysteine residues in mammalian acrosins, it can be inferred that Cys21 in the light chain is disulfide-bonded to Cys152 in the heavy chain in ascidian acrosin. The results of the amino acid composition analysis (data not shown) of the purified ascidian acrosin suggested that the C-terminal amino acid is situated in the vicinity of residue 290. If ascidian proacrosin is cleaved autocatalytically, as are mammalian proacrosins, the C-terminal amino acid residue of activated acrosin would be Arg286, because the Arg residues are located at 286, 269, and 254 in the presumed C-terminal region of active acrosin. If it is the case, the C-terminal CUB domains would be completely removed by autocatalytic activation. In mammalian proacrosin, the participation of the N-terminal region in the binding to the zona pellucida was confirmed by using synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins, and recent studies on site-directed mutagenesis have revealed that the paired basic residues in the N-terminal region of acrosin are crucial for maintenance of the binding of proacrosin to the zona pellucida (14Richardson R.T. O'land M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24069-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was found that ascidian acrosin also has paired basic residues, Lys56-His57, in the N-terminal region that are involved in the binding to the vitelline coat; the binding ability of the peptide containing paired basic residues (Lys-His) to the vitelline coat was found to be higher than that of the peptide containing Ala-Ala. The present findings agree with the above-mentioned finding on the role of paired basic residues in mammalian proacrosin. (14Richardson R.T. O'land M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24069-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several mammalian proacrosins, including human and porcine proacrosins but neither mouse nor rat proacrosin, contain a Pro-rich region in the C terminus that is cleaved off during proacrosin activation (20Baba T. Kashiwabara S. Watanabe K. Itoh H. Michikawa Y. Kimura K. Takada M. Fukamizu A. Arai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11920-11927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because proacrosin and α-acrosin, unlike the fully activated form β-acrosin, are able to strongly bind to the zona pellucida (21Urch U.A. Patel H. Development. 1991; 111: 1165-1172PubMed Google Scholar), it is thought that the C-terminal region may also be involved in the binding to the zona pellucida (21Urch U.A. Patel H. Development. 1991; 111: 1165-1172PubMed Google Scholar). Ascidian proacrosin, but not mammalian proacrosins, has two CUB domains in the C-terminal region. The CUB domain is defined as a 100–110 residue-spanning extracellular module, the name of which is derived from the following three proteins: complement subcomponents (C1r/C1s) (22Leytus S.P. Kurachi K. Sakariassen K.S. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4855-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Tosi M. Duponchel C. Meo T. Julier C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8516-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), an embryonic sea urchin protein (Uegf) (24Delgadillo-Reynoso M.G. Rollo D.R. Hursh D.A. Raff R.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 314-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and bone morphogenetic protein I (BMP-I) (25Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 26Romero A. Romao M.J. Varela P.F. Kolln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A. Sanz L. Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The most characteristic features of the CUB domain are the existence of three or four conserved Cys residues that form two disulfide bonds and the existence of various hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid residues that participate in the formation of the antiparallel β-barrel topography of the molecule. CUB domains in mammalian spermadhesin are known to be involved in sperm binding to the zona pellucida (15Calvete J.J. Sanz L. Dostalova Z. Töpfer-Petersen E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Clavete J.J. Mann K. Schafer W. Raida M. Sanz L. Töpfer-Petersen E.

Our present results showing that the C-terminal CUB domain 1 of ascidian proacrosin is involved in the binding to the vitelline coat coincide well with the above-mentioned fact regarding the CUB domain in mammalian spermadhesin. Although ascidian proacrosin does not possess a Pro-rich region in the C-terminal region, the CUB domains seem to work in the binding of proacrosin to the vitelline coat as a functional homologue of the Pro-rich region in mammalian proacrosin. Of two peptides derived from CUB domains 1 and 2, the peptide of CUB domain 1 strongly inhibited fertilization. Five components (90-, 85-, 30-, 28-, and 25-kDa proteins) in the vitelline coat were found to be able to bind to CUB1 peptide-immobilized agarose beads. It is likely that the CUB1 peptide binds to the vitelline coat, resulting in the inhibition of fertilization. Although we failed to identify the homologous proteins to the above-mentioned five components, it is intriguing to note that the 30-kDa component contains an HAV motif, which is a key element in homophilic cadherin interactions (27Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This motif may play an important role in the interaction between the 30-kDa component of the vitelline coat and the CUB domain 1 of ascidian proacrosin. In connection with this, it is also interesting that the CUB domain 2 also contains a His421-Ala422-Val423 sequence. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that CUB domain 2 is also involved in the binding to the vitelline coat. Concerning the reason why mammalian sperm exposes acrosin and proacrosin after the acrosome reaction, an interesting hypothesis called “binding-releasing mechanism” in mammals has been proposed (28O'land R. Welch J.E. Fisher S.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 205: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After the acrosome reaction, exposed proacrosin in sperm binds to the zona pellucida. Once this binding is established, autodigestion of proacrosin takes place, leaving the sperm free to bind again. This sequential mechanism would facilitate sperm penetration through the zona pellucida. In H. roretzi, we could not detect a substantial amount of proacrosin species in the sperm exudate by Western blotting, implying that acrosin released from sperm upon sperm activation may bind to the vitelline coat through the N-terminal paired basic residues and digest the vitelline coat. Alternatively, if the above mechanism in mammals works in ascidians, it can be inferred that the residual membrane-associated proacrosin may bind to the vitelline coat via the C-terminal CUB domain followed by autodigestion, which enables sperm to freely bind to the vitelline coat again. Further detailed study is necessary to clarify this point.

Recruitment of p300 by cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-Rel cross-talk at the composite CD28 response element (CD28RE)-TRE element of the IL-2 promoter is essential for promoter inducibility during T-cell activation, and CD28RE-TRE is the exclusive target of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I oncoprotein Tax. The intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 is dispensable for activation of the IL-2 promoter, and the N-terminal 743 residues contain the minimal structural requirements for synergistic transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE, the IL-2 promoter, and endogenous IL-2 gene expression. Mutational analysis of p300 reveals differential structural requirements for the N-terminal p300 module by individual cis-elements within the IL-2 promoter.

The role of nuclear transcription factors and coactivators as primary targets of molecular signaling in eukaryotic cells has emerged as a fundamental concept in signal transduction biology (1Goldman P.S.

Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Detailed functional characterization of the molecular correlates that underlie the control of these events has been essential to our understanding of their importance in cellular homeostasis and has provided key insights into the manner in which they become deranged during oncogenic transformation. The study of molecular signaling events involved in the control of cytokine gene expression in activated T-cells has led to several important paradigms with relevant application to the understanding of signal transduction and gene regulation in various cell types (4Avots A. Escher C. Muller-Deubert S. Neumann M. Serfling E. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5Hentsch B. Mouzaki A. Pfeuffer I. Rungger D. Serfling E.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The interleukin-2 (IL-2)1gene is a key molecular signaling target in activated T-cells and plays a pivotal role in the control of the immune response. As such it has become a model system through which the fundamental mechanisms of stimulus-evoked responses can be studied. Although we are far from a precise understanding of the “fine tuned” regulation of IL-2, there is general agreement that many of the molecular signaling events, set in motion during T-cell activation, converge on a 300-bse pair region just upstream of the transcription start site (4Avots A. Escher C. Muller-Deubert S. Neumann M. Serfling E. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys.

This region is often referred to as the interleukin-2 proximal promoter. A common theme that has emerged from the study of the IL-2 promoter and other Ras-controlled genes is that they are modulated by the activity of one or more composite gene regulatory elements. These composite sites are targeted cooperatively by the interaction of two or more separate transcription factors, in a linked fashion, to provide both increased specificity and stability. Recently it has been shown that the CD28 response element (CD28RE), one of the major Rel-κB-controlled sites in the IL-2 promoter, functions as a composite site in conjunction with a 3′-sequence that interacts with members of the basic leucine zipper (B-Zip) family of transcription factors (10Butscher W.G.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This composite site, termed the CD28RE-TRE (CD28RE-AP1), is located at position −174 to −146 within the proximal IL-2 promoter and provides a sequence-specific regulatory interface where Rel and CREB-targeted molecular signaling events converge in synergy with p300 (10Butscher W.G.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and the demyelinating syndrome, tropical spastic paraparesis (13Poiesz B.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gazdar A.F.

U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2534-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The genome of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I encodes a 40-kDa transactivator protein, Tax, which drives oncogenic transformation of human T-lymphocytes and can act, in conjunction with Ras, to promote the transformation of rodent fibroblasts (15Bex F. Gaynor R.B. Methods. 1998; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In infected cells, Tax can act to increase the activation of target cellular genes containing nuclear factor (NF)-κB and CREB/ATF sites by up-regulating the activity of both CREB/ATF and Rel/NF-κB transcription factors (16Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 17Munoz E. Israel A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor-α are well known targets of Tax activation in T-cells (15Bex F. Gaynor R.B. Methods. 1998; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Siekevitz M.

Although the ability of Tax to up-regulate Rel/κB function is thought to be the sole underlying mechanism for its action at the IL-2 promoter, many details of its true mode of regulation at the CD28RE-TRE remain debated (20Himes S.R. Katsikeros R. Shannon M.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4001-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a result, a precise accounting of the role of Tax at the IL-2 promoter continues to be elusive. In this report we analyze the mechanism through which cross-talk between the Rel/κB and ATF/CREB signaling pathways together with p300 control the transactivation of the IL-2 promoter at its central composite enhancers when challenged by both mitogens and the T-cell oncogene tax. We present a model predicting that a key target for the signal transduction pathways generated during T-cell activation is the assembly of a CD28RE-TRE directed “enhanceosome-like” complex at the IL-2 proximal promoter. This assembly is centrally linked to distinct domains of p300 through multiple, yet specific, combinatorial interactions with factors coordinately bound to its composite gene regulatory elements. CD28RE-TRE-CAT, IL-2 CAT, NF-AT-CAT, HIVκB-CAT, AP1-CAT, and Δ56-CAT parental control reporter plasmids have been described (10Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol.

The NFIL-2A-CAT reporter was constructed by inserting two copies of the sequence AGCTTCACGATGTTTTACATATTACACATATTTTCAAAGA into the HindIII site upstream of the minimalfos promoter of Δ56-CAT. The CRE-CAT was a generous gift from Dr. Maria Laura Avantaggiati. The UAS-CAT reporter plasmids contains five tandem copies of the UAS Gal4 recognition site linked to an E1B minimal promoter and was a generous gift from Dr. Irene Collins (NCI). The Tax expression vector has been described previously (23Semmes O.J. Barret J.F. Dang C.V. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

The dominant interfering expression vector of Ras (N17Ras) was a generous gift from Dr. Silvio Gutkind (NIDCR). The CREB dominant negative vector is highly selective for CREB/ATF transactivation in T-cells and represses CREB-dependent transactivation without affecting AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation (10Butscher W.G.

Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The κB-specific superdominant vector is a non-hydrolyzable I-κB expression vector that selectively inhibits κB-dependent transactivation without inhibiting transactivation from other cis-elements including the NF-AT site and has been described (27Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11745-11748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of lysates from cells transfected with cytomegalovirus-p300 expression vectors shows that coexpression with either Ras, CREB, or κB dominant inhibitors does not alter the level of protein produced from the exogenous genes (not shown). The mutant Tax expression vectors pcTax M47, pcTax M22, and the pcTax wt control were a gift from Warner C. Greene (J. David Gladstone Institutes) and have been described extensively (16Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A simple screen for functional domains within the N-terminal 743 amino acids of p300 in the Gal4-p300 fusion constructs was designed by mutating 4 of 10 N-terminal sequences that were predicted to assume an α- helical structure by the method of Chou and Fasman. The targeted regions were arbitrarily referred to as: helix I, residues 21–32; helix II, residues 72–85; helix VIII, residues 600–616; and helix IX, residues 633–663 (see Fig. 5 B). The α-helical structure was disrupted in either single or double mutants by the substitution of three proline residues for three consecutive residues in the center of each of the putative α-helical segments described above. The mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA).

The substitution of alanine for Tyr-638 within the p300 KIX domain (Y638A mutant) was also accomplished by site directed mutagenesis, as described above, using the primers (TCTAGTTCTTTCTGGATCTT GGCGATTTTCTCAGCTAGAAGGT) and (ACCTTCTAGCTGAGAAAATCGCCAAGATCCAGAAAGAACTAGA). The IL-2 mutant TRE CAT reporter plasmid contains the IL-2 flanking region from −575 to +47 with a 3-base substitution at the TRE portions of the CD28RE-TRE composite site (see Fig. 3 A). This reporter mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the IL-2-CAT plasmid using the primers GTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGCAACATCAGAAGAGGAAAAATG and CATTTTTCCTCTTCTGATGTTGCTTTGGAATTTCTTTAAAC and was provided by Dr. V.

Jurkat T-cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells (1–2 × 107) were resuspended in 250 µl of ice-cold phosphate buffer with 2.5–8 µg of reporter plasmid and 1–8 µg of the indicated expression vectors followed by electroporation (200 V, 1180 microfarads). The cells were then resuspended in 5 ml of complete RPMI at 37 °C. After transfection and resuspension, the cells were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with the indicated combinations of 1 µm ionomycin (Calbiochem), 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma Chemical Co.), 2 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Murex), a 1:1,000 dilution of monoclonal antibody 9.3 ascites (anti-CD28) (Bristol-Myers Squibb Research Institute, Seattle), and a 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal antibody OKT3 ascites (ATCC). The construction of Jurkat cells showing stable expression of the Gal4-p300 (amino acids 1–743) was established by selection of cells transfected with a pcDNA3 vector carrying the Gal4-p300 cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene. Cells were selected by growth in medium containing 1.6 mg/ml G418. Resistant pools of cells were screened for the G4-p300 expression by transient transfection with UAS-CAT and subsequent CAT assay. Positive pools of cells were cloned by limiting dilution in G418 and screened a second time by UAS-CAT reporter assay. All transient transfections studies were performed in duplicate or triplicate and, in all cases, are representative of at least two independent experiments. CAT activity in cell extracts was determined as described (10Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol.

The reaction mix was then placed on ice and incubated with 2 µl of [35S]methionine-labeled Gal4-p300 truncation mutants for an additional 15 min. 20 µl of a 1:1 slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the reaction and incubated for a final 15 min with shaking at 4 °C. The samples were then loaded onto 200-µl 10% sucrose cushions containing 1 × binding buffer and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min The sucrose cushion and supernatant were removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 2.5 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel buffer and separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bound protein was visualized by autoradiography, and the percent of total bound labeled protein was determined on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Western blots were performed as described previously using anti-Gal4-DNA binding domain (CLONTECH and Santa Cruz) (10Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from resting or stimulated Ficoll-purified Jurkat T-cells following electroporation as described previously (30Powers C. Krutzsch H. Gardner K. J. Biol.

IL-2 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent analysis using the Quantikine immunoassay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As reported previously (10Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), overexpression of p300 leads to synergistic increases in the transactivation of the IL-2 CD28RE-TRE gene regulatory element (Fig.1 A) in response to the well characterized T-cell mitogens phorbol ester and ionomycin (31Manger B. Weiss A. Imboden J. Laing T. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2755-2760PubMed Google Scholar, 32Weiss A. Imboden J.B. Adv. Immunol. 1987; 41: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The dependence of this synergy on intact Ras-responsive CREB and κB molecular signaling pathways is demonstrated by the disruption of the p300-controlled CD28RE-TRE transactivation by the activity of three previously described pathway-specific inhibitors: a dominant negative CREB/ATF (CREB leucine zipper with acidic extension) expression vector, a superdominant I-κB (hydrolysis-resistant I-κB-α mutant, Rel/κB inhibitor) expression vector, and a dominant negative vector for Ras (Asn-17 substitution; see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1, B–D, blockade of Ras, Rel/κB, or CREB/ATF effector signaling abrogates mitogen-induced transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE, in both the presence and absence of exogenous p300. The Tax oncoprotein has pleiotropic effects on a variety of immediate early and cytokine genes in activated T-cells. Several earlier studies have shown that the IL-2 promoter is a major target of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I Tax oncoprotein (18Siekevitz M. Feinberg M.B. Holbrook N. Wong-Staal F. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5389-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 20Himes S.R. Katsikeros R. Shannon M.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4001-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been generally reported that the κB pathway is the exclusive target of Tax action at the IL-2 reporter through its ability to increase the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the I-κB inhibitor, other laboratories have suggested roles for factors distinct from NF-κB (20Himes S.R. Katsikeros R. Shannon M.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4001-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our observation that the TRE half of the IL-2 CD28RE-TRE element associates with ATF/CREB B-Zip factors (10Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggests that CREB signaling at this site may be a major mechanism through which Tax acts at the IL-2 promoter. To test this possibility, the action of Tax at an IL-2-CAT reporter construct, in which the TRE portion of the CD28RE-TRE composite element within the promoter was altered by site- directed mutagenesis (IL2-mutTRE), was compared with that of the wild type promoter sequence (wt IL2). As demonstrated in Fig.2 A, induction of the IL-2 promoter by tax in either stimulated or costimulated cells is completely dependent on the integrity of the IL-2 CD28RE-TRE 3′-site. Reporter studies utilizing a single copy of the CD28RE-TRE show that Tax directly up-regulates the CD28RE-TRE, and this response is increased dramatically in the presence of exogenous p300 (Fig.2 B). Tax-dependent transactivation is repressed effectively by dominant negative Ras, the superdominant I-κB, and the dominant negative CREB expression vectors (Fig. 2 B), thus demonstrating that Tax targeting of the CD28RE-TRE and its synergy with p300 are dependent on both an intact κB and CREB/ATF signaling pathway. This point is demonstrated further by using mutants of Tax which are deficient in transactivating either CREB/ATF or Rel/κB-dependent genes (Fig. 2 C). The Tax mutant M47 can activate Rel/κB pathways but not the CREB/ATF pathways. Similarly, the M22 Tax mutant is capable of activating the CREB/ATF pathways but not the Rel/κB pathways (16Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 C, coexpression of either pathway-defective Tax mutant produces negligible activation of CD28RE-TRE in the presence of p300. This evidence, in combination with the dramatic effects of both the CREB and Rel/κB-specific dominant negative vectors on Tax induction of CD28RE-TRE, shows that the primary mechanism of action of Tax at this element involves a dual targeting of CREB-Rel cross-talk in activated T-cells. A comparison of the effect of Tax on the composite elements of the IL-2 promoters demonstrates that the CD28RE-TRE composite element of the IL-2 promoter is exclusively targeted by the Tax oncogene in activated T-cells. In ionomycin- and phorbol ester-stimulated cells, Tax coexpression significantly increases the transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, transactivation of the NF-AT site is actually repressed in the presence of Tax (Fig. 3 B). NFIL-2A shows negligible influence by Tax (Fig. 3 C), and like the NF-AT element, a consensus AP-1 site is repressed by Tax (Fig. 3 D). Prior studies have shown that the mechanism of action of Tax at cellular CRE sites is via the enhanced recruitment of p300/CBP to the KID domain of CREB bound to the CRE element (49Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 E is presented as a positive control to demonstrate that CREB molecular signaling is targeted effectively by Tax in mitogen-activated T-cells. In this experiment, low levels of the transfected Gal4-CREB fusion are synergistically transactivated when coexpressed with Tax. Notably, the level of expression is maximal with phorbol ester and ionomycin alone, as it shows little increase by CD28 costimulation. The transcriptional activity of p300 at individual promoters occurs in the absence of any intrinsic DNA binding activity. The main mechanism of p300 action occurs through its recruitment to individual cis-elements and promoters through protein-protein interactions with specific transcription factors and components of the basal transcriptional apparatus (34Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The CREB/ATF binding domain has been localized previously to the KIX domain of p300/CBP, which encompasses amino acids 566–647 in p300 (35Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 36Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Two separate Rel/κB binding domains have been identified recently: one in the N-terminal 594 amino acids of p300, and a portion spanning residues 1572–2414 of the C terminus (37Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 38Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). To test which portions of p300 are necessary for effective recruitment to the CD28RE-TRE, we determined the in vitro domain requirements of p300 to be effectively recruited to the CD28RE-TRE. In this assay, biotinylated duplex oligonucleotides encoding a single copy of the CD28RE-TRE were incubated with in vitro translated Gal4 fusion constructs containing different portions of p300 (see upper panel Fig.4 A). Incubations were carried out in the presence or absence of affinity-purified CREB-Rel complexes obtained from phorbol ester- and ionomycin-activated Jurkat T-cells (10Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DNA-bound versus free complexes were then separated by centrifugation with avidin-coated beads. In Fig. 4 B, the portion of p300 containing the N-terminal 743 amino acids (and thus both Rel and CREB/ATF-1 binding domains) was effectively recruited to the CD28RE-TRE with increasing concentrations of purified CREB-Rel but did not associate with CD28RE-TRE in their absence. A screen of the CREB-Rel-dependent recruitment of different p300 truncation mutants (described in Fig. 4 A) to the CD28RE-TRE shows that the p300 mutant encompassing residues 1–743 is the most efficiently recruited (see Fig. 4 C, bottom panel). Thus the portion of p300 which contains both the CREB/ATF-1 binding KIX domain and the N-terminal Rel binding domain is the most efficiently targeted to the CD28RE-TRE by purified CREB-Rel complexes. In addition, this portion of p300 (residues 1–743) is the most effective at inducing transcriptional activation of the CD28RE-TRE-CAT reporter when stimulated by phorbol ester and ionomycin (see Fig. 4 D). The small amount of recruitment and transactivation potential demonstrated by the C-terminal 1945–2414 residues of p300 (see Fig. 4, C and D) is consistent with a single Rel-interacting domain identified previously in that region (38Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 743 amino acids of p300 is also sufficient to superinduce transactivation of the entire proximal IL-2 promoter (Fig. 4 E). Moreover, cells that stably express the N-terminal p300 residues exhibit increased expression of endogenous IL-2 (Fig. 4 F). To determine the domain dependence of p300 for its ability to interact with the transcriptional activators and other cofactors that regulate the IL-2 promoter, a series of domain specific mutants was generated within the N-terminal 743 residues of p300 (see “Materials and Methods”). One class of mutations was a 1-amino acid substitution of alanine for tyrosine at position 638 within the KIX domain of p300 (Y638A p300). This mutation has been characterized previously to be critical for the interaction of CREB/ATF with the KIX domain (35Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, the N-terminal 743 amino acid residues of p300 are competent to activate the NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites of the IL-2 promoter, in addition t"

In vertebrate photoreceptors, where light-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been extensively characterized, light-induced rhodopsin activation of transducin is terminated by phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues at the rhodopsin C terminus and the subsequent binding of arrestin to phosphorhodopsin (1Wilden U.

Collectively, these proteins are referred to as PPEFs (for proteinphosphatases with EF-hands) in recognition of the most distinctive features of their primary sequence: a serine/threonine protein phosphatase domain and two or more C-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. Members of this family identified to date include the single Drosophila PPEF (RdgC), two mammalian PPEFs (PPEF-1 and PPEF-2), a puffer-fish PPEF, and a single Caenorhabditis elegans PPEF (CePPEF).1 As rdgCmutants show elevated levels of phosphorylated rhodopsin (10Vinos J.

However, direct evidence that calcium binds to the EF-hand motifs has not been reported for any PPEF family member. Mammalian and Drosophila PPEFs are expressed principally or exclusively within the nervous system and are highly enriched in a subset of primary sensory neurons. Drosophila RdgC has been immunolocalized to photoreceptors and the mushroom bodies within the brain (9Steele F.R. Washburn T. Rieger R. O'Tousa J.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 669-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); PPEF-1 transcripts have been localized by in situhybridization to the inner ear, the dorsal root ganglia, and several brainstem nuclei in the developing mouse (13Montini E. Rugarli E.I. Van de Vosse E. Andolfi G. Mariani M. Puca A.A. Consalez G.G. den Dunnen J.T. Ballabio A. Franco B. Hum. Mol.

These observations suggest that the PPEFs may play a conserved role in diverse sensory systems. Aside from Drosophila rhodopsin, the identities of PPEF substrates have remained elusive. By analogy, it would be plausible to suppose that mammalian PPEF-2 specifically dephosphorylates phosphorhodopsin, but current evidence argues against this idea. In particular, protein phosphatase 2A activity has been detected in rod outer segment extracts and can efficiently dephosphorylate phosphorhodopsin (5Hurley J.B. Spencer M. Niemi G.A.

Moreover, immunolocalization of one isoform of PPEF-2 that contains the EF-hand motifs localizes this protein to photoreceptor inner segments rather than outer segments (12Sherman P.M. Sun H.

(The subcellular localization of a second PPEF-2 isoform that lacks the C-terminal domain is unknown.) These observations suggest that, in mammals, protein phosphatase 2A is the rhodopsin phosphatase and therefore that some aspects of PPEF function may not be conserved between vertebrate and invertebrate photoreceptors.

Expression analysis has shown that these are widely distributed inside and outside the nervous system, with many receptors localizing to primary sensory neurons, including the three neurons responsible for responding to volatile odorants: AWA, AWB, and AWC (22Troemel E.R.

In this report, we show that expression of CePPEF, the sole member of the PPEF family inC. elegans, is restricted to several neurons in the head and tail, including the primary sensory neurons AWB and AWC. Within these sensory neurons, CePPEF is highly enriched in sensory cilia, and this localization depends on sequences at the extreme N terminus, which site-directed mutagenesis shows are the sites of both myristoylation and palmitoylation. Finally, we show that the two consensus EF-hand motifs within the C terminus of CePPEF bind calcium. These observations reveal a mechanism for membrane association of the PPEFs; strengthen the idea that PPEF activity is directly regulated by calcium binding; and suggest that some substrates of CePPEF are found in the sensory cilia, possibly including G protein-coupled receptors in the cilia of AWB and AWC. λ phage clones encompassing the F23H11.8 (CePPEF) locus were isolated from a C. elegans genomic DNA library and used to prepare transgene constructs. The full-length green fluorescent protein (FL-GFP) transgene was generated by cloning the genomic region from theEcoRI site 3.0 kb 5′ of the initiator ATG codon to theStuI site 32 base pairs 5′ of the stop codon near the end of exon 7 into pPD95.81. pPD96.04 and pPD95.67 were used to generate the aa-(1)-NLS-GFP-LacZ and aa-(1–14)-NLS-GFP constructs, respectively, each of which also carries the same 3.0 kb of 5′-sequence extending to the EcoRI site. The G2A and C3S mutants of FL-GFP were generated by polymerase chain reaction, followed by cassette replacement of a BclI-AvrII fragment and sequencing. The full-length CePPEF cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using random-primed cDNA from N2 hermaphrodites. Following subcloning, the cDNA sequence was confirmed to rule out spurious mutations. The CePPEF cDNA was modified by polymerase chain reaction to insert an optimal Kozak sequence 5′ of the initiator methionine codon and transferred to pCIS, a mammalian expression vector that utilizes the cytomegalovirus promoter. Subsequent mutagenesis of the N-terminal region was achieved by replacing the first 14 codons with synthetic double-stranded DNA segments containing the appropriate mutations. GFP reporter vectors (60 μg/ml) were mixed with pRF4-Rol6 DNA (100 μg/ml), spun down, and injected into the gonads of L4 or early adult N2 hermaphrodites. Injected animals were recovered and designated as F0. F1 animals with the roller phenotype were isolated and observed for progeny that also showed the roller phenotype. F2 animals with the roller phenotype were generated from at least two different F0 injections for each GFP reporter vector construct analyzed. Adult animals were photographed after anesthetizing in 1 mm levamisole. Fusion proteins between the bacteriophage gene 10 protein and the C-terminal 142 amino acids of CePPEF were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by preparative SDS-PAGE, and used for immunization of rabbits. Fusion proteins between the same CePPEF fragment and maltose-binding protein (MBP) were also produced in E. coli, purified to apparent homogeneity on an amylose resin (New England Biolabs Inc.), covalently cross-linked to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad), and used to affinity purify the rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Animals were synchronized by collecting N2 hermaphrodites from a single 10-cm plate, mixing gently in 10% bleach + 1 m NaOH for 1 min, washing several times in M9 medium, and then gently rocking for 36 h at room temperature to allow all embryos to hatch. Approximately 100 L1 larvae were placed on a Probe-On Plus glass slide (Fisher), coverslipped, and then freeze-cracked under slight pressure. Animals were fixed in −20 °C methanol for 30 min, followed by 15 min in −20 °C acetone. Freeze-cracked animals were blocked for several hours in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum, followed by primary antibody addition at a dilution of 1:100, overnight incubation at 4 °C, and subsequent incubation with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Three 10-cm plates of wild-type N2 animals or transgenic animals with the roller phenotype were resuspended in PBS and washed extensively. Nematodes were lysed in PBS with 1% Triton X-100; sonicated; and centrifuged at 731 ×g at 4 °C to remove cell debris, genomic DNA, and cuticle fragments. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and 20 μg of each lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and electrophoretic transfer. Immunoblots were visualized with the Supersignal West Pico system (Pierce) after sequential incubation with the CePPEF C terminus-specific antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Twenty-four hours after transient transfection using the calcium phosphate method, cells were washed in PBS, dissociated in PBS with 5 mm EDTA, collected by centrifugation at 418 × g, resuspended in 6 ml of PBS with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted with a Polytron 10/35 homogenizer (Kinematica). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 731 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and a portion of the post-nuclear supernatant was saved as the lysate fraction. The remaining sample was centrifuged at 58,450 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant was recovered, and the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of 1× SDS sample buffer, sonicated for 1 min, and diluted to 6 ml. 6× SDS sample buffer was added to the lysate and supernatant fractions to a final concentration of 1×, and 20 μl of lysate, pellet, and supernatant fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 293 cells on gelatin-coated coverslips were transfected with 0.25 μg each of GFP/pCIS and CePPEF/pCIS using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Cells were blocked for 1 h in PBS with 5% normal goat serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 5% normal goat serum and a 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified CePPEF C terminus-specific antibody. The following day, CePPEF was visualized by sequential addition of a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody and Texas Red-streptavidin. Images were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a 1-μm slice thickness. 293 cells were split 1:5 into 12-well plates and transfected 36 h later with 0.5 μg of CePPEF/pCIS using LipofectAMINE. For myristate labeling, [3H]myristate was added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% calf serum at a specific activity of 500 μCi/ml (26Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and cells were incubated in labeling medium for 5 h. For palmitate labeling, cells were transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 for 12 h and then to the same medium with 1% calf serum for 1 h. [3H]Palmitate was added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with 5% calf serum at a specific activity of 1000 μCi/ml (27Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and cells were incubated in labeling medium for 1 h. After labeling, cells were washed in PBS and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mmsodium phosphatase, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitors (see above). Lysates were added to 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads precoated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, rotated at 4 °C for 3 h, and then washed extensively in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 1.5× SDS sample buffer (without dithiothreitol for palmitate-labeled samples) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, treated with ENHANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. Mutations in the C terminus of CePPEF were generated by polymerase chain reaction. MBP fusions with the C-terminal 142 amino acids of wild-type or mutant CePPEF were produced in E. coli. Bacteria were lysed in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA and then purified to near homogeneity by amylose affinity chromatography. Fusion proteins were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and 200 mmKCl, which had been prerun over a Chelex 100 column. Binding assays were performed at 4 °C in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, and 0.1 μCi/ml 45CaCl2(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the indicated concentrations of unlabeled CaCl2. In each binding reaction, the protein concentration was set to 20% of the Ca2+ concentration. The binding mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and bound calcium was purified by running 50 μl of the binding mixture over a Sephadex G-50 spin column prechilled to 4 °C. Columns were spun at 731 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The separation of bound Ca2+ (in the void volume) from free Ca2+ (retained in the column) occurs within several seconds. Calcium binding at each Ca2+ concentration was assayed in triplicate; a control reaction without protein was analyzed for each Ca2+ concentration and subtracted as background. Binding data were fit to a second-order polynomial equation. For analysis of calcium binding under equilibrium conditions, Sephadex G-50 spin columns were pre-equilibrated with a solution that was identical to the binding assay contents described above, except for the absence of protein. Pre-equilibration was accomplished by five cycles of adding 100 μl of the pre-equilibration solution to the Sephadex G-50 spin column followed by centrifugation at 731 × gfor 1 min at 22 °C and two cycles of adding 50 μl of the pre-equilibration solution to the Sephadex G-50 spin column followed by centrifugation at 731 × g for 1 min at 22 °C. Fusion proteins and binding reactions were prepared as described above and incubated at 22 °C for 30 min. Binding reactions were then added to the pre-equilibrated Sephadex G-50 spin column and centrifuged at 731 × g for 1 min at 22 °C. Calcium binding at each Ca2+ concentration was assayed in nine independent Sephadex G-50 spin columns; three control reactions without protein were also analyzed for each Ca2+ concentration and subtracted as background. Binding data were fit to a two-site Aldair-Klotz model (28Celio M.R. Pauls T.L. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996Google Scholar) with the following equation: mol Ca2+/mol protein = 0.675·[m1·10(6 − m0) + 2·m1·m2· 10(12 − 2·m0)]/[1 + m1·10(6 − m0) + m1·m2·10(12 − 2·m0)] where m 0represents the pCa of the binding mixture andm 1 and m 2 represent the first and second macroscopic binding constants, respectively. Adjustment of the numerator by a factor of 0.675 is designed to set maximal binding to the binding observed at 1 mmCa2+ and accounts for the lowered maximal binding due to an estimated 80–90% purity of the fusion protein sample and retention of 10–20% of the fusion protein on the Sephadex G-50 spin column. As a first step in determining the cellular expression pattern of theCePPEF gene in C. elegans, a transgene construct was generated that fused 3.0 kb of DNA sequence upstream of the start codon to a GFP-LacZ reporter carrying an NLS (aa-(1)-NLS-GFP-LacZ) (Fig. 1). The large size of the GFP-LacZ fusion protein facilitates retention in the nucleus. Injection of the aa-(1)-NLS-GFP-LacZ construct into C. elegans revealed reporter gene expression in several anterior neurons, including AWB, AWC, AVA, AVB, AVX, BAG, and URX (Fig.2F). The ASE neuron showed inconsistent transgene expression. To assess the subcellular localization of the CePPEF protein and to determine whether additional transcriptional regulatory elements exist in intronic sequences, a transgene was constructed in which a 9.5-kb genomic DNA fragment extending from 3 kb 5′ of the start codon to a point 32 base pairs upstream of the CePPEF stop codon in exon 7 was fused in-frame to GFP (FL-GFP) (Fig. 1). This FL-GFP transgene directed GFP expression to the same set of neurons as the transgene construct described above (Fig. 2, compare A and B withF), and expression in a single posterior neuron was also more clearly observed (Fig. 2E). Within the expressing cells, the FL-GFP fusion protein localized efficiently to several structures beyond the cell soma, including axons that form the ventral nerve cord (Fig. 2D); dendrites that extend to the anterior tip of the animal (Fig. 2, A and B); and the cilia of neurons AWB, AWC, and BAG (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Localization of CePPEF promoter activity and CePPEF-GFP fusion proteins using transgenicC. elegans. In each panel, anterior is to the right. A and B, analysis of FL-GFP transgenicC. elegans shows the CePPEF-GFP fusion protein localizing to anterior sensory cilia (arrows), to the cell bodies of several anterior neurons surrounding the nerve ring, and to a subset of axons extending posteriorly and dendrites extending anteriorly.C, at high magnification, the extreme anterior end of an FL-GFP transgenic animal demonstrates intense staining in the cilia of BAG, AWB, and AWC (arrow). D and E, the FL-GFP transgene is also expressed in the ventral nerve cord and in a single tail neuron (arrowhead), respectively.F, aa-(1)-NLS-GFP-LacZ transgenic animals show GFP fluorescence in the nuclei of a subset of neurons near the nerve ring.Arrows indicate the location of the sensory cilia. Thebars correspond to 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The transgene constructs described above showed minimal expression in non-neuronal cells. However, we observed transgene expression in intestinal, hypodermal, or muscle cells in occasional transgenic lines in which 3.0-kb genomic DNA fragments extending just past theCePPEF start codon directed production of short N-terminal regions of CePPEF fused to GFP (described below). As these expression patterns occurred sporadically, they likely reflect transgene effects rather than an expression pattern relevant to the endogenous CePPEF gene. As a more direct method for determining the pattern of CePPEF protein localization, affinity-purified rabbit antibodies raised against the C-terminal 142 amino acids of CePPEF were used for immunostaining of C. elegans L1 larvae. The anti-CePPEF antibodies recognized a single polypeptide band of ∼80 kDa on immunoblots of proteins from 293 cells transfected with CePPEF cDNA, and no bands were seen with proteins from untransfected cells (Fig.3A). Immunoblots of wild-typeC. elegans lysates showed two bands, one at 80 kDa, which corresponds closely to the predicted molecular mass of the full-length protein, and a fainter band of slightly lower molecular mass, which may correspond to either a CePPEF degradation product or a heretofore unrecognized splice variant (Fig. 3B). Immunoblots of lysates from FL-GFP transgenic animals showed a higher molecular mass band at ∼120 kDa derived from the CePPEF-GFP fusion protein in addition to the endogenous CePPEF band. These data strongly imply that the anti-CePPEF antibodies specifically recognize CePPEF in C. elegans lysates. Immunostaining of wild-type L1 larvae with the anti-CePPEF antibodies demonstrated CePPEF in several cell bodies in the region of the nerve ring, in dendritic processes leading from these cells to the anterior end of the animal, and in sensory cilia at the extreme anterior end of the animal (Fig. 3C). This expression pattern closely resembles that observed with the GFP transgenic animals, indicating that the CePPEF-GFP transgenes accurately reproduce the endogenous CePPEF expression pattern. The extreme N terminus of CePPEF contains the myristoylation consensus sequence (MGXXX(S/T) … ) as well as the consensus sequence for N-terminal palmitoylation (MGC … ) (26Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Linder M.E. Kleuss C. Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 314-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that CePPEF may be membrane-associated via an N-terminal lipid modification. A membrane association of this type could play an important role in localizing CePPEF to axons, dendrites, or cilia. As an initial step in assessing this possibility, we generated transgenic lines in which 1, 5, 8, 11, or 14 N-terminal amino acids from CePPEF were fused to an NLS-tagged GFP (aa-(1)-NLS-GFP, aa-(1–5)-NLS-GFP, etc.) (Fig. 1). The NLS-GFP reporter showed little nuclear retention, presumably due to its small size. The aa-(1)-NLS-GFP and aa-(1–5)-NLS-GFP transgenic lines showed localization primarily in the nucleus and cell body and weak or no localization in dendrites and cilia (Fig.4, A and B). In contrast, the aa-(1–11)-NLS-GFP and aa-(1–14)-NLS-GFP transgenic lines showed GFP localization primarily in axons, dendrites, and cilia, but not in the cell soma (Fig. 4, D and E). The aa-(1–8)-NLS-GFP fusion showed an intermediate pattern, with localization in axons, dendrites and cilia as well as in the cell body and nucleus (Fig. 4C). To test whether the myristoylation and/or palmitoylation consensus sites are required for localization outside of the cell soma, site-directed mutants were constructed that disrupted either one or both fatty acylation sites. In one set of experiments, Gly2was substituted with alanine in the context of aa-(1–14)-NLS-GFP or FL-GFP to simultaneously disrupt the myristoylation and palmitoylation consensus sequences. In both cases, the G2A mutant proteins localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that myristoylation, palmitoylation, or both modifications together confer membrane attachment and concomitant localization to axons, dendrites, and cilia (Fig. 4, compare F with E and H withG). To further refine this analysis, Cys3 was substituted with serine in the context of FL-GFP to eliminate only the palmitoylation site. This mutant protein showed low levels of axonal, dendritic, and ciliary staining (Fig. 4, compare I withG), suggesting that palmitoylation in particular is critical for membrane attachment. As an independent test of the ability of the CePPEF N terminus to c"
https://openalex.org/W1979402177,"Previous studies have identified a novel interferon-stimulated response element-like element, termed γ-interferon-activating transcription element, within the interferon-stimulating gene factor-3γ (p48) promoter region that is bound by novel transcription factors in response to stimulation with interferons (IFNs) (Weihua, X., Kolla, V., and Kalvakolanu, D. V. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 103–108). In the present study, we have identified CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBP-β) as one of the γ-interferon-activating transcription element cognate transcription factors by screening a human monophage-derived cDNA library in a yeast one-hybrid system. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies suggest that C/EBP-β dynamically regulates p48 gene expression upon IFN-γ stimulation by undergoing changes in its heterodimerization partners. Transient transfection studies demonstrate that overexpression of C/EBP-β strongly enhanced IFN-γ-induced transcription from the p48 promoter. However, deletion mutants of C/EBP-β that lack the N-terminal transactivation domain were unable to stimulate the p48 promoter. Western blotting revealed that C/EBP-β is induced by IFN-γ stimulation in THP-1-derived macrophages. Collectively, these results suggest that C/EBP-β plays an important role in the human IFN-γ signaling pathway by transcriptional regulation of p48 gene expression, an essential component in the IFN signaling pathway. Previous studies have identified a novel interferon-stimulated response element-like element, termed γ-interferon-activating transcription element, within the interferon-stimulating gene factor-3γ (p48) promoter region that is bound by novel transcription factors in response to stimulation with interferons (IFNs) (Weihua, X., Kolla, V., and Kalvakolanu, D.

The ISGF3 complex consists of a 48-kDa DNA-binding protein (p48 or ISGF3-γ) and two signaltransducer and activators oftranscription (STAT) proteins, STAT1 and STAT2. The p48 protein in the ISGF3 complex serves as the adaptor to redirect STAT multimers from their intrinsic palindrome sequence specificity and allows binding to the IFN-stimulatedresponse element (ISRE) that occurs within the promoters of various IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (2Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to the ISRE element, a distinct cis-element termed IFN-γ-activated site (GAS) is also found within the promoters of many IFN-inducible genes and is bound by the STAT1 homodimer (3Mirkovitch J. Decker T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The p48 protein belongs to the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-myb family of transacting factors. This family of transcription factors can activate (IRF-1 and p48), repress (IRF-2 and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein), both activate and repress (IRF-4), and may activate or repress (IRF-3) transcription of target genes (4Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Studies of p48 knockout mice have shown that p48 plays an essential role in both type I and type II IFN responses for activation of IFN-inducible genes and establishment of the antiviral state (5Kimura T. Kadokawa Y. Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Tarutani M. Tan R.S. Takasugi T. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Noguchi S. Taniguchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that an ISRE-like sequence in the hepatitis B viral enhancer-1 could interact with the ISGF3 complex containing p48 and mediate the IFN-α-induced suppression of enhancer activity (6Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28075-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Other independent studies also demonstrated that overexpression of p48 in NIH-3T3 cells restored IFN responses of adenovirus E1A-expressing cells in which the IFN signaling was blocked by E1A (7Leonard G.T. Sen G.C. Virology. 1996; 224: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Leonard G.T. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5095-5101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although IFN and other cytokines induced by the Janus tyrosine kinase-STAT pathway have been well described, the mechanisms regulating expression of the p48 component of ISGF3 remain largely unknown. A number of studies have shown that various cell types, including primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia, human trophoblast, melanoma, and acute promyelocytic leukemia, are resistant to the actions of IFN because the induction of p48 protein is defective (9Cross J.C. Lam S. Yagel S. Werb Z. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Wong L.H. Krauer K.G. Hatzinisiriou I. Estcourt M.J. Hersey P. Tam N.D. Edmondson S. Devenish R.J.

Additionally, it has been argued that IFN-γ priming up-regulates p48-enhanced antiviral and antitumor effects of class I IFNs on IFN-resistant cells (13Gao P.Q. Sims S.H. Chang D.C. Deisseroth A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12380-12387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wong L.H. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. Ralph S.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5475-5484PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that p48 protein also binds to virus-inducible elements within the IFN-α/β promoters. This evidence suggests a potentially new role for ISGF3 in that it may participate directly in the activation of IFN-α/β promoters (15Harada H. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Kashiwazaki Y. Kimura T. Kitagawa M. Yokochi T. Tan R.S. Takasugi T. Kadokawa Y. Schindler C. Schreiber R.D. Noguchi S. Taniguchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Kawakami T. Matsumoto M. Sato M. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Kitagawa M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the transcriptional regulation of p48 is very important for elucidating the global functions of IFNs and signaling pathway networks among cytokines. Previously, we demonstrated that a novel IFN-γ-activated transcriptionelement (GATE) within the p48 promoter region and its cognate transacting factors regulate p48 gene expression upon IFN-γ stimulation (1Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although p48 is a member of the IRF family, it does not function like the other IRFs in which expression is regulated via either ISRE or GAS elements within their promoters (4Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Instead, induction of p48 gene expression in response to IFN stimulation occurs through the GATE, which has no significant homologies with GAS and only partial homology to ISRE. Also, it has been demonstrated that the GATE interacts with novel transcription factors instead of the common transcription factors that were found in most ISGs, STATs, or ISGF3 complexes (1Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A recent study using a Southwestern screening protocol has identified a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factor family, C/EBP-β, that binds to GATE and enhances the expression of the p48 promoter-luciferase in mouse macrophages (17Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism, tissue specificity, and biological contributions to the cells for response to the IFNs of such an event have not been well described. To gain insight into the mechanisms of IFN actions, we have screened a cDNA library derived from human THP-1 macrophages using a yeast one-hybrid system. We demonstrate that C/EBP-β, in association with other undefined transcription factor(s), binds to the GATE and regulates p48 expression in response to IFN-γ stimulation. The C/EBP belongs to a family of transcription factors with structural as well as functional homologies (18Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To date, six members have been identified, each consisting of an activation domain, a basic leucine zipper dimerization domain, and a DNA binding domain. All family members share the highly conserved dimerization domain by which they form homo- and heterodimers with other family members. C/EBP proteins have been linked to a variety of regulatory functions, including normal tissue development, cellular function, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (19Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Gene targeting revealed that members of the C/EBP family play critical roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation in various tissues (20Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Among the C/EBP protein family members, C/EBP-β is essential for macrophage function and is strongly induced during macrophage differentiation and activation (18Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBP-β binding motifs have been found in the functional regulatory regions of genes specifically induced in activated macrophages, such as IL-6, IL-1α, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and nitric-oxide synthase (19Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Mice deficient for the C/EBP-β gene showed that C/EBP-β plays an essential role in the cellular immune defense system, such as acting against foreign pathogens (20Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 21Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of such actions of C/EBP-β has not been well described. The human THP-1 cell line was maintained at a 1 × 106/ml density in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For IFN-γ stimulation, 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) were added into the medium for 8–16 h to induce cell differentiation into macrophages. The differentiated adherent macrophages were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and additional human recombinant IFN-γ (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) was added to a final concentration of 200 units/ml for the indicated periods at 37 °C. For Northern blotting, total RNA (10 μg) was separated on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to positive-charged nylon membranes. After fixation with UV light, the membranes were hybridized with the indicated32P-labeled cDNA probe in Fast-Hybrid solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by exposing the x-ray film overnight. For transfection experiments, following 8-h PMA induction, the adherent macrophages were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then 500 ng of total plasmid DNA/1 × 106 cells was transfected by LipofectinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After addition of DNA and overnight incubation in regular medium, 200 units/ml IFN-γ were added for stimulation (medium without IFN-γ was used for the indicated controls) for another 8 h. The transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in luciferase assay buffer, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein concentrations and β-galactosidase assays were used for standardization controls. Western blotting was performed as described previously (22Wang L.H. Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A., Yu, C.R. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast one-hybrid system was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The two yeast integration vectors, pHISi-1 and pLacZi, were used to produce the engineered yeast strains. The wild type and point mutation GATE oligonucleotide sequences used for constructing engineered yeast strains were: wild type GATE, 5′-C GAG GAG AAT TGA AAC TTA GGG-3′ and mutant GATE, 5′-C GAG GAG AAT TGCTCC TTA GGG-3′, in which the mutant nucleotides are italic and underlined. The engineered yeast reporter strain containing an integrated GATE sequence that controls the selection markers of HIS3 and lacZ gene expression was constructed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, three repeats of the GATE sequence were fused into theEcoRI/SacI site of yeast integration and reporter vector pHISi-1 and the EcoRI/KpnI site of pLacZi vector, producing pHis-GATE and pLacZ-GATE recombinant vectors, respectively. These two plasmids place the HIS andlacZ genes under the control of the inserted GATE elements. First, the recombinant vector pLacZ-GATE was transformed into the yeast strain YM4271, yielding an integrated URA locus yeast strain by selecting the URA marker on SD/−Ura selection medium. The His-GATE plasmid was then transformed into theURA-integrated yeast strain produced previously. The dual integrated HIS and URA locus yeast strain was next selected by SD/−His/−Ura double selection medium. Both wild type and mutant GATE oligonucleotides were separately used for engineered yeast strains and resulted in YM-W-GATE for wild type GATE and YM-M-GATE for mutant GATE, respectively. According to the manufacturer's instructions, inserting a target element to controlHIS and lacZ expression may alter the expression levels of background HIS and lacZ in the engineered yeast strain. Therefore, the level of backgroundHIS was determined in both engineered yeast strains by culturing the yeast strain on SD/−His medium containing various concentrations of 3-AT (from 0 to 60 mm). Both wild type and mutant engineered yeast strains were completely growth-inhibited by at least 45 mm 3-AT. Therefore, 45 mm 3-AT was used in yeast one-hybrid screening. The lacZ background expression level was also checked by β-galactosidase assay, and very low levels of background expression were detected in both strains by the β-galactosidase filter lift assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). The cDNA library was constructed from THP-1-derived macrophages with various periods of IFN-γ stimulations that ranged from 1 to 16 h. After harvesting, the cells were pooled, mRNAs were purified from total RNA, and cDNAs were synthesized and cloned into the HybriZAP-2.1 phage vector by using a cDNA library construction kit (Stratagene). Following the manufacturer's instructions, the cDNA library in phage was converted into phagemid vector pAD-GAL4-2.1 using an in vivo excision protocol and was amplified in Escherichia coli. For screening the cDNA library, 150 μg of purified cDNA library in yeast expression phagemid (containing about 3 × 106 genes) were separately transformed into YM-W-GATE and YM-M-GATE dual selection yeast strains by the LiOAc method (CLONTECH) and plated on SD/−His/−Ura + 45 mm 3-AT agar plates at 30 °C for 5–7 days to select the 3-AT-resistant colonies. Following the PMA-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells for 16 h, IFN-γ was added at various time points prior to harvesting the cells. THP-1 cells without PMA and IFN-γ treatment were used as the THP-1 control; cells with PMA induction alone were used as the IFN-γ (−) control. After pelleting the cells at 2,000 rpm/min for 2 min at 4 °C, nuclear extracts (NEs) were prepared as described previously (1Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and protein assays were performed. EMSAs were performed as described elsewhere (22Wang L.H. Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A., Yu, C.R. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar) except that 2 μg of protein from each sample were mixed with 1× binding buffer containing 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 5 × 104 cpm 32P-labeled probe for 15 min at room temperature before loading on an 8% glycerol-polyacrylamide gel. The following oligonucleotide sequences were used as probe for EMSA (the GATE-w for wild type GATE and GATE-m for mutant GATE were the same as those used for engineered yeast strains): C/EBP-w for wild type C/EBP, 5′-TGC AGA TTG CGC AAT CTG CA-3′ and C/EBP-m for mutant C/EBP, 5′-TGC AGA GAC TAG T CT CTG CA-3′, in which the mutant nucleotides are italic and underlined. The GAS sequence was 5′-GATTTCCCCGAAAT-3′. The normal rabbit serum, anti-STAT1 (p91), and anti-STAT2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-ISGF3-γ (anti-p48), anti-IRF-1, and anti-C/EBP-α were purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-C/EBP-β has been described by Williams et al.(23Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The plasmids used in transgenic transfection experiments were control vector pMEX, pMEX-C/EBPβ containing the full-length rat C/EBP-β cDNA, pMEX-C/EBPβ-(132–276) lacking amino acids 1–131, and pMEX-C/EBPβ-(191–276) lacking amino acids 1–190 as described previously (21Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For luciferase reporters, pGL3 basic-A6 was constructed by PCR from mouse genomic DNA according to the p48 promoter sequence (GenBankTM accession numberU72760) and previous publications (1Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and pGL3 basic-A8 and pGL3 basic-GATEpm were derived from pGL3 basic-A6 by deleting the 5′ sequences up to the PstI enzyme site at 687 bp of the p48 promoter or by introducing the point mutation at the GATE sequence by replacing the AAA sequence inside the GATE with CTC, respectively. pGL3 promoter-P1 and -P4 were constructed by placing the minimal GATE-containing fragment that was excised by restriction enzymesSacI-PstI or PmlI-PstI from pGL3 basic-A6 clone into pGL3 promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). pGL3 promoter-wildGATE and pGL3 promoter-mutantGATE were constructed by fusing three repeats of synthetic GATE-w or GATE-m (see “Yeast One-hybrid System and cDNA Library”) oligonucleotides into theSmaI restriction enzyme site of pGL-3 promoter vectors. Human p48 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA from IFN-γ-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR kit from Life Technologies, Inc.), and then cDNA was amplified by PCR with the sense primer at human p48 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number M87503) 611–630 bp 5′-GTTACAGACACAACTGAGGC-3′ and the antisense primer at 1207–1188 bp 5′-GGACAGAATGGCTGCCTGCT-3′. The 596-bp PCR product was cloned into theSmaI restriction enzyme site of pGEM-7Z vector; the resulting clone was confirmed by sequencing analysis. Macrophages are one of the primary targets of IFN-γ. The human monocytic cell line, THP-1, can be differentiated into macrophage-like cells by PMA treatment, and these cells exhibit the characteristics of macrophages, including their immunological functions. To further understand the regulation of p48 by IFN-γ in human macrophages, we performed Northern blots using THP-1 cells that had been differentiated with PMA followed by IFN-γ stimulation. Fig.1 A shows a Northern blot in which the basal level of p48 messenger RNA increased after 5 h of IFN-γ stimulation and continued to increase in a time-dependent manner until maximally induced at 7–12 h. Expression of p48 began to diminish at 16 h post-IFN-γ treatment. The same blot was reprobed for β-actin as a control to ensure equal amounts of RNA were used. These observations are identical to those obtained using murine macrophages (1Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), i.e.regulation of p48 expression is quite slow (7–10 h) compared with that of ISGF3 formation, which is quite rapid (within minutes (24Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar)) and independent of protein synthesis in the early stage of the response to IFNs. Previous studies have characterized GATE as the IFN-responsive site within the p48 promoter in murine macrophages (1Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Roy S.K. Wachira S.J. Weihua X. Hu J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12626-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Weihua X. Ling W. Kalvakolanu D.V. Antiviral Res. 1999; 40: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism controlling transcription of p48 by IFN-γ, EMSA was performed using a 32P-labeled GATE probe and NE from IFN-γ-stimulated THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 1 B). Three specific binding complexes were observed with different electrophoretic mobilities. Because these binding complexes are not yet defined, we designated them as GATE bindingcomplexes-α, -β, and -γ (GBC-α, -β, and -γ) for the slow-to-fast mobility complexes, respectively. GBC-α was the only complex observed in the control cells (both undifferentiated THP-1 and IFN-γ (−) controls). Its appearance was decreased concomitant with IFN-γ stimulation. There was no GBC-β observed in untreated cells, but GBC-β was strongly induced by IFN-γ in a time-dependent manner starting at 1 h (Fig.1 B, lane 3), peaking at 7–9 h (lanes 6 and 7), and diminishing at 16 h (lane 8) post-IFN-γ treatment. Another minor binding complex, GBC-γ, was undetectable in control cells but appeared and remained at low levels from 3 to 9 h post-IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1 B,lanes 4–7). The above observations suggested that GATE binding complexes are induced by IFN-γ stimulation. The close correlation between the time-dependent induction pattern of p48 mRNA expression and GBCs binding to GATE suggests a direct link between GBCs and p48 expression. To further identify the transcription factors binding to GATE and activating p48 transcription, we employed the yeast one-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library derived from IFN-γ-stimulated THP-1 macrophages. After transforming the cDNA library into the engineered double selection yeast strains YM-W-GATE and YM-M-GATE (see “Materials and Methods”), SD/−His/−Ura agar plates containing 45 mm 3-AT were used to select transformed yeast colonies that express GATE-binding proteins. After two rounds of selection on the restrictive medium plates, five candidates were selected from the YM-W-GATE strain, and the plasmids were isolated. After retransformation into the YM-W-GATE and YM-M-GATE strains, all five candidates exhibited positive phenotypes in YM-W-GATE compared with the control, YM-M-GATE. Expression of the additional selection marker, β-galactosidase, was tested by filter lift assay. The results confirmed positive phenotypes for all five candidates (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the five clones revealed that none was a full-length cDNA but showed that the five clones belong to three different gene groups. Two of the clones showed very high homologies (98%) to the C/EBP transcription factor family member, C/EBP-β. The other two clones were highly identical to an IFN-inducible gene that has not yet been well characterized. The last clone had no significant matches with any known sequence in the NCBI/GenBankTMdatabase. The two C/EBP homology clones contained similarly sized inserts that encode the DNA binding and leucine zipper domains and the 5′-untranslated region sequence of C/EBP-β. Because C/EBP-β has been well characterized as a nuclear transcription factor and has tissue-specific properties in macrophages (26Baer M. Williams S.C. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 4353-4365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matsumoto M. Tanaka T. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5039-5048PubMed Google Scholar), our focus was directed first to C/EBP-β. Because the GATE had been defined originally as an ISRE-like binding site (1Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Weihua X. Ling W. Kalvakolanu D.V. Antiviral Res. 1999; 40: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), anti-STAT1, -STAT2, -IRF-1, -p48 (ISGF3-γ), as well as -C/EBP-α and -C/EBP-β antibodies were used in supershift EMSA to identify the components of the GBCs (Fig.2 A). The indicated antibodies were incubated with the NE for 1 h prior to the addition of probe. Labeled probe was then added to the antibody-reaction mixtures for another 15 min at room temperature, and each reaction was loaded onto an 8% glycerol-polyacrylamide gel. The same NE as in Fig.1 B was used for the IFN-γ (−) (Fig. 2 A,lane 1), and PMA-induced macrophages with IFN-γ treatment for 8 h were used for IFN-γ (+) control (lane 2) and for the antibody supershift reactions (lanes 3–9). Normal rabbit serum was also used as a control (lane 3). The results showed that anti-C/EBP-β abrogated formation of both GBC-α and GBC-β, but not GBC-γ (lane 4), and anti-IRF-1 supershifted the GBC-γ complex only (lane 8). The other antibodies, including anti-C/EBP-α, -STAT1, -STAT2, and -p48, had no effect on formation of the GBC complexes. To further confirm the observations that C/EBP-β is a component of GBCs that bound to GATE, EMSAs were performed using the same NEs and32P-labeled GATE-w probe in the presence of competitor DNAs. The competitors included wild type GATE (GATE-w), mutant GATE (GATE-m), wild type C/EBP (C/EBP-w), mutant C/EBP (C/EBP-m), and the GAS element from the IRF-1 gene promoter (GAS-w) (Fig. 2 B). The results show that the cold GATE-w probe specifically competed with the GBCs binding to GATE (lanes 3 and 4), and C/EBP-w competed with GBC-α and -β binding to GATE-w (lanes 7 and 8). However, the GATE-m (lanes 5 and6) and C/EBP-m (lanes 9 and 10) oligonucleotides did not compete for GATE-w binding. The GAS-w competed with GBC-γ but had no effect on either GBC-α or -β. Members of the C/EBP protein family can form either homo- or heterodimers with other family members when binding to their target binding site (23Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 28Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6919-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Anti-C/EBP-β was able to supershift both GBC-α and -β, and the cold C/EBP-w probe was able to compete with GBC-α and -β suggesting that GBC-α and -β are both C/EBP-β-containing complexes in which C/EBP-β binds directly or as part of a complex to GATE. Therefore, C/EBP-β is likely to play a critical role in formation of GBC-α and -β complexes for regulation of p48 in THP-1-derived macrophages. However, because GATE is an ISRE-like binding site and IRF-1 also has been shown to be a critical transcription factor in ISGs, the GATE may act as a multiple transcriptional activation site. This is supported by the observation that the weaker IFN-γ-inducible c"

In principle, if ecotropic retrovirus, which is incapable of infecting human cells, could be transiently modified to effectively transduce human cells, this safety risk could be alleviated. Here we demonstrate that formation of amphotropic retrovirus polylysine molecular conjugates (aMMLV-PL) enhanced gene transfer up to 10-fold in a variety of human cell lines over the equivalent of unconjugated vector (aMMLV). The polylysine modification and formation of ecotropic retrovirus molecular conjugates (eMMLV-PL) permitted effective and stable transduction of different human cell lines as well as primary human bone marrow stroma cells at frequencies of greater than 80%. It is conceivable that this novel ecotropic-based conjugate retrovirus vector could also potentially provide enhanced safety characteristics not only over amphotropic retrovirus vectors but also over genetically tropism-modified recombinant ecotropic vectors. In contrast to genetic modifications, physical or chemical modifications are not propagated. Thus, formation of replication competent eMMLV from conjugates would be self-limited and would not result in virus propagation in humans.

However, technical barriers related to the biology of vector cell interaction and patient safety remain the most critical end points in clinical trials. Therefore, the success of human gene therapy depends on effective transfer and expression of the desired genes into the target cell at the lowest possible risk for the individual. Gene therapy approaches most commonly utilize recombinant viral vectors, in which both cellular uptake and transgene expression depend on interactions between the viral vector and the target cell (3Haddada H. Cordier L. Perricaudet M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 297-306PubMed Google Scholar,4Hanania E.G. Kavanagh J. Hortobagyi G. Giles R.E. Champlin R. Deisseroth A.B. Am. J.

The best established vector system for achieving stable transduction in human cells is the amphotropic retrovirus vector, with its infectivity or cellular uptake at least in part determined by the presence of natural receptors on the target cells. Since the use of retrovirus vectors is restricted to specific receptor-expressing cells, transduction efficiency is largely determined by cell surface receptor density (7Chen L. Pulsipher M. Chen D. Sieff C. Elias A. Fine H.A. Kufe D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2539-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Thoma S.J. Lamping C.P. Ziegler B.L.

Due to the lack of ecotropic receptors on human cells, unmodified ecotropic retrovirus cannot be used for transduction of human cells. Currently, all clinical approaches for stable transduction of human cells rely on amphotropic retrovirus. The rare event of formation of replication-competent amphotropic retrovirus could result in systemic viremia of a treated individual, as amphotropic retrovirus can infect and replicate in most human cells. If technology would permit the effective use of ecotropic retrovirus for human gene therapy protocols, this crucial safety concern could be alleviated. Uncontrolled virus replication in humans with ecotropic virus would be unlikely, since the lack of natural receptors prevents infection of human cells. Here we have developed and evaluated a strategy to accomplish this goal by synthesizing ecotropic retrovirus molecular conjugates (eMMLV-PL).1 To prove feasibility for this concept, the first step would require physical or chemical modifications of ecotropic retrovirus, not only permitting infection of human cells but also the efficient cellular transduction with the transferred gene. The development of strategies to overcome ecotropic/amphotropic receptor-dependent vector uptake and enhancement of cellular transduction efficiency through circumventing the natural pathway of virus to cell entry has become a major goal of gene therapy research. We previously determined that recombinant adenovirus molecular conglomerate vectors substantially enhanced vector uptake and transgene expression after formation of polylysine-based conglomerates over recombinant adenovirus particles alone (10Schwarzenberger P. Hunt J.D. Robert E. Theodossiou C. Kolls J.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8563-8571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the hypothesis that polylysine-conjugated retrovirus results in increased uptake and gene expression over the equivalent of unconjugated virus (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, we hypothesized that through this procedure, the tropism restriction of ecotropic virus could be overcome, and human cells would become amenable to transduction with ecotropic retrovirus vectors (Fig.1 B). If successful, this conjugate ecotropic vector would have an additional significant safety advantage over currently employed amphotropic systems.

The human pulmonary epithelial carcinoma-derived cell line A549 was purchased from ATCC. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2atmosphere in a humidified incubator (standard cell culture conditions). Primary human bone marrow cells were obtained by standard aspiration from the iliac crest of healthy voluntary donors and collected in MyeloCult H5100 medium (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) supplemented with 250 units/ml heparin. The institutional review board at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center of New Orleans, LA approved this study involving human subjects. For erythrocyte lysis, specimens were incubated for 1 min in 0.747% NH4Cl solution. After two washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1×107 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained under standard conditions. Non-adherent cells were decanted with media exchange 2–3 times/week. A near confluent bone marrow stroma layer of fibroblast morphology was established after 2–3 weeks. Gene transfer experiments in these cells were performed at 70–80% confluence. The amphotropic retroviral helper cell line PA317 or the ecotropic retroviral packaging cell line GP+E86 were transfected with the plasmid pLZ12 using calcium phosphate (13Graham F.L. Abrahams P.J.

Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pLZ121 encodes the lacZreporter gene under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and has a 5′ nuclear localization signal (Fig. 1). The retroviral helper cell line was cultured under standard conditions (14Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected from stable vector-producing cells, and retrovirus purification was performed after a procedure previously described by Akatsuka et al. (17Akatsuka Y. Emi N. Kato H. Abe A. Tanimoto M. Lupton S.D. Saito H. Int. J. Hematol. 1994; 60: 251-261PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 30% (w/w) stock solution of polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma) was prepared in double-distilled water and stored in aliquots at 4 °C. Viral supernatants were gently mixed with polyethylene glycol in 250-ml polystyrene tubes to achieve a final 8% polyethylene glycol solution. The mixture was maintained overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 45 min, the precipitate was dissolved in 3 ml of TES buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). The titer of virus preparations was determined as previously described on NIH3T3 monolayers (18;19). Retrovirus was covalently linked to poly-l-lysine (PL) (Sigma), molecular mass 30–70 kDa, using the heterobifunctional chemical linker 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Pierce). Briefly, 3.6 ml of retrovirus (7 × 107colony-forming units/ml) was resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; 5 mm HEPES pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl) and 0.4 ml of PL (6 mg/ml in HBS). 0.04 ml of freshly made EDC solution (250 mg/ml in dH2O) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 4 h. This ratio of reagents was found to be optimal, as determined in several pilot experiments in different human and murine cell lines (data not shown). The product was then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a large volume of TES using 12–14-kDa cutoff membrane tubing (Spectra/Por, Laguna Hills, CA). The final product, retrovirus-polylysine (eMMLV-PL) was separated into aliquots in TES and stored at −80 °C. NeutrAvidin (NA) (Pierce) was covalently linked to PL, molecular mass 30–70 kDa, using the heterobifunctional chemical linker EDC. Briefly, 10 mg/ml NA was resuspended in HBS. 1.5 ml of NA solution was gently mixed with 0.5 ml of PL (6 mg/ml in HBS) before 0.04 ml of freshly made EDC solution (250 mg/ml in dH2O) was added. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 4 h. The product was then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a large volume of PBS using 12–14-kDa cutoff membrane tubing (Spectra/Por, Laguna Hills, CA). The final product, avidin-polylysine was separated into aliquots in PBS and stored at −20 °C. Retrovirus was covalently linked to sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (biotin) following the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Briefly, 0.2 ml of biotin (10 mg/ml in Me2SO) was mixed with 2.8 ml of retrovirus in PBS (7×107 colony-forming units/ml). The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 2 h. The product (eMMLV-B) was then exchanged in TES buffer (0.01 mTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.002 m EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl) over EP 10 DG columns (Bio-Rad). EMMLV-B was separated into aliquots and stored in TES at −80 °C. The titer of eMMLV-B was determined as previously described on NIH3T3 monolayers (20Mann R. Mulligan R.C. Baltimore D. Cell. 1983; 33: 153-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). LacZ staining was performed as previously described (21Kolls J.K. Peppel K. Silvia M. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 0.05% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3) (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS. Cells were stained for lacZexpression overnight at 37 °C using freshly made X-gal solution buffer (1 mg/ml X-gal, 20 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 20 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 2 mmMgCl2 in PBS). After rinsing with 70% ethanol, cells were analyzed by microscopy for blue cells. Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A unique and specific 1,036-base pair sequence of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene was amplified using the primer pair 5′-GCC-GAC-CGC-ACG-CCG-CAT-CCA-GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCG-GCG-CGG-TGA-CCA-CAC-CC-GG-3′ (antisense) using Taqpolymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Amplification conditions consisted of a 1-min denaturing cycle at 94 °C, a primer annealing step at 65 °C for 1 min, and a primer extension step at 72 °C for 2 min for a total of 35 cycles. A final elongation cycle was performed for 10 min at 72 °C (MJ Research, Peltier Thermal Cycler, Watertown, MA). The product was analyzed after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel after ethidium bromide staining under UV fluorescence. For quantitative REAL-time PCR, a unique and specific 84-base pair sequence of the E. coli lacZ gene was amplified using the primer pair E. coli B-gal-f 5′-ATG-CGC-CCA-TCT-ACA-CCA-A-3′ (sense) and E. coliB-gal-rev 5′-AGA-AAC-AAC-CCG-TCG-GAT-TCT-C-3′ (antisense). Product labeling was performed using the fluorochrome SYBR® Green following the instructions recommended by the manufacturer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification conditions consisted of a 10-min AmpliTaq Gold polymerase activation step at 95 °C followed by a denaturing step at 95 °C for 15 s and a combined annealing and extension step at 60 °C for 1 min in a thermocycler (GeneAmp®5700 sequence detection system, PE Applied Biosystems). A total of 40 cycles of sequential denaturing/annealing and extension was performed. A standard curve was established by concomitant amplification of DNA extracted from a retrovirally stably transduced NIH3T3 clone. The samples were analyzed with the 5700 software detection system and corrected for total DNA content using a spectrophotometer (DU640B, Beckman Instruments). AnR of >0.99 was required for standard curves. The sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 10 copies/sample. Copy number per cell was determined by determining sample LacZ copy from a standard curve. Genomic DNA was extracted form different lacZ-expressing 911 single cell clones previously transduced with eMMLV-PL using a commercial DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). 40 μg of restriction-digested genomic DNA and standards established with the lacZ gene derived from theNotI-digested control plasmid pACCMVLacZ (21Kolls J.K. Peppel K. Silvia M. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) were loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel and separated by electrophoresis following previously described procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA was transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (MSI, Westborough, MA), which was subsequently hybridized with a 32P-radiolabeled probe specific for the lacZ sequence (5′-GCC-GAC-CGC-ACG-CCG-CAT-CCA-GC-3′). After removal of nonhybridized probe by washing, the membrane was exposed to radiographic film and developed. Restriction digestion of pACCMVLacZ with EcoRI linearized the plasmid, yielding a 12-kb fragment; digestion withNotI released a 4.3-kb cassette encoding the lacZgene (21Kolls J.K. Peppel K. Silvia M. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For demonstration of integration by junction fragments, genomic DNA was digested with XbaI. There is a uniqueXbaI site in the retrovirus construct just 3′ of thelacZ reporter gene (15Galileo D.S. Gray G.E. Owens G.C. Majors J. Sanes J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Casadaban M.J. Chou J. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The frequency ofXbaI restriction sites in human genomic is approximately 1/4 kb. For evaluation of lacZ copy number integrated into host cells, genomic DNA was digested with XhoI andXbaI to release a 4.4-kb fragment encoding thelacZ gene within the retrovirus construct (15Galileo D.S. Gray G.E. Owens G.C. Majors J. Sanes J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Casadaban M.J. Chou J. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GenomicXhoI- and XbaI-digested DNA was analyzed by Southern blot together with different dilutions of purifiedNotI-digested pACCMVLacZ plasmid DNA fragments to establish a standard. The membranes were probed with the above-describedlacZ-specific probe, and the radiographic intensities were determined using a chemiluminescent 4000 low light imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Copy number per cell was calculated using previously published formulas where the band intensity of the transduced clones were compared with intensities from the standard curve (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 23Southern E.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 24Elder J.K. Southern E.M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that formation of polylysine-based retrovirus molecular conglomerates would improve transduction efficiency over retrovirus particles, biotinylated aMMLV encoding the lacZ reporter gene (aMMLV-B) and avidinylated polylysine (PL-NA) were synthesized. The biotinylation procedure did not significantly reduce the infectivity and transgene expression of aMMLV-B over unmodified virus (aMMLV) in murine NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Human 911 cells were infected with aMMLV-B with or without Polybrene at increasing m.o.i. (0.05–1.5) or the equivalent amount of aMMLV-B as molecular conglomerate by adding PL-NA (aMMLV-PL). Formation of retrovirus conglomerates significantly increased transgene expression at low m.o.i. by up to 5-fold. At higher m.o.i., transduction efficiency reached 100% for all vectors as expected (Fig.2 A). To investigate the ubiquity of this transduction enhancement, other cell lines, human 293, A549, and murine NIH3T3 cells, were infected with aMMLV-B (with or without Polybrene) or the equivalent amount of retrovirus as aMMLV-PL. At low m.o.i. (0.2), formation of aMMLV-PL resulted in significant, 5-fold-increased transgene expression in the examined cell lines (Fig.2 B). To study the hypothesis that formation of polylysine-based conglomerates overcome the tropism restriction of ecotropic retroviruses, biotinylated eMMLV encoding the lacZreporter gene (eMMLV-B) was joined to PL-NA to form eMMLV-PL. Similar to aMMLV-B, the biotin modification did not significantly decrease infectivity of eMMLV (data not shown). Human embryonal kidney 293 cells were infected with different vector and control constructs at an m.o.i. of 0.4 or 1.5 and analyzed for reporter gene expression. As expected, no transgene expression was observed with unmodified ecotropic virus (eMMLV) or eMMLV-B. However, physical linkage of eMMLV-B to PL-NA with conglomerate formation of eMMLV-PL resulted in significant transgene expression of 25 and 84%, respectively (Fig.3). The human retinoblastoma cell 911, the human lung cancer cell line A549, and freshly isolated primary human bone marrow-derived adherent stroma cells were transfected with eMMLV or eMMLV-PL at the m.o.i. of 0.5 and 1.5. Cells were not cultured under selective conditions favoring proliferation of transduced cells. Transgene expression was only seen in cells transfected with eMMLV-PL with 32 and 87% for 911 cells, 25 and 82% for A549 cells, and 30 and 92% for primary human stroma cells (Figs.4 and5).Figure 5Transgene expression in human 293 and primary bone marrow stroma cells after eMMLV-PL lacZ gene transfer. Human 293 cells (A and B) and primary human bone marrow stroma cells (C and D) were transfected with eMMLV or eMMLV-PL, respectively. Cells were analyzed for lacZ transgene expression as outlined under “Materials and Methods” and visualized by transmission light microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Integration oflacZ gene into the host genome was demonstrated by genomic DNA restriction digestion of five 911 single cell clones using the enzyme XbaI. Different sized junction fragments were identified in all clones examined for the presence of lacZ (Fig.6). The copy number of the transferred reporter gene in transduced 911 cells was measured by REAL-time PCR and by Southern blot. A copy number of 0.91/cell (0.87–0.95) was quantified by PCR, and a copy number of 0.83/cell was quantified by Southern blot (Fig. 7, A andB). The combined evidence for these experiments indicates that eMMLV-PL results in integration of the transgene at 1 copy/cell.Figure 7Determination of transgene copy number after retrovirus molecular conjugates (eMMLV-PL) gene transfer.After transduction of 911 cells with eMMLV-PL, lacZ-positive single cell clone cells were established. REAL-time PCR was performed using a specific probe for lacZ on two clones (denoted by triangles and squares) and compared to a standard curve established with the lacZ-encoding plasmid pACCMVLacZ (dots). Cycle threshold (CT) values are plotted against lacZ copy number (A). For quantitative Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was restriction-digested with XhoI and XbaIto release the 4.4-kb lacZ cassette from the integrated retrovirus construct. Plasmid pACCMVLacZ was restriction-digested with the enzyme NotI, releasing the 4.3-kb lacZ gene to establish a standard. The membrane was hybridized using a probe specific for the lacZ gene as outlined under Materials and Methods.“ Signal intensity was used to calculate copy number per cell (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our findings demonstrate that ecotropic retrovirus could be modified with a conjugate technique to accomplish effective transduction of human cells. If successful, this procedure could potentially provide additional safety features for use in humans. Ecotropic virus is chemically linked within the conjugate, so it remains genetically unaltered. The theoretical risk of in vivo propagation is substantially less for a transient tropism modification compared with a genetically tropism-modified ecotropic retrovirus vector such as vesicular stomatitis virus-pseudotyped envelopes. In the event that transiently modified ecotropic virus becomes replication competent, its progeny would be ecotropic retrovirus, which is incapable of propagating in humans. On the other hand, progeny arising from a genetically engineered, tropism-modified virus could continue to maintain its tropism-modified form and, thus, would remain infectious to human cells, posing a significant safety risk. First, we had to proof that the polylysine conjugation does indeed enhance the transduction efficiency of retrovirus. Although previous studies showed in principle feasibility of retrovirus retargeting via alternate cell surface receptors, several retargeting studies were associated with significant reduction or even disappearance of cellular transduction (25Roux P. Jeanteur P. Piechaczyk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9079-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (26Neda H. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14143-14146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kasahara N. Dozy A.M. Kan Y.W. Science. 1994; 266: 1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 28Fielding A.K. Maurice M. Morling F.J. Cosset F.L. Russell S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 1802-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, greatly enhanced transduction efficiency was reported for retrovirus vectors redirected by pseudotyping with the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope (29Emi N. Friedmann T. Yee J.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1201-1202Crossref Google Scholar,30Yee J.K. Friedmann T. Burns J.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To investigate the hypothesis that polylysine conjugation would enhance retrovirus transduction, retrovirus molecular conglomerates were synthesized by biotinylation and linking to avidinylated polylysine. Our data demonstrate that at low m.o.i., formation of molecular conjugates synthesized with amphotropic virus (aMMLV-PL) substantially enhances transgene expression over the equivalent amount of free amphotropic retrovirus (aMMLV-B). The human cell lines tested were permissive to infection with amphotropic retrovirus; thus, increasing m.o.i. eventually resulted in nearly 100% transduction efficiency with both virus vectors. Therefore, the advantage in this particular experimental setting was limited to a transduction enhancement observed at low m.o.i. The mechanism of the increased transduction efficiency of amphotropic conjugates could be explained through enhancement of virus uptake via their natural receptors or the utilization of an alternate pathway for virus uptake. The former concept has been proposed for fibronectin-meditated retrovirus transduction augmentation (31Moritz T. Dutt P. Xiao X. Hanenberg H. Carstanjen D. Vik T. Williams D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 855-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32MacNeill E.C. Hanenberg H. Pollok K.E. van der Loo J.C. Bierhuizen M.F. Wagemaker G. Williams D.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3960-3967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model proposes that fibronectin facilitates colocalization of retrovirus particles and target cells with a large increase in local virus titer presented to the cell (31Moritz T. Dutt P. Xiao X. Hanenberg H. Carstanjen D. Vik T. Williams D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 855-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Asada K. Uemori T. Ueno T. Hashino K. Koyama N. Kawamura A. Kato I. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 106: 423-430Google Scholar). Similarly, the adjunct use of the positively charged polycations such as Polybrene in retroviral gene transfer procedures has long been known to nonspecifically promote retrovirus transduction efficiency and is now used for many protocols (35Cornetta K. Anderson W.F. J. Virol. Methods. 1989; 23: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To proof that the entry mechanisms of retrovirus-polylysine conjugates are independent of natural receptors and are entirely polylysine-mediated, experiments were designed using ecotropic retrovirus constructs in human cells. We found that only the physical binding of eMMLV to polylysine accomplished cellular transduction with efficiencies of 80–90% in different human cell lines and primary cells. Although polycations have previously been reported to facilitate infectivity and to enhance transduction efficiency (36Kierney P.C. Dorshkind K. Blood. 1998; 70: 1418-1424Crossref Google Scholar), our data indicate that this effect can not only be greatly enhanced by chemical or physical linkage of virus and polycation, but this linkage allows an ability to completely overcome receptor-dependent virus uptake. This phenomenon could be explained by the ability of positively charged polylysine to nonspecifically penetrate cell surface membranes and enter the cytosol (37Skutelsky E. Danon D. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Wickham T.J. Roelvink P.W. Brough D.E. Kovesdi I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Compared with individually retargeted retrovirus particles, conglomerates consist of multiple virus particles bound to polylysine, thus providing a higher likelihood of delivering one intact virus to the nucleus. This explanation of an added survival benefit is supported by studies where DNA bound to polylysine was found to have significantly enhanced resistance to intracellular degradation over free DNA (39Chiou H.C. Tangco M.V. Levine S.M. Robertson D. Kormis K. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5439-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similar to DNA, the retrovirus particles may be relatively protected from nuclease digestion within the polylysine conglomerate formation. Therefore, the improved transduction efficiency could result as the combined effect of both polylysine-mediated enhanced uptake and also improved retrovirus survival from cytosolic degradation. Transduction with eMMLV-PL in human cells resulted in a similar genomic copy number as eMMLV in the murine cell line NIH3T3. This implies that the formation of retrovirus conglomerates does not change the fundamental principal established for retrovirus/cell interactions of only a single integration event with one retroviral copy per cell (40Varmus H. Science. 1988; 240: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In summary, this novel retrovirus-based gene transfer system has the potential to improve transduction efficiency that comes from low receptor expression, such as for instance in hematopoietic cells (8Thoma S.J. Lamping C.P. Ziegler B.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2103-2114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,9Crooks G.M. Kohn D.B. Blood. 1993; 82: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this system would provide additional safety features over amphotropic retrovirus vectors currently used in human trials. Even the case of formation of replication-competent ecotropic virus would be theoretically a self-limited problem, as progeny of transiently modified ecotropic virus could not further propagate in humans due to its tropism restriction. Last, the polylysine-based retrovirus system may enable specific receptor retargeting by formation of receptor-targeted retrovirus molecular conglomerate vectors (10Schwarzenberger P. Hunt J.D. Robert E. Theodossiou C. Kolls J.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8563-8571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,41Schwarzenberger P. Spence S.E. Gooya J.M. Michiel D.M. Ruscetti F.W. Keller J.R. Blood. 1996; 87: 472-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Jakob Reiser for the critical review of our studies."
https://openalex.org/W1983382306,"Abstract The current models that have been proposed to explain the mechanism of replication termination are (i) passive arrest of a replication fork by the terminus (Ter) DNA-terminator protein complex that impedes the replication fork and the replicative helicase in a polar fashion and (ii) an active barrier model in which the Ter-terminator protein complex arrests a fork not only by DNA-protein interaction but also by mechanistically significant terminator protein-helicase interaction. Despite the existence of some evidence supporting in vitro interaction between the replication terminator protein (RTP) and DnaB helicase, there has been continuing debate in the literature questioning the validity of the protein-protein interaction model. The objective of the present work was two-fold: (i) to reexamine the question of RTP-DnaB interaction by additional techniques and different mutant forms of RTP, and (ii) to investigate if a common domain of RTP is involved in the arrest of both helicase and RNA polymerase. The results validate and confirm the RTP-DnaB interaction in vitro and suggest a critical role for this interaction in replication fork arrest. The results also show that the Tyr33 residue of RTP plays a critical role both in the arrest of helicase and RNA polymerase."
