https://openalex.org/W1510707687,"A simple technique for the simultaneous measurement of relative levels of a specific mRNA in numerous small samples of animal cells or tissue is described. The technique involves denaturation of cytoplasmic preparations, followed by dotting of up to 96 samples onto a single sheet of nitrocellulose, hybridization with a 32P-labeled cDNA plasmid, autoradiography, and scanning. By analyzing cytoplasmic preparations instead of purified RNA, manipulations of multiple samples prior to analysis is minimized. Experiments with a clonal line of rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells showed that this technique can be employed to follow the induction by Ca2+ of prolactin mRNA sequences, employing cytoplasm prepared from as little as 2.5 x 10(4) cells. The specificity of the technique for prolactin mRNA was shown by employing GC cells, a GH3 cell variant lacking detectable prolactin mRNA sequences. Experiments with cultured rat hemipituitaries showed that the prolactin mRNA present in cytoplasm corresponding to as little as 1/100 of a pituitary could be readily detected. This technique is quite simple, requires very small amounts of cells or tissue, and permits the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples. Hence, it should be quite useful for studies with various experimental systems of the regulation of specific mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2035215935,The antineoplastic agent adriamycin was coupled to an insoluble agarose support. This material was actively cytotoxic to L1210 cells in culture under conditions in which no free adriamycin could enter the cell. It is concluded that an agent whose principal target was previously thought to be DNA can exert its cytotoxic action solely by interaction at the cell surface.

The increase was greater to the left hemisphere for a verbal task and greater to the right hemisphere for a spatial task. The direction and degree of hemispheric flow asymmetry were influenced by sex and handedness, females having a higher rate of blood flow per unit weight of brain, and females and left-handers having a greater percentage of fast-clearing tissue, presumably gray matter."
https://openalex.org/W1976023763,"When the Y chromosome from Mus poschiavinus (YPOS) is transferred onto the C57BL/6J genome, XY individuals develop as females with two ovaries, or as hermaphrodites. No XY individual develops normal testes. Although C57BL/6J-YPOS XY females are rarely fertile, most hermaphrodites with normal male genitalia sire offspring. Thus, the Mus poschiavinus Y chromosome carries a form of the Y-linked testis-determining locus different from that present in the C57BL/6J inbred strain. This gene interacts abnormally with autosomal or X-linked testis-determining loci of the C57BL/6J genome to prevent normal testicular differentiation. Divergence of the Y-linked testis-determining gene may be involved in mammalian speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2031001883,"A horseradish peroxidase technique was used to trace the peripheral terminations of two types of ganglion cells in adult cats. It was found that large, usually bipolar ganglion cells end on inner hair cells and small, usually pseudomonopolar ganglion cells end on outer hair cells. Thus, a virtually complete segregation of afferent neural inputs from the two types of hair cells was directly confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W1510702873,"A symbiotically important gene system in rhizobial species is the heme biosynthetic pathway. A mutant having reduced levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the first unique enzyme in this pathway, was obtained in Rhizobium meliloti 102F34 by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. Enzyme activity ranged from 3-13% of the wild type. Alfalfa plants inoculated with the Rhizobium synthetase mutant grew no better than uninoculated controls and formed only small white nodules which had no acetylene-reducing capacity. A cloned segment of Rhizobium genomic DNA capable of complementing this lesion was identified in a previously described gene bank from R. meliloti prepared with the broad host range plasmid cloning vector pRK290 (Ditta. G., Stanfield, S., Corbin, D., and Helinski, D. R. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 7347-7351). Symbiotic effectiveness could be restored in the mutant by supplementing plants with exogenous delta-aminolevulinic acid or by introducing into the mutant the wild type delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase gene cloned into the pRK290 plasmid. The recombinant plasmid carrying the synthetase gene was also able to weakly complement an Escherichia coli hemA mutant. Transposon mutagenesis of this plasmid with Tn5 further localized the delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase gene to a 1.4-kilobase region contained within a 4-6-kilobase Bam HI fragment. Full complementation of hemA was observed when this fragment was subcloned under E. coli trp and Tet promoter control on a pBR322 replicon. A temperature-sensitive mutant of this latter plasmid, which was unable to complement hemA at high temperature, produced enzyme having temperature-sensitive synthetase activity in vitro. This result confirmed that the cloned complementing DNA contained the structural gene for delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase and not a biosynthetic regulatory gene."

https://openalex.org/W2084928785,"DNAs from nitrosoethylurea-induced rat neuroblastomas transform NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts in a transfection assay. DNAs of such transformed cells can be used in a subsequent cycle of transfection to generate secondary foci that contain virtually no foreign genetic material besides the sequences carrying the rat neuroblastoma transforming function. These secondary neuroblastoma transfectants were injected into young mice and grew out into fibrosarcomas. Sera from these mice were examined for reactivity with any proteins which were induced specifically by the neuroblastoma transforming sequence. These sera precipitate a polypeptide of about 185,000 daltons from 35S-methionine-labeled cell lysates of the rat neuroblastoma cells that served as DNA donors and in all transfection-derived primary and secondary foci. This protein is present in high levels in all neuroblastoma transfectant clones, but was not detectable in a variety of other transformed cells. Antisera were prepared from mice bearing tumors induced by transformed cells derived by transfection of DNAs from various tumor cell types unrelated to rat neuroblastoma. These antisera failed to immunoprecipitate the 185,000 dalton protein. These data indicate that the synthesis of the 185,000 dalton protein is specifically induced by the neuroblastoma transforming sequence. The protein may be encoded by the transforming sequence and may mediate transformation in this chemically induced tumor."

Opioid, but not nonopioid, stress analgesia is reduced by adrenal demedullation and denervation and is potentiated by reserpine, a drug known to increase concentrations of adrenal medullary enkephalin-like peptides. It is suggested that adrenal enkephalins mediate opioid stress analgesia."

https://openalex.org/W2046382661,"Controlled drinking has recently become a controversial alternative to abstinence as an appropriate treatment goal for alcoholics. In this study we reexamine the evidence underlying a widely cited report by Sobell and Sobell of successful controlled drinking by a substantial proportion of gamma (physically dependent) alcoholic subjects in a behavior therapy experiment. A review of the evidence, including official records and new interviews, reveals that most subjects trained to do controlled drinking failed from the outset to drink safely. The majority were rehospitalized for alcoholism treatment within a year after their discharge from the research project. A 10-year follow-up (extended through 1981) of the original 20 experimental subjects shows that only one, who apparently had not experienced physical withdrawal symptoms, maintained a pattern of controlled drinking; eight continued to drink excessively--regularly or intermittently--despite repeated damaging consequences; six abandoned their efforts to engage in controlled drinking and became abstinent; four died from alcohol-related causes; and one, certified about a year after discharge from the research project as gravely disabled because of drinking, was missing."
https://openalex.org/W2076982114,The rat hippocampal formation was tested for the presence of factors that would accelerate neurite extension from chick parasympathetic (ciliary ganglion) or sympathetic (lumbar chain) neurons in vitro. Two growth factors were identified in extracts of this brain region. One accelerated neurite extension from sympathetic neurons and was blocked by antiserum to nerve growth factor. The other accelerated neurite extension from parasympathetic neurons but was not affected by the antiserum. These results suggest that specific growth factors account for the specificity of neuronal sprouting.

Hypoxic EMT6 tumor cells were similarly sensitized in vivo. The action of diethyl maleate is synergistic with the effect of the electron-affinic radiosensitizer misonidazole, suggesting that the effectiveness of misonidazole in cancer radiotherapy may be improved by combining it with drugs that deplete intracellular glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1988612368,"Spinal cord damage in neonatal cats has different effects on different spinal pathways. Corticospinal projections exhibit anatomical plasticity, forming an aberrant pathway that bypasses the lesion. In contrast, brainstem-spinal pathways undergo massive retrograde degeneration. Neither of these responses occurs in adult cats. Sparing of motor function is found in cats operated on as neonates but not in cats operated on as adults, and appears to depend on the plasticity of the corticospinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W2032738399,"Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) opens the blood-brain barrier of mice to the enzymatic tracer horseradish peroxidase. A single injection of horseradish peroxidase in 10 to 15 percent DMSO into the tail vein along with 10 to 15 percent DMSO delivered intraperitoneally allowed horseradish peroxidase to fill the extracellular clefts throughout the brain within 2 hours. In the absence of DMSO, peroxidase failed to enter brain parenchyma except through the circumventricular organs. Opening of the blood-brain barrier by DMSO is reversible. Dimethyl sulfoxide stimulated the pinocytosis of horseradish peroxidase by the cerebral endothelium; the peroxidase was then directed to lysosomal dense bodies for degradation. Vesicular transport of horseradish peroxidase from the luminal to the abluminal wall of the endothelial cell was not observed. Dimethyl sulfoxide did not alter the morphology of endothelial cells or brain parenchyma."
https://openalex.org/W2040146184,"Cadmium chloride, administered intratracheally to golden Syrian hamsters, causes an acute lung injury which evolves into a lesion with functional and morphological features of diffuse fibrosis. With simultaneous feeding of a lathyrogen, beta-aminoproprionitrile, this same injury evolves into functional and morphological changes of bullous emphysema. These results suggest that the same lung injury might result in either fibrosis or emphysema, connective tissue synthesis during the healing phase being the critical determinant."

https://openalex.org/W1494427387,"In order to learn at what stage the disulfide bonds of albumin are formed during its biosynthesis, we perfused rat livers with iodoacetamide and then isolated the intracellular precursor, proalbumin, from organelles known to be in the pathway of albumin synthesis and secretion. The alkylated cysteines in proalbumin were determined as a measure of its thiol groups in vivo. Proalbumin of smooth microsomes was found to contain a single thiol, which is proposed to be the noncoupling cysteine occurring residue 34 in circulating albumin. Proalbumin in rough microsomes contained an average of two cysteines; the additional cysteine thiol was largely situated in the COOH-terminal region and disappeared rapidly after blocking albumin synthesis with cycloheximide. In nascent chains of proalbumin, about 45% of the cysteine + cystine was in the thiol form. From these findings we propose that disulfide bond formation begins while the nascent chain is still attached to the ribosome and proceeds in an NH2 to COOH direction. The disulfide bonding apparently is completed into the endoplasmic reticulum. Possible intermediates in the process such as mixed disulfide forms of proalbumin with glutathione or cystamine were not detected. We suggest that cysteine-34 does not participate in disulfide bonding because the NH2 terminus of proalbumin remains loosely bound to the membrane, attached by a hydrophobic segment of the chain at residues 21-27."
https://openalex.org/W2048630112,"We obtained a regressing-tumor antiserum specific for the unique sequence of the transforming protein P140 of Fujinami sarcoma virus by injecting Fischer rats with syngeneic embryo cells transformed with Fujinami sarcoma virus. This serum is capable of immunoprecipitating a protein of 98,000 daltons from cell extracts of normal, uninfected chicken bone marrow cells. This normal cellular protein (NCP98) was shown to be structurally related to P140, sharing the majority of 35S-methionine-labeled tryptic peptides with the viral gene product P140. NCP98 is a phosphoprotein in vivo, with an associated in vitro protein kinase activity, capable of phosphorylating specifically at tyrosine residues of NCP98 itself and alpha-casein, an externally added substrate. This kinase activity is biochemically indistinguishable from the kinase activity associated with P140 by all criteria tested. Moreover, in vitro-phosphorylated NCP98 and P140 shared the same phosphopeptides. The expression of NCP98 is tissue-specific. It is readily detectable in bone marrow cells and detectable to a lesser extent in liver and lung cells from 6--18 day old chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2007653337,"Chicken bone marrow cells infected in vitro with a temperature-sensitive avian erythroblastosis virus fail to produce hemoglobin at 36°C. When the product or products of the transforming gene (erb) are inactivated by a temperature shift to 42°C in culture, several different cloned lines of cells infected with the temperature-sensitive avian erythroblastosis virus begin to make hemoglobin. This shift in phenotype correlates with an increase in hemoglobin mRNA specific to both adult and embryonic α and β globin. The switch is accompanied by the acquisition of DNAase I-hypersensitive sites in one cell line (clone 2); however, a hypothetically more mature line (clone 3) has already acquired globin DNAase-hypersensitive sites but does not express hemoglobin until the temperature shift. Several (but not all) specific restriction sites associated with both the α and β domains become unmethylated after the switch from 36°C to 42°C. The magnitude of these methylation switches is small compared with changes that occur in these genes during normal avian erythropoiesis. The results suggest that changes in chromosomal structure precede transcription and are not a consequence of transcription. Since (presumptive) precursor cloned lines can be established with some, but not all, of the structural properties of active globin chromatin, it is likely that many of these properties can be independently established and are not obligatorily related."

https://openalex.org/W1532171984,"Alkyldihydroxyacetone-P (alkyl-DHAP) synthase, the enzyme that forms the ether linkage of alkyl and alk-1-enyl glycerolipids, has been solubilized from ehrlich ascites cell microsomes using Triton X-100 and acetone precipitation. the solubilized enzyme, which is stabilized by glycerol or ethylene glycol, was then purified further by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, QAE-Sephadex, Matrex Red, and hydroxylapatite with the aid of a new rapid assay method using DEAE-cellulose disks. Four enzymes involved in the metabolism of acyl-DHAP and alkyl-DHAP (acyl-DHAP/alkyl-DHAP oxidoreductase, DHAP acyltransferase, alkyl-DHAP phosphohydrolase, and a dinitrofluorobenzene-insensitive acyl-DHAP acylhydrolase) are removed under these conditions along with endogenous fatty acids and fatty alcohols. Two other activities copurify with the alkyl-DHAP synthase forward reaction: an acyl exchange reaction, in which [1-14C]palmitic acid is incorporated into palmitoyl-DHAP, and an alkyl exchange reaction, in which [1-14C]hexadecanol is incorporated into hexadecyl-DHAP. Exchange reactions of this type are characteristic properties of a ping-pong mechanism but not a sequential mechanism. This is confirmed by documentation that palmitic acid is a competitive inhibitor with respect to hexadecanol. In addition, low levels of palmitoyl-DHAP (less than 100 microM) show competitive inhibition with respect to hexadecanol, possibly due to palmitic acid formed from palmitoyl-DHAP by alkyl-DHAP synthase under these conditions. Based on the observations presented here and previously, a molecular mechanism for alkyl-DHAP synthase is proposed."

The apparent molecular weight was determined to be 30,000 by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. This molecular weight differs from that previously reported for cytochrome b561 purified by other procedures. The granule cytochrome was compared to mitochondrial cytochrome b and, in spite of similar molecular weights and optical spectra, these two proteins were found to be different by the following criteria: 1) amino acid composition, 2) NH2-terminal analysis, 3) interaction with antimycin, and 4) reduction with durohydroquinone."
https://openalex.org/W1532590572,"Electrogenic Na+ gradient-stimulated active accumulation of alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside was demonstrated using apical membrane vesicles isolated from an established kidney epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1). Apical membrane vesicles were purified from densely confluent cell cultures after cell disruption by nitrogen cavitation using a rapid Mg2+ differential precipitation procedure. Such preparations were 11-fold enriched in apical-specific enzyme markers, were not enriched in basolateral-specific markers, and were relatively free from contamination by intracellular membranes. Sugar accumulated within vesicles was sensitive to osmotic pressure differences across the membrane. alpha-Methyl-D-glucopyranoside transport activity in vesicles exhibited similar hexose specificities and sensitivity to inhibition by phlorizin to the corresponding transport system expressed in intact LLC-PK1 cells and in kidney proximal tubule. Vesicles prepared from subconfluent cultures, which have not yet developed the expression of this transport system, had diminished Na+-stimulated sugar transport activity yet expressed Na+-stimulated amino acid transport activity. Active accumulation as a function of increasing Na+ gradient and an interior-negative membrane potential suggested a stoichiometry between sugar and Na+ uptake of 1:2, respectively. Experimental generation of interior-negative membrane potentials in vesicles produced a further stimulation of sugar accumulation, consistent with an additive contribution from both a Na+ chemical gradient and an electrical membrane potential in energizing active sugar transport."

https://openalex.org/W1675820479,"Bile acid-CoA:glycine/taurine N-acetyltransferase from bovine liver was analyzed for its ability to conjugate a variety of different bile acid-CoA analogues. A complete steady state bisubstrate kinetic analysis was conducted for each analogue. The enzyme demonstrated strict specificity for the normal 4-substituted pentanoic acid side chain; shortening the side chain by 1 methylene group (norcholyl-CoA) completely eliminates enzymatic activity, and extending the side chain by 1 methylene group (homocholyl-CoA) causes a 30-fold decrease in activity at Vmax. These effects of side chain modification were not related to decreased binding affinity as much as to decreases in the rates of the bond-breaking and bond-making steps. Bile acid-CoA analogues with a variety of ring substitutions involving keto and hydroxyl groups were also examined. Varying the position of substitution and the nature of the substituent had major effects on both the Km and Vmax terms. The analogues with the highest activities at Vmax were 7-dehydrocholyl-CoA and the allo bile acid 5 alpha,6-ketolithocholyl-CoA. However, in both cases, the high activity is obtained at the expense of binding energy. The most efficient substrates were 7-ketolithocholyl-CoA and 3-dehydrocholyl-CoA. The more common analogue, chenodeoxycholyl-CoA, was a surprisingly inefficient substrate. The relative rates of formation of glycine versus taurine conjugates were also found to vary with changes in structure. This indicates that certain bile acids are more likely to be conjugated with taurine, and others with glycine."
https://openalex.org/W2066308290,"The input-output properties of interneurons mediating spinal reflexes were investigated by extracellularly recording the response of interneurons to excitation from muscle receptors in the ankle extensor muscles of decerebrated, spinal cats. A population of interneurons in the intermediate region of the spinal cord is potently excited by increases in muscle force. Unlike the discharge of Golgi tendon organs, which accurately encodes moment-to-moment variations in the force of a single muscle, the discharge of these interneurons depends in a dynamic and usually nonlinear way on the force in several muscles. Powerful input from unidentified mechanoreceptors in muscle, presumably free nerve endings, is at least partly responsible for these properties. These force-sensitive interneurons are more likely to mediate clasp knife-type inhibition than simple negative force feedback."
https://openalex.org/W1537933937,"The influence of various fatty acids of 14-18 carbon chain lengths on the binding of calcium to human serum albumin was studied. The cis-unsaturated fatty acids (myristoleic, palmitoleic, oleic, and linoleic) caused a much larger increase in the affinity and maximum binding of calcium for albumin than did saturated fatty acids (myristic, palmitic, and stearic). For the unsaturated fatty acids, the influence on calcium-albumin binding increased as the degree of unsaturation increased or the chain length decreased. With oleic or linoleic acid, increases in calcium binding were observed at approximately 2-3 mol of fatty acid/mol of albumin, while for myristic, palmitic, or elaidic acid, concentrations of 5-7 fatty acids/mol of albumin were required. The maximum fluorescence emission of albumin was found to change in parallel with the calcium binding for oleic, palmitic, and elaidic acids. We conclude that 1) cis-unsaturated and saturated or trans-unsaturated fatty acids have very different effects on the binding of calcium to human albumin, 2) the alteration in calcium binding is likely due to a conformational change in the albumin molecule, and 3) changes in calcium binding to albumin are observed at levels of cis-unsaturated fatty acids which are obtainable in vivo."

When the serosal surface is stimulated with carbachol in vitro, serotonin is secreted on the serosal side but not the mucosal side. Carbachol added to the luminal side is ineffective. Atropine but not hexamethonium blocks the effect of carbachol. Acetylcholine on the serosal surface also stimulates serotonin release on the serosal side. These findings indicate that enterochromaffin cells possess on their serosal surfaces muscarinic receptors that mediate vectorial release of serotonin when activated by cholinergic agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1503431398,"In an effort to stimulate the in vivo formation of active enzyme from newly synthesized polypeptide chains, we have studied the in vitro assembly of the active catalytic subunits of aspartate transcarbamoylase from unfolded polypeptide chains. Hydrodynamic and spectroscopic measurements showed that incubating the catalytic trimers in 4.7 M urea for 45 min at 9 degrees C produced unfolded polypeptide chains largely devoid of the secondary and tertiary structures characteristic of native subunits. Dilution of the urea solutions led to the slow restoration of enzyme activity and the formation of trimers at a rate which could be measured quantitatively by a hybridization technique using succinylated polypeptide chains as a chase to stop the assembly. Kinetic studies showed that reactivation and assembly of trimers were coincident with a half-time for completion of about 50 min at 0 degrees C. Also, the rate-limiting reaction was first order. Although these results suggest that chain folding is the slow process, spectroscopic studies indicated that large changes in the environments of the aromatic amino acid residues occur very rapidly. Indeed the changes in the absorption spectrum are largely complete before significant reactivation and trimer formation occur. The results are consistent with an assembly mechanism in which the first step is the rapid collapse of the expanded randomly coiled chains to give partially folded monomers. These monomers are not enzymically active and cannot associate to form trimers until a rate-limiting conformational change occurs. Subsequent to this slow process, the competent monomers associate via a series of reactions to form active trimers."

Unfractionated proteoglycan and proteoglycan fractions with low affinity and high affinity separated on antithrombin III-agarose were treated with alkali, releasing heparin chains (Mr congruent to 1 x 10(5)). Each chain preparation was fractionated on antithrombin III-agarose into fractions with low affinity and high affinity. Unfractionated proteoglycan and proteoglycan fractions with low affinity and high affinity were incubated with rat serum at pH 6.0, which gave products of similar size to commercial heparins (Mr congruent to 1 x 10(4)) termed heparin fragments. Each fragment preparation was fractionated on antithrombin III-agarose, yielding fractions with no affinity, low affinity, and high affinity, 40% of the proteoglycan preparation had low affinity, containing 4% high affinity chains and 7% high affinity fragments. The high affinity proteoglycan fraction yielded 40% high affinity chains and 22% high affinity fragments. The data show that the distribution of binding sites with high affinity for antithrombin III in heparin proteoglycans is highly asymmetric. Therefore, the concept that polymer modification reactions occurring during heparin biosynthesis, which must be involved in the formation of high affinity binding sites, occur in a random way must be reappraised."

We found that C9 molecules in the complex can be covalently crosslinked (disulfide-linked) by glutathione. In this experiment, the tetramolecular C5b-8 complex bound to phospholipid vesicles was first prepared from purified C5b-6, incubated (37 degrees C, 20 min) with an excess of 131I-C9 in the presence of 1 mM glutathione; an average of 5.3 molecules of C9 per C5b-8 were bound and the C5b-9 complex formed was predominantly a dimeric C5b-9 complex. About one-third of C9 in this C5b-9 complex was found to be in a disulfide-linked dimeric form. The C5b-9 complex, having only an average of 0.9 molecules of C9 per C5b-8, was also prepared in the presence of glutathione; this C5b-9 preparation contained both monomeric and dimeric C5b-9 complexes, and about one-fifth of the C9 subunits was in a cross-linked dimeric form. By contrast, C9 in the absence of the C5b-8 complex was not significantly cross-linked by glutathione.

Blood pressure differences between females given antiserum and females given saline disappeared during and following pregnancy. The antiserum also lowered the concentration of prolactin in plasma 49 percent in males and decreased the prolactin response to ether stress in both sexes. These results suggest that endogenous prolactin is involved in blood pressure regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1976271554,Two families were studied in which the same homolog of chromosome pair 10 expressed both the fragile sites on the long (q) arm at 10q23 and 10q25. Recombination between the fragile sites was observed in 3 of the 27 offspring in whom it could occur. The genetic length of chromosome between the fragile sites was 11 female centimorgans within a 95 percent probability interval of 4 to 28 centimorgans. This estimate of genetic length is comparable to those obtained with other methods.
https://openalex.org/W1510863562,"The NH2-terminal extension fragment (Col 1) of the pro alpha 1(I) procollagen chain selectively inhibits the translation of procollagen mRNA in a reticulocyte lysate system, whereas the reduced and alkylated fragment (AE-Col 1) and its proteolytically derived peptides inhibit the translation of all mRNAs (Horlein, D., McPherson, J., Goh, S. H., and Bornstein, P. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 6163-6167). The latter inhibitory function, which occurs at the level of polypeptide chain initiation, has now been shown to be associated with an increase in phosphorylation of an Mr = 94,000 protein. The time span required for observation of changes in phosphorylation and in inhibition of protein synthesis is similar. Since AE-Col 1 can serve as a substrate for casein kinase II, we suggest that phosphorylation of AE-Col 1 and its derivatives may be required for their activity."
https://openalex.org/W1567240998,"We report static and dynamic light scattering analysis on subpopulations of proteoglycan monomer isolated in milligram quantities from chick limb bud mesenchymal cell cultures by gel fractionation in dissociative solvent conditions. These experiments furnish information on radius of gyration, Rg, and hydrodynamic radius, Rh, as a function of molecular weight, Mr,w. A comparison of these quantities, rho = Rg/Rh, indicates a decrease in branch frequency with decreasing Mr,w. This is consistent with the known result that decreasing molecular weight is due to a decrease in the number of polysaccharide side chains attached to a constant protein core length. These results show that photon correlation spectroscopy can be used to monitor structural changes in macromolecules isolated from these cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1481702559,"Abstract The fractionation of gizzard tropomyosin from 17-day-old chick embryos by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels indicates that this protein is composed of three different polypeptides that were designated as alpha, beta, and gamma. Each one of these polypeptides is resolved into two components with different isoelectric points when tropomyosin is fractionated by two-dimensional electrophoresis; the major components were designated as tropomyosins alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma 1 and the minor ones as tropomyosins alpha 2, beta 2, and gamma 2. The results of in vitro translation of gizzard RNA indicate that only tropomyosins alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma 1 are synthesized in the cell-free system. A partial separation of the mRNAs coding for tropomyosins alpha 1 and gamma 1 was obtained by fractionation of gizzard RNA by zonal centrifugation in sucrose gradients. Altogether these results indicate that in gizzard tissue from 17-day-old chick embryos three genes coding for different forms of tropomyosin are expressed."

Transfection experiments should help to clarify these questions and to determine what fraction of the class I genes are pseudogenes. Obviously some of the class I genes may encode differentiation antigens in addition to the TL and Qa antigens that, accordingly, may have been difficult to detect by conventional serological approaches. There is a possibility that the genes for class I molecules may employ alternative RNA-splicing patterns to generate two or more polypeptides from the same gene, as is seen with the heavy-chain genes for immunoglobulins, which generate the membrane and secreted molecules by a similar mechanism. Several indirect lines of evidence suggest that the multiple exons and introns encoding the cytoplasmic domain may be involved in alternative RNA-splicing patterns that would result in the synthesis of distinct transplantation antigens with the same external domains and different cytoplasmic domains (Steinmetz et al., Cell 25, 683-692, 1981)."
