https://openalex.org/W2010332067,"Cryptosporidium species cause acute gastroenteritis and diarrhoea worldwide. They are members of the Apicomplexa—protozoan pathogens that invade host cells by using a specialized apical complex and are usually transmitted by an invertebrate vector or intermediate host. In contrast to other Apicomplexans, Cryptosporidium is transmitted by ingestion of oocysts and completes its life cycle in a single host. No therapy is available, and control focuses on eliminating oocysts in water supplies1. Two species, C. hominis and C. parvum, which differ in host range, genotype and pathogenicity, are most relevant to humans1,2,3. C. hominis is restricted to humans, whereas C. parvum also infects other mammals2. Here we describe the eight-chromosome ∼9.2-million-base genome of C. hominis2. The complement of C. hominis protein-coding genes shows a striking concordance with the requirements imposed by the environmental niches the parasite inhabits. Energy metabolism is largely from glycolysis. Both aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms are available, the former requiring an alternative electron transport system in a simplified mitochondrion. Biosynthesis capabilities are limited, explaining an extensive array of transporters. Evidence of an apicoplast is absent, but genes associated with apical complex organelles are present. C. hominis and C. parvum exhibit very similar gene complements, and phenotypic differences between these parasites must be due to subtle sequence divergence."

Molecular chaperones, because of their properties in protein quality control, afford conformational flexibility to proteins and serve to integrate stress-signaling events that influence aging and a range of diseases including cancer, cystic fibrosis, amyloidoses, and neurodegenerative diseases. We describe here characteristics of celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene and an active component from Chinese herbal medicine identified in a screen of bioactive small molecules that activates the human heat shock response. From a structure/function examination, the celastrol structure is remarkably specific and activates heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) with kinetics similar to those of heat stress, as determined by the induction of HSF1 DNA binding, hyperphosphorylation of HSF1, and expression of chaperone genes. Celastrol can activate heat shock gene transcription synergistically with other stresses and exhibits cytoprotection against subsequent exposures to other forms of lethal cell stress. These results suggest that celastrols exhibit promise as a new class of pharmacologically active regulators of the heat shock response.

Modulation of the heat shock response has gained attention as a potential therapeutic modality in human disease for cancer, ischemia-reperfusion, trauma, transplantation surgery, and diabetes and has been implicated in longevity and aging (1Morimoto R.I.

Consequently, the identification of pharmacologically active small molecules that influence the levels of molecular chaperones has gained some attention. Examples include sodium salicylate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which directly activate heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) 1The abbreviations used are: HSF1, heat shock transcription factor 1; Hsp, heat shock protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB.1The abbreviations used are: HSF1, heat shock transcription factor 1; Hsp, heat shock protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB.; the benzoquinones ansamycin, geldanamycin, and radicicol, which bind to and inhibit Hsp90 and activate a compensatory heat shock response; and inhibitors of the proteasome, which indirectly activate chaperone expression in response to an increased flux of proteins targeted for degradation (1Morimoto R.I.

Chaperones are central to many vital cellular functions, including protein folding, signal transduction, immunity, and apoptosis, and they have critical roles in protecting the cell against a wide range of physiological stressors. The regulation of the heat shock response, therefore, may be directly beneficial for a variety of diseases including those associated with aberrant cell growth, such as cancer, and those associated with damaged and misfolded proteins, such as the neurodegenerative diseases of aging.In response to a flux of misfolded proteins, mammalian cells induce the heat shock response as mediated by the stress-induced transcription factor HSF1. Under “normal” conditions of cell growth, the majority of HSF1 exists in a repressed state associated transiently with the molecular chaperones Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp40 and distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of human cells. Upon activation, HSF1 undergoes a multi-step process involving relocalization within the nucleus, oligomerization to a trimeric DNA-binding competent state, binding to heat shock promoter elements, and hyperphosphorylation at serine residues resulting in the coordinated elevated transcription of a large family of heat shock genes (1Morimoto R.I.

The high level of heat shock gene transcription, induced by heat stress, occurs rapidly and transiently and is autoregulated by molecular chaperones that feedback through HSF1 to attenuate transcription.To identify new lead compounds for the pharmacological treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, we participated together with a consortium of 26 laboratories to screen a library of Federal Drug Association-approved or biologically active drugs to identify small molecules that suppress properties associated with the expression of mutant Huntingtin and superoxide dismutase, respectively (18Abbott A. Nature. 2002; 417: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Heemskerk J. Tobin A.J. Bain L.J. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 494-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 283 positive small molecules identified in the primary screen were subsequently screened in human cells with an hsp70.1 promoter-luciferase reporter to establish whether any of these compounds increased expression of the inducible hsp70 promoter. Of the several positive compounds in our assay, one compound, celastrol, a natural product derived from the Celastraceae family of plants (20Chen B. Duan H. Takaishi Y. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 683-697Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Ngassapa O. Soejarto D.D. Pezzuto J.M. Farnsworth N.R. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was of particular interest because it was also identified independently in five laboratories using six different cell-based screens for Huntingtin aggregation and neurotoxicity. Extracts from the Celastraceae family of plants have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of fever, chills, joint pain, inflammation, edema, rheumatoid arthritis, and bacterial infection (22Li R.L. Shu D.F. Investigations and Clinical Applications of Trysterygium wilfordü hook F. China Science and Technology Press, Beijing, China1989Google Scholar, 23Gunatilaka A.A.L. Herz W. Kirby G.W. Moore R.E. Steglich W. Tamm C. Triterpenoid Quinonemethides and Related Compounds (Celastroids). Springer, Vienna1996Google Scholar).Here, we show that an important consequence of celastrol exposure is the induction of heat shock protein gene expression by activation of HSF1. Our analysis of synthetic celastrol analogs and other chemically related multi-ring compounds suggest that the activity of celastrol is highly dependent on its molecular structure. Celastrol treatment is cytoprotective against subsequent exposures to lethal stress in HeLa cells and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. We propose that a common mechanism for celastrol could be its effect on the expression of heat shock proteins including Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp27, which may be responsible for its cytoprotective properties.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture Conditions—Human HeLa, SH-SY5Y, and 293T cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. MCF7, BT474, and H157 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 5% CO2. The compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and added at the indicated concentrations and for the indicated times to the cells. Control cells were treated with an equivalent concentration of Me2SO. Heat shock was induced by submersion of cells in a prewarmed circulating water bath at 42 °C.Preparation of Chemical Reagents—Celastrol was obtained from the GAIA Chemical Corporation (Gaylordsville, CT), and derivatives and other multi-ring compounds were prepared as described in the supplemental text.Plasmid Constructs—The hsp70.1pr-luc construct was made by PCR amplifying the hsp70.1 promoter (-188 to +150, GenBank™ accession number M11717) from LSN-WT (24Williams G.T. McClanahan T.K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2574-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) using the 5′ primer (5′-CGGGATCCGAAGAGTCTGGAGAGTTCTG-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-CGGGATCCCCAGCTGAACGGTCTGGTTA-3′). Both primers contain BamHI sites. Purified PCR products were digested with BamHI and subcloned into BglII site of the pEGFP-N2 (CMVpr), for which the cytomegalovirus promoter was deleted using VspI and NheI sites. The luciferase gene was then subcloned from pRSLL/V (25Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Konings A.W. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to hsp70.1pr-luc using HindIII and SalI sites. The GAL4-HSF1 fusion construct contains GAL4 residues 1-147 and HSF1 residues 124-503 (26Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Transfection and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Transient transfections were performed with Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The hsp70.1pr-luc cell line was generated by transfecting HeLa cells with the hsp70.1pr-luciferase plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Colonies were selected for G418 resistance (600 μg/ml). The resistant colonies were then tested for the induction of luciferase expression 5 h after heat shock (15 min at 44 °C) or cadmium (20 μm) treatment, and the colony with the highest luciferase induction was selected for our studies.HSF1 Antibody—We have generated a new polyclonal antibody (HSF1 r2) against a murine glutathione S-transferase-HSF1 fusion protein that recognizes the various phosphorylated states of murine and human HSF1 with characteristics comparable with our previously published HSF1A antibody (27Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). For additional antibody information see Supplemental Fig. 1.Luciferase Assays—The cells were plated at 7.5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates 24 h before compound treatment. The indicated compounds, dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm, were diluted in medium and added at the indicated concentrations to the cells. Twenty-four hours after compound addition, the cells were harvested for luciferase activity using the Bright-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was quantified using a 96-well plate luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).Gel Mobility Shift Analysis—Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed as previously described (28Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled probe containing the proximal heat shock element from the human hsp70.1 gene promoter. The intensities of the shifted bands were quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Supershifts were performed by incubating 1 μl of polyclonal antibodies specific for HSF1 (27Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) with the whole cell extracts for 20 min at room temperature prior to the HSF-heat shock element binding reaction.Reverse Transcription-PCR—The cells were harvested, and RNA was generated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the reverse transcription reaction, PCR was performed using PCR primers specific for hsp70.1 and 18 S rRNA. The hsp70.1 primers were: 5′-AGAGCCGAGCCGACAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACCTTGCCGTGTTGGAA-3′ (reverse). The 18 S rRNA PCR primers were 5′-CGTCTGCCCTATCAACTTTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCCTTCCTTGGATGTGGTAG-3′ (reverse). PCRs were carried out for 25 cycles.Western Blot Analysis—Ten μg of whole cell extracts were run on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western analysis was performed with the Odyssey system (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE). For HSF1, the HSF1 r2 antibody was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. For Hsp70, a mouse monoclonal antibody to Hsp70 (4g4; Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO) was used at a dilution of 1:5,000. The anti-β-actin antibody (3103, Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) was used to verify equal protein loading.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions were performed essentially as described (29Beresford G.W. Boss J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The samples generated from HeLa-S3 cells (3 × 107) were immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of anti-HSF1 r2 (see Supplemental Fig. 1) at 4 °C overnight. Primers used for the hsp70.1 promoter were (forward) 5′-GGCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-AGCCTTGGGACAACGGGAG-3′. Primers used for the dihydrofolate reductase promoter were: 5′-GGCCTCGCCTGCACAAATAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGCAGAAATCAGCAACGGGC-3′ (reverse).Cytoprotection Analysis—The cells were pretreated with 3 μm celastrol for 1 h, washed three times and given fresh medium, and then recovered for 5 h prior to a 45 °C heat treatment for the indicated times. As a control, the cells were pretreated with a 42 °C heat shock for 1 h. The cells were then assayed for the percentage of cell death by trypan blue uptake 24 h later. Apoptotic cell death was detected by measuring the increase in cytoplasmic nucleosomes using the Cell Death Elisa Plus assay system (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSCelastrol Activation of a Heat Shock Promoter Is Chemically Selective—Celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene, was shown by our laboratory to induce expression of an hsp70.1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene stably integrated into HeLa cells as part of a screen performed by multiple laboratories to identify compounds with potential for treating neurodegenerative disease (18Abbott A. Nature. 2002; 417: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To establish the mechanism by which celastrol activates the heat shock response, we first characterized the EC50 of celastrol in HeLa cells stably expressing the hsp70.1 promoter-luciferase reporter (hsp70.1pr-luc) and determined an optimal concentration of 3 μm (Fig. 1A). Celastrol activates the hsp70 promoter reporter in diverse cell types to levels comparable with or greater than that obtained by heat shock (42 °C; data not shown) or treatment with other chemical stressors (CdCl2 treatment; data not shown). For example, induction of the hsp70.1pr-luc reporter of 10-fold or greater was observed in the human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and BT474, the human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cell line H157, and the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that celastrol can activate the hsp70 reporter independent of cell type.To test the chemical specificity of celastrol, we analyzed other celastrol derivatives (Fig. 2A, structures 1-9) and multiring compounds (Fig. 2B, structures 10-19). Our results show that in addition to celastrol (structure 1, 30-fold), celastrol methyl ester (structure 2, 9-fold) and dihydrocelastrol diacetate (structure 7, 28-fold) are also active at 3 μm, whereas celastrol butyl ester (structure 4) and dihydrocelastrol (structure 5) require a higher concentration for activity. By comparison, closely related chemical structures including celastrol benzyl ester (structure 3), pristimerol (structure 6), pristimerol diacetate (structure 8), and the triacetate of celastrol (structure 9) were inactive at all concentrations tested for induction of the hsp70.1 promoter reporter. To further examine the selectivity exhibited by celastrol, we tested other multi-ring compounds in a concentration range of 1-10 μm, including various quinonemethides, anthrones, and anthraquinones, for activation of the heat shock response and found none of them to be active (Fig. 2B). Therefore, our results reveal that the activity of celastrol is highly selective, because only celastrol and a small number of celastrol derivatives can activate the hsp70.1pr-luc reporter. Because celastrol is the most potent of the small molecules tested, further analysis was performed with this compound.Fig. 2Celastrol activates a heat shock promoter reporter and this activity is specific to the structure of the molecule. A, structure-function analysis of celastrol. HeLa hsp70.1pr-luc cells were treated with either 3 or 8 μm of the indicated celastrol derivatives for 24 h prior to luciferase analysis. B, other multi-ring compounds do not activate the reporter in HeLa hsp70.1pr-luc cells. A variety of quinone methides, anthrones, anthraquinones, and other multi-ring compounds were tested for activation of the hsp70.1pr-luc reporter at concentrations (Conc) up to 10 μm. None of the compounds shown here (structures 10-19) were active.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Celastrol Induces HSF1 Activity—Stress-induced activation of the heat shock response is regulated by HSF1, which binds to the conserved heat shock element corresponding to reiterated inverted and adjacent arrays of the pentamer 5′-nGAAn-3′. To assess whether celastrol-dependent activation of the human hsp70 promoter was due to induction of HSF1 DNA binding-activity, we performed electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays using radiolabeled heat shock element-containing oligonucleotides. The results indicate that HSF1 DNA binding activity is induced within 10 min of exposure to celastrol and persists through to the last time point assayed of 240 min (Fig. 3A, upper panel). It is of interest to note that the kinetics of HSF1 activation by celastrol and heat shock are similar (Fig. 3A). Because multiple phosphorylated states of HSF1 can exist with different activities (12Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 31Holmberg C.I. Hietakangas V.

Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we then examined the phosphorylation state of celastrol-induced HSF1. The different phosphorylated states of HSF1 are readily distinguished by their SDS-PAGE mobility; constitutively phosphorylated HSF1 migrates more rapidly than the stress-activated hyperphosphorylated HSF1. For both celastrol and heat shock treatments, the hyperphosphorylated HSF1 is detected by 30 min (Fig. 3A, lower panel). By 120 min, most of the HSF1 exists in the hyperphosphorylated state, as indicated by the band of higher mobility and the disappearance of the lower band. As has been observed previously, the time course of hyperphosphorylation lags behind the kinetics of HSF1 DNA binding (8Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Celastrol induces HSF1 DNA binding and hyperphosphorylation. A, upper panel, gel mobility shift analysis of whole cell extracts from HeLa cells treated with 3 μm celastrol or 42 °C heat shock for the indicated periods of time shows that both celastrol and heat shock can induce DNA binding. Supershift analysis shows that the induced DNA-protein complexes contain HSF1. Lower panel, 3 μm celastrol and 42 °C heat shock induce hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 in HeLa cells. The same whole cell extracts used for the gel shifts were analyzed by Western analysis for HSF1 hyperphosphorylation, as indicated by the more slowly migrating band. B, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed at the indicated time points show that both 3 μm celastrol and 42 °C heat shock induce HSF1 binding to the hsp70.1 promoter in vivo. Chromatin was cross-linked, harvested, and immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for HSF1. The samples were then analyzed by PCR with primers specific for the hsp70.1 promoter. The controls include input DNA before immunoprecipitation and a no antibody control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify the biological significance of celastrol treatment on HSF1 DNA binding activity in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to assess binding to the endogenous hsp70.1 promoter, a known downstream target. HeLa cells treated with either celastrol or heat shock for the indicated times were cross-linked and harvested, and chromatin was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody against human HSF1. PCR analysis using primers specific for the hsp70.1 promoter shows that both heat shock and celastrol induce HSF1 binding to the promoter in vivo with similar profiles over the time course of treatment (10-240 min; Fig. 3B). Specificity is indicated by the lack of HSF1 binding to the dihydrofolate reductase promoter by celastrol or heat shock treatment (data not shown).Mechanism of HSF1 Activation by Celastrol—To further examine the effect of celastrol on HSF1 activation, we made use of a GAL4-HSF1 fusion construct to directly test for an affect on the transactivation function of DNA-bound HSF1. In this construct, the HSF1 DNA-binding domain is replaced by the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, resulting in a chimeric HSF1 that binds DNA constitutively but is not fully active until exposed to heat shock or other stresses (26Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consequently, when transfected together with a GAL4-luciferase reporter, GAL4-HSF1 is activated upon heat shock (Fig. 4). Celastrol treatment has a similar effect on activation of the hsp70 promoter reporter (4.4-fold for heat shock and 5.5-fold for celastrol). Therefore, in addition to the induction of HSF1 DNA binding and hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 3), celastrol treatment induces the transcriptional activity of a chimeric GAL4-HSF1 that is constitutively bound to DNA.Fig. 4Celastrol functions through the activation domain of HSF1. 293T cells were transfected with a GAL4-luc reporter and a GAL4-HSF1 fusion construct. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 3 μm of celastrol (Cel) for 24 h or a 42 °C heat shock (HS) for 1 h followed by a 23-h recovery. The data are plotted as fold luciferase activation over the no treatment control. The experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A feature of modulators of the heat shock response is that certain stressors can have combinatorial synergy with heat stress (3Lee B.S.

Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2280-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether suboptimal levels of heat shock and celastrol could have a synergistic effect on endogenous HSF1. Whereas separate exposure to either a 41 °C heat shock or 1.5 μm celastrol does not fully activate the hsp70.1pr-luc construct (relative to a 42 °C heat shock), simultaneous exposure to both 1.5 μm celastrol and 41 °C resulted in maximal levels of hsp70 promoter activity (Fig. 5). From these results, we conclude that celastrol treatment can lower the temperature threshold required for the heat shock response.Fig. 5Celastrol can synergize with heat stress. HeLa hsp70.1pr-luc cells were treated with a 1-h heat shock at the indicated temperatures or with celastrol (Cel) at the indicated concentrations. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Celastrol Effects on Endogenous Heat Shock Gene Expression—We next wanted to test the effects of celastrol treatment on the expression of endogenous heat shock genes in both HeLa and the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. In HeLa cells, the Hsp70 protein levels induced by treatment with 3 μm celastrol (8 h) are similar to levels achieved following 42 °C heat shock (1 h followed by 7 h of recovery; Fig. 6). The accumulation of Hsp70 corresponded to an increase in the levels of hsp70.1 mRNA. Because the heat shock response is generally not as strong in neuronal cells as in HeLa cells, we also tested the neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y. Induction of Hsp70 protein and hsp70.1 mRNA is clearly observed in SH-SY5Y cells treated with either celastrol or heat shock, although the Hsp70 protein levels are lower than in HeLa cells (Fig. 6). Because Hsp40 can work together with Hsp70 as a cochaperone and Hsp27 has been implicated in protection from apoptosis, we tested whether these mRNAs were also induced. We found that celastrol, like heat shock, can induce these mRNAs as well (data not shown). Therefore, our results show that celastrol induces a “classical” heat shock response as indicated by increases in Hsp protein and mRNA expression levels.Fig. 6Celastrol induces Hsp70 protein and mRNA levels. A, Western analysis shows that treatment of HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells with 3 μm celastrol (Cel) induces Hsp70 protein expression to a similar extent as heat shock (HS). The cells were treated with 3 μm celastrol for 8 h prior to analysis. Heat shock was performed at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by recovery for 7 h. β-Actin was used as a loading control.

The underlying mechanisms were studied here in three transgenic mouse strains with identical genetic background, all expressing the tau-4R/2N isoform driven specifically in neurons by the thy1 gene promoter. Two strains, expressing human tau-4R/2N or mutant tau-4R/2N-P301L at similar, moderate levels, developed very different phenotypes. Tau-4R/2N mice became motor-impaired already around age 6–8 weeks, accompanied by axonopathy (dilatations, spheroids), but no tau aggregates, and surviving normally. In contrast, tau-P301L mice developed neurofibrillary tangles from age 6 months, without axonal dilatations and, despite only minor motor problems, all succumbing before the age of 13 months. The third strain, obtained by tau knock-out/knock-in (tau-KOKI), expressed normal levels of wild-type human tau-4R/2N replacing all mouse tau isoforms. Tau-KOKI mice survived normally with minor motor problems late in life and without any obvious pathology. Biochemically, a fraction of neuronal tau in aging tau-P301L mice was hyperphosphorylated concomitant with conformational changes and aggregation, but overall, tau-4R/2N was actually more phosphorylated than tau-P301L. Significantly, tau with changed conformation and with hyperphosphorylation colocalized in the same neurons in aging tau-P301L mice. Taken together, we conclude that excessive binding of tau-4R/2N as opposed to reduced binding of tau-P301L to microtubules is responsible for the development of axonopathy and tauopathy, respectively, in tau-4R/2N and tau-P301L mice and that the conformational change of tau-P301L is a major determinant in triggering the tauopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1991287841,"Histone modifications are thought to serve as epigenetic markers that mediate dynamic changes in chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression. As a model system for understanding epigenetic silencing, X chromosome inactivation has been previously linked to a number of histone modifications including methylation and hypoacetylation. In this study, we provide evidence that supports H2A ubiquitination as a novel epigenetic marker for the inactive X chromosome (Xi) and links H2A ubiquitination to initiation of X inactivation. We found that the H2A-K119 ubiquitin E3 ligase Ring1b, a Polycomb group protein, is enriched on Xi in female trophoblast stem (TS) cells as well as differentiating embryonic stem (ES) cells. Consistent with Ring1b mediating H2A ubiquitination, ubiquitinated H2A (ubH2A) is also enriched on the Xi of both TS and ES cells. We demonstrate that the enrichment of Ring1b and ubH2A on Xi is transient during TS and ES cell differentiation, suggesting that the Ring1b and ubH2A are involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Furthermore, we showed that the association of Ring1b and ubH2A with Xi is mitotically stable in non-differentiated TS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2153834943,"The brightness of type Ia supernovae, and their homogeneity as a class, makes them powerful tools in cosmology, yet little is known about the progenitor systems of these explosions. They are thought to arise when a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star, is compressed and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion1,2,3. Unless the companion star is another white dwarf (in which case it should be destroyed by the mass-transfer process itself), it should survive and show distinguishing properties. Tycho's supernova4,5 is one of only two type Ia supernovae observed in our Galaxy, and so provides an opportunity to address observationally the identification of the surviving companion. Here we report a survey of the central region of its remnant, around the position of the explosion, which excludes red giants as the mass donor of the exploding white dwarf. We found a type G0–G2 star, similar to our Sun in surface temperature and luminosity (but lower surface gravity), moving at more than three times the mean velocity of the stars at that distance, which appears to be the surviving companion of the supernova."

We previously found that the mt tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>, carrying the A8344G mutation from cells of patients with myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), lacks the τm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U modification. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a tRNA-modifying enzyme <i>MTU1</i> (mitochondrial tRNA-specific 2-thiouridylase 1) that is responsible for the 2-thiolation of the wobble position in human and yeast mt tRNAs. Disruption of the yeast <i>MTU1</i> gene eliminated the 2-thio modification of mt tRNAs and impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, which led to reduced respiratory activity. Furthermore, when <i>MTO1</i> or <i>MSS1</i>, which are responsible for the C5 substituent of the modified uridine, was disrupted along with <i>MTU1</i>, a much more severe reduction in mitochondrial activity was observed. Thus, the C5 and 2-thio modifications act synergistically in promoting efficient cognate codon decoding. Partial inactivation of <i>MTU1</i> in HeLa cells by small interference RNA also reduced their oxygen consumption and resulted in mitochondria with defective membrane potentials, which are similar phenotypic features observed in MERRF."

However, a convincing causal chain of events underlying the role of these collagen mutations in the pathogenesis of OA has not been elucidated. Here we show that the expression of a cell surface collagen receptor, discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), is increased in chondrocytes of the articular cartilage of knee joints in mice that develop OA as a result of a heterozygous mutation in type XI collagen. At the same time point, 6 months, we also found increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) in the mutant mouse knee cartilage. The expression of both DDR2 and MMP-13 was increased in chondrocytes cultured on plates coated with native type II collagen but not on gelatin, and overexpression of DDR2, but not of a truncated form, was found to induce the expression of MMP-13 when chondrocytes were cultured on type II collagen but not on plastic. The DDR2-induced expression of MMP-13 appears to be specific, since we did not observe induction of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-8, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and IL-1 transcripts in human chondrocytes or Mmp-3, Mmp-8, Adamts-4, Adamts-5, and Il-1 in mouse chondrocytes. Our data suggest that the defect in the cartilage matrix of mice that are heterozygous for a type XI collagen mutation (cho/+) permits activation and up-regulation of DDR2 in chondrocytes. This could be due to increased exposure of chondrocytes to type II collagen as a result of the decreased amount of type XI collagen in the mutant cartilage.

Although the causes of OA are diverse, mutations in cartilage specific collagen genes have been identified in human familial OA associated with a wide range of osteochondrodysplasia, from mild to lethal forms (4Spector T.D.

Mutations in genes encoding type IX collagen, COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3, cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and intervertebral disc disease in humans. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is a milder dysplasia of the epiphyses of peripheral joints that is characterized by cartilage degeneration resulting in early-onset OA. One of the clinical features of intervertebral disc disease is the degeneration of the articular cartilage of the discs. Interestingly, the amount of type IX collagen is reduced in aged people (11Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 376SCrossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), in whom there is high incidence of OA. In humans, mutations in genes for type XI collagen, COL11A1 and COL11A2, have also been identified in several forms of familial OA (12Spranger J. Pediatr. Radiol. 1998; 28: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A reduced amount of type XI collagen is also found in aged people (11Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 376SCrossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the OA due to these collagen mutations are largely unknown. We have used a mouse model of chondrodysplasia (cho) to investigate how mutations in type XI collagen cause an OA-like pathology. We found previously that the cho phenotype is due to a single nucleotide deletion leading to frameshift and premature termination of translation of the α1 chain of type XI collagen (13Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E.

Electron microscopy of the articular cartilage of knee joints in heterozygous mutant (cho/+) mice shows thick collagen fibrils (14Xu L. Flahiff C.M. Waldman B.A. Wu D. Olsen B.R. Setton L.A. Li Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2509-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which is one of the early clinical characteristics of human OA (15Weiss C. Fed. Proc. 1973; 32: 1459-1466PubMed Google Scholar). The cho/+ mice (homozygous cho/cho mice die at birth) reveal OA-like changes in their knee and temporomandibular joints, starting at the age of 3 months, without other apparent skeletal abnormalities (14Xu L. Flahiff C.M. Waldman B.A. Wu D. Olsen B.R. Setton L.A. Li Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2509-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have also found increased protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3, stromelysin) and MMP-13 (collagenase 3) in knee articular cartilage of cho/+ mice, which is consistent with a recent study of human OA cartilages (16Tetlow L.C. Adlam D.J. Woolley D.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Although a hereditary defect in type XI collagen is not responsible for most forms of human OA, disruption of matrix composition in cho/+ mice results in the loss of joint stability and associated biochemical alteration that mimics human OA. An additional advantage of the cho/+ mouse is that the degradation of joint structures occurs postnatally with gradual changes throughout the life span of the mouse. MMPs constitute a group of zinc-dependent proteinases that are involved in remodeling of extracellular matrices in most tissues. MMP-1 (collagenase-1) and MMP-8 (collagenase-2), as well as MMP-3 and MMP-13 function during cartilage development, postnatal growth, and homeostasis to cleave triplehelical type II collagen and degrade proteoglycans in articular cartilage (17Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z.

Aggrecanases, particularly ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) and ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase-2), are also important matrix-degrading proteinases in the cartilage matrix (19Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). All of these proteinases are expressed at relatively low levels in normal articular cartilage. However, a number of studies have demonstrated that expression of these enzymes is increased in localized regions of human OA articular cartilage and that MMP-13 may be a particularly critical enzyme in the degradation of type II collagen in articular cartilage (21Knauper V.

This is consistent with the OA-like changes in knee joints of mice that constitutively express MMP-13 in cartilage (23Neuhold L.A. Killar L. Zhao W. Sung M.A. Warner L. Kulik J. Turner J. Wu W.

Given the known ability of these enzymes to degrade major components of cartilage matrix, it is likely that their expression in chondrocytes is tightly regulated. The discoidin domain receptors 1 (DDR1) and 2 (DDR2) were identified in humans and mice as cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (24Di Marco E. Cutuli N. Guerra L. Cancedda R. De Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24290-24295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lai C. Gore M. Lemke G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2567-2578PubMed Google Scholar, 26Karn T. Holtrich U. Brauninger A. Bohme B.

The mRNA transcripts of the receptors are detected in several human and mouse tissues, such as bone, cartilage, skin, skeletal muscle, brain, and heart. Two research groups reported in 1997 that native collagens were the DDR ligands (28Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G.

Interestingly, a synthetic short triple-helical collagen-like peptide (10 repeat of Gly-Pro-Hyp) was not able to activate DDRs. Studies of Ddr1-deficient mice suggest that Ddr1 plays a key role in mammary gland development and arterial wound repair (30Vogel W. Aszodi A. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

Ddr2-deficient mice exhibit short stature and a delay in the healing of skin wounds (32Labrador J.P. Azcoitia V. Tuckermann J. Lin C. Olaso E. Mañes S. Brückner K. Goergen J. Lemke G.

Activation of DDR2 by type I collagen increases the level of MMP-1 in the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT 1080 (28Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of DDR2 is associated with overexpression of MMP-1 in synovial fibroblasts from rheumatoid arthritis patients (33Wang J. Lu H. Liu X. Deng Y. Sun T. Li F. Ji S. Nie S. Yao L. J. Autoimmun. 2002; 19: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because type XI collagen is an integral component of the type II collagen fibrils in cartilage, we reasoned that the cho mutation may result in a disruption of the collagen network in cartilage matrix and enhance the interaction between chondrocytes and type II collagen molecules. We report here that the expression of Ddr2, a cell surface receptor interacting specifically with native fibrillar collagen rather than with other matrix components such as fibronectin, proteoglycans, or cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is increased in the articular cartilage of knee joints in cho/+ mice. Studies in vitro indicate that up-regulation and activation of DDR2 by native type II collagen can specifically induce the expression of MMP-13 by chondrocytes. We also show that the increased expression of Ddr2 and Mmp-13 is associated with type II collagen degradation in adult cho/+ mice. Our data suggest a mechanism, involving Ddr2 signaling and increased expression of this receptor tyrosine kinase, for destruction of the collagen network in articular cartilage leading to the age-dependent and progressive OA-like pathology in cho/+ mouse joints. Analysis of Proteinase Activity in Extracts of Knee Articular Cartilage of cho/+ and Wild-type Mice—Articular cartilage samples were dissected from the knee joints of 12 cho/+ and 12 wild-type mice at the age of 3 or 6 months. We used an EnzChek gelatinase/collagenase assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) to assay for metalloproteinase activity (38Ricke W.A. Smith G.W. Reynolds L.P. Redmer D.A. Smith M.F. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The articular cartilage samples were pooled from 12 animals from cho/+ or wild-type mice at each age and homogenized in a buffer containing 100 mg (wet weight)/ml. 100 μl of the homogenates, 80 μl of 1× reaction buffer, and 20 μl of DQ gelatin solution were added to each well of a 96-well plate for the analysis. For a negative control, 100 μl of 1× reaction buffer instead of the homogenates, and for a standard curve plot, 100 μl of different enzyme dilutions at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 unit/ml instead of the homogenates, were added. Each homogenate was analyzed in triplicate. Fluorescence was measured using the LJL Analysts microplate reader with excitation at 485 ± 10 nm and emission detection at 530 ± 10 nm. Relative proteinase activity was calculated against the standard plot. Examination of mRNA Levels of Matrix-degrading Enzymes in Knee Articular Cartilages of cho/+ Mice—Knee articular cartilages from six cho/+ or six wild-type mice at the ages of 3 or 6 months were collected, and the cartilages from the cho/+ or wild-type littermates were pooled together for the isolation of total RNAs using the total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primer using the Super-Script first-strand synthesis system (Clontech). Real-time PCR conditions were optimized for maximal PCR efficiency by the adjustment of concentrations of the following PCR primers: Mmp-3, CCTACTTCTTTGTAGAGGAC (forward) and GTCAAATTCCAACTGCGAAG (reverse); Mmp-8, GTAAACTGTAGAGTCGATGC (forward) and CATAGGGTGCGTGCAAGGAC (reverse); Mmp-13, GTGTGGAGTTATGATGATGT (forward) and TGCGATTACTCCAGATACTG (reverse); Adamts-4, GCAACGCAGGGCAGAGATAC (forward) and CATCTGTGTTTTAGCAGGAG (reverse); Adamts-5, ACCGTGCAGTGCCAGGATGG (forward) and GGTGACAATGACATGAAGGC (reverse); Il-1, GAATCTATACCTGTCCTGTG (forward) and TTATGTCCTGACCACTGTTG (reverse); Gapdh, ACTGAGGACCAGGTTGTC (forward) and TGCTGTAGCCGTATTCATTG (reverse). Four different combinations of primers were tested, forward (nm)/reverse (nm): 200/200, 200/600, 600/200, and 600/600. The optimum concentrations of the primers for each gene were: Mmp-3, 200/200; Mmp-8, 200/600; Mmp-13, 600/600; Adamts-4, 200/200; Adamts-5, 200/200; Il-1, 200/200; and Gapdh, 200/200. PCR was performed using 25 μl of 1× PCR buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 nm dNTPs, each primer at 200 nm or 600 nm, 1× SYBR Green, 0.5 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen), and 0.5 μl of cDNA. Real-time PCR was performed using the Icycler iQ detection system (Bio-Rad), and the PCR reaction was carried out at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 4 min. At the end of the PCR cycles, a melting curve, using a temperature range between 55 and 95 °C with +0.5 °C intervals, was generated to test the specificity of the PCR product. A cDNA sample in each experiment was tested in triplicate and each experiment was performed twice. We used Gapdh as internal control. The efficiency of PCR represented by a standard curve was also tested by plotting the amount of PCR product versus the known amount of a template, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ng. In theory, when the slope of the standard curve is -3.322, the efficiency of PCR is considered 100%. In these experiments, the efficiency reached 90% or higher. Examination of Degraded Type II Collagen in Articular Cartilage of cho/+ Mice—Three knees from cho/+ or wild-type mice at the ages of 3 and 6 months were collected for cryosection. The samples were fix in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, followed by embedding in OCT for sectioning. Sections of 10 μm were cut and incubated with polyclonal antibody C1-2C (IBEX Tech. Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada), which recognizes the neoepitope in degraded type II collagen produced by collagenase cleavage. The samples were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for the color detection. A negative control, staining without primary antibody, was also performed. Transmission Electron Microscopy—A detailed experimental procedure has been described in the previous publication (14Xu L. Flahiff C.M. Waldman B.A. Wu D. Olsen B.R. Setton L.A. Li Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2509-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, two knee joints each from 1-month-old cho/+ mice and two knee joints each from their normal littermates were obtained. The articular cartilage of the joints was exposed, and specimens were fixed in Karnovsky's solution with 4% gluteraldehyde overnight at room temperature. The samples were then processed for ultra-thin (95 nm) sectioning. Ultra-thin sections from each sample were examined, and multiple locations in each section were randomly selected for photographs. Immunohistochemical Staining for Collagen Receptors—Immunohistochemical experiments were performed to characterize the expression of Ddr1, Ddr2, β1 integrin, and annexin V in the articular cartilage of knee joints from cho/+ and wild-type mice. Three knee joints from different cho/+ mice and three knee joints from different wild-type littermates at the ages of 3 or 6 months were used. The samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4° C and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections of 8 μm were cut from the medial side to the lateral side. From each joint, four sets of 12 evenly spaced paraffin sections were collected for staining. The sections were deparaffinized, quenched for endogenous peroxidase activity, and treated with hyaluronidase. One set of the sections was incubated with an antibody in PBS solution at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies, against human DDR1 (catalog number sc-7553), human DDR2 (catalog number sc-7554), human β1 integrin (catalog number sc-8978), and human annexin V (catalog number sc-8300) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used to analyze serial sections. The sections were washed with PBS three times followed by treatment with biotinylated secondary antibody. Color detection was performed with peroxidase substrate after incubation with a mixture of avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase. Staining without primary antibody was performed as a negative control. Analysis of Ddr2 mRNA Levels in Mouse Articular Cartilage—The experimental procedure was as described above using the following PCR primers for Ddr2, 5′-CTGTCGGATGAGCAGGTTAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGGCTCCTTGCTGAAGAA-3′ (reverse), at the concentration of 200 nm/200 nm. Chondrocyte Cultures—Primary costochondral chondrocytes were isolated from 2-week-old C57BL mice and cultured as described in a previous study (39Xu L. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Olsen B.R. Li Y. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The immortalized human chondrocyte cell line, C-28/I2, obtained after infection of juvenile costal chondrocytes with a neomycin-resistant retroviral vector encoding SV40 virus large T-antigen, selection in G418 and cloning (40Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (1/1, v/v; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passaged at a ratio of 1:8 at >95% confluence every 5 to 6 days. For preparation of culture plates, type II collagen from chicken sternal cartilage (catalog number C-9301, Sigma) was dissolved in 0.25% acetic acid at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and used to coat 6-well plates. We also prepared plates coated with denatured type II collagen (gelatin) and re-natured type II collagen as follows. The type II collagen solution (1 mg/ml) was heated at 70 °C for 45 min, and one-half of the denatured type II collagen was used to coat 6-well plates. The other half of the denatured collagen preparation was left at room temperature overnight to generate renatured type II collagen and then used for coating of 6-well plates. A portion (200 μl) of each sample, including native (commercial), denatured, and renatured type II collagens, was subjected to SDS-PAGE to confirm the quality of the preparation. For experiments, culture plates coated with the various collagen preparations and non-coated plates (controls) were seeded with either mouse or human chondrocytes. The cells were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1/1, v/v; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum for 12 or 24 h. For real-time PCR, cells from 3 wells for each experimental condition were pooled and collected for total RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis. The cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primer. PCR conditions were optimized by the adjustment of concentrations of the following PCR primers for each human gene (see above for mouse genes): DDR2, CTCCCAGAATTTGCTCCAG (forward) and GCCACATCTTTTCCTGAGA (reverse); MMP-1, GCCACAAAGTTGATGCAGTT (forward) and GCAGTTGAACCAGCTATTAG (reverse); MMP-3, ACTGTGATCCTGCTTTGTCC (forward) and ACGCCTGAAGGAAGAGATGG (reverse); MMP-8, GTTTTCCAGCAAGAACATTT (forward) and AACTTCCCTTCAACATTCTG (reverse); MMP-13, GCTGCCTTCCTCTTCTTGAG (forward) and TGCTGCATTCTCCTTCAGGA (reverse); ADAMTS-4, GCACCGAAGAGCACAGATTC (forward) and ATGAGGCAGCAACAGAAGC (reverse); ADAMTS-5, GAAGTTAGCAAAAGGATGTC (forward) and TTCTGTGCGTTAGGTAGACC (reverse); IL-1, CAACTGGTACATCGACACCT (forward) and GGGATTGAGTCCACATTCAG (reverse); GAPDH, TTCGACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCTT (forward) and CAGGCGCCCAATACGACCAAATC (reverse). The optimum concentrations of the primers for the genes were: DDR2, 200/200, MMP-1, 200/200; MMP-3, 200/200; MMP-8, 200/600; MMP-13, 600/600; ADAMTS-4, 600/200; ADAMTS-5, 200/200; IL-1, 200/200; and GAPDH, 200/200. The PCR was performed as described above. Transient Overexpression of Full-length and Truncated DDR2—To generate full-length cDNA of human DDR2, total RNA was isolated from the human chondrocyte C-28/I2 cell line. The cDNA was synthesized using the oligo(dT) primer. The primers for the PCR were designed according to the published human DDR2 sequence. The 5′-end of the forward primer was designed with a KpnI site, 5′-ggggtaccccagatgatcctgattccca-3′, and the 5′-end of the reverse primer was designed with an EcoRI site, 5′-ggaattccctgacagcatcactcgtc-3′. After amplification, the PCR product was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The truncated cDNA of DDR2, containing only the extracellular and transmembrane domains, was obtained using the following PCR primers, which were designed with BstXI sites at the 5′-ends: forward primer, 5′-ccaaaaaaatggatgatcctgattccca-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ccaaaaaaatggtgggctggactggcttcaca-3′. The sequences of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors containing either the full-length or the truncated human DDR2 were prepared and purified for transfection into chondrocytes using the EndoFree plasmid maxi-kit (Qiagen). Transient transfection experiments were carried out in human C-28/I2 cells using Lipofectamine PLUS™ Reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection in 6-well plates at 3.5 × 105 cells/well in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum. For each well, 200 ng of plasmid construct, 6 μl of PLUS reagent, and 92 μl of serum-free DMEM/F-12 were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (4 μl) in 100 μl of serum-free medium was then added to each reaction mixture, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the transfection mixture was combined with 800 μl of serum-free medium, and the lipid-nucleic acid complex was transferred to the washed cell monolayer in each well. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the transfection mix was diluted with an equal volume of DMEM/F-12 containing 20% fetal calf serum, and incubation was continued for 24 h to permit expression of the wild-type and truncated DDR2 cDNAs. The cells were then scraped and transferred to 6-well plates without or with coating with type II collagen and incubations were continued for 24 h. The levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 mRNA were examined by real-time PCR, and the PCR conditions were the same as those described above. GAPDH was used as internal control. Treatment of Chondrocyte Cultures with Protein Kinase Inhibitors—The C-28/I2 cells were cultured in type II collagen-coated 10-cm plates for 4 h allowing the cells to adhere. Protein kinase inhibitors were added as follows: 1) MEK inhibitor, PD98059 at 10 μm (from CALBIOCHEM); 2) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor, Wortmannin at 25 nm (from Calbiochem); and 3) JAK2 inhibitor, AG490 at 10 μm (from Calbiochem). No protein kinase inhibitor was added to control cultures. Incubations were carried out for 24 h, and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and harvested for RNA extraction. Age-related Increase in Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity in Articular Cartilage of Knee Joints in cho/+ Mice—To determine whether the age-related articular cartilage destruction that we previously observed in cho/+ mice was associated with increased activities of cartilage-degrading proteinases, we analyzed metalloproteinase activity in extracts of articular cartilage from knee joints. Using a fluorescent substrate to detect combined collagenase/gelatinase activity, we found that metalloproteinase activity was increased about 2-fold at the age of 3 months in cho/+ mouse articular cartilage compared with cartilage from wild-type littermates (Fig. 1, left panel). At the age of 6 months, metalloproteinase activity was increased about 6-fold in articular cartilage of cho/+ mice compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 1, right panel). These results indicate that the age-related articular cartilage destruction observed in cho/+ mice is associated with increased metalloproteinase activity. Age-related Increase of Mmp-13 mRNA Level in Articular Cartilage of cho/+ Mice—To determine more specifically which matrix-degrading enzymes are up-regulated in the articular cartilage of knee joints in cho/+ mice, we examined the levels of Mmp-3, Mmp-8, Mmp-13, Adamts-4, an"
https://openalex.org/W1992939453,"The human cell surface receptors DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin) and DC-SIGNR (DC-SIGN-related) bind to oligosaccharide ligands found on human tissues as well as on pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The extracellular portion of each receptor contains a membrane-distal carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) and forms tetramers stabilized by an extended neck region consisting of 23 amino acid repeats. Cross-linking analysis of full-length receptors expressed in fibroblasts confirms the tetrameric state of the intact receptors. Hydrodynamic studies on truncated receptors demonstrate that the portion of the neck of each protein adjacent to the CRD is sufficient to mediate the formation of dimers, whereas regions near the N terminus are needed to stabilize the tetramers. Some of the intervening repeats are missing from polymorphic forms of DC-SIGNR. Two different crystal forms of truncated DC-SIGNR comprising two neck repeats and the CRD reveal that the CRDs are flexibly linked to the neck, which contains α-helical segments interspersed with non-helical regions. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements indicate that the neck and CRDs are independently folded domains. Based on the crystal structures and hydrodynamic data, models for the full extracellular domains of the receptors have been generated. The observed flexibility of the CRDs in the tetramer, combined with previous data on the specificity of these receptors, suggests an important role for oligomerization in the recognition of endogenous glycans, in particular those present on the surfaces of enveloped viruses recognized by these proteins.

The dendritic cell receptor DC-SIGN 1The abbreviations used are: DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin; DC-SIGNR, DC-SIGN-related protein; CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain. and the closely related DC-SIGNR found on endothelial cells have been of considerable interest because of their ability to enhance infection of T cells by the human immunodeficiency virus and because of their interactions with glycoproteins found on the surface of other enveloped viruses (1Pöhlmann S.

(Lond.). 2003; 104: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of these receptors are not known with certainty, but DC-SIGN has been ascribed roles in binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 3 on T cells and intercellular adhesion molecule 2 on endothelia, as well as in uptake of pathogens (3Steinman R.M.

Although DC-SIGN binds to a broad spectrum of glycans, it has highest affinity for N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides and fucose-containing structures that are found both as blood group antigens in human tissues and on the surfaces of certain parasites (7Appelmelk B.J. van Die I. van Vliet S.J.

Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). DC-SIGNR binds only to the high mannose oligosaccharides, and unlike DC-SIGN, it does not mediate uptake and degradation of glycoconjugates (8Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR share nearly 80% sequence identity and are closely similar in overall architecture. Both receptors are type II transmembrane proteins in which C-terminal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) are projected from the cell surface by a neck comprising a series of highly conserved 23-amino acid repeats. There are seven complete repeats preceded by a partial repeat at the N terminus. The sequence present in all repeats is designated A, and the sequence missing in the first repeat is called B (Fig. 1A). Circular dichroism has been used to demonstrate that the neck has a high content of α helix (9Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The neck repeats feature a hydrophobic heptad motif characteristic of coiled-coils of α helices (Fig. 1A). However, each repeat starts with a proline and several hydrophilic residues, features that do not favor formation of coiled coils.Fig. 1The DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR neck sequences and their effects on oligomerization.A, sequence alignment of the neck repeats of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. The conserved hydrophobic heptad positions are highlighted, and their positions are numbered underneath the alignments. Asterisks indicate the sites of glycosylation, and arrows denote sites of subtilisin digestion.

Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In other receptors that contain C-type CRDs, the arrangement of the CRDs in clusters leads to enhanced affinity for multivalent ligands. Although the oligosaccharide ligands recognized by DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are found on host cells, they are probably more highly clustered on the surfaces of viruses and parasites. Thus, it is likely that the organization of these receptors enhances the affinity for targets that contain appropriately high densities of specific carbohydrate ligands (10Frison N. Taylor M.E.

Structural analysis of a fragment containing a truncated neck reveals possible modes of tetramer formation and shows that the CRDs are flexibly linked to the neck. A combination of hydrodynamic measurements and model building suggests possible arrangements of the full extracellular tetramer and provides insights into the avidity enhancement provided by oligomer formation. Cross-linking—For cross-linking in situ, one confluent 25-cm2 flask of cells expressing DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR (8Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K.

Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) was rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping and centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and 25-μl aliquots were treated with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce). Intact protein was isolated from cells harvested as above and solubilized in 2 ml of loading buffer (150 mm NaCl containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and 25 mm CaCl2) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The sample was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml column of mannose-Sepharose (12Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). After rinsing with 5 ml of loading buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, the column was eluted with 5 aliquots (0.5 ml) of eluting buffer (150 mm NaCl containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and 2.5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein-containing fractions were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by blotting with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR. Before cross-linking, full-length protein as well as fragments expressed in Escherichia coli were dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl containing 25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, and 5 mm CaCl2. Proteolysis—Proteins purified by affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography (9Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Aliquots of 25 μl containing ∼5 μg of protein were incubated with trypsin (Worthington Biochemicals) or subtilisin (Roche Applied Science), prepared as stock solutions in water immediately before use. For sequencing, gels of the digestion reaction were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (13Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sequenced directly in a Beckman LF-3000 protein sequencer. Protein Expression—Truncated forms of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR were prepared in the expression vector pT5T (14Eisenberg S.P. Evans R.J. Arend W.P. Venderber E. Brewer M.T. Hannum C.H. Thompson R.C. Nature. 1990; 343: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) previously used to express the full extracellular domains of these proteins (9Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides were used to link restriction fragments from the cDNA with the initiator methionine from the plasmid. An alanine codon was inserted after the methionine codon so that the formylmethionine residue would be processed in the bacteria, leaving an exposed N terminus to allow confirmation of the N-terminal sequences of the expressed fragments. Most of the proteins were expressed as previously described (9Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, fragments that do not form oligomers and, hence, do not bind tightly to the affinity columns were concentrated by dialysis against water, lyophilization, and resuspension in one-tenth the original volume of loading buffer before application to a 10-ml column of mannose-Sepharose. The column was washed with 10 ml of loading buffer followed by 20 ml of elution buffer, and fractions of 2 ml were collected throughout. Proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described for the full extracellular domain (9Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamics—For hydrodynamic analysis, proteins were dialyzed extensively against 100 mm NaCl containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8. Sedimentation equilibrium studies were conducted at three concentrations as previously described (2Soilleux E.J. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2003; 104: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity was performed in a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge using 0.45-ml centerpieces in the AN-60 rotor at 50,000 rpm. Scans at 230 nm were recorded at 4.5-min intervals. The results were analyzed by the second moment method using software provided by the manufacturer. Gel filtration was performed on a 30 × 0.75-cm Spherogel-3000 column (Phenomenex) eluted with 100 mm NaCl containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Diffusion coefficients were calculated based on standards of thyroglobulin, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase. Dynamic light scattering was measured at 20 °C at a concentration of ∼250 μg/ml on a DynaPro 801 instrument from Protein Solutions. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of a dimeric DC-SIGNR fragment, residues 116–399, were obtained in the presence or absence of carbohydrate ligand. The first crystal form, grown in the presence of Ca2+ and the trisaccharide Lewisx, have been described (8Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1SL6). The second crystal form was grown by mixing 2.0 μl of DC-SIGNR with 1.0 μl of reservoir solution containing 3.75 m sodium formate and 0.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. For data collection, crystals were transferred to a solution containing 3.75 m sodium formate, 0.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, and 17% glycerol for 2 min, then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals were maintained at 100 K for data collection. Diffraction data were measured on an ADSC Q315 CCD detector at beam line 8.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source and processed with MOSFLM and SCALA (15Collaborative Computational Project N.

The best solution gave correlation coefficient of 53.4% and an R value of 38.0% (resolution range 13–3.5 Å). Refinement and map calculations were performed using CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The maximum likelihood (MLF) target was employed throughout the refinement, as were bulk solvent and overall anisotropic temperature factor corrections. The model was partially refined before obtaining the high resolution data set; to avoid biasing Rfree, the same reflections were used for the test set in the new data along with reflections from the higher resolution shells. The neck region was built in gradually, and resolution was increased to 2.25 Å. Water molecules were added to Fo - Fc map peaks that were >3σ and were within hydrogen bond distance to the protein or other water molecules. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not applied during refinement, as the molecular replacement maps clearly indicated that the domain organization differs between the two copies in the asymmetric unit. Only those residues in the neck repeat closest to the CRD were visible. Several crystals were washed, dissolved, and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing to confirm that the protein in the crystals was intact. The final model contained residues 251–396 for protomer A, 253–396 for protomer B, and 77 water molecules. Refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Hydrodynamic Modeling—Sedimentation values and diffusion coefficients were calculated from models of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR with the program HYDROPRO (19Garcia de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). These calculations used a partial specific volume of 0.733 ml/g for DC-SIGN and 0.730 ml/g for DC-SIGNR, calculated from the amino acid composition. The solvent viscosity was 0.010 poise, the solvent density was 0.998 g/ml, and the temperature was 293 K. The effect of hydration is included in an effective atomic radius of 3.2 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms. Calorimetry—Samples for calorimetry were dialyzed into 125 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm CaCl2. Conditions for calorimetry and data analysis were as previously described (20Wallis R. Shaw J.M. Uitdehaag J. Chen C-B. Torgersen D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 278: 14065-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar), except that scans were performed between 20 and 90 °C, and the base line was calculated using data between 25 and 40 °C and 80 and 90 °C. Fitting to Gaussian curves was performed using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Polymorphism Analysis—A panel of human DNA samples was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Porton Down, Salisbury, UK). The third exon of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genes was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using forward primer CTCAGTTCAGGGCTTGGCACACAGTAGGTG and reverse primer CTGAGGCTCAGGCAGGGTCGGTAACTCAAG. After a preliminary heating for 60 s at 94 °C, 40 cycles of heating at 94 °C for 30 s followed by 60 s at 65 °C were performed with an advantage 2 DNA polymerase kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Amplified DNA was isolated directly from agarose gels and sequenced using the amplification primers and Big Dye 3.1 chemistry and a 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Where DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR fragments co-eluted, they were cloned into vector pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and individual minipreps were sequenced using primers in the vector. Oligomeric State of Intact DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR—The oligomeric states of intact DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR were investigated by examining protein expressed in rat fibroblasts. These cells have been described previously and have been shown to express the receptors at the cell surface (8Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The intact receptors were extracted from the cells in the presence of Triton X-100 and purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose. Treatment with a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent generated dimers, trimers, and tetramers, with the tetramers predominating at higher reagent concentrations (Fig. 2). Cross-linking to form the tetramer was also observed when intact cells were treated with the reagent. These results confirm that each receptor in its native state forms a tetramer. Similar results for DC-SIGN in dendritic cells have recently been reported (21Su S.V. Hong P. Baik S. Negrete O.A. Gurney K.B. Lee B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19122-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Identification of Regions in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR That Stabilize Oligomer Formation—Previous studies on the properties of the extracellular domains of the receptors indicate that interactions within these fragments are sufficient to stabilize the tetramers. An initial indication of the overall arrangement of this portion of the protein was obtained by performing limited proteolytic digestions. Treatment of the full extracellular domains with subtilisin resulted predominantly in cleavage at two sites (Fig. 3). The protease-resistant fragments were identified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. One site of protease digestion occurs after the first, partial neck repeat. This cleavage removes the unique sequence of 15 amino acids that separates the neck repeats from the transmembrane domain as well as the only site of N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 1). The second cleavage site is exactly at the junction between the C-terminal neck repeat and the beginning of the CRD, demarcated by the first cysteine residue. There is little evidence for cleavage within the intervening neck repeats, suggesting that this portion of the protein forms a stable, protease-resistant stalk. Similar results were obtained using trypsin (data not shown). The importance of different portions of the neck for formation of oligomers was investigated by creating a series of truncated forms of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, which were expressed in E. coli. The deletions were made at the boundaries of A or B segments (Fig. 1). For convenience, partial repeats are denoted as 0.5 repeats (Fig. 1B). The oligomeric states of these fragments were investigated by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking. The results show that the first 1.5 repeats can be removed without disrupting the tetramer (Table II and Fig. 1B). Removal of an additional 0.5 repeat results in partial dissociation of the tetramer. A tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of 16 ± 5 μm was determined by fitting of the data at multiple protein concentrations.Table IIUltracentrifugation and cross-linking analysis of truncated forms of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR Molecular weights were determined by sedimentation equilibrium.

Thus, truncated proteins containing 3.5 to 2.5 repeats were difficult to purify intact, and they degraded rapidly during centrifugation, so their oligomeric state could not be characterized. Shorter proteins containing two repeats were substantially more stable but formed partially dissociating dimers rather than tetramers. A dimer-monomer dissociation constant of 35 ± 3 μm was measured for truncated DC-SIGNR containing two neck repeats. Association of monomers of truncated DC-SIGN with two neck repeats was not evident in the ultracentrifugation experiments, but dimers were detected by cross-linking, probably because of the higher protein concentration used in the cross-linking experiment and because the bifunctional reagent traps the dimer form even if it is present in only a small fraction of the sample. Previous studies have demonstrated that the CRDs, in the absence of any of the neck, are monomeric (9Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and the presence of half a repeat does not change this behavior. Thus, the results suggest that repeats close to the CRD mediate the formation of dimers, whereas repeats near the N-terminal membrane anchor are needed for association to form tetramers. Crystal Structures of a Truncated DC-SIGNR with Two Neck Repeats—After an extensive screening of crystallization conditions for several truncated DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR constructs, two crystal forms were obtained from a DC-SIGNR fragment comprising the CRD and two full neck repeats. The first form crystallized in the presence of Ca2+ and the Lewisx trisaccharide (8Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit of this crystal form contains three dimers. The dimer interface is formed by contacts between the neck regions of two protomers. The CRDs of the dimer do not contact one another, and they also adopt different positions with respect to the neck, making the dimer asymmetric (Fig. 4, A and B). In the DC-SIGN + Lewisx crystals, the neck region of each protomer consists of two discontinuous regions. Residues 246–264, corresponding to the last 19 residues of the last repeat, form a single α helix that ends at the CRD. Moving toward the N terminus of the protein, residues 235–245 are disordered. Residues 219–234, which are the first 16 residues of the penultimate neck repeat, form another α helix that runs antiparallel to, and packs against, the 246–264 helix. This generates an antiparallel, four-helix bundle stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4C). The missing electron density for the residues that connect the two α helices of each protomer makes it impossible to determine the topology of this assembly, i.e. to which chain the first α helix belongs. The second crystal form of the truncated DC-SIGNR construct contains a single dimer in the asymmetric unit. This dimer packs against a dimer in a neighboring asymmetric unit that is related by a crystallographic 2-fold rotation axis, which generates a tetramer (Fig. 5A). In this crystal, only a portion of the CRD-proximal segment of the last neck repeat, residues 251–264, is visible. These residues form a single helix, which asso"

It appears frequently as an opportunistic disease, especially in virus-infected immunodepressed people. Similarly to other pathogens, parasites became resistant to most of the first-line drugs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop antiparasitic agents with new modes of action. Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides are promising candidates, but so far only a few of them have shown anti-protozoa activities. Here we found that temporins A and B, 13-amino acid antimicrobial peptides secreted from the skin of the European red frog Rana temporaria, display anti-Leishmania activity at micromolar concentrations, with no cytolytic activity against human erythrocytes. To the best of our knowledge, temporins represent the shortest natural peptides having the highest leishmanicidal activity and the lowest number of positively charged amino acids (a single lysine/arginine) and maintain biological function in serum. Their lethal mechanism involves plasma membrane permeation based on the following data. (i) They induce a rapid collapse of the plasma membrane potential. (ii) They induce the influx of the vital dye SYTOX™ Green. (iii) They reduce intracellular ATP levels. (iv) They severely damage the membrane of the parasite, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. Besides giving us basic important information, the unique properties of temporins, as well as their membranolytic effect, which should make it difficult for the pathogen to develop resistance, suggest them as potential candidates for the future design of antiparasitic drugs with a new mode of action.

Leishmaniasis includes a wide variety of clinical symptoms caused by infection with different species of the genus Leishmania, a human protozoan parasite with a worldwide incidence of 12–14 million people affected. The disease is widespread mostly in tropical and subtropical countries (1Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Leishmania is a digenetic parasite with two major stages, differing widely in their antigenic pattern, metabolism, and plasma membrane composition (2Handman E. Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 44: 1-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): (i) the flagellated promastigote, and (ii) the intracellular nonflagellated amastigote. The promastigote dwells in the gut of the insect vector, the sandfly, and is transmitted by bite into the mammalian host. Then it invades the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system and transforms into the amastigote, the pathological form of the parasite for vertebrates. At present, the only available treatment is based on chemotherapy with organic pentavalent antimonials as the first-line drugs (3Croft S.L. Yardley V. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Croft S.L. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 502-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). However, their efficacy is rapidly eroding because of the increasing appearance of resistant clinical isolates (5Mbongo N. Loiseau P.M. Billion M.A. Robert-Gero M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 352-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Seifert K. Matu S. Javier Perez-Victoria F. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Croft S.L. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2003; 22: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the severe side effects associated with the treatment (7Guerin P.J. Olliaro P. Sundar S. Boelaert M. Croft S.L. Desjeux P. Wasunna M.K. Bryceson A.D. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2002; 2: 494-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of alternative drugs, such as amphotericin B or miltefosine, there is a real need for the development of new agents with new modes of action (4Croft S.L. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 502-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Among them, eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; bisoxonol, bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric) trimethine oxonol; CA(1–8)M(1–18), cecropin A-melittin hybrid (KWKLFKKIGIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISNH2); DMNPE-luciferin, d-luciferin-(1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl ester); HIFCS, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LPG, lipophosphoglycan; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide.1The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; bisoxonol, bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric) trimethine oxonol; CA(1–8)M(1–18), cecropin A-melittin hybrid (KWKLFKKIGIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISNH2); DMNPE-luciferin, d-luciferin-(1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl ester); HIFCS, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LPG, lipophosphoglycan; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. constitute a promising alternative. They are ubiquitous in pluricellular organisms, where they kill a wide variety of pathogens. Accordingly, they are located at the anatomical sites primarily involved in contact with microorganisms, such as mucosal, epithelial, or phagocytic cells (reviewed in Ref. 8Boman H.G. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 254: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Skin secretions from Amphibia represent one of the richest sources for these molecules, because every species synthesizes its own particular set of defense peptides (9Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Barra D.

J. 2002; 368: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although AMPs differ significantly in their sequences, most of them share some features, such as a high positive charge and a potential to adopt an amphipathic α-helix and/or β-sheet structures upon their interaction with membranes. To date, there is compelling evidence that a common step in the microbial killing mechanism is their electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged cell membrane followed by its permeation/disruption (13Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 14Shai Y. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). During the last few years, a considerable number of studies have been carried out with AMPs on bacteria (15Friedrich C.L. Moyles D. Beveridge T.J. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in an attempt to understand the parameters responsible for their activity. Nevertheless, reports on the activity and the mode of action of AMPs toward protozoan and metazoan parasites are very scarce (23Vizioli J. Salzet M. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 475-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For Leishmania, these include dermaseptins (24Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and skin polypeptide tyrosine-tyrosine (25Vouldoukis I. Shai Y. Nicolas P. Mor A.

J. 2003; 375: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) investigated the leishmanicidal activity of highly positively charged cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptides. Their data suggested that the killing of the parasite was strongly correlated with plasma membrane permeabilization. Conversely, autophagic cell death has been described for indolicidin-treated parasites (27Bera A. Singh S. Nagaraj R. Vaidya T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 127: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here we report the biological function and the mode of action of temporin A (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) and temporin B (LLPIVGNLLKSLL-NH2), both isolated from the frog Rana temporaria, against Leishmania promastigotes and amastigotes. Temporins are short (13-residue) peptides, with an amidated C terminus and with only one positively charged amino acid. They were first identified in R. temporaria skin secretions (31Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Canofeni S. Miele R. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and further detected in several North American Rana species, such as Rana clamitans (32Halverson T. Basir Y.J. Knoop F.C. Conlon J.M. Peptides (Elmsford). 2000; 21: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Rana luteiventris (33Goraya J. Wang Y. Li Z. O'Flaherty M. Knoop F.C. Platz J.E. Conlon J.M. Eur. J.

Pept. 2000; 90: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Temporins, together with indolicidin, are among the smallest AMPs isolated so far from animal sources. However, in contrast with indolicidin, temporins are nonhemolytic (35Selsted M.E. Novotny M.J. Morris W.L. Tang Y.Q. Smith W. Cullor J.S. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that these molecules are active mainly against Gram-positive bacteria, Candida albicans, and some human tumor cell lines (12Rinaldi A.C. Mangoni M.L. Rufo A. Luzi C. Barra D. Zhao H. Kinnunen P.K. Bozzi A. Giulio DiA. Simmaco M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our data show that temporins A and B have leishmanicidal activity at concentrations that are not toxic to human red blood cells. In addition, in contrast to most AMPs, temporins preserve biological function in serum. Furthermore, studies on their mode of action suggest that they act directly on the membrane of the parasite and destroy its integrity; therefore, it should make it difficult for the pathogen to develop resistance. Besides providing important basic information, the small size of temporins, their destructive mode of action, and their ability to maintain activity in serum suggest them as attractive templates for further development of new antiparasitic drugs.

Other reagents of the highest quality were purchased from Sigma or Merck. Parasites—Promastigotes of L. donovani (MHOM/S.D./00/1S-2D) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HIFCS), antibiotics, and 2 mm glutamine in a Bellco roller device (Ace Glass, Vineland, NJ) at 26 °C. The mutant R2D2 strain, defective in the biosynthesis of the repetitive phosphorylated disaccharide unit of lipophosphoglycan (LPG), was kindly provided by S. J. Turco (University of Kentucky School of Medicine). For this strain, 5 μg/ml of lectin ricin agglutinin (Ricinus communis) was added to the growth medium (37King D.L. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem.

These parasites were grown under the same conditions as the parental strain, except for the additional supplement of 50 μg/ml geneticin to the growth medium. Leishmania pifanoi axenic amastigotes were grown at 32 °C in M199 medium (31100, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% HIFCS, 5% trypticase, and 50 μg/ml hemin, pH 7.2 (38Pan A.A. McMahon-Pratt D.

Peptide Synthesis—Temporin A and temporin B were synthesized by the standard Nα-Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid derivatives with a [5-(4-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxy-phenoxy)]valeric acid polyethyleneglycol resin on an automated peptide synthesizer (Pioneer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The purity of the peptides was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, and their sequence was determined by both automated Edman degradation, using a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model AB476A), and mass spectral analysis with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight Voyager DE (Applied Biosystems). The concentration of the peptides was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis using a Beckman System Gold instrument, equipped with an ion-exchange column and ninhydrin derivatization. Antibacterial Activity—The antibacterial activity of the peptides was tested by using an inhibition zone assay on agarose plates seeded with viable bacteria, according to Hultmark et al. (39Hultmark D. Engstrom A. Andersson K. Steiner H. Bennich H. Boman H.G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). 2-Fold serial dilution of the peptides in 20% ethanol (v/v) and in 33% heat-inactivated human serum was used (40Oren Z. Hong J. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14643-14649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Activity of the Peptides on Leishmania Promastigotes and Amastigotes—Procyclic promastigotes and amastigotes were harvested at a late exponential phase, whereas metacyclic promastigotes were from cultures at a stationary phase. Parasites were then washed twice with Hanks' medium (136 mm NaCl; 4.2 mm Na2HPO4; 4.4 mm KH2PO4; 5.4 mm KCl; 4.1 mm NaHCO3), pH 7.2, supplemented with 20 mm d-glucose (Hanks-Glc) (41J.H. Hanks W.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1958; 98: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and resuspended in the same buffer at a final concentration of 2 × 107 parasites/ml. Aliquots of this suspension (120 μl) were incubated with the peptides for 60 min at 26 and 32 °C for promastigotes and amastigotes, respectively, and subsequently divided into 2 further aliquots (100 and 10 μl), which were used in the following two assays (29Chicharro C. Granata C. Lozano R. Andreu D. Rivas L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). (i) Inhibition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction to insoluble formazan by mitochondrial reductases was used as a short term viability parameter of the parasites and assayed immediately after peptide incubation (28Diaz-Achirica P. Ubach J. Guinea A. Andreu D. Rivas L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To the 100-μl aliquot of parasite suspension, 1 ml of Hanks-Glc was added to slow down peptide activity. The parasites were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml MTT solution in Hanks-Glc, transferred into a 96-well culture microplate, and incubated for 2 h at 26 or 32 °C for promastigotes or amastigotes, respectively. The reduced formazan was solubilized by the addition of an equal volume of 10% (w/v) SDS, incubated overnight at 26 °C, and measured in a 450 Bio-Rad Microplate Reader equipped with a 595-nm filter. (ii) To measure inhibition of promastigotes proliferation, the 10-μl aliquot was added to 100 μl of RPMI medium, devoid of phenol red, and supplemented with 10% HIFCS. The surviving parasites were allowed to proliferate for 72 h; then 100 μl of MTT solution (1 mg/ml in Hanks-Glc) was added, and its reduction was measured as described above. For amastigotes, the inhibition of proliferation was performed in M199 growth medium. After 5 days, the cells were centrifuged, washed with Hanks', and resuspended in 0.5 mg/ml MTT solution. All assays were performed in triplicate, and the experiments were repeated twice. The results were normalized to those of the corresponding controls in the absence of the peptide. Modification of Bioenergetic Parameters—We carried out two different assays. (i) The collapse of membrane potential was estimated by the potentially sensitive anionic dye bisoxonol, as its fluorescence increases after its insertion into the membrane, once the cell is depolarized. Assays were performed under standard conditions, in the presence of 0.1 μm bisoxonol. Peptides were added at different concentrations, and changes in fluorescence were recorded continuously for about 30 min using a Fluorostat Galaxy microplate reader (BMG Labotechnologies, Offenburg, Germany), equipped with excitation and emission filters at 540 and 580 nm, respectively. Maximal depolarization was considered as that obtained with 2.5 μm CA(1–8)M(1–18) cecropin A-melittin hybrid (28Diaz-Achirica P. Ubach J. Guinea A. Andreu D. Rivas L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All assays were done in triplicate. (ii) For in vivo monitoring of intracellular ATP variation, the variation of intracellular ATP level was monitored as described previously (30Luque-Ortega J.R. Saugar J.M. Chiva C. Andreu D. Rivas L. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, promastigotes transfected with the pX63NEO-3Luc expression vector were incubated for 15 min at 26 °C with 25 μm DMNPE-luciferin, a free membrane-permeable caged luciferase substrate. Changes in luminescence were measured in the Fluorostat Galaxy microplate reader fitted with luminescence optics, with readings averaging every 10 s. Peptides were added once the luminescence reached a plateau. This point was considered as time 0, and its luminescence value was taken as 100%. The decrease in luminescence was monitored continuously for 60 min. All assays were performed in triplicate, and the luminescence values were normalized to those of the corresponding controls in the absence of the peptide. Permeation of the Plasma Membrane of the Promastigotes and Amastigotes—We adapted the procedure described by Thevissen et al. (42Thevissen K. Terras F.R. Broekaert W.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5451-5458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess the permeability of the Leishmania membrane. Briefly, the parasites were incubated with 1 μm SYTOX™ Green in Hanks-Glc for 15 min in the dark. After peptide addition, the increase in fluorescence, due to the binding of the dye to intracellular DNA, was measured in the same microplate reader described above, using 485- and 520-nm filters for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Maximal membrane permeation was defined as that obtained after the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 (29Chicharro C. Granata C. Lozano R. Andreu D. Rivas L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Parasites were incubated with the peptides for 1 h and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Afterward, parasites were fixed for 1 h with 5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, included with 2.5% (w/v) osmium tetraoxide, and gradually dehydrated in ethanol (30, 50, 70, 90, and 100% (v/v) for 30 min each) and propylene oxide (1 h). Finally, they were embedded in Epon 812 resin and observed with a Philips 2200 electron microscope as described previously (28Diaz-Achirica P. Ubach J. Guinea A. Andreu D. Rivas L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Other Methods—Hydrophobicity was calculated according to the normalized scale of Eisenberg (43Eisenberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 595-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). LC50 (the concentration of peptide required to inhibit half of the maximum MTT reduction) and its 95% confidence limits were determined by the Litchfield and Wilcoxon procedure using the PHARM/PCS version 4 software package for PCs. The number of experiments analyzed was indicated in the legend of each figure. Temporins were tested for their activity and plausible mode of action on both promastigote and amastigote stages of Leishmania. The ability of a drug to kill the mammalian intracellular stage of the parasite is crucial for its potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent. Note that this form has been shown to be more resistant to other cationic AMPs than the corresponding form present in the insect host (29Chicharro C. Granata C. Lozano R. Andreu D. Rivas L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MTT Reduction in Promastigotes by Temporins A and B—Temporins A and B were tested for their ability to inhibit MTT reduction in Leishmania promastigotes at a concentration range of 5–25 μm. The assay was done either after 1-h incubation of the parasites with the peptides (short term effect) or after proliferation of the remaining viable protozoa at a 72-h incubation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are given in Fig. 1. The data shown in Fig. 1A reveal that, at a given peptide concentration, the percentage of inhibition for the short time effect was practically similar to the inhibition of proliferation, without taking into account the S.D. Moreover, both peptides exhibited a similar antiparasitic effect as indicated also by their corresponding LC50 values (Table I). The lethal concentrations against three bacterial strains (the Gram-negative Escherichia coli D21, the Gram-positive Bacillus megaterium Bm11, and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I) as well as human erythrocytes are included in Table I for comparison. These results indicate that although the antibacterial potency of temporin A was ∼2-fold higher than that of temporin B, both peptides were similarly active toward the promastigotes, and at least 5-fold more efficient than cecropin A, a potent 36-residue AMP (44Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, we found that, in contrast to most natural AMPs (40Oren Z. Hong J. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14643-14649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), temporins maintained high activity in serum (Table I). Furthermore, temporins inhibited MTT reduction of the metacyclic promastigotes (Fig. 1B), the circulating form of the parasite in the blood of an infected mammal for about 24 h before becoming amastigote, to a slightly lower extent than that found for the procyclic promastigotes (Fig. 1A).Table IAntimicrobial and hemolytic activity of temporin A, temporin B, and cecropin APeptideL. donovaniaL. donovani promastigotes were incubated with the corresponding peptides at different concentrations, and viability was evaluated by MTT reduction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as LC50. 95% confidence limits determined by the Litchfield and Wilcoxon procedure are included in parentheses.E. coli D21bValues are taken from Ref. 31.B. megaterium Bm11cNumbers in parentheses were obtained in 33% human serum.

Open table in a new tab The Influence of External Parameters on the Activity of Temporins on Leishmania Promastigotes—To better understand the interaction of these peptides with the surface of the parasite, we carried out a systematic variation of the conditions used in the short term standard assay for determining the ability of temporins to inhibit MTT reduction. (i) To study the role of electrostatic interactions, we tested temporins in the absence and presence of 50 μg/ml heparin, a strongly anionic polysaccharide. Temporin A, at 15 μm, caused 90.8 ± 2.3% inhibition of MTT reduction in the absence of heparin (Fig. 1A), while after a 15-min incubation with heparin, prior to the addition of the peptide to the promastigotes, the inhibition was 78.4 ± 3.2%. This effect was clearly weaker than that obtained for other peptides having a higher cationic character such as CA(1–8)M(1–18) (28Diaz-Achirica P. Ubach J. Guinea A. Andreu D. Rivas L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In another assay, temporin A was assayed at 10 μm for its ability to inhibit the MTT reduction using two isosmotic incubation media as follows: the standard Hanks' medium (140"
https://openalex.org/W1978802770,"One of the deepest questions in condensed matter physics concerns what other phases compete with superconductivity in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors. One candidate is the ""stripe"" phase, in which the carriers (holes) condense into rivers of charge separating regions of antiferromagnetism. A related but lesser known system is the ""spin ladder"", which consists of two coupled chains of magnetic ions forming an array of rungs. A doped ladder can be thought of as a high-Tc material with lower dimensionality, and has been predicted to exhibit both superconductivity and an insulating ""hole crystal"" phase in which the carriers are localised through many-body interactions. The competition between the two resembles that between static stripes and superconductivity in high-Tc materials. Here we report evidence, from resonant x-ray scattering, for the existence of a hole crystal in the doped spin ladder of Sr14Cu24O41. This phase exists without a detectable distortion in the structural lattice, indicating it arises from many-body effects. Our measurements confirm theoretical predictions and support the picture that proximity to charge ordered states is a general property of superconductivity in copper-oxides."

https://openalex.org/W1972791857,"This study investigated the regulatory mechanism of rapid and transient induction of a transcriptional repressor ERF3 gene by wounding in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. Deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter region have suggested that the proximal W boxes (TGAC(C/T)) and a GCC box, respectively, may be involved in the positive and negative regulation of wound-induced expression of the ERF3 gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that wounding enhanced the specific binding activity of nuclear factors to the W boxes. NtWRKY1, -2, and -4, which are tobacco group I WRKYs, interacted specifically with the W boxes and activated transcription via the W boxes. On the other hand, deletion of the GCC box from NsERF3 promoter-GUS reporter gene caused a delay in down-regulation of transcription after wound induction. In addition, ERF3 repressed transcription via the NsERF3 promoter activated by NtWRKYs. These results suggest the possible involvement of NtWRKYs and autorepression in the rapid and transient expression of the ERF3 gene by wounding."

GalE is the sole annotated UDP-glucose 4-epimerase in this bacterium. The presence of GalNAc residues in these carbohydrates suggested that GalE might be a UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase. GalE was shown to epimerize UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc in coupled assays with C. jejuni glycosyltransferases and in sugar nucleotide epimerization equilibria studies. Thus, GalE possesses UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase activity and was renamed Gne. The K m(app) values of a purified MalE-Gne fusion protein for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc are 1087 and 1070 μm, whereas those for UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal are 780 and 784 μm. The kcat and kcat/K m(app) values were three to four times higher for UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Gal than for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc. The comparison of the kinetic parameters of MalE-Gne to those of other characterized bacterial UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerases indicated that Gne is a bifunctional UDP-GlcNAc/Glc 4-epimerase. The UDP sugar-binding site of Gne was modeled by using the structure of the UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase WbpP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Small differences were noted, and these may explain the bifunctional character of the C. jejuni Gne. In a gne mutant of C. jejuni, the lipooligosaccharide was shown by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry to be truncated by at least five sugars. Furthermore, both the glycoprotein N-linked heptasaccharide and capsule were no longer detectable by high resolution magic angle spinning NMR.

In bacteria, UDP-GalNAc is generated from the epimerization of the hydroxyl group at position C-4 of UDP-GlcNAc by UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase (often called Gne for UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase). The presence of GalNAc in these glycoconjugates in C. jejuni NCTC 11168 is intriguing because there is no annotated UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase gene (gne) in its genome (9Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K.

Similarity and identity percentages between aa sequences were determined using Pairwise BLAST (BLAST 2 Sequences at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.html). Coupled Enzyme Assays—The acceptor oligosaccharides (see below) were labeled with FCHASE and were prepared as described elsewhere (31Wakarchuk W. Martin A. Jennings M.P. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by sonication. Enzyme assays were performed at 37 °C from 5 to 30 min. Two types of coupled assays were performed: Gne + CgtA (β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) assays and Gne + MalE-CgtB (β-1,3-galactosaminyltransferase) assays. The Gne + CgtA assays were performed in 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm UDP-GalNAc (or UDP-GlcNAc when Gne was present), and 0.5 mm GM3-FCHASE. 2For simplicity's sake, the acceptor sugars used in CgtA and CgtB enzyme assays throughout this report were named after their corresponding gangliosides (even if they only consist in their glycone moiety). Hence, GM3-FCHASE is NeuAc-α-2,3-Gal-β-1,4-Glc-FCHASE, and GM2-FCHASE is GalNAc-β-1,3-[NeuAc-α-2,3]-Gal-β-1,4-Glc-FCHASE. The product of the CgtB reaction, GM1a-FCHASE, is Gal-β-1, 3-GalNAc-β-1,3-[NeuAc-α-2,3]-Gal-β-1,4-Glc-FCHASE. The reactions were started with the addition of an aliquot of CJL30 (positive and negative controls) or CJL30 and PL2 + pCPG6 lysates (coupled assays). The Gne + MalE-CgtB assays were performed in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm UDP-Gal (or UDP-Glc when Gne was present), and 0.5 mm GM2-FCHASE. 2For simplicity's sake, the acceptor sugars used in CgtA and CgtB enzyme assays throughout this report were named after their corresponding gangliosides (even if they only consist in their glycone moiety).

The product of the CgtB reaction, GM1a-FCHASE, is Gal-β-1, 3-GalNAc-β-1,3-[NeuAc-α-2,3]-Gal-β-1,4-Glc-FCHASE. The reactions were started with the addition of an aliquot of PL2 + pCJL20 (positive and negative controls) or PL2 + pCJL20 and PL2 + pCPG6 lysates (coupled assays). All reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS (STOP solution) and were diluted with H2O to obtain 10–15 μm final concentration of the FCHASE-labeled compounds. The samples were subsequently analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using manual integration with the P/ACE Station software (Beckman Instruments, see Ref. 32Gilbert M. Watson D.C. Cunningham A-M.

The reactions were performed in duplicate by using cells from different cultures. Epimerization of UDP Sugars by the C. jejuni Gne and Capillary Electrophoresis Quantification—Reactions were performed at 37 °C in a total volume of 30 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 mm of UDP sugar (UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Glc, or UDP-Gal) and 15 μl of cell lysate of PL2 + pCPG6. The epimerization reaction was monitored over time by collecting 10-μl aliquots after 30 min of incubation and stopped after 60 min. The reactions were stopped with STOP solution and were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis as described above. The reactions were performed in duplicate using cells from different cultures. Purification of MalE-Gne from C. jejuni—Cells were resuspended at 10% (w/v) in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A) and were lysed by two passages through an Emulsiflex (Avestin). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted as needed in Buffer A and applied to a 20-ml column of amylose resin (New England Biolabs). After sample application, the column was washed with 2 column volumes to elute unbound proteins. The bound MalE-Gne was eluted by washing the column with Buffer B (Buffer A with 20 mm maltose), and the eluate was collected in 2-ml fractions. The fractions containing the eluted MalE-Gne were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of Buffer A at 4 °C. Protein quantitation was done using the BCA reagent (Pierce). The purified MalE-Gne was kept at 4 °C in Buffer A without loss of activity over a period of several months. Determination of Kinetic Parameters for MalE-Gne—Enzymatic reactions were performed in a total volume of 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. The concentrations of UDP sugar varied from 0.025 to 10 mm with 6.25 ng of purified MalE-Gne in all reactions. The reactions were stopped after 5 min of incubation with 10 μl of STOP solution. The reactions were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis as described above. Vmax and K m(app) values were calculated by using GraphPad Prism version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, www.graphpad.com). Modeling of the Structure of Gne from C. jejuni—Modeling of Gne was performed by using the protein structure-modeling program MODELLER 6 version 2 (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

The plasmid was then electroporated into C. jejuni, and the kanamycin-resistant mutant was characterized by PCR to confirm integration by a double crossover event. O-Deacylated LOS Analysis by CE-MS and HR-MAS NMR Spectroscopy of C. jejuni Glycans—O-Deacylated LOS for CE-MS and C. jejuni whole cells for HR-MAS NMR were prepared as described in Ref. 5Szymanski C.M.

Separation conditions by CE-MS were bare-fused silica (90 cm × 50 μm inner diameter, 190 μm outer diameter), 5% methanol in 30 mm morpholine, pH 9.0, +25 kV. 1H HR-MAS NMR spectra of NCTC11168gne mutant were acquired on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz spectrometer with a spectral width of 9600 Hz and 19 K data points.

The nucleotide sequence of the cloned Cj1131c was found to be identical to that of Cj1131c (see Ref. 9Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M.

Nature. 2000; 403: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar; GenBank™ accession number AL111168). The C. jejuni NCTC 11168 GalE shares 98% identity with GalE from C. jejuni 81116 (six differences over 328 positions, none of which occur within the two conserved motifs nor among the residue parts of the predicted active site; Fig. 2 and see below). GalE from C. jejuni NCTC 11168 also shares significant aa sequence similarities with other bacterial UDP-GlcNAc epimerases (27–40% identity and 42–59% similarity; Fig. 2) as well as with GalE from E. coli (36% identity and 54% similarity; Fig. 2). The C. jejuni NCTC 11168 GalE contains the two motifs characteristic of members of the so-called short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The first motif is GXXGXXG (Gly7-Xaa-Xaa-Gly10-Xaa-Xaa-Gly13 in the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 GalE, Fig. 2), which is located near the amino-terminal end of the enzyme and the cofactor-binding pocket. This motif helps to stabilize the FAD or NAD(P)-binding Rossman fold and is involved in the binding of the nucleotide cofactor to the domain (40Kleiger G. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The second motif is Ser-Xaa24-Tyr-Xaa3-Lys (Ser121-Xaa24-Tyr146-Xaa3-Lys150 in the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 GalE, Fig. 2), in which the seryl, tyrosinyl, and lysyl residues are directly involved in catalysis (14Liu Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11469-11477Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Production of GalE from C. jejuni in E. coli and Functional Characterization—GalE from C. jejuni was overproduced in E. coli PL2 from plasmid pCPG6 (Table II) upon induction with IPTG. A protein of the expected molecular weight (37 kDa) was visible in the cell lysate (data not shown). The galE28 mutation abrogates UDP-glucose 4-epimerase activity in E. coli PL2 so that any epimerization of UDP-Glc into UDP-Gal will be attributable to the pCPG6-encoded GalE. In addition, GalE from E. coli is unable to epimerize UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc (16Thoden J.B. Henderson J.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, any epimerization observed in the assays will be attributed solely to GalE from C. jejuni. The enzymatic function of GalE from C. jejuni was investigated by performing coupled enzyme assays with glycosyltransferases from C. jejuni. The rationale for these assays was that the expected product of the reaction would be synthesized by the glycosyltransferase only if the appropriate donor sugar was present (Fig. 3). By supplying UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcNAc and the C. jejuni GalE to the reaction, the product will be synthesized only if the UDP sugar is first converted into its C4-epimer. In the case of assays using UDP-GlcNAc, the synthesis of the expected reaction product would indicate that the C. jejuni GalE also possesses UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase activity. Coupled assays using the C. jejuni GalE and CgtB were performed to verify the ability of GalE to epimerize UDP-Glc into UDP-Gal. The CgtB glycosyltransferase from C. jejuni is a β1,3-galactosyltransferase that adds a galactosyl residue via a β-1,3 linkage to the GalNAc moie"
https://openalex.org/W2008083479,"Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2, L-type Ca2+ channel) function is highly regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters in large part through the activation of kinases and phosphatases. Regulation of Cav1.2 by protein kinase C (PKC) is of significant physiologic importance, mediating, in part, the cardiac response to hormonal regulation. Although PKC has been reported to mediate activation and/or inhibition of Cav1.2 function, the molecular mechanisms mediating the response have not been definitively elucidated. We show that PKC forms a macromolecular complex with the α1c subunit of Cav1.2 through direct interaction with the C terminus. This interaction leads to phosphorylation of the channel in response to activators of PKC. We identify Ser1928 as the residue that is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and in vivo. Ser1928 has been identified previously as the site mediating, in part, the protein kinase A up-regulation of channel activity. Thus, the protein kinase A and PKC signaling pathways converge on the Cav1.2 complex at Ser1928 to increase channel activity. Our results identify two mechanisms leading to regulation of Cav1.2 activity by PKC: pre-association of the channel with PKC isoforms and phosphorylation of specific sites within the α1c subunit.

We show that PKC forms a macromolecular complex with the α1c subunit of Cav1.2 through direct interaction with the C terminus. This interaction leads to phosphorylation of the channel in response to activators of PKC. We identify Ser1928 as the residue that is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and in vivo. Ser1928 has been identified previously as the site mediating, in part, the protein kinase A up-regulation of channel activity. Thus, the protein kinase A and PKC signaling pathways converge on the Cav1.2 complex at Ser1928 to increase channel activity. Our results identify two mechanisms leading to regulation of Cav1.2 activity by PKC: pre-association of the channel with PKC isoforms and phosphorylation of specific sites within the α1c subunit. The influx of Ca2+ through Cav1.2 is essential for activation of excitation-contraction coupling in the heart (1Fabiato A. Fabiato F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1979; 41: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx also contributes to the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential, pacemaker activity in nodal cells, and the modulation of gene expression (2Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). A variety of diseases such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease have been associated with alterations in Cav1.2 density and/or function (3Kamp T.J. He J.Q. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Kamp T.J. Hell J.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar).

PKC is a serine/threonine kinase consisting of an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic region and is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) produced in response to hormones such as α-adrenergic agonists, angiotensin II, and endothelin-1 (12Rybin V.O.

Three PKC subgroups have been identified and functionally distinguished: conventional PKC (cPKC), novel PKC (nPKC) and atypical PKC (aPKC) (14Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P.

The molecular basis for Cav1.2 regulation by PKC has been widely studied, but remains incompletely elucidated and controversial. The cardiac Cav1.2 α1c and β2a subunits are phosphorylated by PKC on unidentified sites in vitro (16Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Zhao X.L. Ladner M.B. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9605-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Electrophysiologic studies of recombinant channels have attempted to identify specific mechanisms that mediate PKC regulation, but have yielded conflicting information, potentially due to differences in experimental conditions and/or sequences of α1c/β subunits (17Bourinet E. Fournier F. Lory P. Charnet P. Nargeot J. Pflugers Arch Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 421: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M.

Several studies have suggested that the N terminus of α1c is important for PKC up-regulation of channel function. Deletion of the first 46 or 139 amino acid residues of rabbit heart α1c causes a 5–10-fold increase in whole cell current in oocytes (21Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), without affecting channel density. These findings suggest that the N terminus provides an inhibitory control, which can be relieved after PKC phosphorylation, potentially of a remote phosphorylation site(s) (23Shistik E.

To elucidate the mechanism(s) through which PKC isoforms regulate channel activity, we have utilized glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins to screen potential phosphorylation sites. Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site (Ser1928) on the α1c subunit (24De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10392-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which mediates, in part, Cav1.2 activation (25Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), is a substrate for PKC in vitro and in vivo. The phosphorylation of Ser1928 is mediated, in part, through a direct association between the α1c subunit and PKC isoforms. The results suggest that both PKA and PKC converge on Ser1928 of the α1c subunit to mediate phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Ca2+ influx. Preparation of Adult Heart and Brain and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 Cell Extracts/Membranes—Membranes were prepared from rat ventricular tissue as described previously (26Webster R.J. Sabbadini R.A. Dettbarn C.A. Paolini P.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1273-1290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All preparative procedures were performed at -4 °C. Rat ventricles were minced and homogenized in 10 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm calpain I inhibitor, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Pefabloc SC. Homogenates were spun for 20 min at 4000 × g, filtered through gauze, and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate containing 0.3 m sucrose and 0.9% NaCl. Membranes were stored at -80 °C. Rat brain extracts were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, one Complete mini-tablet (Roche Applied Science), 44 μm calpain I inhibitor, 18 μm calpain II inhibitor, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as described previously (27Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30280-30287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (twice at 14,000 rpm for 10 min), and supernatants were collected. HEK cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to clarify supernatants. Isolation of Neonatal Cardiac Myocytes—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 2-day-old Wistar rat hearts by trypsin dispersion using a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiomyocytes, followed by irradiation as described previously (28Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on protamine sulfate-coated culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Experiments were performed on cultures grown for 5 days in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then serum-deprived for the subsequent 24 h. Neonatal cardiac myocytes maintained in cultures were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 10 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.8) containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Membranes were prepared according to methods described previously (29Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The pellets were suspended in 100 μl of 1× sample buffer. cDNA Clones and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The rabbit α1c subunit (NCBI accession number X15539) and the rabbit β2a subunit (NCBI X64297) were ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for expression. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene). All clones were sequenced on both strands prior to use. Transfections into HEK293 cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Preparation of Phospho-specific Antibody—The phospho-Ser1928-specific antibody was prepared at Zymed Laboratories Inc. utilizing the peptide NH2-LGRRApSFHLECLK-COOH as described previously (27Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30280-30287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The sensitivity and specificity of the phospho-specific antibody were confirmed utilizing GST fusion proteins/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunoprecipitations and Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, Complete mini-tablets (one/7 ml), and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using 2 μg of anti-α1c antibody (ACC-003, Alomone Laboratories). Immune complexes were collected using protein A (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h, followed by extensive washing. All immunoprecipitations included negative controls (peptide-blocked, preimmune serum, antibody alone). Additional antibodies included horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody (sc-138, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a panel of PKC isoform-specific antibodies (BD Biosciences). Blots were developed with the use of ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal detection (Pierce). In all cases, data shown are representative of three or more similar experiments. For PKA kinase reactions, full-length recombinant α1c was immunoprecipitated with the α1c-specific antibody, and immune complexes were captured on protein A-Sepharose. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Sepharose beads were extensively washed and resuspended in kinase reaction buffer containing 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris, and 50 mm PIPES (pH 6.8). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μm cAMP (Sigma), 5 units of PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma), 50 μm MgATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated with 6× loading buffer, size-fractionated on SDS-7% or 10% polyacrylamide gel, and exposed to film. Preimmune serum was utilized as a negative control for immunoprecipitation. Negative controls for the phosphorylation reactions included the absence of cAMP or the PKA catalytic subunit and protein kinase inhibitor (PKI)-(5–24). For PKC kinase reactions, samples were washed twice with PKC wash buffer (cPKCα: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm CaCl2; nPKCϵ: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm EGTA; and aPKCζ: 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2 and 500 μm EGTA). aPKCα kinase assays were performed in 15 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 200 μg/ml DAG, and 50 μm ATP. 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added to the assay buffer to radiolabel the substrates of the kinase assay as indicated. nPKCϵ phosphorylation assays were performed with an identical buffer, except the Ca2+ was replaced with 100 μm EGTA. aPKCζ phosphorylation assays were performed in 15 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 200 μg/ml DAG, and 50 μm ATP. 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added to the assay buffer to radiolabel the substrates of the kinase assay as indicated. Phosphorylation reactions, which were optimized for individual PKC isoforms (Panvera and Invitrogen), were performed for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were size-fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, extensively washed, stained with Coomassie Blue, fixed, and dried. [γ-32P]ATP was detected by autoradiography. For immunodetection of Ser1928 phosphorylation, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted using the phospho-Ser1928-specific antibody (1:2000 in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000; Pierce), followed by ECL detection. Cav1.2 Forms a Macromolecular Complex with PKC in the Heart and Brain—Although significant evidence supports the concept that PKC signaling pathways can modulate Cav1.2 activity in the heart, there is still little to no information on the identity of the PKC isoform(s) and the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. In keeping with the emerging role of protein-protein interactions as a mechanism to locally regulate channel activity by regulatory kinases (particularly in differentiated cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons), the initial studies examined whether PKC isoforms interact with Cav1.2 in cardiac or brain tissue. Cardiomyocytes coexpress conventional (cPKCα), novel (nPKCδ and nPKCϵ), and atypical (aPKCλ) isoforms; cPKCβ has also been variably detected in cardiomyocytes by some investigators (30Puceat M.

Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that Cav1.2 co-immunoprecipitated with cPKCα, but nPKCδ and nPKCϵ were not recovered in the anti-Cav1.2 immune complexes (Fig. 1A). Similarly, all three cPKC isoforms expressed in the brain (PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ) were recovered in Cav1.2 immune complexes (Fig. 1B). In contrast, nPKCδ (which is abundant in cardiac and brain tissue) did not co-immunoprecipitate with Cav1.2 in either preparation under these conditions (Fig. 1, A and C). nPKCϵ also did not co-immunoprecipitate with Cav1.2 from cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1A), although some nPKCϵ was detected in Cav1.2 immune complexes from the brain (Fig. 1C), perhaps due to the higher levels of nPKCϵ expression in this tissue. Other PKC isoforms such as aPKCι and aPKCθ (which are abundant in neuronal tissue and are not expressed at any appreciable level in cardiomyocytes) also were recovered with Cav1.2 in the brain (Fig. 1C). In each case, the PKC isoform interactions with Cav1.2 were specific, as PKC isoforms were not recovered when immunoprecipitations were performed with irrelevant IgGs. Collectively, these results show a constitutive interaction between Cav1.2 and certain PKC isoforms (primarily cPKCs) in cardiac and brain tissue.Fig. 1Cav1.2 forms a macromolecular complex with PKC in the heart and brain.A,Cav1.2 α1c was immunoprecipitated from rat heart membranes, size-fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with PKC isoform-specific antibodies as indicated.

C, shown are nPKC and aPKC isoform immunoblots of α1c/preimmune precipitates from rat brain extracts. Brain α1c weakly associated with nPKCϵ, aPKCι, and aPKCθ, but not with nPKCδ. In all cases, blots are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the PKC isoforms directly interact with the α1c subunit (and to map the PKC interaction domains on α1c subunits), a panel of GST fusion proteins containing the α1c subunit N terminus, individual intracellular loops, and non-overlapping regions of the α1c C terminus were generated (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that cPKCα co-sedimented with GST fusion proteins containing domains in the α1c subunit C terminus. The interactions between cPKCα and these non-overlapping regions of the α1c subunit C terminus were specific, as cPKCα did not co-sediment with GST alone or GST fused to other α1c subunit intracellular domains (including the N terminus or the intracellular loop sequences) (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the cPKCα-α1c C terminus interaction is direct (i.e. does not require another coprecipitating protein), additional in vitro studies were performed with the α1c C terminus-GST fusion proteins and recombinant cPKCα. Fig. 2C shows that both C terminus-GST fusion proteins pull-downed cPKCα; cPKCα was not recovered when the pull-down was performed with GST alone. Collectively, these results identify a direct interaction between cPKCα and the α1c subunit. We next sought to determine whether the interaction between Cav1.2 and cPKCα (which we detected in native tissues and in in vitro binding assays) could be reconstituted in a mammalian expression system. To this end, we expressed Cav1.2 (α1c and β2a) in HEK293 cells, which have nearly undetectable levels of endogenous α1c upon immunoblotting. HEK293 cells demonstrated relatively high expression of cPKCα, aPKCι, and aPKCλ and weaker expression of nPKCδ, nPKCϵ, nPKCθ, and aPKCζ upon immunoblotting (data not shown). Fig. 3A shows that α1c specifically co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous cPKCα in unstimulated HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A, left panel). No cPKCα immunoreactivity could be detected when immunoprecipitation was performed with preimmune serum or with anti-α1c antibody in the presence of blocking (immunogenic) peptide (Fig. 3A, left panel), consistent with the lack of immunoprecipitation of α1c (right panel). A constitutive interaction between Cav1.2 and cPKCα could constitute a mechanism to optimize channel phosphorylation in the context of stimulatory conditions that are associated with the generation of Ca2+ and DAG. To determine whether α1c subunits are phosphorylated by PKCα docked to the channel, we performed in vitro kinase assays. Immune complexes were isolated with anti-α1c subunit antibody or preimmune serum and subjected to kinase assays with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of sonicated vesicles containing the PKC-activating lipid cofactors and DAG. Although endogenous cPKCα co-immunoprecipitated with α1c subunits under these conditions, exogenous cPKCα (alone or with a PKC peptide inhibitor; Promega catalog no. V5691) was added to some incubations as indicated. Fig. 3B shows that α1c subunits were labeled in the in vitro kinase assays by both exogenous and endogenous PKCs. α1c subunit phosphorylation increased when excess exogenous PKCα was added to the assays (and it was blocked in the presence of a PKC inhibitor). These results indicate that the α1c subunit is phosphorylated by PKC, rather than another kinase(s) that also might co-immunoprecipitate with the Cav1.2 channel complex. PKC Phosphorylates the α1c Subunit C Terminus—The sites for PKC phosphorylation of Cav1.2 α1c subunits have not been identified. Based upon electrophysiologic findings, PKC inhibitory modulation of channel activity has been mapped to several residues in the α1c subunit N terminus (Thr27 and Thr31) (33McHugh D. Sharp E.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12334-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), although evidence that this region is not directly phosphorylated in vitro by PKC has also been presented (23Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which we have confirmed (data not shown). Because cPKCα interacts directly with the C terminus, we hypothesized that regions within the C terminus may contain the authentic PKC phosphorylation sites. To map PKC phosphorylation sites on the α1c subunit, we utilized GST fusion proteins containing non-overlapping regions of the C terminus as substrates for in vitro PKC phosphorylation. Whereas cPKCα phosphorylated both regions 1509–1905 and 1906–2170 of the C terminus, nPKCϵ and aPKCζ phosphorylated primarily region 1906–2170 (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that individual PKC isoforms can exert distinct regulatory control on channel function by phosphorylating different regions of the α1c subunit. Previous studies mapped the PKA phosphorylation site on the α1c subunit to a PKA consensus motif (RRAS1928) located in the C terminus (24De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10392-10402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In vitro α1c subunit phosphorylation assays are consistent with this conclusion, as PKA induced the radiolabeling of fragment 1906–2170 (which encompasses the Ser1928 site) (Fig. 4B). α1c Ser1928 Is a PKC Phosphorylation Site—An examination of the amino acid sequence within fragment 1906–2170 revealed that Ser1928 represents a consensus PKC phosphorylation site (Fig. 5A) (34Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). PKA and cPKCα induced similar increases in 32P incorporation into GST-fused wild-type (WT) fragment 1906–2170; in each case, radiolabeling was nearly completely abrogated by a single substitution (S1928A) (Fig. 5B). Similarly, utilizing a phospho-specific antibody developed to detect Ser1928 phosphorylation, prominent immunoreactive bands were detected (with a range of mobilities corresponding to the GST-fused full-length protein as well as the proteolytic/truncated fragments) in both PKA and cPKCα phosphorylation assays in GST-fused WT fragment 1906–2170 (Fig. 5C). In contrast, no anti-phospho-Ser1928 antibody immunoreactivity was detected when a single substitution (S1928A) was introduced into the substrate sequence. Similar to cPKCα, nPKCϵ and aPKCζ phosphorylated Ser1928 using GST-fused fragment 1906–2170 (Fig. 5D). Because Ser1928 represents a common target for PKA and PKC in vitro (Fig. 5, B and C) and PKA has been shown to form a macromolecular complex with Cav1.2, we sought to determine whether PKC directly phosphorylates Ser1928. The PKA inhibitor PKI-(5–24) specifically blocked phosphorylation of Ser1928 by PKA (but not cPKCα) of GST-fused fragment 1906–2170 (Fig. 5E) and full-length recombinant α1c expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5F). Similar to cPKCα, nPKCϵ and aPKCζ specifically phosphorylated Ser1928in vitro in full-length recombinant α1c (Fig. 5G). These results demonstrate that PKA and PKC can independently phosphorylate α1c Ser1928. Having validated the specificity of the phospho-Ser1928-specific antibody as a reagent to track kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the α1c C terminus, we used it to examine the phosphorylation status of full-length recombinant WT and S1928A α1c subunits expressed in HEK293 cells. Fig. 6A shows that WT α1c subunits (immunoprecipitated from quiescent HEK293 cells and subjected to immune complex kinase assays without lipid cofactors) displayed very low levels of Ser1928 phosphorylation (second lane); in contrast, Ser1928 phosphorylation was not detected when studies were performed on HEK293 cells expressing the S1928A mutant (first lane), despite equivalent expression and immunoprecipitation of WT and mutant α1c subunits (lower panels). WT α1c Ser1928 phosphorylation was increased by the addition of lipid cofactors to the in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 6A, fourth lane), consistent with Fig. 3 results showing that α1c subunits were recovered in complexes with cPKCα. Exogenously added cPKCα or PKA further increased WT α1c Ser1928 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, fifth and sixth lanes). Similar in vitro studies were performed on endogenous α1c subunits recovered from adult rat hearts. In native tissues (heart, brain, and skeletal muscle), the α1 subunit displayed a slight increase in mobility upon SDS-PAGE (relative to the mobility of full-length α1c subunits expressed in HEK293 cells) due to the previously described C-terminal truncation (35De Jongh K.S.

PCC 6803 using thioredoxin affinity chromatography, which was first applied to the survey of thioredoxin target proteins in chloroplasts (Motohashi, K., Kondoh, A., Stumpp, M. T., and Hisabori, T. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 98, 11224–11229). They are annotated as AhpC/TSA family protein (SLL1621) and antioxidant protein (SLR1198) in CyanoBase (Nakamura, Y., Kaneko, T., Hirosawa, M., Miyajima, N., and Tabata, S. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res., 26, 63–67). Based on sequence homology analysis SLL1621 and SLR1198 are categorized into type II peroxiredoxin and 1-Cys type peroxiredoxin, respectively. In vitro interaction between SLL1621 and thioredoxin was confirmed using the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we found that SLL1621 shows remarkable glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity. Disruption of the sll1621 gene had a dramatic effect on the viability of the cyanobacterial cells even under weak light conditions (50 μmol·m-2·s-1), suggesting this peroxiredoxin is essential for this cyanobacterium. In contrast, although the peroxidase activity of SLR1198 was scarcely detected, disruption of the gene, slr1198, certainly affected the growth rate of the cells. The results indicate the physiological significance of two different peroxiredoxins as an anti-oxidative stress system in cyanobacteria.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 54: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In plants, Prx proteins are categorized into four subclasses based on their different subunit composition and the position of the conserved cysteine residues. 2-Cys Prx is a homodimeric enzyme where the two subunits are linked via a disulfide bond in the oxidized form (2Cheong N.E. Choi Y.O. Lee K.O. Kim W.Y. Jung B.G. Chi Y.H. Jeong J.S. Kim K. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Goyer A. Haslekas C.

Chloroplastic Prx-Q, which is a homologue of the Escherichia coli bacterioferritin comigratory protein (Bcp), belongs to the second group and functions as a monomer (5Kong W. Shiota S. Shi Y.

The last subgroup is named type II Prx. Members of this subfamily can use thioredoxin (Trx) as an electron donor (10Choi Y.O. Cheong N.E. Lee K.O. Jung B.G. Hong C.H. Jeong J.H. Chi Y.H. Kim K. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but also glutaredoxin (Grx), which is used at higher efficiency (11Rouhier N. Gelhaye E.

This subclass has multiple isoforms localized in many subcellular compartments (12Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol.

Bot. 2002; 53: 1321-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the catalytic Cys residues of Prx proteins, which are oxidized during the peroxide reduction, have to be reduced by electron donors such as Trx, Grx, or cyclophilins for the next catalytic cycle (4Konig J.

Although broad substrate specificity has been reported for the Prx proteins (15Nogoceke E. Gommel D.U. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohe L. Biol.

The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is a prokaryotic photosynthetic microalgae, which is often used as a model organism for the study of photosynthesis and other important physiological processes of photosynthetic organisms. In addition, this organism was one of the first prokaryotes to be fully sequenced (18Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S.

DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). In the Synechocystis cells, the genes for 2-Cys Prx (sll0755), 1-Cys Prx (slr1198), Prx-Q (sll0221 and slr0242), and type II Prx (sll1621) were revealed by genome analysis. In addition, multiple genes for Trx and Trx-like proteins (sll0685, sll1057, sll1980, slr0233, slr0623, slr1139, and slr1796) were found. The reason for the existence of multiple genes for various Prx proteins, Trx, and their homologues in this unicellular microalgae is still unknown. So far, not very much is known on the relation between these multiple Prx and Trx proteins in cyanobacteria. Among various Prx proteins in Synechocystis, the biochemical properties and the in vivo role of 2-Cys Prx, which is the gene product of sll0755, were investigated in detail by Klughammer et al. (20Klughammer B. Baier M. Dietz K.J. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 104: 699-706Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Yamamoto et al. (21Yamamoto H. Miyake C. Dietz K.J. Tomizawa K. Murata N. Yokota A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, the role of the homologous peroxidase of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was recently reported (22Perelman A. Uzan A. Hacohen D. Schwarz R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In both strains, disruption of the gene for 2-Cys Prx certainly eliminated the tolerance against H2O2, supporting the role of this Prx as anti-oxidative stress protein, although the pathway of the reducing equivalents for 2-Cys Prx is not known. In contrast, Muller and Buchanan (23Muller E.G.D. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4008-4014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the significance of TrxM by gene disruption in Anacystis nidulans R2, whose present nomenclature is Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Disruption of the gene for TrxM, which corresponds to slr0623 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, gave lethality, suggesting this Trx gene is indispensable for photosynthetic growth. Gene disruption of a Trx-like protein in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, which corresponds to sll1980 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, was also examined (24Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the results the authors suggested that this Trx-like protein is essential for the correct assembly of a photosynthetic protein complex. However, these studies did not provide information on all interacting partners for Trx or Trx-like protein. Trx regulates the activity of various enzymes through formation or reduction of a disulfide bridge in the enzyme molecule (25Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 26Schürmann P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Jacquot J.P. Lancelin J.M. Meyer Y. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the last couple of years a number of studies have been attempted to elucidate the variety of target proteins of Trxs in plant cells, in chloroplasts, and in bacteria using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis (28Yano H. Wong J.H. Lee Y.M. Cho M.J. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By using the Trx-affinity chromatography, we identified two anti-oxidative stress proteins, type II Prx, SLL1621 and 1-Cys Prx group protein, SLR1198, as major counterpart proteins of Trx in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In the present study we investigated the physiological significance of these anti-oxidative stress proteins in cyanobacteria. Materials—Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Bioscience. DTT, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), glutathione reductase purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and glutaredoxin from E. coli were from Sigma. BCA Protein Assay Reagent was from Pierce. 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (AMS) was from Invitrogen. Other chemicals were the highest grade commercially available. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of TrxA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803—Genomic DNA from Synechocystis cells was used as a template for PCR. The coding region of trxA gene, slr1139, was amplified by PCR using two primers: 5′-cccggaattccatatgagtttactggaaatcaccgacg-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-ccccgctcgagttaaataaaatccaattcctctttc-3′ (XhoI). The restriction sites shown in parentheses are underlined in the sequences. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-23c (Novagen), and the DNA sequence of the obtained plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Prism 310, Applied Biosystems). The plasmid, TrxA-pET23c, was transformed into the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3), and the desired protein was overexpressed. The expressed protein was then purified at 0-4 °C as described previously (32Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified protein was determined by BCA Protein Assay Reagent using bovine serum albumin as standard. Preparation of Trx Mutant—The plasmid for the TrxA mutant, TrxAC34S whose active site sequence was mutated to WCGPS, was generated using the Mega-primer method (33Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with the expression plasmid of the slr1139 gene, TrxA-pET23c, as a template. The mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by the method as for the wild type TrxA. Preparation of the Trx-immobilized Resin—TrxA mutant (5 mg) in 100 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 mm NaCl was incubated with 2 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instruction. More than 95% of TrxAC34S was immobilized on the resin. Collection of the Target Protein by Immobilized Trx Mutant—To obtain the cytosol fraction, the glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (34Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar) was grown at 32 °C in BG-11 medium (35Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under continuous illumination with white fluorescent light (30-50 μmol·m-2·s-1). The liquid culture of Synechocystis cells was bubbled with air containing 1% (v/v) CO2. Cell growth was measured by absorbance at 730 nm, and cultures whose absorbance value reached to 1.0 were collected by centrifugation. The collected cells were washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and re-suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmp-aminobenzamidine-2HCl, 1 mm 6-amino-n-caproic acid, and 5 units/ml DNase. The cells were then disrupted by French Pressure Cell at 140 MPa, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 1 h, and the cytosol fraction was obtained as the supernatant. The precipitate was washed once with buffer and used as the crude thylakoid membrane fraction. The obtained cytosol fraction containing 25 mg of protein was incubated with 2 ml of TrxAC34S-immobilized resin, and the resin was washed completely as described (6Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 30Yamazaki D. Motohashi K. Kasama T. Hara Y. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The resin was then suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm DTT and was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C under gentle stirring. The eluted proteins were separated from the resin by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE was performed with 15% (w/v) acrylamide gel, and the separated protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. NH2-terminal Sequence—Each of the captured proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the NH2-terminal sequences of the proteins were determined by Edman degradation method with a peptide sequencer model PPSQ-21(Shimadzu). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Type II Prx and 1-Cys Prx—The coding region of type II Prx (sll1621) and that of 1-Cys Prx (slr1198) were amplified by a PCR method using the following combination of the primers: for type II Prx, 5′-cccggaattccatatgacccccgaacgagttcccagtg-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-ccccgctcgagttagccgacaaaagctttaacgggc-3′ (XhoI); and for 1-Cys Prx, 5′-cccggaattccatatggccttacaactcggtgatgttg-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-ccccgctcgagttacttattgggttggggggtcaaa-3′ (XhoI). The amplified DNA fragments were then cloned into NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-23c (Novagen), and the DNA sequences were confirmed. The obtained plasmids, type II Prx-pET23c and 1-Cys Prx-pET23c, were transformed into the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3), and the desired proteins were overexpressed. The expressed proteins were purified basically by the same method used for the purification of TrxA, although the desired peak fractions eluted at different salt concentrations. Peroxidase Activity—Trx-dependent peroxidase activity was measured by the coupled oxidation of NADPH using NADPH-Trx-reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtNTR) and TrxA at 25 °C (6Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). For the measurement of the activity of type II Prx, a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 20 μm TrxA, 5 μmAtNTR (expressed in E. coli as recombinant protein), and 0.5 mm NADPH was used. After the addition of 3.33 μm of type II Prx, the reaction was initiated by the addition of H2O2, t-BOOH, or CHP at the final concentrations of 0.5 mm, and the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. For 1-Cys Prx, a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 1 μm TrxA, 1 μmAtNTR, and 0.5 mm NADPH was used. To measure the glutathione (GSH)-dependent peroxidase activity, a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.23 unit/ml NADPH-glutathione reductase, 30 μm NADPH, and the indicated concentration of GSH was used (36Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 μm H2O2, t-BOOH or CHP, and the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. In Vitro Reduction of Prx Proteins—The oxidized forms of SLL1621 protein (type II Prx) was incubated with the combination of DTT and Trx, or GSH as indicated in the figure legends. Then the redox states of SLL1621 protein (type II Prx) were determined as follows. Briefly, the protein was precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) and collected by centrifugation. The obtained protein precipitates were then washed with acetone and dissolved in freshly prepared solution containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 10 mm AMS. Labeled proteins were then separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE using 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. In the case of SLR1198 protein (1-Cys Prx), the oxidized form protein was incubated with the combination of NADPH, AtNTR, and Trx as indicated in the figure legends. Then the redox states of SLR1198 protein (1-Cys Prx) were directly assessed by their difference in the mobility on nonreducing SDS-PAGE using 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Disruption of sll1621 and slr1198 Genes in Synechocystis—The DNA fragments encoding sll1621 and slr1198 genes were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a template. The primers were as follows: for sll1621, 5′-gacggtaatttcataacgttccg-3′ and 5′-ttcctcgggctacagcgggttgg-3′; for slr1198, 5′-cgcctctcggtggcctttttcaa-3′ and 5′-ttcgtcctgccacagttgccacg-3′. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cloning of the DNA fragment was verified by the nucleotide sequence. The resulting plasmid for sll1621 was digested with BamHI, which was introduced into the coding region of sll1621 by PCR, and a 2.0-kbp BamHI fragment encoding a streptomycin/spectinomycin-resistant cassette derived from plasmid pRL453 was ligated. In the case of slr1198, kanamycin-resistant cassette was inserted into the coding region (37Kobayashi M. Ishizuka T. Katayama M. Kanehisa M. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Pakrasi H.B. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Wild-type strain cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were transformed with the plasmid according to the method of (38Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on a BG11 plate containing 20 μg·ml-l spectinomycin or 20 μg·ml-l kanamycin. Cultivation of the mutant cells was performed under weak light conditions (10 μmol·m-2·s-1). Complete segregation was confirmed by PCR with the above combination of the primers using the total DNA extracted from the transformants as a template. Growth Experiment under Stress Conditions—Growth experiments under the stress conditions were performed in BG11 medium. The absorbance at 750 nm of the each culture aliquot was set as 0.05, and the growth rate was measured using Abs750. The culture flask was set on a shaker and incubated at 20 °C under the light in the presence of 1% (v/v) CO2 in air. Acquisition of Trx Target Candidates by Trx Affinity Chromatography—By using the immobilized TrxAC34S, we successfully captured potential target proteins in the cytosol fraction of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained when the TrxA isoform, SLR0623, was used as an immobilized protein for Trx affinity chromatography (data not shown). By NH2-terminal Edman sequencing, we analyzed the NH2-terminal sequences of five protein bands, and their annotations were surveyed. We assigned these five proteins as shown in Table I. In CyanoBase (39Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), sll1621 is annotated as the gene for an AhpC/TSA family protein, and slr1198 is the gene for an antioxidant protein, respectively. From the comparison of the amino acid sequences, the gene product of sll1621 is categorized into a family of type II Prx and those of slr1198 into a family of 1-Cys Prx (Fig. 2).Table IList of the target protein candidates of TrxA captured in the present studyNo.Molecular massAnalyzed sequencesAnnotated geneAnnotationConserved Cys/total CyskDaI23.6ALQLGDVVPDFTQEXSslr1198Antioxidant protein1/3II21.2MTPERVPSVsll1621AhpC/TSA family protein2/4III18.1MFDVFTRVVsll1577Phycocyanin β subunit3/3IV17.2MQDAITAVINTADVQslr1986Allophycocyanin-β2/2V9.2MSINAYKLATTssl2245Unknown proteinND/1aND, not determined.

Due to the lack of the information of similar proteins in the whole databases, we could not determine the number of conserved cysteines. Open table in a new tab In addition, we captured two phycocyanin family proteins by this procedure, although the redox-related response of phycocyanin is not known at all (Table I). In the case of SSL2245, which is annotated as an “unknown protein” in CyanoBase, none of the similar protein was found in the whole protein databases. Because SSL2245 has only one cysteine, this protein may dimerize and form the intermolecular disulfide bond, which is a requirement to be captured by this method. Localization and Expression Levels of Prx Proteins in Synechocystis—Antibodies against the two Prx proteins were prepared using their recombinant proteins. Both Prx proteins were localized in the cytosol but not in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3, A and B). The amount of the proteins in the cytosol fraction was estimated from their intensities of the bands on the Western blot. They were ∼6 μg/mg cytosol proteins for type II Prx (SLL1621) and ∼5 μg/mg cytosol proteins for 1-Cys Prx (SLR1198). Changes in the amount of both Prx proteins in the cell were examined in the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 3C). The same results were obtained when 1 mm H2O2 was used instead. Kobayashi et al. (37Kobayashi M. Ishizuka T. Katayama M. Kanehisa M. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Pakrasi H.B. Ikeuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) recently reported that the amount of transcripts for sll1621 in the cell drastically increased when the cells were cultivated in the presence of 10 μm methylviologen, a strong reactive oxygen species inducer, under light conditions. However, we could not detect any remarkable changes in the amount of the Prx proteins under these conditions. Peroxidase Activities of Prx Proteins—Next, we investigated the biochemical properties of the recombinant Prx proteins expressed in E. coli. First, the peroxidase activities were examined. Type II Prx, SLL1621 could reduce H2O2, t-BOOH, and CHP coupled with oxidation of NADPH in the presence of TrxA and AtNTR, although the activity was considerably low (Table II). Therefore, we tested other electron donors for this Prx, and found that GSH is the best electron donor (Table II). In this case, t-BOOH was a much better substrate than H2O2. Recently, Rouhier et al. (11Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautiere P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Fay E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P.

However, the acceleration of the peroxidase activity by the addition of Grx was only 10-20% in our case (Fig. 4 and Table II). Even in the absence of Grx, our SLL1621 exhibited a significant peroxidase activity (Table II) compared with the activity reported (see Table II of Ref. 11Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautiere P.E. Brun A.

Open table in a new tab In contrast, the recombinant SLL1198 did show a very low peroxidase activity (0.2 nmol/mg of protein/min) in the presence of NADPH, TrxA, and AtNTR, using H2O2 as a substrate. The combination of glutathione reductase and GSH was not applicable for the activity measurement of this protein. In Vitro Reduction of Prx Proteins—SLL1621 has four cysteines in the molecule. Based on sequence alignments, Cys55 and Cys80 seem to be the catalytically critical cysteines. Here, oxidation or reduction of the cysteines in SLL1621 was investigated (Fig. 5). The SLL1621 protein was oxidized using 0.1 mmt-BOOH. Subsequent reduction of the protein was performed with the combination of DTT and TrxA. Reduction by GSH was also examined. The redox state of Prx was visualized using AMS modification. An intermolecular disulfide formation under oxidized conditions and Trx-dependent reduction was clearly observed (Fig. 5B). In addition, GSH could reduce the oxidized form SLL1621 efficiently (Fig. 5C) as expected from the results shown in Table II. In contrast SLR1198 has three cysteines, and Cys45 is the only conserved cysteine. According to the reported catalytic cycle of 1-Cys Prx, the catalytic cysteine is oxidized by reactive oxygen species and converted to sulfenic acid (41Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Then sulfenic acid will be"
https://openalex.org/W2070651949,"Estrogen plays a critical role in development and maintenance of female reproductive and mammary tissues, but is also involved in maintenance of cardiovascular, skeletal, and neural function. Although it is widely accepted that the estrogen-occupied receptor mediates its effects by interacting with estrogen response elements (EREs) residing in target genes, a number of estrogen-responsive genes contain no identifiable ERE. To understand how estrogen-responsive genes lacking EREs but containing activator protein 1 (AP-1) and Sp1 sites respond to hormone treatment, we have identified four discrete regions of the human progesterone receptor gene that contain AP-1 or Sp1 sites and examined their abilities to modulate transcription in the presence of 17β-estradiol, ICI 182,780, tamoxifen, raloxifene, genistein, or daidzein. Transient cotransfection assays demonstrated that ERα was a more potent activator of transcription than ERβ in bone, uterine, and mammary cells. The Sp1-containing promoters were substantially more potent transcriptional enhancers than the AP-1-containing promoters, but a 1.5-kb region of the human progesterone receptor gene containing both AP-1 and Sp1 sites was the most hormone-responsive promoter tested. The ability of ligands to modulate transcription of AP-1- or Sp1-containing promoters was dependent on cell context, but the expression of AP-1 or Sp1 proteins was not necessarily related to transcriptional response. Taken together, these studies have helped to delineate the roles of ERα and ERβ in modulating transcription of genes containing AP-1 and Sp1 sites and define the effects of widely used, pharmacologic agents in target cells with distinct cellular environments."

To investigate the pathways that mediate Wnt-dependent cell motility, we treated Chinese hamster ovary cells with Wnt-3a-conditioned medium and monitored changes in cell shape and movement. Wnt-3a induced cell spreading, formation of protrusive structures, reorganization of stress fibers and migration. Although Wnt-3a stabilized β-catenin, two inhibitors of the β-catenin/canonical pathway, Dickkopf-1 and a dominant-negative T cell factor construct, did not reduce motility. The small GTPase RhoA also was activated by Wnt-3a. In contrast to β-catenin signaling, inhibition of Rho kinase partially blocked motility. Because Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins are effectors of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling, we used immunofluorescent analysis and small interference RNA technology to evaluate the role of Dvl in cell motility. Specific knock-down of Dvl-2 expression markedly reduced Wnt-3a-dependent changes in cell shape and movement, suggesting that this Dvl isoform had a predominant role in mediating Wnt-3a-dependent motility in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

The Wnts comprise a large family of secreted glycoproteins that have multiple roles in the development of organisms ranging from worms and flies to mammals. Wnts regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, polarity, survival, and migration and affect the organization of the body plan, organogenesis, and tissue patterning (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

This pathway has an important role in many developmental processes as well as neoplasia and was shown to participate in the migration of bladder carcinoma and osteosarcoma cells (8Müller T. Bain G.

However, a wealth of data indicates that noncanonical Wnt signaling has a major role in regulating cell polarity and movement (10Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The planar cell polarity pathway was first defined in Drosophila as a Fz- and Dishevelled-dependent (Dsh in Drosophila and Dvl in vertebrates) mechanism that controls epithelial cell polarity (11Boutros M.

We used soluble biologically active Wnt-3a, which had been previously shown to stimulate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (28Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, a line that had served in prior analysis of Wnt signaling (29Capelluto D.G. Kutateladze T.G. Habas R. Finkielstein C.V. He X. Overduin M. Nature. 2002; 419: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We documented Wnt-dependent changes in cell shape and enhancement of cell movement in wound healing (scratch) and transwell assays. Cell motility was not inhibited by disruption of the β-catenin pathway but was partially blocked by a ROCK inhibitor. Surprisingly, motility was markedly decreased when Dvl-2 expression was specifically reduced by small interference RNA methodology. In cells expressing a normal level of Dvl-2, Wnt-3a treatment elicited changes in the distribution of Dvl-2 protein consistent with a role in cell movement. These findings provide useful insights into the mechanisms responsible for Wnt-dependent cell motility and in particular indicate an important function for Dvl-2 in mediating CHO cell movement elicited by Wnt-3a.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—A murine Wnt-3a cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Shinji Takada, was transfected into L cells, and a stable clonal line was selected that released β-catenin stabilizing activity into serum-free CM. Wnt-3a CM and CM from nontransfected L cells were harvested from confluent monolayers that had been grown in serum-containing medium but subsequently were incubated for 72 h in serum-free EMEM supplemented with nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Typically, CM was stored at -80 °C; once thawed, medium was kept refrigerated and retained activity for several weeks (activity was lost if material was subjected to another round of freeze-thawing). Recombinant secreted Frizzled-related protein-1 (sFRP-1) was purified as previously described (30Üren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Human Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), human fibronectin was from Roche Applied Science (catalog number 1080938), calf intestine phosphatase was from Promega (Madison, WI; catalog number M1821), antibody against the C terminus of β-catenin was from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA; catalog number C19220), and antibodies to Dvl-2 (sc-13974 for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation and sc-7399 for immunofluorescent staining), Dvl-3 (sc-8027), RhoA (sc-418), and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70, sc-7298) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Cell Culture and Transfection—Early passage CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Transfections were performed with GenePorter 2 (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, using 1 μg of DNA/well in a 6-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well). A plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of TCF-4E (DN-TCF) was kindly provided by Drs. Frank McCormick and Osamu Tetsu (31Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). The TCF/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-responsive reporter plasmid, pTOPFLASH, was a gift from Dr. Hans Clevers (32Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W.

Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescent Staining and Assessment of Cell Morphology— The cells were seeded on glass coverslips in complete Ham's F-12 medium. After 4-6 h, the medium was replaced with either Wnt-3a or L CM, and cells were incubated for the indicated times. Then they were fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 with PBS for 5 min. After blocking with 5% BSA with PBS for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-Dvl-2 diluted 1:400 in 2% BSA with PBS, followed by fluorescent labeled donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Phalloidin (Alexa Fluor 568; Molecular Probes) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dihydrochloride; Sigma-Aldrich) were included during this 30-min period for F-actin and nuclear staining, respectively. In some experiments, the cells were only stained with phalloidin. A Leica DM IRB fluorescent microscope with 63× objective lens (Germany) and SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc. Sterling Heights, MI) were used to detect fluorescence. The images were processed with Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 (Adobe Inc., San Jose, CA). For measurement of cell surface area in the plane where cells were in contact with the coverslip, the images were obtained with a 20× objective lens from 10 random locations on a single coverslip and analyzed with ImageGaugeV4.21 software (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Japan).Cell Migration Assays—Scratch or wound healing assays were performed with CHO cells seeded on glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) that had been precoated with fibronectin (100 μg/ml). After cells were ∼80% confluent, the monolayer was scratched with a pipette tip (Continental Laboratory Product, San Diego, CA; catalog number 2142S). The medium was replaced with Wnt-3a or L CM, and cultures were incubated for 6-24 h in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells were examined with an Axiovert S100 (Zeiss, Germany) inverted microscope (10× objective lens) and Photometrix Sensys camera (Tucson, AZ).Transwell assays were performed with 6.5-mm-diameter, Falcon cell culture inserts (8-μm pore size; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA; catalog number (35Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) 3097) and 24-well cell culture plates. CHO cells were trypsinized, resuspended in serum-free EMEM, and transferred to the upper chamber (2 × 104 cells in 500 μl); an equal volume of Wnt-3a or L CM was added to the lower chamber. The cells were maintained for 6-8 h in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Following incubation, the media were aspirated, and the cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab, whereas cells that had migrated to the lower surface were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 30 min and counted (bright field image with Leica DM IRB fluorescent microscope, 40× objective lens). In experiments with sFRP-1 (10 μg/ml), CM was preincubated with the protein for 20 min at room temperature prior to addition to the lower chamber. For Dkk-1 (1 μg/ml), the cells were preincubated with protein for 20 min at room temperature before transfer to the upper chamber. When experiments were performed with Y-27632, the ROCK inhibitor was preincubated for 20 min at room temperature both with the cells and CM in separate test tubes prior to addition to the upper and lower chambers, respectively. For DN-TCF and Dvl-2 RNAi experiments, the cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection and transferred to the upper chamber.Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Phosphatase Treatment—CHO monolayers (70-80% confluent) were incubated in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium overnight and then treated with Wnt-3a or L CM for varying periods. Where indicated, CM was preincubated with sFRP-1 for 20 min at room temperature. When Dkk-1 was used, the cells were preincubated with the protein for 20 min at 37 °C. Following CM treatment, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS and lysed with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were clarified in a desktop centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). For all of the immunoblots, 30 μg of protein were loaded per lane. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), which was blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl), incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized with SuperSignal Pico or Femto chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce) using BioMax films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysate (500 μg) was incubated with Dvl antibody (2 μg) overnight at 4 °C in a rotary shaker, followed by the addition of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation for 1-2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed twice with cell lysis buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. Phosphatase treatment was performed as previously described (33Semenov M.V. Snyder M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Rho A Activation Assay—RhoA activation was demonstrated with a GST-RBD pull-down assay, essentially as previously described (22Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Because the recombinant fusion protein was labile, aliquots of bacteria expressing the protein were snap-frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until the day of the assay, when the protein was bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CHO cells were grown to ∼80% confluence, serum-starved overnight, and then treated with Wnt-3a or L CM for the indicated times. The cells were washed and lysed, and 1.0-1.5-mg lysates were incubated with GST-RBD agarose (20 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C in a rotary shaker. The beads were pelleted and washed, and proteins recovered for immunoblotting with RhoA antibody. Whole cell lysates were similarly immunoblotted for comparison. Similar results were obtained with the Rho Activation Kit from Upstate Cell Signaling (Lake Placid, NY; catalog number 17-294).Small Interference RNA—pSilencer 1.0-U6 (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used as a vector to introduce hairpin loop double-stranded RNA into cells to disrupt endogenous Dvl expression. The targeted sequence of Dvl-2 was: 5′-CUUUGAGAACAUGAGCAAC-3′. The following oligonucleotides were made to order by Invitrogen and annealed according to instructions from Ambion: sense, 5′-CTTTGAGAACATGAGCAACTTCAAGAGAGTTGCTCATGTTCTCAAAGTTTTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AATTAAAAAACTTTGAGAACATGAGCAACTCTCTTGAAGTTGCTCATGTTCTCAAAGGGCC-3′. The oligonucleotide duplex was ligated into ApaI/EcoRI-digested pSilencer vector according to the protocol from Ambion. One μg of the Dvl-2 RNAi construct or vector control was transfected into HEK293 (4 × 105) or CHO (2 × 105) cells with GenePorter2, following the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for expression analysis or functional studies.Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—RNA was prepared from CHO cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at -80 °C. Complementary DNA was generated with the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system from Invitrogen. Subsequent PCR was performed with the following pairs of primers: Dvl-1 forward: 5′-GCGGAGACCAAAATCATCTACCAC-3′, Dvl-1 reverse: 5′-GACCATAGACTCTGTGCCTGTCTC-3′; Dvl-2 forward: 5′-CGCGTCGGTTTGCGGGTGTG-3′, Dvl-2 reverse: 5′-GAAGGATGGAGGCCTTGAGTC-3′; Dvl-3 forward: 5′-GAGCCATGGGCGAGACCAAG-3′, Dvl-3 reverse: 5′-GTTCTGTGGAGCTGCTGAACCTGC-3′; and β-actin forward: 5′-CCACTGGCATCGTGATGGAC-3′, β-actin reverse: 5′-GCGGATGTCCACGTCACACT-3′. The predicted sizes of PCR products were 420 bp (Dvl-1), 496 bp (Dvl-2), 624 bp (Dvl-3), and 428 bp (β-actin). All of the PCR experiments were performed with the same set of conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; amplification for 30 cycles, each consisting of incubation at 94 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s and extension at 72 °C for 8 min.Statistical Analysis—The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in cell spreading (area of cell/coverslip contact) among the treatment groups. The significance of differences in data obtained from transwell and luciferase reporter assays was determined with Student's two-tailed t test. The differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSWnt-3a Stimulates Morphological Changes and CHO Cell Motility—CHO cells exhibited several changes in shape following exposure to Wnt-3a CM that were characteristic of migratory cells. Treatment with Wnt-3a CM induced a rearrangement of stress fibers that was detectable with phalloidin staining within 1 h and prominent by 6 h. A portion of cells had protrusive structures and elongated bodies containing stress fibers (Fig. 1). These morphological changes were inhibited by preincubation of the Wnt-3a medium with recombinant sFRP-1, supporting the view that the effects were attributable to Wnt protein (30Üren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 34Jones S.E. Jomary C. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Wnt-3a CM also stimulated cell spreading. Morphometric analysis documented a moderate increase in the spreading of most cells, because the median area of cell/coverslip contact was 1121 μm2 for cells treated with CM from nontransfected L929 (L) cells, whereas that of Wnt-3a CM-treated cells was 1760 μm2. More striking was a Wnt-3a-dependent increase in the number of cells with a large area of cell/coverslip contact; 27.1% of the Wnt-3a-treated cells had an area > 3000 μm2, whereas only 5.3% of L CM-treated cells were of comparable size. The corresponding proportion of cells in the Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1 treatment group was 10.3%, confirming that the abundance of large, flattened cells was a Wnt effect (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Wnt-3a induced morphological changes in CHO cells.Left panels, CHO cells were seeded on glass coverslips and subsequently treated for 6 h with L or Wnt-3a CM. The panels show phalloidin staining of representative cells from cultures incubated with L CM, Wnt-3a CM, or Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1 (10 μg/ml). The scale bar (50 μm) is applicable to all three panels. Right panels, histograms illustrate distribution of cell surface area in the plane of contact with coverslip for each treatment group (n = number of cells analyzed). The median areas of contact for cells incubated with L CM, Wnt-3a CM, or Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1 were 1121, 1760, and 1358 μm2, respectively. Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, the difference in each pair-wise comparison of median values was highly significant (Wnt-3a CM versus L CM, p = 5.89 × 10-6; Wnt-3a CM versus Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1, p = 0.012; Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1 versus L CM, p = 0.009). The proportions of cells with areas of contact greater than 3000 μm2 (to the right of the dotted lines) for L CM, Wnt-3a CM, and Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1 were 5.3, 27.1, and 10.3%, respectively. The differences between Wnt-3a CM versus L CM and Wnt-3a CM versus Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1 were highly significant (p = 0.0007 and p = 0.0116, respectively), whereas the difference between Wnt-3a CM + sFRP-1 versus L CM was not significant (p = 0.366).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess cell mobility in response to Wnt-3a CM, we performed a scratch or in vitro wound healing assay (Fig. 2A). The cells were seeded onto glass-bottomed dishes that had been precoated with fibronectin. When ∼80% confluent, the monolayer was scratched with a pipette tip, and the culture fluid was replaced either with Wnt-3a or L CM. By 6 h, the cells treated with Wnt-3a CM had become reoriented at the boundary of the denuded area with their long axes pointing toward the open space. Many cells had migrated into this space after 24 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast, little movement of cells into this area was seen in cultures incubated with L CM or Wnt-3a CM containing sFRP-1, indicating that cell migration was Wnt-dependent.We observed chemotactic activity of Wnt-3a CM in a standard transwell assay (Fig. 2B). In this scheme, the cells were placed in the upper chamber with serum-free EMEM and separated from the lower chamber containing test medium by a filter with an 8-μm pore size. After 6 h, very few cells had migrated to the bottom of the filter when EMEM was in the lower chamber. A larger fraction of cells passed through the filter when L CM was in the lower chamber, and the number more than doubled to 20-30% of the total cell population following exposure to Wnt-3a CM (Fig. 2B). When CM was added to the top chamber rather than the bottom, there was little difference in response to Wnt-3a or L CM, demonstrating that the previously described results were due to enhanced directional movement. The cells that migrated through the filter in response to Wnt-3a CM had an elongated shape with prominent extensions, whereas cells exposed to L CM retained a more rounded shape and a smoother surface with few extensions (Fig. 2C). This implied that L CM stimulated an amoeboid-type movement, whereas Wnt treatment induced sustained changes in cell shape that augmented migration. Preincubation of Wnt-3a CM with sFRP-1 reduced activity in the transwell assay by >80%. sFRP-1 also had an inhibitory effect on L CM in this assay (Fig. 2, B and C).Canonical Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway Is Activated by Wnt-3a CM but Not Required for Motility or Associated Changes in Cell Shape—As previously reported for L cells (28Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), Wnt-3a CM stimulated a large increase in β-catenin protein in CHO cells (Fig. 3A). This effect was seen in whole cell lysates after 1 h, maximal at 3 h, and still evident at 24 h. In contrast, only weak stimulation was observed with L CM. The accumulation of β-catenin in cells treated with Wnt-3a CM was markedly reduced by 10 μg/ml of sFRP-1 or 1 μg/ml of Dkk-1 (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3β-Catenin pathway was stimulated by Wnt-3a CM but not required for migration in transwell assay.A, lysates from CHO cells incubated with L CM or Wnt-3a CM for the indicated times (h) were immunoblotted (IB) with antibodies to β-catenin and HSP-70. B, immunoblot analysis was performed as in A, only the cells were incubated for 3 h, and some were treated with Wnt-3a CM plus sFRP-1 (10 μg/ml) or Dkk-1 (1 μg/ml). C, transwell assays were performed with L or Wnt-3a CM as described in the legend for Fig. 2B, either in the absence or in the presence of Dkk-1 (1 μg/ml). D, phalloidin staining of representative CHO cells treated with L or Wnt-3a CM plus Dkk-1 (1 μg/ml). The scale bar (50 μm) pertains to both panels. E, TOPFLASH reporter activity was measured in CHO cells transiently transfected either with control (ctl.) or DN-TCF vector and incubated with Wnt-3a CM. Activity was measured in arbitrary units of luminescence. The results are the means ± S.E. of transfections performed in triplicate in a representative experiment. F, transwell assays were performed with L or Wnt-3a CM as described in the legend for Fig. 2B, using cells that had been transiently transfected either with control or DN-TCF vector. The experiments in this figure were performed at least three times with similar results. The differences in responses of cells transfected with control versus DN-TCF vector were not statistically significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether β-catenin signaling was required for cell motility, trans"

Yet the mechanisms responsible for its functions in bone are largely unknown. Here we report that the expression of amphiregulin (AR), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, is rapidly and highly up-regulated by PTH in several osteoblastic cell lines and bone tissues. Other osteotropic hormones (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and prostaglandin E2) also strongly stimulate AR expression. We found all EGF-like ligands and their receptors are expressed in osteoblasts, but AR is the only member that is highly regulated by PTH. Functional studies demonstrated that although AR is a potent growth factor for preosteoblasts, it completely inhibits further differentiation. AR also strongly and quickly stimulated Akt and ERK phosphorylation and c-fos and c-jun expression in an EGF receptor-dependent manner. Moreover, AR null mice displayed significantly less tibial trabecular bone than wild-type mice. Taken together, we have identified a novel growth factor that is PTH-regulated and appears to have an important role in bone metabolism.

Paradoxically, PTH has two opposite effects on bone if administered in different ways. Although continuous administration causes bone loss, intermittent injection increases bone volume and bone density (1Tam C.S. Heersche J.N. Murray T.M. Parsons J.A. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 2Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner.

To date, PTH is the only osteoporosis treatment that promotes bone formation. The primary target of PTH in bone is the osteoblast, which expresses a single PTH receptor (PTH1R), a G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor (4Juppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Upon PTH binding, both protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling pathways are activated, and consequently the expression of many genes are altered (5Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Recently, we performed microarray experiments to study the gene expression profile changes in PTH-treated UMR 106-01 cells, a rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line (6Qin L. Qiu P. Wang L. Li X. Swarthout J.T. Soteropoulos P. Tolias P. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19723-19731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A total of 125 known genes were identified as PTH-regulated. Amphiregulin (AR), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was one of those genes.The EGF family members are divided into two classes (7Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6550-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The first class, also known as EGF-like ligands, all bind to the EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), which includes EGF, AR, and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α), which bind to EGFR exclusively, and heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), beta-cellulin, and epiregulin, which bind both EGFR and ErbB4. The second class, collectively termed neuregulins, bind directly to the receptors ErbB3 and/or ErbB4. The EGFR (ErbB1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase and lies at the beginning of a complex signal transduction cascade that modulates cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation (8Yarden Y. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: S3-S8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the EGFR undergoes dimerization and phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in its intracellular domain, thus activating several important cellular signal transduction pathways. The major signaling routes are the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (9Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathways (10Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). It is now known that ErbB2 is the preferred coreceptor for the EGFR, and the heterodimeric receptor complex signals more potently than a homodimer of the EGFR (8Yarden Y. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: S3-S8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).AR was first isolated from conditioned medium of MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (11Shoyab M. Plowman G.D. McDonald V.L. Bradley J.G. Todaro G.J. Science. 1989; 243: 1074-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 12Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Bradley J.G. Todaro G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6528-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). AR is bifunctional because it inhibits the growth of many human tumor cells but stimulates the proliferation of other cells such as normal fibroblasts and keratinocytes (13Plowman G.D. Green J.M. McDonald V.L. Neubauer M.G. Disteche C.M. Todaro G.J. Shoyab M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 14Cook P.W. Mattox P.A. Keeble W.W. Pittelkow M.R. Plowman G.D. Shoyab M. Adelman J.P. Shipley G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Similar to EGF, AR is produced as a precursor transmembrane protein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to yield the mature protein. So far, there have been no reports of AR production or function in bone. However, EGF has been shown to have several effects on bone cells or on bone: it stimulates osteoblast proliferation (15Ng K.W. Partridge N.C. Niall M. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), decreases alkaline phosphatase (16Kumegawa M. Hiramatsu M. Hatakeyama K. Yajima T. Kodama H. Osaki T. Kurisu K. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and collagen production (17Hata R. Hori H. Nagai Y. Tanaka S. Kondo M. Hiramatsu M. Utsumi N. Kumegawa M. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), changes bone nodule formation (18Antosz M.E. Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and yet, has catabolic effects on bone (19Raisz L.G. Simmons H.A. Sandberg A.L. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), i.e. similar to AR, bifunctional effects. Nevertheless, the production, detailed mechanism, and the significance of the EGF signaling pathway in bone are not well understood.In this paper, we demonstrate that AR is a general immediate response gene for PTH action in bone. It has profound effects on osteoblasts because it strongly stimulates the growth of preosteoblasts while it inhibits the differentiation and mineralization of mature osteoblasts. Its role in normal bone development and in PTH function will be discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Synthetic human PTH(1–38) was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Compound 32, compound 56, wortmannin, and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25-(OH)2D3) were purchased from Calbiochem. Rat PTH(1–34), recombinant human AR, human EGF, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies for ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for Akt and phospho-Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).Cell Culture—UMR 106-01 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. For experiments, the cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at 1.2 × 104 cells/cm2 in the same medium overnight and then switched to serum-free MEM for 2 days before the addition of appropriate agents. Rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells were obtained from neonatal rat calvariae by sequential digestions with collagenase and trypsin as described previously (20Shalhoub V. Conlon D. Tassinari M. Quinn C. Partridge N. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum until confluence at day 7. Then the medium was switched to differentiation medium (BGJb medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid). MC3T3 cells were maintained in MEM plus 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. After confluence, cells were cultured in the same differentiation medium. Before PTH treatment, both types of cells were serum starved for 1 day.In Vivo Injection of PTH—Four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, about 75 g, were purchased from Hilltop (Scottdale, PA). Rats were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (0.9% saline solution) or hPTH(1–38) (8 μg/100 g) and euthanized using CO2 at 0.5, 1, 4, or 8 h after injection. The primary spongiosa samples from distal femur were harvested as described previously (21Onyia J.E. Bidwell J. Herring J. Hulman J. Hock J.M. Bone. 1995; 17: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The animal protocols were approved by Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Analysis of mRNA Abundance by Real Time RT-PCR—Cells or tissues were harvested at the indicated time points after hormone treatments. Total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma) followed with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). A TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA. Following this, PCR was performed on Opticon (MJ Research) using a SYBR Green PCR Core kit (Applied Biosystems). Each analysis was performed two or three times with independent sets of cells or tissues from hormone treatment to RT-PCR to obtain the mean value ± S.E. shown in the figures. The primers used for the RT-PCR are summarized in the supplemental table. For UMR 106-01 and MC3T3 cells, rat and mouse β-actin was used as an internal control. For femoral samples and primary osteoblastic cells, rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control.DNA Synthesis Measurement—Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into macromolecules was used to assess DNA synthesis. Rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells were seeded at 4 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Cells were then serum starved for 1 day before being treated with appropriate agents overnight. Cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) for the final 3 h of incubation. DNA containing incorporated radiolabel was collected onto glass fiber filters using a semiautomatic cell harvester (Skatron), whereas unincorporated [3H]thymidine was removed by exhaustive water elution. The incorporation was assayed by liquid scintillation counting. Experiments were performed with three samples/group and repeated twice. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test.Cell Counting—Rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 6.2 × 104 cells/well. On the next day (day 1), the medium was switched to serum-free MEM. On days 2 and day 4, fresh MEM containing different amounts of AR was added. The cells were detached from the plates with trypsin/EDTA, and the cell numbers were counted using a hemacytometer on day 6. Experiments were performed with three samples/group and repeated twice. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test.Cell Cycle Analysis—Rat primary calvarial osteoblastic cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish. Cells were serum starved the next day for 1 day before treatment with AR or EGFR inhibitors overnight. One million cells were trypsinized, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol for at least 1 h on ice. Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with propidium iodine solution containing ribonuclease A. The cell cycle of stained cells was analyzed by Beckman Coulter XL.Alizarin Red Staining and Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Staining— For alizarin red staining, cells were fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 1 h and stained with 40 mm alizarin red for 10 min. Then cells were washed five times for 20 min each with water and then photographed. For alkaline phosphatase activity staining, cells were stained with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium liquid substrate system (Sigma) for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by washing with water.Immunoblotting—Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (22Swarthout J.T. Tyson D.R. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Partridge N.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Microcomputed Tomography (microCT) Measurement of AR Null and Wild-type Mice—AR null mice (B6/129) were described previously (23Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A breeding colony was established using heterozygous mice to provide littermate controls. The femora and tibiae were harvested from 4-week-old AR null mice and their wild-type littermates and were subjected to microCT analyses. The animal protocol was approved by Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The trabecular architecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis was measured using a microCT 20 (Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). After an initial scout scan, a total of 100 slices with an increment of 9 μm was obtained on each bone sample starting 0.3 mm below the growth plate. The area for analysis was outlined within the trabecular compartment, excluding the cortical and subcortical bone. A three-dimensional analysis was done to determine bone volume, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, and connectivity density. Cortical bone parameters were measured on the mid shaft of the femur. Ten slices of the diaphysis were made, and the same segmentation parameters were used for analysis. The periosteal surface was outlined, and a two-dimensional analysis was done to determine bone volume and periosteal perimeter. The endocortical surface was outlined and the analysis repeated to determine endocortical perimeter. The mean cortical thickness was determined by distance measurements at eight different points on the cortical slice. Data were analyzed by Dunnett's one-way analysis of variance using SigmaStat software (SPSS Sciences, Chicago).RESULTSPTH Stimulates AR Expression Both in Vitro and in Vivo— Recently we identified 125 PTH-regulated genes in UMR 106-01 cells using microarray technology (6Qin L. Qiu P. Wang L. Li X. Swarthout J.T. Soteropoulos P. Tolias P. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19723-19731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). AR (also known as schwannoma-derived growth factor) mRNA was shown to be stimulated more than 2-fold after 4 h and 12 h with 10-8 m rat PTH(1–34) treatment. Real time RT-PCR quantitatively proved that AR is indeed an early rPTH-responsive gene in this osteoblastic cell line (Fig. 1A). The mRNA expression of AR dramatically increased about 23-fold after 1 h of 10-8 m rPTH(1–34) treatment. This stimulation then decreased, as the fold change was about 11-fold at 4 h of PTH treatment, but was maintained at a significant level even at 12 h (8-fold). As shown in Fig. 1B, the stimulation of AR expression is PTH dose-dependent. Significant stimulation was observed at 10-10 m rPTH(1–34) (4-fold) and higher concentrations (15-fold at 10-9 m and 23-fold at 10-8 m). No obvious PTH effect was detected at 10-11 and 10-12 m. The real time RT-PCR product was sequenced, and the result completely matches the rat AR cDNA sequence (data not shown).To study whether AR is a ubiquitous PTH target gene, we tested two other PTH-responsive osteoblastic cell preparations: rat calvarial primary osteoblastic cells (Fig. 1C) and mouse MC3T3 cells (Fig. 1D). The primary osteoblastic cells undergo proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization phases in vitro. Rat PTH(1–34) strongly induced AR expression in those cells, with the highest induction (23-fold) in the mineralization phase and the lowest induction (5-fold) in the proliferation phase. In all phases the strongest induction of AR occurred at 1 h. It is worth noting that the basal expression of AR did not change among three phases (data not shown). In MC3T3 cells, a significant increase in AR expression was also observed at early time points (4-fold at 1 h and 3-fold at 2 h) of PTH treatment.It is known that intermittent injection of PTH into young rats increases bone and mineral density (24Gunness-Hey M. Hock J.M. Metab. Bone Dis. Relat. Res. 1984; 5: 177-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Expression of several genes, such as c-fos, IL-6, and myc, which are important for PTH actions in bone, have been found to be regulated by acute PTH injection in rat osteoblast-enriched femoral metaphyseal primary spongiosa (21Onyia J.E. Bidwell J. Herring J. Hulman J. Hock J.M. Bone. 1995; 17: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PTH regulates AR in vivo, we injected human PTH(1–38) (8 μg/100 g) into young male rats and harvested the femoral metaphyses at various time points. As shown in Fig. 1E, the level of AR mRNA was elevated dramatically to about 12-fold after 1 h of PTH injection and decreased to about 2-fold after 4 h, demonstrating that amphiregulin is actually regulated by PTH in vivo in a very rapid fashion similar to that seen in culture.PTH Induction of AR Is a Primary Response—To determine whether PTH induction of AR requires new protein synthesis, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with 10-8 m rPTH(1–34) in the presence or the absence of cycloheximide, a reagent that inhibits protein synthesis. Fig. 2 shows that cycloheximide had no effect on the PTH induction of AR because in cycloheximide-pretreated UMR cells PTH increased AR mRNA expression 16-fold, similar to the 18-fold increase in the ethanol-pretreated cells. This result suggests that one or more existing transcription factors that are post-transcriptionally regulated by PTH are likely responsible for the AR induction. The fact that there was no superinduction of AR in the cycloheximide-pretreated cells also tends to exclude the possibility that PTH regulates AR by stabilizing its mRNA. In addition, in a separate study, we have shown that PTH stimulates activity of the AR promoter in a cAMP-response element-binding protein-dependent manner. 2L. Qin and N. C. Partridge, manuscript submitted. Fig. 2The stimulation of AR expression by PTH is a primary response. UMR 106-01 cells were treated with ethanol (0.1% v/v) or cycloheximide (chx, 30 μg/ml) for 1 h. Cells were then treated with 10-8 m rat PTH(1–34) for another 1 h before harvesting RNA for real time RT-PCR analyses. The AR mRNA level in the cells treated only with ethanol was set as 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)AR Is a Target Gene for Other Osteotropic Hormones—In addition to PTH, 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and PGE2 are other agents that play important roles in bone remodeling via osteoblasts. Next, we investigated whether these hormones could also regulate AR expression. Rat primary osteoblastic cells were serum starved for 1 day then treated with either 1α,25-(OH)2D3 or PGE2 for various time periods. RNAs were harvested to analyze the AR mRNA level by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3). Interestingly, both hormones have strong effects on AR induction, albeit the expression patterns are different from those induced by PTH. The AR induction by 1α,25-(OH)2D3 peaked to 24-fold at 12 h but was low at earlier time points (3-fold at 1 h and 2-fold at 4 h) (Fig. 3A). Note that AR has been recently found to be up-regulated by 1α,25-(OH)2D3 in squamous cell and breast carcinoma cells in a similar time-dependent pattern (25Akutsu N. Bastien Y. Lin R. Mader S. White J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PGE2 quickly and continuously elevated the expression of AR, resulting in 13-, 12-, and 11-fold increases at 1, 4, and 12 h, respectively (Fig. 3B).Fig. 31α,25-(OH)2D3 (A) and PGE2 (B) stimulate AR expression in primary osteoblastic cells. Rat calvarial primary osteoblastic cells at day 13 in culture (differentiation phase) were serum starved for 1 day and then treated with control, 10-8 m 1α,25-(OH)2D3, or 10-6 m PGE2 for the indicated time points before RNA purification for real time RT-PCR analysis to determine the fold changes in AR mRNA levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of EGF-like Ligands and Their Receptors in Osteoblastic Cells—To date, there is no report of the expression of EGF family ligands and receptors in osteoblastic cells. Because we have demonstrated that AR is regulated by several osteotropic hormones, it became important to determine the profile of other EGF ligands and their receptors in osteoblastic cells. Using RT-PCR, we were able to detect the expression of EGF, TGF-α, HB-EGF, betacellulin, epiregulin, EGFR, and ErbB2 in both UMR 106-01 and rat calvarial primary osteoblastic cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we investigated whether expression of those ligands and receptors is regulated by PTH. Real time RT-PCR revealed that although the expression of EGFR, ErbB2, EGF, epiregulin, and betacellulin was unaffected by PTH treatment in UMR 106-01 cells, TGF-α and HB-EGF expression showed more than 2-fold increases at 12 h and 1 h of 10-8 m rPTH(1–34) treatment, respectively (supplementary figure). Those results are consistent with our previous microarray analysis results in which the expression of TGF-α showed a 2.5-fold increase at 12 h of PTH treatment, and the expression of HB-EGF was not detected under any conditions. Nevertheless, these fold inductions by PTH are much lower than that of AR as shown above (23-fold at 1 h), suggesting that PTH mainly regulates AR but not other EGF-like ligands and receptors in bone.AR Has Strong Proliferative Effects on Osteoblastic Cells, and the EGFR Signaling Pathway Is Important for Normal Growth of Osteoblastic Cells—AR is a bifunctional growth factor because it stimulates proliferation in some cells and inhibits growth in others (13Plowman G.D.

Next we investigated the effect of AR on the proliferation of osteoblastic cells. Rat calvarial osteoblastic cells in the proliferation phase were used for all of the following experiments. Those cells are considered as committed preosteoblasts because they do not express differentiation-specific markers. These primary cells were obtained from calvariae of neonatal rats and cultured in medium with various amounts of AR for 4 days. Fig. 4A clearly indicates that the cell number/well increased as the medium AR concentration increased. Even in the presence of the lowest AR concentration (5 ng/ml), a significant increase in cell number (35%) was observed (p < 0.001). [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA showed a similar result (Fig. 4B). There was a concentration-dependent increase in DNA synthesis of rat primary osteoblastic cells. Specifically, 50 ng/ml (5 nm) AR produced a 2.7-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation over untreated cells. This effect was slightly higher than 25 ng/ml (4 nm) EGF and comparable with 10% fetal bovine serum.Fig. 4AR is a potent growth factor for osteoblasts. Cell counts (A) and [3H]thymidine incorporation (B) were performed with rat primary osteoblastic cells in proliferation stage to demonstrate that AR stimulates proliferation (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). In A and B, * represents p < 0.001. C, the proliferative effect of AR requires EGFR. After 1 day of serum starvation, primary osteoblastic cells were pretreated with the following for 1 h: dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1% v/v), 1 μm C32, or 1 μm C56. Cells were then treated with the following overnight: 50 ng/ml AR, 10-8 m PTH(1–34), or control medium. [3H]Thymidine was added for the last 3 h of the assay. The incorporated [3H]thymidine amounts in each well were then measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)AR binds to and signals through the EGFR in breast cancer cell lines, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes. The addition of EGFR-specific inhibitors, 1 μm compound 32 (C32) or compound 56 (C56), not only eliminated the proliferative effect of AR on rat primary osteoblastic cells, but decreased incorporation of [3H]thymidine to almost 50% of control cells (Fig. 4C, left part), suggesting that this effect of AR was through the EGFR. Similar to a previous report that PTH inhibits the proliferation of osteoblastic cells (26Partridge N.C. Opie A.L. Opie R.T. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Onishi T. Hruska K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 10-8 m rPTH(1–34) inhibited DNA synthesis by 50% in primary osteoblastic cells. The addition of C32 or C56 had an additive effect with PTH, further inhibiting [3H]thymidine incorporation to only 25% of control (Fig. 4C, middle part). Moreover, 1 μm C32 or C56 on its own strongly inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation to about 50% of control cells (Fig. 4C, right part). Note these cells have been serum-depleted for 1 day before addition of inhibitors. This result clearly indicates that EGF-like ligands, including AR, produced by osteoblastic cells could have autocrine or paracrine effects on normal growth of osteoblastic cells through EGFR signaling pathways. Similar results were also observed with UMR 106-01 cells (data not shown).Flow cytometry experiments were performed to study the effect of AR on the regulation of the cell cycle of primary osteoblastic cells. As shown in Table I, after serum starvation, 80.6% of cells were in G1 phase of the cell cycle. AR treatment decreased cells in G1 to about 68.5% and increased cells in both S phase and G2+M phase. Simultaneous addition of C32 completely abolished the effect of AR on cell cycle regulation. However, C32 itself showed no effect on cell cycle regulation under these conditi"

They share one sequence motif, a GGQ tripeptide that is vital to release factor (RF) activity in both kingdoms. In bacteria, the Gln residue of the motif in RF1 and RF2 is modified to N5-methyl-Gln by the S-adenosyl l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase PrmC and the absence of Gln methylation decreases the release activity of Escherichia coli RF2 in vitro severalfold.

In eubacteria, two class I RFs with different but overlapping specificity for stop codon recognition perform this task. RF1 reads UAG and UAA, and RF2 reads UAA and UGA. However, in archebacteria and eukaryotes, a single class I RF, aRF1 and eRF1, respectively, recognizes all three stop codons. aRF1 and eRF1 are homologous to each other, and although they are functionally similar to the eubacterial RFs, they belong to a different structural family (2Kisselev L.L.

An additional type of RF, referred to as a class II factor, participates in protein synthesis termination in eubacteria and eukaryotes. These factors, named RF3 and eRF3, respectively, are ribosome-dependent and class I RF-dependent GTPases (12Zhouravleva G. Frolova L. Le Goff X. Guellec LeR. Inge-Vechtomov S. Kisselev L. Philippe M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). RF3 catalyzes the dissociation of class I factors from the ribosome following peptide release (13Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). eRF3 may perform a similar role in eukaryotes (1Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38287-38291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). eRF1 and eRF3 form a complex in the absence of ribosomes, which involves the C-terminal domain of each protein (16Merkulova T.I. Frolova L.Y. Lazar M. Camonis J. Kisselev L.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). No such interaction between bacterial RF1 or RF2 and RF3 has been observed in the absence of ribosomes, but when both are bound to the ribosome, they are thought to interact in a way that involves the N-terminal domain of RF1 or RF2, which would then be functionally analogous to the C-terminal domain of eRF1 (Fig. 1) (17Klaholz B.P. Myasnikov A.G. Van Heel M. Nature. 2004; 427: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Mora L. Zavialov A.V. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In E. coli, both RF1 and RF2 are post-translationally modified by methylation of the Gln residue in the GGQ motif to give N5-Me-Gln (19Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The methyltransferase (MTase) involved has been identified and is coded in E. coli and in most bacteria by a gene, hemK (now named prmC), located immediately down-stream of prfA, encoding RF1 (20Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Nakahigashi K. Kubo N. Narita S. Shimaoka T. Goto S. Oshima T. Mori H. Maeda M. Wada C. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In data bank annotations, PrmC has been classed among MTases methylating N6-adenine or N4-cytidine in DNA because of the presence of S-adenosyl l-methionine (AdoMet) binding motifs and of an NPPY motif thought to be a hallmark of this class of MTases. It is now understood that the real specificity of the (D/N)PPY family of MTases is for a nitrogen conjugated to a planar system, which may be an amide moiety or a nucleotide base (22Schubert H.L. Phillips J.D. Hill C.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Pairs of apparent homologues to bacterial prmC, one member of which probably encodes a protein targeted to the mitochondrion, are present in the genomes of eukaryotic organisms including yeast, fly, mouse, and man (20Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). So far, no genetic or biochemical evidence has existed to ascribe a function to any of these supposed MTases. The perfect conservation of the GGQ motif in RFs from all of the kingdoms and the widespread presence of genes in higher organisms potentially encoding homologues of prmC prompted us to determine whether eRF1 in S. cerevisiae is modified in a similar way to RF1 and RF2 in E. coli. Here, we present evidence that this is the case, that the YDR140w gene product is required for the modification of eRF1, and that eRF3 and GTP are also required for the modification to take place. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Strain FYBL1–8B (MATa; ura3Δ851; leuΔ1; his3Δ200; lys2Δ202) was obtained from P. Lesage. Strain W303–1B (MATa; ade2-1; his3-11,15; leu2-3,112; ura3-1; trp1-1) and plasmid pYeDP60 were obtained from D. Pompon. pYeDP60 contains an E. coli replication origin and ampicillin resistance gene and a yeast 2-μm plasmid replication origin. Transcription occurs from the hybrid promoter Gal10-cyc1, repressed by glucose but induced by galactose, and stops at a phosphoglycerate kinase terminator. The putative MTase YDR140w gene was cloned in the pYeDP60 for expression in yeast by PCR amplification with Pwo TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) using the following primers specific to yIBPC27 DNA: ydrV60up (5′-AAGGGGATCCATGCTACCGACCCCTTATGT-3′) and ydrH6V60low (5′-CCGGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCCTTGTAAAGCTGTACACACTGAG-3′). These primers introduce a BamHI restriction site immediately upstream of the initiation codon and an EcoRI site downstream of the stop codon (italics). Oligonucleotide ydrH6V60low also contains a sequence (boldface) encoding a His6 tag just upstream of the stop codon. The resulting plasmid was called pYeVH407. Strain yLM6, in which eRF1 His6 tagged at the C terminus is expressed from the chromosome, was constructed by in vivo recombination between chromosomal DNA in FYBL1–8B and a PCR product carrying the modified eRF1 sequence and a HIS3-selectable marker gene. PCR was performed on DNA from plasmid pHis3 encoding the HIS3 gene using the oligonucleotides eRFup (5′-CTGAGGATGAATATTATGACGAAGATGAAGGATCCGACTATGATTTCATTTCACACCACCACCACCACCACTAATGCGCTAGGAGTCACTGC-3′) and eRFd-own (5′-GAATTTAATTTAAATCTGGCATCTAGTGATTAAATTCTTTTTGATTCGATAAAGGAAAGCGCGCCTC-3′). eRFup contained the 50 nucleotides before the eRF1 stop codon (normal type), a sequence encoding Ser-His6 (boldface), and 17 nucleotides upstream of the HIS3 gene (italic). eRFdown contained 50 nucleotides complementary to the region downstream of eRF1 (normal) and 17 nucleotides downstream of HIS3 (boldface). The his– S. cerevisiae strain yIBPC27n was transformed with the PCR product, and His+ recombinants (YLM6) were selected on minimal medium (SD), 2% glucose (23Adams A.D. Gottschling E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). The correspondence of the recombinants to the expected sequence was verified by PCR amplification of the region around the SUP45-HIS3 junction. Strain yVH11, deleted for YDR140w, was a derivative of yLM6 constructed by in vivo recombination, selecting for G418 antibiotic resistance. DNA amplification was performed on chromosomal DNA from the commercially available strain Y04074 (Euroscarf: MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; YDR140w::kanMX4) where the entire gene YDR140w was replaced by a kanMX4 cassette conferring resistance to G418 (150 μg/ml). The primers were chosen ∼500 bp upstream and downstream from the cassette (ydrkan571, 5′-CTGGTCGTT-AGTAAGGTCTC-3′, and ydrkan2977, 5′-CTCAACATGGAAGGCTTCAC-3′). The construction was checked by PCR with this primer pair and with the pair ydrkan2977 and a kanC-specific sequence in the antibiotic cassette (5′-TGATTTTGATGACGAGCGTAAT-3′). E. coli Strains and Plasmids—For expression of YDR140w in E. coli, the gene was amplified by PCR as described above with the exception that the upstream and downstream oligonucleotides (ydr140up, 5′-GGAAGGTGACATATGCTACCGAC-3′, and ydr140low, 5′-ATATAGGGATCCGTCTTGAGTAA-′) encoded NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (in boldface), and cloned between the same sites in the expression vector pET11a (Novagen), yielding plasmid pVH371. After transformation of BL21(DE3) carrying a vector to overexpress minor tRNA isoacceptors (BL21-Codon Plus, Stratagene), the expression of YDR140w was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C at an optical density of 0.5 in rich medium. The overproduced protein was present almost exclusively as inclusion bodies, which were used for purification of the protein and the preparation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies. eRF1 and Truncated eRF3 Vectors and Expression—The full-length cDNA encoding human eRF1 with C-terminal His6 tag fusion was cloned into pET23b(+) vector (Novagen) under the control of phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter as described (9Seit-Nebi A. Frolova L. Justesen J. Kisselev L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3982-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Frolova L. Seit-Nebi A. Kisselev L. RNA. 2002; 8: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The truncated variant of S. cerevisiae eRF3 (Sup35) starting from the third methionine was prepared using the pET-based bacterial expression system (Novagen). The DNAs encoding this eRF3 were generated by PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and the Sup35 gene as a template (25Kushnirov V.V. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Telckov M.V. Surguchov A.P. Smirnov V.N. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) cloned in the pBCKS+ vector and kindly provided by M. Ter-Avanesyan. The following primers used for PCR were: forward, 5′-ATTGGATCCTTTTGGTGGTAAAGATCACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AATTGGATCCTTACTCGGCAATTTTAACAAT-3′. The purified PCR fragments were cloned into the BamHI site of pET15b inframe with the N-terminal His6 tag. All of the PCR-generated constructs were checked for polymerase fidelity and preservation of open reading frame by sequencing. Human eRF1 and truncated yeast eRF3 were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) as described (26Frolova L.Y. Merkulova T.I. Kisselev L.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-eRF1 antibodies were prepared commercially. Overproduction of YDR140w Protein in S. cerevisiae—His-tagged YDR140w protein was produced in yeast strain W303–1B transformed with plasmid pYeVH407 and grown in rich medium (YPGE: 1% bacto yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone, 0.5% glucose, 3% ethanol). Expression was induced at an optical density at 600 nm of ∼9 by the addition of galactose to a final concentration of 2%. Control cultures of cells carrying the parent plasmid pYeDP60 without insert were grown in parallel. Growth was stopped after an additional 15 h (optical density ∼14). Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and EDTA-free anti-protease (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer), and broken by passage through a French press at 8000 p.s.i. After centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was loaded on to a 0.5-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. Fractions containing protein were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 10 molecular weight cut-off, Millipore) and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg acetate, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 50% glycerol and stored at –20 °C. An analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal anti-YDR140w antibodies showed the presence of YDR140w protein only in extracts from cells containing pYeVH407. Several protein impurities were visible in preparations of YDR140w but were present in the control extracts as well. Purification of His-tagged eRF1—Cultures of strain yLM6 in 4l of rich medium (YPD), 2% glucose (23Adams A.D. Gottschling E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of ∼5. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm PMSF with EDTA-free anti-protease at twice the concentration recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were broken by passage through a French press, and the supernatant after centrifugation for 1 h at 30,000 × g was made 8 m in urea by the addition of the solid product and readjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. The solution was loaded on a column (20 ml) of Mono Q fast-flow (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 8 m urea, and 50 μm PMSF (buffer B) and eluted at 2 ml/min with a 100-ml gradient from 0 to 0.6 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing eRF1 were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 10 molecular weight cut-off, Millipore) to 1 ml. nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (0.5 ml, Qiagen), previously washed with buffer B, was added, and protein was allowed to bind to the resin for 15 h with gentle agitation at 10 °C. The resin was packed as a column, washed with 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris buffer, and 8 m urea, pH 7.5 (adjusted with NaOH), and eluted with 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris buffer, and 8 m urea, pH 4.5 (adjusted with HCl). The fractions containing protein were pooled, concentrated to 0.25 ml by ultrafiltration, made at 1% in SDS and 10 mm in dithiothreitol, and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and reconcentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼0.1 ml. The proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), and His-tagged eRF1 was located by Western blot performed on a lane containing ∼5% of the preparation. A gel fragment containing the remaining amount of the identified protein was excised, washed, dehydrated, and reswollen in 20 μl of a trypsin solution (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science, 15 ng/μl in 5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NH4HCO3) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were desalted on C18 Zip-Tips (Millipore) for analysis by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was performed with an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE PRO spectrometer equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337-nm, 3-ns pulse) at the Department of Protein Engineering and Metabolic Control (Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France). Operating parameters for reflectron include the following: accelerating voltage (20 kV); grid voltage (75%); guidewire voltage (0.005%); and 100 laser shots/spectrum. The ions of des-Arg-bradykinin, angiotensin I, Glu-fibrinopeptide B, and neurotensin were used for external calibration. Monoisotopic masses were used with deviations for mass assignment within ±0.5 Da. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix, and 0.5-μl volumes were applied for each analysis. Methylation in Vitro—Methylation tests in vitro were conducted in a total volume of 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg acetate, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 μm [3H]AdoMet (1.62 Ci/mmol) containing, where stated, 50 pmol of eRF1, 50 pmol of eRF3, 1 mm GTP, and 10 μl of enzyme preparation. The source of PrmC was a 100,000-g supernatant from E. coli cells overexpressing the enzyme at a high level (19Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, 5 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid was added followed by filtration on Whatman GF/C filters and measurement of radioactivity. Analysis of [3H]Methyl-labeled Products of in Vitro Methylation— Methylation in vitro for subsequent SDS-PAGE and analysis by fluorography was performed as described above with the exception that the specific activity of [3H]AdoMet was 3.14 Ci/mmol. The proteins were separated on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and exposed for 3 days at –80 °C to preflashed Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to Pronase (Roche Applied Science) digestion, methylation reactions were performed as described above, the reaction products were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ether, dried, and redissolved in 20 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% SDS at 45 °C and digested with Pronase at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml for 64 h at 45 °C. Authentic N5-[3H]Me-Gln was obtained from E. coli RF1 by the same procedure. The digestion products were analyzed by TLC on cellulose sheets (Polygram, Cel 400) in acetone:0.5% urea (60:40 v/v). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot experiments were performed using rabbit anti-eRF1 or anti-YDR140w antibodies commercially prepared from pure proteins overproduced in E. coli. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotting with antibodies (diluted × 5000) were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (diluted × 5000), SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and Kodak X-Omat AR. Yeast eRF1 Is Methylated in Vivo—To determine whether the methylation of the Gln residue present in the GGQ motif in E. coli is conserved in yeast eRF1, the protein was isolated from yeast cells, digested with trypsin, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. To achieve this goal, the SUP45 gene encoding eRF1 was modified by recombination to encode a His6 tag at the C terminus of the protein. His6-tagged eRF1 expressed from the modified chromosomal gene was purified under denaturing conditions by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography in 8 m urea, nickel-resin chromatography in 8 m urea, and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). As a non-methylated control protein, S. cerevisiae eRF1 was prepared by overproduction in E. coli. From the sequence of eRF1, no other tryptic peptide of the mass of the tryptic peptide containing the GGQ motif, GGQSALR, is expected if the peptide is monomethylated (702.37). On the other hand, another tryptic peptide, HNYVR, has the same mass (688.37) as the non-methylated peptide GGQSALR. An analysis of tryptic digests of His6-tagged eRF1 from normal yeast cells by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed the presence of a peptide of mass 702.3 (Fig. 2C) that was absent from the analyses of the factor overproduced in E. coli (Fig. 2B), as expected if eRF1 was methylated on the Gln residue of the GGQ motif. Identification of a MTase for eRF1 Methylation in Vivo—A search of the S. cerevisiae genome revealed two genes, YDR140w and YNL063w, with significant homology to prmC in E. coli, going beyond the motifs that are known to be involved essentially in the binding AdoMet. The second of these genes probably encodes a protein targeted to the mitochondrion (20Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Engstöm Å. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether the YDR140w gene might be required for eRF1 methylation, it was inactivated by insertion of a kanamycin-resistant cassette. The resulting strain (yVH11) was viable but grew slowly with a doubling time of 185 min in Hartwell complete synthetic medium containing 2% glucose as compared with 90 min for the parent strain (results not shown). The complementation of yVH11 by plasmid pYeVH407 carrying the YDR140w gene restored the growth rate to that of the wild type strain, yLM6. These results are consistent with the experiments of Niewmierzycka and Clarke (29Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and the growth data obtained during systematic deletion studies in S. cerevisiae (30Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. et al.Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). When His-tagged eRF1 was prepared from the mutant strain yVH11, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry, no fragment with a mass of 702.3 corresponding to monomethylated GGQSALR could be observed (Fig. 2D), consistent with the possibility that the YDR140w mutant strain could no longer methylate eRF1. Methylation in Vitro of S. cerevisiae and Human eRF1 by YDR140w Protein—The mass spectrometry data described above provided evidence that the GGQ motif in eRF1 from S. cerevisiae is methylated and strongly suggested that the YDR140w gene is required for this methylation. Further evidence was sought by trying to methylate S. cerevisiae eRF1 with YDR140w protein in vitro. YDR140w was found to be efficiently overproduced in E. coli but failed to yield MTase able to methylate eRF1 under any of the conditions used (see below). Therefore, the MTase, His-tagged at the C terminus, was overproduced in wild-type yeast strain W303–1B from the high-copy plasmid pYeVH407. The level of expression of YDR140w under these conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) was low, but highly enriched preparations of the His-tagged MTase could nevertheless be obtained from the yeast cell extracts using nickel-resin chromatography. Western blots using polyclonal antibodies raised against YDR140w protein overproduced in E. coli showed the presence of"

Cyclin D1 is also an oncogene that is thought to act primarily by bypassing the requirement for mitogens during the G1 phase. Studies of clinical tumors have found that cyclin D1 overexpression is associated with chromosome abnormalities, although a causal effect has not been established in experimental systems. In this study, we found that transient expression of cyclin D1 in normal hepatocytes in vivo triggered dysplastic mitoses, accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes, abnormalities of the mitotic spindle, and marked chromosome changes within several days. This was associated with up-regulation of checkpoint genes p53 and p21 as well as hepatocyte apoptosis in the liver. Transient transfection of cyclin D1 also induced centrosome and mitotic spindle abnormalities in breast epithelial cells, suggesting that this may be a generalized effect. These results indicate that cyclin D1 can induce deregulation of the mitotic apparatus and aneuploidy, effects that could contribute to the role of this oncogene in malignancy.

A critical component of normal cell division is the accurate distribution of chromosomes and other cellular components during mitosis. Abnormal cell division and chromosome content are hallmarks of cancer and are associated with a poor prognosis in a number of tumors (1Rajagopalan H. Nowak M.A. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Nat. Rev.

The mechanisms by which cells acquire chromosome changes have not been fully identified, but alterations of centrosomes and the mitotic spindle apparatus appear to play an important role (3Salisbury J.L.

Most normal cells contain one centrosome, which serves as the major microtubule organizing center and participates in processes such as cell polarity, migration, and intracellular transport (3Salisbury J.L.

In normal cell division, centrosomes undergo one round of duplication in a manner analogous to the replication of chromosomal DNA during S phase. During mitosis, centrosomes direct the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles that ensure equal segregation of chromosomes between daughter cells. Increased numbers of centrosomes are frequently observed in malignant cells (3Salisbury J.L. Whitehead C.M. Lingle W.L. Barrett S.L. Biol.

This is thought to result in distortion of the mitotic apparatus and abnormal sorting of chromosomes during cell division. The resulting changes in chromosome complement can lead to loss of tumor suppressor genes or gain of oncogene function that further promote the malignant phenotype. In addition to changes in centrosome number, alterations in the centrioles and pericentriolar material that make up the centrosome are frequently seen in cancers. Although recent studies have provided substantial insight into the proteins that make up the centrosome, the identity and function of centrosome components, and their potential derangement in cancer, remain to be fully characterized. Recent studies have identified proteins that govern the centrosome duplication cycle (reviewed in Refs. 5Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev.

Relevant substrates of cdk2 include the Mps1 kinase, nucleophosmin/B23, and CP110, which regulate centrosome duplication. The cdk inhibitor p21, which is a downstream target of p53, is thought to inhibit the centrosome cycle through inactivation of cdk2 activity. Cells lacking p53 function may also be deficient in other cellular checkpoint mechanisms that affect centrosome duplication. In addition to p53 and p21, mutations of tumor suppressor genes, Brca1, Brca2, and Gadd45, and adenomatous polyposis coli are associated with centrosome abnormalities. Conversely, overexpression of several oncogenes that regulate the mitotic spindle apparatus, such as Ran and Aurora-A, can disrupt normal centrosome function. Cyclin D1 is a G1 phase regulatory protein that promotes physiologic cell proliferation downstream of mitogens and other extracellular stimuli (12Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 13Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 411: 1001-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cyclin D1 is a putative oncogene that is overexpressed in many human malignancies. Constitutive expression of cyclin D1 is likely to contribute to malignant transformation by reducing the dependence on extracellular signals that normally control proliferation, i.e. it diminishes the requirement for mitogens in the transition through the G1 restriction point. Studies of clinical tumors have found that cyclin D1 overexpression is associated with chromosomal abnormalities (15Collecchi P. Santoni T. Gnesi E. Naccarato GiuseppeA. Passoni A. Rocchetta M.

Here we document that transient cyclin D1 expression induced centrosome amplification, deregulation of the mitotic spindle, and overt chromosome abnormalities within a matter of days. These results suggest that cyclin D1 may promote malignancy by causing genomic instability.

Cell Culture and Immunohistochemistry—Mouse hepatocytes were isolated using Liver Perfusion Media and Liver Digest Media (Invitrogen). Cells were purified through a Percoll gradient and cultured for the indicated times on collagen-treated glass coverslips in Williams E media in the presence of epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) and insulin (20 milliunits/ml) (23Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). Media were changed daily; colchemid (25 ng/ml) was added 3 h prior to fixation. Immunohistochemistry was completed on coverslips with attached cells after being fixed in -20 °C methanol and then rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. A mixture of primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Cep135 or anti-Cep135 and anti-centrin (gift of Dr. J.

Microscopic identification was completed by using a Nikon eclipse microscope with epifluorescence optics or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. In Fig. 2E, slides were stained with DAPI, and the percentage of cells in metaphase was counted in three different specimens for each condition.

Quantification of p21 and p53 mRNA by Real Time PCR (RT-PCR)— Total RNA from each liver was isolated as described previously (28Albrecht J.H. Poon R.Y. Ahonen C.L. Rieland B.M. Deng C. Crary G.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). RNA samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized using ethidium bromide to ensure that the RNA was not grossly degraded. Samples of RNA (5 μg) were treated with DNase I (DNA-free™, Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was generated from 4 μg of each RNA with Taqman reverse transcriptase reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). Mouse p21 DNA sequences for upper (5′-cggtggaactttgacttcgt-3′) and lower (5′-cagggcagaggaagtactgg-3′) primers, p53 upper (5′-agagaccgccgtacagaaga-3′) and lower (5′-ctgtagcatgggcatccttt-3′) primers, and β-actin sequences for upper (5′-aaccctaaggccaaccgtgaaaag-3′) and lower (5′-accgctcgttgccaatagtgatga-3′) primers were selected by using the Primerselect program (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). The resulting sequences were synthesized at the University of Minnesota microchemical facility and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. RT-PCR was completed using a LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Samples were denatured for 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 20 s. Optimization of MgCl2 and primer concentrations was completed as recommended by the manufacturer (2.4 mm MgCl2 for p21 and p53 and 3 mm for β-actin). Primer concentrations were found to be optimal at 0.2 μm for p21 and p53 and 0.1 μm for β-actin. For each mRNA, quantification was completed by comparison (linear interpolation) of the cycles to saturation in each sample. p21 and p53 mRNA were normalized to β-actin mRNA expression (which did not change under any of the conditions, data not shown), and the relative amounts were determined as recommended by the manufacturer. Transfection of Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (hMEC)—hMEC cells were transfected with the cyclin D1 or control adenoviruses (25 plaque-forming units per cell), seeded on glass coverslips, and harvested at 48 h as described previously (27D'Assoro A.B.

In normal liver, hepatocytes rarely replicate, but these cells rapidly enter the cell cycle in response to injuries that diminish functional hepatic mass (31Fausto N. Campbell J.S. Mech.

We have found that transient transfection of hepatocytes in vivo with a recombinant adenovirus expressing human cyclin D1 (ADV-D1) is sufficient to trigger hepatocyte replication and liver growth under conditions where these cells are normally quiescent (20Nelsen C.J.

Intravenously injected replication-defective (E1-deleted) adenoviruses such as these primarily target the liver and can transfect >95% of hepatocytes; this system has been used extensively to study the effect of transient single-gene expression in these cells (24Becker T.C.

Investig. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Two days after cyclin D1 transfection, hepatocyte mitoses appeared normal (Fig. 1). However, after 6 days the mitotic figures were uniformly abnormal, with multipolar mitoses and apparently asymmetric segregation of chromatin. Such features are commonly seen in neoplasia. Injection with the control adenovirus did not induce significant cell cycle progression, and the few observed mitoses were morphologically normal (data not shown and see Ref. 20Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitoses observed at 48 h after partial hepatectomy did not display similar abnormalities (data not shown). Thus, protracted cyclin D1 expression (over a matter of days) led to apparent deregulation of the mitotic apparatus, which is a likely precursor of aneuploidy (1Rajagopalan H. Nowak M.A. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Sen S. Curr. Opin.

Because this suggests a novel mechanism by which cyclin D1 could promote neoplasia, we examined the mitotic and chromosome abnormalities in greater detail.Fig. 1Cyclin D1 induces abnormal hepatocyte mitoses in vivo. BALB/c mice were transfected by intravenous injection of a recombinant adenovirus expressing human cyclin D1.

The study of centrosomes and mitotic spindles in fixed tissue specimens is limited by technical considerations (36Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 67: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore transfected mice with ADV-D1 (or the control vector) for 3 days and then isolated hepatocytes by collagenase perfusion. The cells were placed in culture for 2 days in the presence of epidermal growth factor and insulin, which triggers proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes. Cells were then fixed and co-immunostained with antibodies to centrosome proteins (Cep-135 or γ-tubulin) and α-tubulin, which is the major mitotic spindle protein (4Brinkley B.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 18-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 25Kuriyama R. Ohta T. Vogel J. Peng G.

All γ-tubulin-positive foci also stained with Cep-135 (data not shown), and we therefore elected to use Cep-135 as the marker of centrosomes in hepatocytes because of the quality of the antibody (26Ohta T. Essner R. Ryu J.H. Palazzo R.E. Uetake Y. Kuriyama R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In normal hepatocytes, or those transfected with the control adenovirus, we observed bipolar mitotic spindles with either two or four centrosomes (Fig. 2A), reflecting the normal population of 2N and binucleated (2 × 2N) cells in the liver (37Guidotti J.E. Bregerie O. Robert A. Debey P. Brechot C. Desdouets C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19095-19101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Similarly, hepatocytes transfected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding human cyclin E (ADV-E) did not demonstrate substantially increased centrosome numbers or abnormal mitotic morphology. In contrast, cyclin D1-transfected hepatocytes uniformly demonstrated irregular multipolar mitotic spindles with supernumerary centrosomes. The number of centrosomes (as defined by distinct Cep-135 or γ-tubulin-positive foci) exceeded the number of spindle poles, because several centrosomes sometimes clustered at a single pole (Fig. 2A, inset). As shown in Fig. 2B, cyclin D1-transfected hepatocytes almost always contained more than four centrosomes, and some had ≥20 per cell. Thus, 5 days after cyclin D1 transfection (3 days in vivo and 2 days in culture), hepatocytes demonstrated substantially increased centrosome numbers and markedly abnormal mitotic morphology. Normal centrosomes consist of a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material (5Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Centrosomes are typically visualized and quantified by performing immunostaining for pericentriolar proteins such as γ-tubulin or Cep135. In Fig. 2C, cells were immunostained with an antibody to centrin, a centriolar protein, which is frequently used to visualize these structures (3Salisbury J.L. Whitehead C.M. Lingle W.L. Barrett S.L. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 451-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 67: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, in both normal and cyclin D1-transfected cells, centrosomes staining with Cep-135 showed two centrin-positive centrioles. These results indicate that cyclin D1 led to hyperamplification of centrosomes with a normal number of centrioles. The number of centrosomes per cell has been linked to DNA content, and one potential mechanism of centrosome hyperamplification is aborted cell division that gives rise to polyploid cells with increased centrosome numbers (5Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 38Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship of cell ploidy to centrosome number, cells were subjected to FACS analysis to examine DNA content (Fig. 2D). Normal or control-transfected hepatocytes demonstrated clear 2N and 4N peaks. Cyclin D1-transfected hepatocytes showed the same peaks, with proportionately more 4N cells and a substantial number of 8N cells. However, a significant number of cells did not fall into the 2N, 4N, or 8N peaks, suggesting that cyclin D1 induced aneuploidy (see below). Furthermore, very few cells with >8N DNA content were observed. In the cyclin D1-transfected cells, centrosome content (Fig. 2B) appeared to be increased to a greater degree than DNA content (Fig. 2D). Thus, persistent cyclin D1 expression may lead to uncoupling of the centrosome cycle from the cell cycle. Normal hepatocytes proliferate readily in culture in the presence of appropriate growth factors, and previous studies (23Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar, 29Loyer P. Cariou S. Glaise D. Bilodeau M. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. J. Biol.

Dev. 2003; 120: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) have shown that cyclin D1 is induced in these cells in a mitogen-dependent manner. In Fig. 2E, slides were stained with DAPI, and the number of cells displaying metaphase morphology was found to be similar in cyclin D1-transfected or control cells. Therefore, it is apparent that re-entry into the cell cycle per se was not sufficient to cause the observed centrosome and mitotic abnormalities. Interestingly, cyclin D1 induced the accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes even in interphase cells (Fig. 3), whereas control-transfected or normal cells showed 2-4 centrosomes (data not shown). As was the case for the metaphase cells, the number of centrosomes in cyclin D1-transfected interphase cells did not seem to clearly correlate with the DNA content as assessed by FACS analysis (Fig. 2D). Thus abnormal centrosome numbers were observed in the majority of cyclin D1-transfected cells. To further examine the relationship between cell ploidy and centrosome number, we studied hepatocytes 2 days following transfection with cyclin D1 (24 h in vivo and 24 h in culture, Fig. 4). At this early time point, the mitotic cells had bipolar spindles after cyclin D1 transfection (Fig. 4A; also see Fig. 1). However, many cells showed a substantially increased number of centrosomes (Fig. 4B), which clustered at the two spindle poles (Fig. 4A). FACS analysis indicated that there was a shift to 4N DNA content and a portion of cells had >4N content (Fig. 4C). However, few cells had 8N content, and the large number of centrosomes seen in some cells (Fig. 4B) was not accompanied by a proportional increase in DNA content. These studies further suggest that cyclin D1 can differentially regulate centrosome number and cell cycle progression. These results also indicate that although short term cyclin D1 overexpression can promote both processes, centrosome overduplication and multipolar spindle formation may be distinctly regulated at early time points. Cyclin D1 Induces Chromosomal Abnormalities in Hepatocytes—The data shown above indicate that over a period of several days, cyclin D1 induced abnormal mitoses, suggesting the possibility that it may also affect the cellular chromosome content. The FACS data in Figs. 2D and 4C indicated that a substantial portion of cyclin D1-transfected cells contained hyperploid nuclei that did not correspond with the 2N, 4N, or 8N peaks, suggesting that cells with grossly abnormal chromosome content were present. To examine this further, chromosome morphology from control and transfected hepatocytes was evaluated using standard techniqu"

In yeast, ESCRT-I is composed of three proteins, VSP23, VPS28, and VPS37, whereas in mammals only Tsg101(VPS23) and VPS28 were originally identified as ESCRT-I components. Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we identified one of a family of human proteins (VPS37C) as a Tsg101-binding protein. VPS37C can form a ternary complex with Tsg101 and VPS28 by binding to a domain situated toward the carboxyl terminus of Tsg101 and binds to another class E VPS factor, namely Hrs. In addition, VPS37C is recruited to aberrant endosomes induced by overexpression of Tsg101, Hrs, or dominant negative form of the class E VPS ATPase, VPS4. Enveloped viruses that encode PTAP motifs to facilitate budding exploit ESCRT-I as an interface with the class E VPS pathway, and accordingly, VPS37C is recruited to the plasma membrane along with Tsg101 by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) Gag. Moreover, direct fusion of VPS37C to HIV-1 Gag obviates the requirement for a PTAP motif to induce virion release. Depletion of VPS37C from cells does not inhibit murine leukemia virus budding, which is not mediated by ESCRT-I, however, if murine leukemia virus budding is engineered to be ESCRT-I-dependent, then it is inhibited by VPS37C depletion, and this inhibition is accentuated if VPS37B is simultaneously depleted.

A major decision governing the fate of such proteins is made when they either remain on the limiting membrane of the MVB or become internalized within the lumen of the MVB.

Cargo sorting and vesicle formation likely involves sequential recruitment of ESCRT-I, -II, and -III, and subsequent vesicle fission requires dissociation of ESCRT complexes from the MVB membrane, induced by an AAA-ATPase, VPS4 (12Babst M.

Many encode sequence motifs, termed late assembly or “L” domains to recruit class E VPS factors to mediate budding of nascent virions through cellular membranes. Three classes of L domains have been described and are defined by the presence of essential P(T/S)AP, YPXLLXXLF, or PPXY peptide motifs (18Gottlinger H.G. Dorfman T. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A.

PTAP motifs occur in the L domains of, for example, HIV-1 and Ebola virus (18Gottlinger H.G. Dorfman T. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PTAP binds to the amino-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant-like (UEV) domain, and this interaction serves to recruit Tsg101 to sites of virus particle assembly at the plasma membrane (24Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 26Pornillos O. Alam S.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. Nat. Struct.

However, the UEV domain is apparently dispensable if the remaining portion of the protein is artificially recruited to virus assembly sites by tethering to an HIV-1 Gag protein (24Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). A second component of ESCRT-I, VPS28, binds to a carboxyl-terminal domain of Tsg101 and is recruited along with it to HIV-1 particle assembly sites (27Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Bishop N. Woodman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11735-11742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, the VPS28-binding activity of Tsg101 is required in order for it to support HIV-1 budding (27Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J.

Enveloped viruses that exploit alternative L domain classes apparently do not require ESCRT-I but do require at least some of the remaining class E VPS proteins during their egress (7Martin-Serrano J.

However, the orthologous yeast complex contains an additional component, VPS37 (4Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), that does not have obvious sequence homologues in mammals. Therefore, we set out to identify mammalian orthologues of VPS37 using yeast two-hybrid screening. This search yielded hVPS37C, one of a family of proteins, which includes VPS37A and VPS37B, that was also recently identified as ESCRT-I components (29Stuchell M.D. Garrus J.E. Muller B. Stray K.M.

Here, we describe the characterization of VPS37C, its interactions with Tsg101 and other class E VPS factors and show that it, along with VPS37B, plays a crucial role in mediating the virus release activity of PTAP-type viral L domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Plasmids based on pCR3.1/YFP that express human class E VPS factors fused to the carboxyl terminus of YFP have been previously described (7Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 27Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). pCR3.1/CFP derivatives were constructed and are identical to the pCR3.1/YFP derivatives, except for the color of the expressed fluorescent fusion protein. The VPS37C and VPS3B open reading frames (see “Results” for description of the VPS37C open reading frame) were similarly inserted into pCR3.1/YFP for expression as YFP fusion proteins in mammalian cells. pCR3.1-based plasmids expressing a synthetic, codon-optimized HIV-1 Gag cDNA, and a derivative lacking p6 have been previously described (27Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing an HIV-1 Gag-HcRed fusion protein was constructed by inserting the respective codon optimized cDNAs into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. A plasmid expressing a GST-VPS37C fusion protein in mammalian cells was constructed by inserting the VPS37 coding sequence into pCAGGS/GST. pGBKT7 and pVP16-derived plasmids that express the GAL4 DNA binding domain and VP16 activation domain fusion proteins, respectively, have either been described previously (7Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 27Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) or were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified coding sequences of VPS37C and VPS37B into pVP16.Yeast Two-hybrid-based Screening and Assays—A Y190-derived yeast culture carrying pGBKT7/Tsg101 was generated by standard transformation and selection procedures. These yeast were transformed with a library of cDNAs derived from peripheral mononuclear lymphocytes (PML) in the pGAD10 vector (Clontech). Approximately 2 million transformants (selected by growth on media lacking tryptophan and leucine) were screened by an X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside)/agarose overlay assay, and blue colonies were picked. After confirmation of LacZ expression using a liquid β-galactosidase assay, library plasmids were recovered from the positive yeast clones and retested by cotransformation in Y190 cells with pGBKT7/Tsg101 or pGBKT7 (as a control). The coding sequence of one “hit” in this screen (PML39/VPS37C) was amplified by PCR and inserted into pVP16 (31Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for further analysis. To measure interactions between VPS37C, Tsg101, Tsg101 fragments, and other class E VPS factors, yeast Y190 cells were cotransformed with the combinations of previously described pGBKT7-derived and pVP16-derived plasmids (7Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 27Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), transformants selected by growth on media lacking tryptophan and leucine, and β-galactosidase activity measured in three pools of transformants, as previously described (7Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).GST and YFP Fusion Protein Coprecipitation Assay—293T cells in 12-well plates were cotransfected with 250 ng of pCAGGS/GST-VPS37C along with 250 ng of pCR3.1/YFP-Tsg101, or pCR3.1/YFP-derived plasmids expressing YFP fused to Tsg101 fragments or other class E factors (as indicated in the text and figures) using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Forty-five hours post-transfection cells were lysed and cleared of cellular debris by microcentrifugation. Protein complexes were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed by Western blotting as previously described (7Martin-Serrano J. Yaravoy A. Perez-Caballero D. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12414-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).Microscopy—293T cells in 35-mm dishes containing glass coverslips (Mattek) were cotransfected with 250 ng of pCR3.1/YFP-VPS37C or pCR3.1/YFP-VPS37B and 250 ng of pCR3.1/CFP-Tsg101, pCR3.1/CFP-VPS28, pCR3.1/CFP-Hrs, pCR3.1/CFP-VPS4, or pCR3.1/CFP-VPS4(DN). In some experiments, 750 ng of pCR3.1/HIV-1 Gag, pCR3.1/HIV-1 Gagδp6, or pCAGGS/Gag-HcRed was cotransfected with pCR3.1/YFP-VPS37C and pCR3.1/CFP-Tsg101. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, washed with 10 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline, and visualized. Fluorescence images were acquired using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope-based DeltaVision system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Optical filters were used to distinguish CFP (436/10 nm excitation, 470/30 nm emission), YFP (500/20 excitation, 535/30 emission), and HcRed (575/25 nm excitation, 630/40 nm emission). Respective excitation wavelengths were separated from fluorescence emission using a triple-band dichroic beam-splitter (Omega Optical #XF2090, Brattleboro, VT).Effects of VPS37-specific siRNA on ESCRT-I-dependent Virus Release—293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 60 pmol of each siRNA (Dharmacon) per well along with 350 ng of an MLV proviral plasmid in which the L domain was either intact or replaced with an HIV-1 PTAP motif (MLV/p6) (32Yuan B. Campbell S. Bacharach E. Rein A. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7250-7260Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-five hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, as were virions after harvesting them from 0.2-μm-filtered culture supernatants by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose. Virion and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting.PTAP Mutant HIV-1 Complementation Assay—HeLa cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 1.5 μg of an HIV-1 proviral plasmid containing an inactivated PTAP motif (LTAL) (24Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) along with 500 ng of a plasmid expressing either wild type Gag, PTAP mutant Gag, or Gag proteins in which p6 was replaced with either Tsg101, VPS37C, or VPS37B, using Lipofectamine 2000. Forty-five hours post-transfection, virions were harvested from 0.2-μm-filtered culture supernatants by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose. Virion and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting.Western Blot Analyses—Cell and virion lysates or protein precipitates were separated on 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. GST fusion proteins were detected using an anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), YFP fusion proteins were detected using a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science), MLV Gag proteins were detected using a goat polyclonal anti-capsid (CA) antiserum, and HIV-1 Gag was detected using an anti-HIV p24 monoclonal antibody (183-H12-5C). Subsequently, blots were probed with species-specific anti-immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugates and developed using chemiluminescent detection reagents (Pierce).RESULTSYeast Two-hybrid Screening and Identification of VPS37C— We screened a peripheral mononuclear lymphocyte library using a GAL4-Tsg101 fusion protein as a bait and obtained 77 hits. After plasmid rescue and retransformation, three of these clones tested positive for interaction with GAL4-Tsg101 but not with GAL4 alone. Sequence analysis of one of these clones, initially termed PML39, revealed that it encoded a protein of 355 amino acids, and this clone was selected for further study. The predicted open reading frame (lacking 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequences present in the originally isolated clone) was sub-cloned so as to express a VP16 activation domain fusion protein, and this protein also tested positive in the yeast two-hybrid assay in combination with a GAL4-Tsg101 bait (Fig. 1A).The protein predicted to be encoded by the PML39 clone contained a Mod(r) (modifier of rudimentary) domain (33Begley D. Murphy A.M. Hiu C. Tsubota S.I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) at its amino terminus, and BLAST searches of the human sequence databases revealed that the protein was identical to the carboxyl-terminal 355 residues of a 523-amino acid hypothetical protein, termed FLJ20847. In addition, the predicted amino-terminal ∼160 amino acids of PML39 had significant homology to another hypothetical human protein, FLJ1270, as well as to hepatocellular carcinoma-related protein 1 (HCRP1) and Williams Beuren syndrome chromosome region 24 (WBSCR24). Interestingly, PML39 also shared a similar degree of homology with a Drosophila protein (CG1115-PA), which has been shown to bind to Drosophila Tsg101 during the course of a genome wide screen of Drosophila protein-protein interactions (34Giot L. Bader J.S. Brouwer C. Chaudhuri A. Kuang B. Li Y. Hao Y.L. Ooi C.E. Godwin B. Vitols E. Vijayadamodar G. Pochart P. Machineni H. Welsh M. Kong Y. Zerhusen B. Malcolm R. Varrone Z. Collis A. Minto M.

An alignment of the amino-terminal 159 amino acids of PML39, which encodes the Mod(r) domain, with these homologues is shown in Fig. 1B. While this report was in preparation, human HCRP1 and FLJ1270 were independently identified by yeast two-hybrid screening and homology searches as potential mammalian orthologues of yeast VPS37 (29Stuchell M.D. Garrus J.E. Muller B. Stray K.M. Ghaffarian S. McKinnon R. Krausslich H.G. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These two proteins were designated VPS37A and VPS37B, and, based on sequence homology, FLJ20847 (hypothetical) and WBSCR24 were termed VPS37C and VPS37D. Although FLJ20847/VPS37C was not characterized further in these studies, one study showed that a Mod(r) domain-containing fragment of FLJ20847/VPS37C binds to Tsg101 in vitro (30Bache K.G. Slagsvold T. Cabezas A. Rosendal K.R. Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).The hypothetical 523-amino acid FLJ20847/VPS37C protein sequence, whose carboxyl terminus aligned perfectly the 355-amino acid PML39 coding sequence that we isolated, was deposited in the REFSEQ data base during the course of this work. However, the FLJ20847 hypothetical protein extends the amino terminus of VPS37C by 168 additional amino acids beyond that of the PML39 clone. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence suggested that the PML39 clone encoded the full-length VPS37C protein. First, a more recent BLAST search of human expressed sequence tags with sequences encoding the predicted amino terminus of the FLJ20847 hypothetical protein revealed no hits. Second, a mouse cDNA (RIKEN cDNA 5730409F24, accession number BC025865) that encodes the closest murine homologue of VPS37C contains an in-frame translational stop sequence 11 codons 5′ to a methionine codon that corresponds to the initiating methionine codon in the 355-amino acid PML39/VPS37C clone. Third, repeated attempts to PCR-amplify sequences encoding the 168-amino acid amino terminus of the hypothetical FLJ20847 protein from several human cDNAs sources were unsuccessful. We conclude that the genome annotation process was mistaken in this instance and that the authentic human VPS37C protein is encoded by the PML39 clone. This makes the size and organization of the VPS37C protein more similar to the recently characterized VPS37B protein (29Stuchell M.D. Garrus J.E. Muller B. Stray K.M. Ghaffarian S. McKinnon R. Krausslich H.G. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36059-36071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and hereafter we refer to the 355-amino acid, PML39-encoded protein as VPS37C. Aside from the presence of the Mod(r) domain, the other noteworthy feature of VPS37C is the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain; 67/197 carboxyl-terminal residues (34%) are proline. This feature is shared with VPS37B (39/120 (33%) proline residues) and VPS37D (23/78 (30%) proline residues). VPS37A lacks an equivalent carboxyl-terminal domain but contains a moderately proline-rich domain (26/162 residues) amino-terminal to the mod(r) domain shared by the VPS37 isoforms. The function of this domain is unknown at present, and it is not present in yeast VPS37.VPS37C Forms a Ternary Complex with Tsg101 and VPS28 in Human Cells—We next determined whether VPS37C could bind to components of ESCRT-I, namely Tsg101 and VPS28, when expressed in mammalian cells. Glutathione-Sepharose-based precipitation analysis using a GST-VPS37C fusion protein expressed in 293T cells showed that a coexpressed YFP-Tsg101 fusion protein, but not YFP alone, could be very efficiently coprecipitated with GST-VPS37C (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a YFP-VPS28 fusion protein was not efficiently coprecipitated by GST-VPS37C, and only trace amounts of VPS28 were detected in the glutathione-bound fraction (Fig. 2B). However, when YFP-Tsg101 and YFP-VPS28 were coexpressed, both were efficiently coprecipitated by GST-VPS37C (Fig. 2B, lanes 2). When a mutant YFP-Tsg101 fusion protein, that contains a four amino acid-to-alanine substitution in residues 368-371 and does not bind well to VPS28 (previously termed mutant A3 (27Martin-Serrano J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)), was coexpressed with GST-VPS37C and YFP-VPS28, the precipitable complex contained YFP-Tsg101(A3) but not YFP VPS28 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3). Thus, the ability of GST-VPS37C to associate with YFP-VPS28 was dependent on Tsg101 and we therefore conc"

Most RP-linked rhodopsin mutants are unable to fold correctly in the endoplasmic reticulum, are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system, and are highly prone to forming detergent-insoluble high molecular weight aggregates. Here we have reported that coexpression of folding-deficient, but not folding-proficient, ADRP-linked rhodopsin mutants impairs delivery of the wild-type protein to the plasma membrane. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-precipitation studies revealed that mutant and wild-type rhodopsins form a high molecular weight, detergentinsoluble complex in which the two proteins are in close (<70 Å) proximity. Co-expression of ARDP-linked rhodopsin folding-deficient mutants resulted in enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation and steady-state ubiquitination of the wild-type protein. These data suggested a dominant negative effect on conformational maturation that may underlie the dominant inheritance of ARDP.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-precipitation studies revealed that mutant and wild-type rhodopsins form a high molecular weight, detergentinsoluble complex in which the two proteins are in close (<70 Å) proximity. Co-expression of ARDP-linked rhodopsin folding-deficient mutants resulted in enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation and steady-state ubiquitination of the wild-type protein. These data suggested a dominant negative effect on conformational maturation that may underlie the dominant inheritance of ARDP. Rhodopsin is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates light-driven signal transduction in rod photoreceptors (1Ridge K.D. Abdulaev N.G. Sousa M. Palczewski K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of rhodopsin in mammalian cell culture appears to faithfully recapitulate its synthesis, folding, and assembly with its native chromophore, 11-cis retinal (2Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and thus is a tractable model system to understand the early events in rhodopsin biogenesis. Like other integral membrane proteins, nascent rhodopsin molecules are co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where they undergo N-linked glycosylation and conformational maturation prior to export to the Golgi apparatus and delivery to the plasma membrane (3Sung C.H. Tai A.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 195: 215-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rod photoreceptor cells, rhodopsin is delivered to the outer segments via vesicular transport on axonemal microtubules (reviewed in Ref. 3Sung C.H. Tai A.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 195: 215-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Li Z.Y. Fariss R.N. Prog. Retin. Eye. Res. 1998; 17: 175-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). With a combined incidence of ∼1 in 3500, RP is the most prevalent Mendelian degenerative retinopathy in humans. The majority of RP is inherited as an autosomal dominant (AD) trait linked to over 100 missense mutations in the rhodopsin gene (5Phelan J.K. Bok D. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 116-124PubMed Google Scholar), although ADRP has also been linked to genes encoding other structural components of the rod outer segment and the phototransduction cascade (6Inglehearn C.F. Eye. 1998; 12: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ADRP-linked rhodopsin mutations have been assigned to two classes based on their intracellular behavior when expressed in cell culture (7Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 8Sung C.H. Davenport C.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26645-26649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Class I mutants resemble wild-type in steady-state level, plasma membrane localization, and the ability to form functional chromophore when assembled with 11-cis retinal (9Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Class I mutants cluster near the C-terminal domain of rhodopsin and appear to be defective in trafficking to outer segments, possibly by virtue of their inability to bind to the Tctex-1 subunit of dynein/dynactin (10Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The most prevalent rhodopsin-linked ADRP mutations are class II mutants. When expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, class II mutant rhodopsins accumulate to lower steady-state levels compared with class I mutants or to wild-type (WT) rhodopsin protein. Class II mutants are unable to assemble with 11-cis retinal and are partially or completely retained in the ER, suggesting a defect in an early step in the folding or assembly pathway (7Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8840-8844Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 9Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Indeed, class II mutants such as P23H-rhodopsin and G188R-rhodopsin exhibit prolonged association with molecular chaperones compared with WT rhodopsin (11Chapple J.P. Cheetham M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19087-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Chapple J.P. Grayson C. Hardcastle A.J. van der Saliba R.S. Spuy J. Cheetham M.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 414-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and are substrates for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Consistent with a severe defect in folding, P23H is highly prone to form SDS-resistant high molecular weight multimers and non-ionic detergent-insoluble aggregates (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In these respects, class II rhodopsin mutations resemble mutations that underlie the pathogenesis of other dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases, including familial Parkinson and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (14Taylor J.P. Hardy J. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 2002; 296: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Indeed, like the mutations in SOD1 linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the >100 missense mutations responsible for ADRP are essentially randomly distributed throughout the sequence of rhodopsin, suggesting that class II rhodopsin-linked ADRP is a “conformational disease” (15Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Despite a wealth of studies investigating the genetic, biochemical, and biophysical properties of ADRP-linked rhodopsin mutants, the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations cause retinal degeneration remain poorly understood. A key to elucidating the pathogenic mechanism lies in unraveling the molecular basis of dominant inheritance, which could result from either a loss-of-function (i.e. dominant interference) or a gain-of-function mechanism. Here we have reported that class II mutants interfere with the biosynthetic maturation of WT rhodopsin, leading to retention of the latter in the endoplasmic reticulum and recruitment into oligomeric detergent-insoluble complexes. Our data indicated that this dominant interference results from a direct physical interaction between mutant and wild-type proteins and has important implications for the development of rational pharmacological and genetic interventions for the treatment of ADRP. Antibodies, Plasmids, and Other Reagents—The following antibodies were used in this study: Rho1D4 (16Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) (monoclonal; gift from R. Molday, University of British Columbia), B6-30 (17Vrabec T. Arbizo V. Adamus G. McDowell J.H.

Res. 1988; 1: 42-47PubMed Google Scholar) (monoclonal; gift from P. Hargrave, University of Florida), and anti-ubiquitin (polyclonal; Chemicon). S-protein HRP and S-protein-agarose were purchased from Novagen. Wild-type and P23H rhodopsin in pRK were obtained from J. Nathans (Johns Hopkins University). The ΔF508-CFTR-FLAG construct has been described earlier (19Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). V345M (13Illing M.E.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and G188R were made by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange® (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). YFP and CFP rhodopsin and P23H plasmids have been described previously (20Rajan R.S. Illing M.E. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Rho-Myc and Rho-S were made by annealing oligonucleotides corresponding to the c-Myc decapeptide (EQKLI-SEEDL) or the 15-amino acid S-peptide (KETAAAKFERQHMDS) between the HindIII and BamHI sites at the C terminus of human rhodopsin in the Rho-YFP plasmid. A stop codon was inserted at the end of the S-peptide coding sequence to prevent YFP from being translated. Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected as described previously (21Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were carried out by adding plasmid DNA as a calcium phosphate precipitate (22van der Graham F.L. Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). Each plasmid was introduced at 3 μg for an ∼40% confluent 10-cm dish of cells, and the total was made to 8 μg with empty vector. Western Blots, S-Protein Pulldowns, and Deglycosylation Assays— Cell pellets from transfected and washed HEK cells were lysed in 150 μl of ice-cold buffer A (PBS, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 5 min on ice. They were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were recovered. For Western blotting, lysates were separated on Ready Gel precast 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Chemiluminescence detection was carried out with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For S-protein pulldowns, lysates were diluted 1:10 with PBS containing protease inhibitors to achieve a final detergent concentration of 0.1%. Lysates were precleared with glutathione-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by overnight incubation with S-protein-agarose (Novagen). Beads were washed, in order, with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS + 0.02% SDS, PBS. Elution was performed with 1× sample buffer (+β-mercaptoethanol). For endoglycosidase H and PNGase (Roche Applied Science) digestions, elution from S-protein-agarose pulldowns was performed with 0.8% SDS (+β-mercaptoethanol). Endo H or PNGase digestions were then carried out for 1 h at 24 °C in a 10:1 dilution with the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. S-protein HRP was used at a ratio of 1:2000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% milk powder (PBSTM). Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells were starved for cysteine/methionine for 30 min and then labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 10 min. They were scraped off the plate and collected by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm in a microfuge. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of buffer A + 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min to remove detergent-insoluble material. Supernatants were diluted 1:10 with PBS to achieve a final detergent concentration of 0.1%. Pulldown with S-protein-agarose, followed by Western blotting, was performed as described in the previous paragraph. Input lysates were normalized for total 35S counts as described earlier (23Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Mg132 treatments, cells were incubated with 10 μm of Mg132 throughout the starvation, labeling, and chase period. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were harvested for microscopy as described in (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Epifluorescence micrographs were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a ×63 objective (NA 1.4). Digital (12-bit) images were acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) and processed by using METAMORPH software (Universal Imaging, Media, PA). The excitation filters, dichroics, and emission filters have been described before (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Measurements— FRET was determined as described previously (20Rajan R.S. Illing M.E. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on suspended cells (∼106 cells/ml) in a Spex fluorolog fluorometer with a Spex 1620 dual grating emission monochromator (Spex Industries, Metuchen, NJ). FRET measurements were made by exciting the donor (CFP) at 425 nm and monitoring the emission spectrum between 450 and 600 nm. All FRET spectra were corrected for background YFP fluorescence using a non-FRET pair consisting of identical amounts of YFP fusion construct and unlabeled rhodopsin (wild-type or mutant). Intrinsic YFP fluorescence was recorded for the background subtraction procedure (20Rajan R.S. Illing M.E. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) by excitation at 490 nm and emission between 505–600 nm. Slit widths were 2 mm for all experiments. Class II Mutants Impair Localization and Processing of WT Rhodopsin—To test whether expression of mutant rhodopsin can influence the biosynthesis and trafficking of WT rhodopsin, HEK-293 cells co-transfected with a class II mutant (P23H-CFP) and wild-type (Rho-YFP) rhodopsin were imaged simultaneously to assess the steady-state distributions of the two proteins (Fig. 1A). In this experiment, as in all of the experiments reported here, the two rhodopsin plasmids were introduced at equal concentration, matching the ratio of the two alleles present in the genome of ADRP heterozygotes. We have previously established that the presence of the fluorescent protein (green fluorescent protein, CFP, YFP) appended to the C terminus of rhodopsin has no discernable effect on its folding or intracellular distribution (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 20Rajan R.S. Illing M.E. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As expected from previous studies on class II mutants (2Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), P23H-CFP exhibited an exclusively intracellular distribution, consistent with its inability to mature from the ER to distal compartments of the secretory pathway (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, in cells co-expressing the two proteins, the distribution of Rho-YFP overlapped considerably with that of P23H-CFP, displaying extensive colocalization within intracellular compartments. Unlike the mutant protein, Rho-YFP was also evident at the cell periphery, suggesting that the impairment of delivery of WT rhodopsin to the plasma membrane in the presence of P23H was not complete. In the occasional cell that expressed wild-type rhodopsin in the absence of detectable mutant protein, Rho-YFP was present in its normal, predominantly plasma membrane distribution (Fig. 1A, arrowhead). These observations suggest that P23H may alter the folding and/or trafficking of WT rhodopsin. To clarify the biochemical effect of P23H on WT rhodopsin, a WT rhodopsin construct with a 15-amino acid C-terminal S tag was created (Rho-S), so that the synthesis and maturation of tagged WT rhodopsin could be selectively monitored in the presence of mutant rhodopsin. Attachment of small C-terminal epitope tags, such as c-Myc, does not alter either the processing of rhodopsin, its ability to bind retinal, or its ability to activate transducin (25Borjigin J. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14715-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that Rho-S can be selectively detected with S-protein HRP (left panel). The 1D4 anti-rhodopsin monoclonal antibody recognizes the last 8 C-terminal residues of rhodopsin (16Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 26MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) only in the context of an unmodified C terminus (26MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, incorporation of the C-terminal S tag (or YFP) completely abrogates recognition by 1D4 (right panel). Comparison of WT rhodopsin and Rho-S banding patterns, reflecting the relative levels of different WT rhodopsin glycoforms, suggests that introduction of the S tag does not alter the trafficking properties of rhodopsin. To test whether P23H influences the intracellular trafficking of WT rhodopsin, cells were co-transfected with Rho-S together with untagged P23H (or WT rhodopsin as a control) and analyzed for Rho-S expression by S-protein blot overlay (Fig. 1C). In the presence of untagged WT rhodopsin (lane 2), Rho-S migrated as a set of bands between ∼35–55 kDa, with the predominant species at ∼40 kDa (block arrow) corresponding to the mature, complex glycosylated form. In the presence of P23H (lane 3), there was a marked decrease in the intensity of this 40-kDa band and a concomitant increase in the intensity of a 35-kDa band (solid arrow) corresponding to core-glycosylated Rho-S. The identities of these species were confirmed by treatment of S-protein pulldowns with endoglycosidases F (or PNGase, which cleaves all N-linked oligosaccharides) and H (which cleaves only high mannose oligosaccharides characteristic of glycoproteins in a pre-Golgi compartment) (Fig. 1D). These data indicated that P23H, which is not able to fold into a transport-competent state, has a dominant effect in preventing the maturation of WT rhodopsin. To test whether this effect is specific for P23H, we co-expressed Rho-S together with a class I mutant (V345M) or a different class II mutant, G188R, and probed immunoblots of the lysates with S-protein HRP (Fig. 1E). Expression of the class I mutant had no detectable effect on Rho-S processing, as indicated by the predominance of the complex glycosylated form in immunoblots probed with S-protein HRP. By contrast, expression of G188R resulted in a severe reduction in the fraction of mature Rho-S, suggesting that dominant suppression of WT rhodopsin maturation may be a property shared among class II mutants. Direct Interaction between Mutant and WT Rhodopsin—One possible mechanism by which P23H might influence the maturation of WT rhodopsin is by depleting chaperones or other ER quality control factors required for correct folding of the wildtype protein. To test this possibility, cells were co-transfected with Rho-Myc and an unrelated integral membrane protein, the ΔF508 mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein is quantitatively unable to fold (23Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S.

Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), similar to that described for class II mutants of rhodopsin (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Like P23H, ΔF508 was localized exclusively to intracellular compartments; at the levels used in this experiment, it was present mainly in the ER, as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy (left panel). By contrast, in the same cells WT rhodopsin exhibited a predominantly plasma membrane distribution (right panel). These findings suggested that the effect of P23H co-expression on WT rhodopsin distribution is not simply a consequence of a generalized saturation, or impairment, of the ER quality control machinery.Fig. 1Class II mutants alter localization and processing of WT rhodopsin.A, P23H co-expression causes intracellular retention of WT rhodopsin.

Lysates of HEK-293 cells transfected with untagged, wild-type rhodopsin (Rho, lane 1), YFP- or S-tagged Rho (lanes 2 and 3, respectively) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes that were probed with S-protein HRP (left panel) or 1D4 mAb (right panel). The mobility of core-glycosylated and mature Rho is indicated by simple and block arrows, respectively. C, P23H co-expression leads to reduction in steady-state levels of mature rhodopsin.

Lysates of HEK-293 cells co-transfected with Rho-S and P23H were subjected to S-protein-agarose pulldown, and the eluates were either untreated (lane 2), treated with PNGase (lane 3), or with Endo H (lane 4). Lane 1, lysate from untransfected cells. Mobility position of deglycosylated Rho (Rho-CHO) and Rho oligomers (Rho2, Rho3, produced during the incubation with endoglycosidase) are noted.

To assess whether P23H and WT rhodopsin interact, protein-S-agarose was used to pull down Rho-S from lysates of cells co-transfected with equal plasmid amounts of P23H and Rho-S. The affinity-purified material was then subjected to immunoblotting using 1D4, which selectively recognizes only untagged rhodopsin (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the input material (left panel) indicated that P23H and WT rhodopsin were expressed at comparable levels and confirmed our previous finding (13Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F.

The 1D4 immunoreactive material from cells co-expressing P23H and Rho-S that bound to S-protein-agarose (right panel) was composed exclusively of dimers and higher multimers. By contrast, only background levels of 1D4 immunoreactivity were detected in pulldowns of cells co-expressing Rho-S and WT rhodopsin. No 1D4 immunoreactive material was detectable in eluates from control transfections that express WT rhodopsin lacking an S tag, confirming the specificity of the pulldown. These data demonstrated that P23H can form a complex with WT rhodopsin. Moreover, the absence of detectable P23H monomer in the bound fraction suggested that such complexes are extremely stable, as they were not disrupted under the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE. The presence of P23H in pulldowns of Rho-S could be due to a direct interaction between P23H and WT rhodopsin or to an indirect interaction, i.e. formation of a complex consisting of other proteins that bind to both the mutant and wild-type proteins. One way to discriminate between these two possibilities is FRET. This technique involves the transfer of energy from a fluorescent donor in its excited state to another excitable moiety, the acceptor, via non-radiative dipole-dipole interactions. This energy transfer process is highly sensitive to the distance and the orientation between the two fluorophores, typically occurring over a d"
https://openalex.org/W2005037646,"Both low temperatures and encounters with host phagocytes are two stresses that have been relatively well studied in many species of bacteria. Previous work has shown that the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is required for Yersiniae to grow at low temperatures. Here, we show that PNPase also enhances the ability of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia pestis to withstand the killing activities of murine macrophages. PNPase is required for the optimal functioning of the Yersinia type three secretion system (TTSS), an organelle that injects effector proteins directly into host cells. Unexpectedly, the effect of PNPase on the TTSS is independent of its ribonuclease activity and instead requires its S1 RNA binding domain. In contrast, catalytically inactive enzyme does not enhance the low temperature growth effect of PNPase. Surprisingly, wild-type-like TTSS functioning was restored to the pnp mutant strain by expressing just the ∼70 amino acid S1 domains from either PNPase, RNase R, RNase II, or RpsA. Our findings suggest that PNPase plays multifaceted roles in enhancing Yersinia survival in response to stressful conditions.

Our findings suggest that PNPase plays multifaceted roles in enhancing Yersinia survival in response to stressful conditions. Bacteria can rapidly modulate their metabolism to enhance their survival during periods of environmental change. For example, the cold shock response of Escherichia coli involves the induction of several genes including cold shock proteins (CSP) 1The abbreviations used are: CSP, cold shock protein; PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; TTSS, type three secretion system; Yops, Yersinia outer membrane protein virulence factors; MOI, multiplicity of infection; cfu, colony forming unit; YP, Y. pestis; YPT, Y. pseudotuberculosis; GFP, green fluorescent protein. as well as exoribonucleases PNPase and RNaseR involved in RNA metabolism (1Jones P.G.

Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition to E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and Yersinia enterocolitica have been shown to require PNPase for growth in the cold (3Luttinger A. Hahn J. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Huis in't Goverde R.L. Veld J.H. Kusters J.G. Mooi F.R. Mol.

It is believed that PNPase is required for the restart of growth following cold shock by degrading the remaining CSP mRNA molecules (5Yamanaka K. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2808-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Neuhaus K. Rapposch S. Francis K.P. Scherer S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3285-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar to cold-induced responses, interactions with immune cells also triggers bacterial responses that serve to enhance bacterial survival. Viewed in this light, at least some virulence gene products can be thought of as host cell-induced stress response proteins. Several bacterial pathogens secrete virulence factors that mollify anti-microbial killing systems of host cells. Many plant- and animal-interacting Gram-negative bacteria, including the pathogenic Yersiniae, utilize a type three secretion system (TTSS) to inject virulence factors directly from the bacterium into the host cell (7Galan J.E. Collmer A. Science. 1999; 284: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Yersinia outer membrane protein virulence factors (Yops) are either effector or facilitator proteins, the latter being necessary for the direct injection of the effector Yops into the host cell. YopE, an effector Yop, has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, and disrupts the host cell cytoskeleton (8Black D.S. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9Von Pawel-Rammingen U. Telepnev M.V. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Wolf-Watz H. Rosqvist R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). YopB and YopD have been shown to be required for the directed translocation of effector Yops into the host cell (10Hakansson S. Schesser K. Persson C. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Homble F. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 11Williams A.W. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 350-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears as though TTSS has evolved to directly address host cell-induced stresses. Through microarray analysis, a Salmonella enterica pnp mutant strain was recently shown to have altered patterns of gene expression in 3.44% of all genes analyzed including TTSS and fimbriae genes (12Clements M.O. Eriksson S. Thompson A. Lucchini S. Hinton J.C. Normark S. Rhen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8784-8789Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Differential expression of TTSS and fimbriae-encoding genes may account for the differences observed between the wild-type and pnp strains in cell culture and animal infection assays (12Clements M.O. Eriksson S. Thompson A. Lucchini S. Hinton J.C. Normark S. Rhen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8784-8789Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether Yersinia ribonucleases are involved in host cell-induced stress responses and specifically tested whether PNPase affects the functioning of Yersinia TTSS. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Oligonucleotide primer sequences used for constructing strains and plasmids are provided under Supplemental Materials. The Y. pseudotuberculosis (YPT) pnp strain was derived from the parental YPIII/pIB100 yopE::gfp (13Bartra S. Cherepanov P. Forsberg A. Schesser K. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using a recombinase-based method (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). In brief, a kanamycin or a chloramphenicol resistant cassette was PCR-amplified by using forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers flanked by 30 nucleotides of complementary target gene sequence. These PCR products were transformed into YPT strains previously transformed with a plasmid encoding the lambda red recombinase. Following transformation of the PCR product and subsequent recombination, the inserted resistance cassette was then excised by virtue of a flanking FRT site. The recombinase-encoding plasmids were then cured, and deletion of the entire pnp coding sequence was confirmed by PCR and immunoblotting. The YPIII/pIB604 strain was used as the TTSS-deficient (yopB) control (10Hakansson S. Schesser K. Persson C. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Homble F. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). All Y. pestis (YP) strains originate from the KIM5–3001 strain (15Lindler L.E. Klempner M.S. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A KIM5–3001 yopB mutant strain was generated by an allelic replacement strategy as described by Day et al. (16Day J.B. Ferracci F. Plano G.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The YP ribonuclease mutant strains were generated using the same method as described above, and the YP pnp strain was deleted from residues 79–578. For the Elk-tagged translocation assay (Fig. 7), the KIM5–3001.P39 and P.41 strains (PNPase+/YopB + and PNPase+/YopB, respectively) were used (16Day J.B. Ferracci F. Plano G.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PNPase-/YopB+ strain was generated by transferring the pCD1 virulence plasmid from KIM-3001.P39 into the pnp strain described above.Fig. 1Viability assay of Yersinia pnp-deficient strains in an infection assay.A, YPT wild-type, yopB, and pnp strains were transformed with either the control vector pCL-1920 or pCL-1920 encoding E. coli PNPase (pnp/PNP+). Transformants were added to tissue culture wells containing RAW 267 mouse macrophages at MOIs of 0.2–0.5. Following a 30-min attachment period, excess bacteria were removed, and the number of viable cell-associated bacteria was determined by plating either immediately (0 h) or 6 h later. Three independent wells per strain were analyzed, and the average fold-increases over the 6-h infection period for each strain are shown graphically. Using the Student's t test and calculating for unequal variance, p < 0.01 for the differences between the wild type and yopB, wild type and pnp, and pnp and pnp/PNP+. For an independent YPT viability assay showing actual numbers of cfu per well see Supplemental Materials (Fig. S1A). B, YP wild-type, yopB, and pnp strains were assayed in the same manner as the YPT strains shown in A with the exception that a 8-h infection period was used. p values <0.01 were calculated when comparing differences between wild type and yopB, and wild type and pnp.

Infected cells were then lysed, lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting blots were probed with either antibodies specific for phosphorylated Elk or total Elk. B, signals were quantified by the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, and normalized values were determined by dividing the samples phospho-Elk signal by its total Elk signal (absolute values provided in Supplemental Materials).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Constructs encoding either the full-length E. coli PNPase or PNPase variants were supplied by Claude Portier (17Jarrige A. Brechemier-Baey D. Mathy N. Duche O. Portier C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Various S1 domains from YP proteins (Fig. 10) were cloned into Bluescript (pSK, Stratagene), which was previously converted into a Gateway-compatible destination vector (Invitrogen). Cell Infection Assays—Viability assays (Fig. 1) were performed essentially as described by Bartra et al. (13Bartra S. Cherepanov P. Forsberg A. Schesser K. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). YPT wild-type and yopB strains were transformed with the empty control vector pCL-1920, and the YPT pnp strain was transformed with either the control vector pCL-1920, or a pCL-1920 construct encoding the E. coli full-length PNPase. In brief, a murine macrophage-like cell line (RAW 264) was seeded in 24-well plates at densities of 2.5–4.0 × 105 per well. Cultures were grown to saturation in either defined TMH (19Straley S.C. Bowmer W.S. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 445-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) medium supplemented with 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C (Figs. 1A, 5, 6, and 11) or tissue culture medium at 26 °C (Figs. 1B, 2, 8, and 10). Similar results were obtained when cultures were grown under either condition. Strains were added to each well at low multiplicity of infections (MOIs) to minimize background. Following removal of unattached bacteria after 30 min, fresh RPMI medium was added to each well. At the indicated times, the number of viable bacteria in each well was determined by first removing the medium followed by lysing the infected cells (but not bacteria) with 500 μl of distilled H2O, a portion of which was spread on a Luria-Bertani plate, and colony forming units (cfu) were counted 2–3 days later.Fig. 11S1-mediated effects on YPT YopE expression and secretion. The wild-type and pnp strains used in Fig. 5 were transformed with either an empty Bluescript vector (lanes 1–4) or a Bluescript vector expressing either the PNPase S1 domain or RNaseR S1 domain (S1PNPase or S1RNaseR, respectively). All strains were grown and induced as described in the legend to Fig. 4 or left uninduced. Samples were removed as quickly as possible after the addition of the TTSS inducer EGTA (∼20-s time point), and YopE levels from both whole cell and supernatant fractions were determined by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8PNPase determinants required for YP-induced HeLa cell cytotoxicity.

The above photographs were taken after2hof infection at 37 °C. A (inset) endogenous PNPase protein levels in the wild-type and pnp strain (lane A) as well as levels of plasmid-encoded PNPases from the strains shown in the corresponding B–E were determined by immunoblotting. Similar results were obtained for YPT strains expressing PNPase variants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For cytotoxicity assays (Figs. 2, 8, 10, and Supplemental Materials Fig. S5), HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates at densities of 1.5 × 105–2.0 × 105 in RPMI +10% bovine serum. Strains were added to wells at MOIs as indicated in the figure legends, and cells were monitored for Yersinia-induced cytotoxicity. The degree of cytotoxicity was determined using a defined scoring system described under Supplemental Materials (Fig. S2). TTSS Assays—In the Elk-tagged translocation assay (Fig. 7), YP strains were transformed with the expression plasmid pYopE-Elk1 that contained yopE sequences (codons 1–129) translationally fused to an elk1 fragment (codons 375–392) derived from pFA2-Elk-1 (16Day J.B. Ferracci F. Plano G.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These transformants were grown to saturation at 26 °C in Heart Infusion Broth (HIB) with appropriate antibiotics, and saturated cultures were diluted to an A620 of 0.15. These diluted cultures were then grown in HIB with appropriate antibiotics at 26 °C for 3 h after which the number of bacteria were again normalized and added to HeLa cells at a MOI of ∼30. After a 3-h infection period, HeLa cells were lysed with sample buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The resulting blots were probed with rabbit anti-phospho-Elk Ser-383 and Elk antibodies, respectively (Cell Signaling). The secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) that possesses a near-infrared fluorophore, which is excited at 680 nm and emits at 702 nm when scanned on the Odyssey Imaging System (Licor). The digital image obtained by the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System was then quantified using the Odyssey v1.1 software (Licor). The method of Plano and Straley (18Plano G.V. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3536-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed for the growth restriction assay (Fig. 4). In brief, cultures were grown to saturation in defined TMH medium (19Straley S.C. Bowmer W.S. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 445-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and strains were diluted in 3 ml of TMH (either without or with 2.5 mm of Ca2+) to optical densities (620 nm) of 0.2. Diluted cultures were then grown for 1 h at 26 °C and then shifted to 37 °C where optical densities at 620 nm were read every hour for a 5-h period. For flow cytometric analysis of yopE promoter activity (Fig. 5), cultures were grown to saturation in 2 ml of TMH containing 2.5 mm Ca2+ and 5.0 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. Cultures were diluted to an A620 of 0.2 in 5 ml of TMH that was prewarmed to 37 °C and contained 2.5 mm Ca2+ and 5.0 mm MgCl2. After 1 h of shaking at 37 °C, the TTSS was induced by adding 5.0 mm EGTA, a calcium chelator. At various times, 300-μl samples were removed and placed in prechilled tubes and kept on ice. Bacterial cells were then washed once in Hank's Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended in 300 μl of HBSS. Flow analysis was then carried out using a Facscan 488 with an argon laser (BD Biosciences), and mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs) were analyzed using the Cellquest Pro software (BD Biosciences). In the secretion assay shown in Figs. 6 and 11, cultures were grown exactly the same way as for the above flow cytometric analysis except that some cultures did not receive EGTA. At the indicated time points, 1-ml samples were removed and placed in prechilled tubes and were kept on ice. Cells and supernatants were fractionated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. 500 μl of the resulting supernatant were removed and precipitated with 55 μl of trichloroacetic acid overnight on ice after which samples were centrifuged 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal mix of anti-YopE and anti-YopD antibodies (Fig. 6) or anti-YopE alone (Fig. 11). Cell pellets were resuspended directly in sample buffer and were analyzed together with the secreted proteins. Cold Growth Assays—For the experiment shown in Fig. 9, strains were grown to saturation at 26 °C in HIB with the appropriate antibiotics, diluted 10-1, and grown for 1 h at 26 °C. Cultures were then diluted 10-5, and 50 μl were plated on LB plates containing antibiotics, if necessary, and were incubated at 4–6 °C for 10 days. Viability of PNPase and Various Ribonuclease-deficient Strains in an Infection Assay—The viability of a YPT PNPase-deficient mutant strain was tested in a cell infection assay using a mouse macrophage-like cell line. Previously, it had been demonstrated that this assay is sensitive to well characterized virulence determinants of YPT (13Bartra S. Cherepanov P. Forsberg A. Schesser K. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There was a 14.8-fold increase in cfu of the wild-type YPT strain between the start of the infection and the 6-h end point (Fig. 1A). In contrast, there was a decrease in the number of cfu of the YPT TTSS-deficient yopB strain during the 6-h infection period. The cfu fold-increase of the YPT pnp strain was significantly reduced when compared with the wild-type strain in this assay (p < 0.01). Wild-type-like levels of viability were restored to the YPT pnp strain by supplying E. coli PNPase in trans (Fig. 1A; p < 0.05 between the pnp and pnp/PNP+). For an independent YPT viability assay showing actual numbers of cfu recovered per well see Supplemental Materials (Fig. S1A). We also evaluated whether PNPase contributed to YP survival vis-à-vis cultured macrophages. There was a 15.5-fold increase in cfu of the wild-type YP strain between the start of the infection and the 8-h end point (Fig. 1B). There was a small increase (1.3-fold) in the number of cfu of the YP yopB strain during the 8-h infection period. Similar to what was observed in YPT, the cfu fold-increase of the YP pnp strain was significantly less than the wild-type strain (p < 0.01). For an independent YP viabilty assay represented by actual numbers of cfu recovered per well see Supplemental Materials (Fig. S1B). Differences observed in viability between the various strains shown in Figs. 1A, 1B, S1A, S1B were not a result of differential binding to host cells since approximately the same number of viable bacteria were recovered after the initial 30-min attachment period. Collectively, these data show that both the YPT and YP pnp mutant strains behaved similarly relative to their respective wild-type and TTSS-deficient strains in a viability-based infection assay. To test whether the loss of viability of the PNPase strain in the infection assay is caused by a general loss of ribonuclease activity, we tested YP strains mutated in RNaseII, RNaseIII, and RNaseR in our infection assay. We found that the performance of these mutant strains were indistinguishable from that of the isogenic wild-type strain (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1B, and data not shown). PNPase and Cytotoxicity of Yersinia-infected HeLa Cells— Since PNPase appeared to play a specific role in Yersinia viability in the infection assay, we examined whether PNPase was necessary for Yersinia to affect the morphology of HeLa cells. Yersinia enhances its viability vis-à-vis the host cell by employing its TTSS to disrupt the cytoskeleton of the infected cell (13Bartra S. Cherepanov P. Forsberg A. Schesser K. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Rosqvist R. Forsberg A. Rimpilainen M. Bergman T. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). HeLa cells infected by the wild-type YPT and YP strains retract following a 2–3-h infection period (Fig. 2, A and B respectively). Yersinia-mediated HeLa cell cytotoxicity was quantified using a defined scoring system (Fig. 3 and Supplemental Materials, Fig. S2). In contrast, the morphology of cells infected with the TTSS-deficient yopB strains appeared unaltered and resembled uninfected cells. Cells infected with the pnp strains did display a cytotoxic effect indicating that these strains were delivering effector Yops into host cells. However, the kinetics of the HeLa cell cytotoxicity induced by the pnp strain appeared delayed relative to the wild-type-infected cells. Transforming the YP and YPT pnp strains with a plasmid encoding E. coli PNPase restored the HeLa cell cytotoxicity to levels observed in wild-type-infected cells (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the pnp strain possesses a translocation-competent TTSS, which may function suboptimally. A compromised TTSS likely accounts for the decreased viability of the pnp strains in the infection assays shown in Fig. 1. PNPase and TTSS Functioning—Based upon the resemblance between the pnp strains and the TTSS-deficient yopB strains in the above assays, we further analyzed TTSS functioning in the YP and YPT pnp strains. Normally, Yersinia possessing an intact TTSS arrest their growth when shifted from their optimal growing temperature of 26–37 °C in medium lacking calcium; this is referred to as “growth restriction” (21Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 4, similar to the wild-type strain, the YP pnp strain ceased growing when shifted to 37 °C in medium lacking calcium in contrast to YP strains with disregulated TTSSs that either constitutively secrete Yops in both the absence and presence of calcium termed calcium blind (22Day J.B. Plano G.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or constitutively grow in either the presence or absence of calcium, calcium-independent. 2G. V. Plano and F. Ferracci, unpublished data. These data indicate that PNPase is not required for TTSS-dependent growth restriction. We then tested whether PNPase plays a role in Yop virulence factor expression and export by the TTSS. We measured Yop secretion in YPT since YP possesses a unique extracellular protease, Pla that rapidly degrades secreted Yops (23Sodeinde O.A. Sample A.K. Brubaker R.R. Goguen J.D. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2749-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional feature of the YPT strains used in Fig. 1A is that they contain a yopE::gfp transcriptional fusion gene that allows for yopE promoter activity measurements without affecting the expression or function of YopE (13Bartra S. Cherepanov P. Forsberg A. Schesser K. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Strains were grown at 37 °C in the presence of calcium, and the expression and secretion of Yops were induced by adding a calcium chelator to the medium. For evaluating yopE promoter activity in the wild-type and pnp YPT strains, samples were removed from the medium at various times shortly after induction and analyzed by flow cytometry. As previously reported (13Bartra S. Cherepanov P. Forsberg A. Schesser K. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the wild-type strain had a detectable increase in yopE promoter-driven GFP signal within 5 min following induction that steadily increased to 5.5-fold compared with initial levels by 60 min (Fig. 5). In the pnp strain, initial GFP levels were comparable to those observed in the wild-type strain, and following TTSS induction, there was a similar increase in GFP signal (Fig. 5). These data indicate that PNPase does not grossly affect either steady-state or inductive yopE promoter activity. For the direct analysis of cellular Yop protein levels, YPT strains were grown and induced in the same fashion as shown in Fig. 5. As measured by immunoblotting, YopE protein levels increased in both wild-type and pnp cells 20 min following induction whereas cellular YopD protein levels changed very little in either strain during the course of the experiment (Fig. 6). These data closely matched the results obtained in the flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 5) in that, essentially, no differences in steady-state or inductive Yop protein levels were observed between the wild-type and pnp YPT strains. To test whether PNPase affected Yop secretion, YopE and YopD protein levels were determined in the culture supernatants from the above samples. Prior to induction, low levels of YopE and YopD were detected in the culture supernatant from the wild-type strain (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). By either 5 or 20 min following induction, there were several fold-increases in YopE and YopD protein levels, respectively, in the wild-type culture supernatants (lanes 5 and 9). In stark contrast, very little YopE protein, and no detectable YopD protein were observed in the cultural supernatant from the pnp strain prior to induction (lanes 3 and 4). In fact, YopE and YopD protein were not detectable in the pnp culture supernatants until either 5 or 20 min, respectively (lanes 7 and 11). Although YopE protein was detected 5 min after induction, the levels were severalfold lower than that present in the culture supernatant from the wild-type strain (compare lanes 5 with 7 and 9 with 11). However, by 60 and 120 min following induction, there were little appreciable differences in YopE and YopD protein levels between the wild-type and pnp culture supernatants (data not shown). These data suggest that PNPase is involved in configuring Yersinia TTSS in such a way that maximal Yop effector proteins are exported from the bacterium upon induction. A translocation assay was employed to test whether the reduced initial Yop secretion rates in the pnp strain translated into reduced Yop injection into host cells. A plasmid encoding a hybrid protein consisting of YopE (residues 1–130) and a 40-residue Elk tag was transformed into the YP wild-type, yopB, and pnp strains. The relative level of YopE-Elk translocation into HeLa cells can be determined by probing for Elk phosphorylation that only occurs within the host cell (16Day J.B. Ferracci F. Plano G.V. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2108490141,"Rad18 is involved in postreplication repair mainly through monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Here we show that Rad18 protein was detected in human cells as two major bands at 75 and 85 kDa by Western blot. The bands were identified as nonubiquitinated and monoubiquitinated forms of Rad18, respectively, by mass spectrometry. Multiple ubiquitinated bands of Rad18 were detected <i>in vitro</i> in the presence of E1, E2 (Rad6), and methylated ubiquitin, indicating that Rad18 was monoubiquitinated at multiple sites through autoubiquitination. Rad18 self-associates, and this interaction was abolished by replacing one of the conserved cysteine residues with phenylalanine in the zinc finger domain (C207F). In the C207F mutant Rad18, monoubiquitination of Rad18 was not observed <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting that self-association was critical for monoubiquitination. Monoubiquitinated Rad18 was detected mainly in the cytoplasm, whereas nonubiquitinated Rad18 was detected predominantly in the nuclei. Furthermore, Rad18 was shown to be polyubiquitinated in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. Purified Rad18 was also polyubiquitinated in an <i>in vitro</i> system containing E1, E2 (Rad6), and ubiquitin, and it was degraded by the addition of proteasomes. These results suggest that the amount of Rad18 in the nucleus is regulated differentially by mono- and polyubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W3027527462,"Data on human genetic variation help scientists to understand human origins, susceptibility to illness and genetic causes of disease. Destructive episodes in the history of genetic research make it crucial to consider the ethical and social implications of research in genomics, especially human genetic variation. The analysis of ethical, legal and social implications should be integrated into genetic research, with the participation of scientists who can anticipate and monitor the full range of possible applications of the research from the earliest stages. The design and implementation of research directs the ways in which its results can be used, and data and technology, rather than ethical considerations or social needs, drive the use of science in unintended ways. Here we examine forensic genetics and argue that all geneticists should anticipate the ethical and social issues associated with nonmedical applications of genetic variation research."
https://openalex.org/W1507838062,"Phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) isoforms, which are under the control of Gαq and Gβγ subunits, generate Ca2+ signals induced by a broad array of extracellular agonists, whereas PLCδ isoforms depend on a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ for their activation. Here we find that PLCβ2 binds strongly to PLCδ1 and inhibits its catalytic activity in vitro and in living cells. In vitro, this PLC complex can be disrupted by increasing concentrations of free Gβγ subunits. Such competition has consequences for signaling, because in HEK293 cells PLCβ2 suppresses elevated basal [Ca2+] and inositol phosphates levels and the sustained agonist-induced elevation of Ca2+ levels caused by PLCδ1. Also, expression of both PLCs results in a synergistic release of [Ca2+] upon stimulation in A10 cells. These results support a model in which PLCβ2 suppresses the basal catalytic activity of PLCδ1, which is relieved by binding of Gβγ subunits to PLCβ2 allowing for amplified calcium signals.

The binding of an agonist to its target G protein-coupled receptor stimulates heterotrimeric G proteins, which in turn can result in an increase in intracellular Ca2+ through the activation of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; PH, pleckstrin homology; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescent complex; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PTX, pertussis toxin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DABCS4L, 4-(dimethylamino)phenylazo-phenyl-4-sulfonyl chloride succinyl ester.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). PLCs catalyze the hydrolysis of a minor lipid component, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), to release the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). These messengers in turn activate protein kinase C and stimulate the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. All PLCβs (β1–β4) are regulated by Gαq subunits that are coupled to specific sets of G protein-coupled receptors. PLCβ2 and to a lesser extent PLCβ3 can also be stimulated by Gβγ subunits (1Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 2Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Because Gβγ subunits have the potential to be released from all types of Gα-Gβγ heterotrimers, PLCβ2 and -β3 may be activated by a wider range of receptors. In contrast to other mammalian PLC enzymes, the cellular regulation of PLCδ enzymes is unclear. It is known that these enzymes are regulated by an increase in cellular Ca2+ levels because PLCδ is the only PLC family that is not active at basal Ca2+ levels but is strongly activated when cytoplasmic Ca2+ rises above basal levels (1Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 3Ochocka A.M. Pawelczyk T. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This behavior suggests that PLCδs function to amplify, rather than initiate, calcium-mobilizing signals. At maximum Ca2+ concentrations, the specific catalytic activity of purified PLCδ1 is typically 50–100-fold greater than that of unstimulated PLCβ or PLCγ. When reconstituted into permeabilized PC12 and HL60 cells, PLCδ1, but not PLCβ1 or PLCγ1, shows substantial activation by physiologic calcium levels (4Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PLCδ1 in PC12 and Chinese hamster ovary cells enhances the increase in cellular Ca2+ and soluble inositol phosphate levels produced by bradykinin (5Kim Y-H. Park T.-J. Lee Y.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15846-15852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-amplification role of PLCδ1 has been clearly defined in keratinocytes derived from PLCδ1-null mice in which the sustained elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ that follows a PLCγ1-stimulated rapid rise does not occur but can be reconstituted when PLCδ1 is introduced (7Nakamura Y. Fukami K. Yu N. Takenaka K. Kataoka Y. Shirakata Y. Nishikawa S-I. Hashimoto K. Yoshida N. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2981-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that activation of PLCδ1 is under more complex control than the simple rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+. In frog oocytes expressing thrombin and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, microinjection of PLCδ1 antibody specifically inhibits thrombin but not platelet-derived growth factor-induced calcium mobilization (8Cho Y.S. Han M.K. Chae S.W. Park C.U. Kim U.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells, overexpression of PLCδ1 enhances the amount of inositol phosphates generated by ionomycin, but this increment is much smaller than the increase observed during thrombin stimulation (6Banno Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15846-15852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results are obtained in bradykinin-stimulated PC12 cells expressing high levels of PLCδ1 (5Kim Y-H. Park T.-J. Lee Y.H. Baek K.J. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here, raising calcium with high extracellular potassium, thapsigargin, or ionomycin induces a measurable increase in inositol trisphosphate, yet this increment is substantially less than that observed with a maximum dose of bradykinin. Thus, although these observations support a generalized amplification hypothesis, they suggest that receptor-generated signals other than calcium also contribute to PLCδ1-dependent inositol phosphate generation. Whereas protein regulators of most mammalian PLCs have been identified, those for PLCδ1 have not been well established. A novel form of RhoGAP associates strongly with PLCδ1 in cell lysates (9Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), stimulating its catalytic activity at low levels of calcium (0.1 μm). There is compelling evidence that PLCδ1 is also regulated by an atypical GTP-binding protein, Gh, or transglutaminase (10Im M.J. Russell M.A. Feng J.F. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Gh is controlled by α1-adrenergic receptor α1b and α1d in heart and liver (11Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C.D. Im M. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 315: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PLCδ1 stimulates GDP/GTP exchange on TGII/Gh (11Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C.D. Im M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5591-5597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and reciprocally, Gh allows PLCδ1 to be stimulated at lower Ca2+ concentrations. Although these studies show that TGII/Gh couples heptahelical receptors to PLCδ1, the fraction of the total cellular response that this represents is unclear. Other regulators of PLCδ1 have been suggested. Association of PLCδ1 to GAP43 results in a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+, although it is uncertain whether this is because of increased membrane association of PLCδ1 (16Caprini M. Gomis A. Cabedo H. Planells-Cases R. Belmonte C. Viana F. Ferrer-Montiel A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The activity of PLCδ4 is suppressed by a inactive PLCδ4-Alt3 variant (17Nagano K. Fukami K. Minagawa T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether comparable regulators of other PLCδ isozymes exist. Most PLCβ and PLCδ isozymes are widely expressed with varying tissue distribution. PLCβ2, which is the focus of this study, is expressed at high levels in cells of hematopoietic origin. Mice lacking this isozyme have abnormal chemokine signaling, possibly through Gβγ released from Gαi/o-coupled receptors (18Lee S.B. Rao A.K. Lee K.H. Yang X. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLCδ1 is the most widely distributed PLCδ isotype and is most strongly expressed in skeletal muscle, some layers of the skin, the spleen, testis, and lung (1Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 3Ochocka A.M. Pawelczyk T. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Homma Y. Takenawa T. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, PLCδ1 is found primarily in glial cells (20Yamada H. Mizuguchi M. Rhee S.G. Kim S.U. Brain Res. 1991; 59: 7-16Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Yamada M. Kakita A. Mizuguchi M. Rhee S.G. Kim S.U. Ikuta F. Brain Res. 1993; 606: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, like PLCβ2, its presence is low in most neurons. Previous work in our laboratories has focused on characterizing the regulation of PLCδ1 and PLCβ2. Here we report that PLCβ2 inhibits PLCδ and that this inhibition is relieved upon binding of Gβγ to PLCβ2. Our results suggest a novel mechanism in which G protein stimulation has the ability to amplify PLCβ2-generated Ca2+ signals through simultaneous activation of PLCδ1 under some cellular conditions. In Vitro Fluorescence Studies—Gβ1γ2 subunits and PLCβ2 were expressed in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus system (22Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Gβ1γ2 subunits were reconstituted into preformed lipid bilayers by simple addition (23Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PLCδ1 was bacterially expressed and purified (24Tall E. Dorman G. Garcia P. Runnels L. Shah S. Chen J.

Association measurements between membrane-bound proteins were carried out in large unilamellar vesicles composed of 67% anionic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-l-phosphatidylserine and 33% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-l-phosphatidylcholine, where both PLC enzymes are membrane-bound above 250 μm total lipid (data not shown) (25Garcia P.

Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein-protein association was assessed using the fluorescence methods described previously (27Guo Y. Philip F. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29995-30004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were covalently labeled with either acrylodan or coumarin (26Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were excited at 340 nm and scanned from 380 to 500 nm. The emission intensity was taken from the integrated area of the spectrum. We found that the emission intensity of labeled PLCβ2 showed a substantial and reproducible increase upon the addition of unlabeled PLCδ1 and gave a titration curve that showed the appropriate shift in midpoint when the initial concentration of acrylodan-PLCβ2 was changed, thereby reflecting protein-protein association. Protein-protein associations were also assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer using coumarinand DABCSYL-labeled proteins and were carried out similarly by using the methods and analysis described previously (28Runnels L.W. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PLC Activity Measurements—PLC activity measurements were conducted by using purified proteins and detergent-mixed micelles substrates as described previously (26Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Cifuentes M.E. Delaney T. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1945-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of BiFC Plasmid—The vectors used to construct YFP fusion proteins were generously provided by Dr. Thomas Kerppola (University of Michigan). These vectors contained YFP fragments (FLAG/YN-Smad3 or FLAG/YC-Smad4) that can associate to form a bimolecular fluorescent complex (BiFC). The coding sequence of human PLCβ2 was amplified by using PCR with PLCβ2.pVL1392 plasmid as template and was subcloned through EcoRI/XbaI sites into the FLAG/YN-Smad3 vector. The primer set was 5′-CGGCGGCCGCGGAATTCTGCAAAGAGGAACG-3′ and 3′-CCCACAGCTCTAGAAGGCTGGGGCTCCTTTTTCCTGGGGG 5′, which contained restriction enzyme sites EcoRI and XbaI (underlined), respectively. PLCβ2 was subcloned through an ECOR/XbaI site into FLAG/YN-SMAD3 vector. Similarly, human PLCδ1 was amplified by using PCR with PLCδ1.pet3a plasmid as template (the primer set was 5′-GTTTAACTGGTACCAGGAGATATACATATGGACTC-3′ and 3′-CTCAGGGGGGACCCCTCTAGATTCCTCCAGCCTAGTCC-5′, which contained restriction enzyme sites KpnI and XbaI (underlined), respectively) and was subcloned through KpnI/XbaI sites into FLAG/YC-Smad4 vector. The PLCβ2-FLAG/YN-Smad3 and PLCδ1-FLAG/YC-Smad4 plasmids were sequenced by checking their reading frames. Cell Culture and Overexpression of PLCs—HEK293 cells and A10 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For A10 cells, the medium was supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For fluorescence studies, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with BiFC-PLCβ2/PLCδ1 vectors (15 μg/106 cells in 60-mm dish) by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. HEK293 cells transfected with either BiFC-PLCβ2/PLCδ1 vectors or vectors lacking the BiFC tags were used in the Ca2+ and inositol phosphate studies as both produced identical results. A Western blot showing the levels of expression is given in Fig. 3. In the pertussis toxin (PTX)-treated cells, HEK293 cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml for 16–20 h. Imaging of Fluorescence in Living Cells—24 h after transfection, cells from 60-mm dishes were plated into Labtek chambered glass coverslips (Bio-Rad). Fluorescence emission from living cells was measured 48–72 h after transfection on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope using 63× 1.4 numerical aperature oil objective. Emission spectra of BiFC complexes from a 100-mm dish of living cells were taken on an ISS spectrofluorometer (Champaign, IL). Cells expressing BiFC-PLCβ2/PLCδ1 were placed in a 1-cm cuvette with stirring at an adjusted concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Spectra were taken at λexc = 500 nm and scanning from 535 to 600 nm. Cut-off filters (525 nm, Corion Optical) were placed before the monochromators to help reduce the amount of scattered light. Background samples were obtained from cultures transfected with only one of the BiFC constructs. Background spectra, which contributed 12–22% of the signal, were subtracted from the corresponding sample spectra. For immunostaining, cells were grown on Labtek chambers, fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked in PBS containing 5% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 50 mm glycine overnight. The monoclonal antibody against PLCδ1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used as the primary antibody. Polyclonal antibody against PLCβ2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also used as the primary antibody. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Cells were incubated in primary antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. This was followed by three washes of 7 min each in PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:2000 in PBS, 0.5% BSA. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody was to detect PLCδ1 antibody, and DSRed-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used to detect antibody against PLCβ2. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed by PBS (three times at 7 min each). Finally, PBS was added to the cells, and the specimens were viewed under the Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. Preparation of BiFC-PLCβ2/PLCδ1 Membranes—Cells expressing BiFC-PLCβ2/PLCδ1 were harvested and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed with PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and homogenized. The lysate was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing the cell membranes was resuspended, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml. Both purified Gβγ subunits and PLCβ2 were briefly dialyzed in 20 mm Hepes, 0.16 m KCl, 1mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, to remove detergent in the Gβγ storage buffer. Measurement of Cellular [Ca2+]i—Cellular [Ca2+]i was determined with the fluorescent calcium indicator dye fura-2/AM in an ISS spectrofluorometer. Briefly, cell monolayers were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,5mm glucose, 15 mm Hepes, 1% BSA, pH 7.4), and the cells were detached by a buffer stream. Suspended cells were labeled with 1 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min at 37 °C in HBSS with rotation. Thereafter, cells were washed twice and incubated in HBSS for another 20 min. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and were measured in a continuously stirred cell suspension at room temperature. The ratio of fluorescence emitted at 340 and 380 nm (340:380 ratio) of cells was converted to Ca2+ concentration by the method of Tsien and co-workers (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the relation: [Ca2+]i free (nm) = ((R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R)) ·(Fmax/Fmin) ·Kd (nm). The Fura-2/AM Kd value is ∼225 nm. Fmax is the fluorescence at that wavelength in EDTA buffer, and Fmin is the fluorescence in the presence of detergent and excess calcium. R is the measured ratio, and Rmin and Rmax are the ratios corresponding to the EDTA and detergent/excess calcium conditions, respectively. In some experiments, [Ca2+]i was determined in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ by treatment cell with 1 mm EGTA. Measurements of Inositol Phosphate Formation and Phosphoinositide Analysis in Intact Cells—Cells were prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) for 2 days in inositol-free medium. The cells were harvested, kept in suspension, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with HBSS/LiCl (118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,5mm d-glucose, and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mm LiCl), before challenging with agonist. For agonist stimulation, the cells were incubated with agonist (5 μm carbachol) in the presence of LiCl for 30 min at 37 °C. All reactions were stopped by removing the incubation medium and lysing the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. After the addition of 1 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of H2O, phase separation was performed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous upper phase was applied to AG 1-X8 anion exchange columns to isolate myo-[3H]-inositol phosphate formation. For determination of phosphoinositide levels, the lower phase was collected and evaporated by vacuum drying, and the lipids were resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform and spotted onto LK5D linear-k silica gel TLC plates (Whatman). The plates were developed in chloroform, methanol, 2.5 m ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2, v/v). The areas corresponding to authentic PtdIns (Rf = 0.64), PtdIns(4)P (Rf = 0.45), and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Rf = 0.25) were scraped into vials, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of disintegrations/min was normalized for protein content. PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 Strongly Interact on Model Membrane Surfaces—This study began with the unexpected finding that PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 form heteromeric complexes in solution and on membrane surfaces. We directly measured the formation of PLCβ2 ·PLCδ1 complexes by using fluorescence methods to quantify the association energy between proteins. Protein-protein association was monitored by the change in the fluorescence emission of the probe acrylodan covalently linked to PLCβ2 (see “Materials and Methods”). This probe undergoes an increase in emission intensity and energy upon the association of Gβγ subunits with PLCβ2 and yields a dissociation constant identical to that obtained by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (27Guo Y. Philip F. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29995-30004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A, we show the normalized increase in acrylodan-PLCβ2 fluorescence when PLCδ1 is added in solution. This increase was not observed when buffer or unlabeled PLCβ2 was substituted for PLCδ1. These data can be fit to a bimolecular association constant that gives an apparent affinity of Kapp ∼200 nm. Both enzymes are capable of membrane binding, and it is expected that membrane binding would increase their affinity because of a reduction in dimensionality. PLCδ1 was added to acrylodan-PLCβ2 under conditions where both enzymes were completely membrane-bound (49Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a stronger apparent affinity of Kapp = 9.2 ± 4 nm was observed due to the concentrating effect of being bound to a membrane surface (see “Discussion”). The affinity of PLCδ1 for PLCβ2 on membranes was unchanged when the free Ca2+ concentration was raised from 0 to 12 μm using Ca2+/EGTA buffers. Similar studies monitoring the self-association of the two isolated proteins under membrane-bound conditions, which would promote associations, showed that PLCβ2, which appears monomeric by chromatography under our purification conditions (31Runnels L.W. Regulation of Phospholipase C-β Isozymes by Heterotrimeric GTP-binding Proteins. Ph.D. thesis, State University of New York, Stony Brook1997Google Scholar), does not self-associate at concentrations up to 300 nm. Similarly, PLCδ1 does not self-associate at concentrations up to 320 nm (equivalent to the highest concentration achieved in the PLC binding measurements). Thus, the association between membrane-bound PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 is not explained by a tendency of the PLCs to form homomeric complexes. PLCβ2 Inhibits the Activity of PLCδ1—We tested whether the association between PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 affected their enzymatic activities. These studies utilized the substrate [3H]PI(4)P rather than PI(4,5)P2. The rationale for using [3H]PI(4)P is that the reduced Km value of PLCδ1 toward this substrate as compared with PI(4,5)P2 allowed us to carry out activity assays at enzyme concentrations above the apparent dissociation constant of PLCβ2-PLCδ1. We found that the catalytic activity of a mixture of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 was much less than the additive values obtained from the isolated enzymes (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the PLCβ2-PLCδ1 association inhibits one or both of the enzymes. We thus began a series of studies to determine whether one of the enzymes is inhibited by the other. PLCδ1 binds to membranes primarily through a high affinity site for PI(4,5)P2/Ins(1,4,5)P3 in its N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in addition to the low affinity catalytic binding site for substrate/product (32Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This high affinity site keeps PLCδ1 membrane-bound as long as substrate is present in the membrane and the amount of product in the aqueous phase is low. In contrast, the corresponding pleckstrin homology of PLCβ2 binds to membranes with little specificity (33Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Addition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to PLCδ1 should greatly reduce its activity because it will inhibit the binding of the PH domain to substrate-containing membranes. Additionally, the presence of product will compete for substrate in the catalytic site, although very high levels of product are needed for inhibition by this latter process. Conversely, product inhibition of PLCβ2 will only occur at high levels of product. We measured the ability of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to inhibit the PLCβ2/PLCδ1 mixture, and we found that the activity of the mixtures was not significantly changed. This result suggests that the activity of PLCδ1 may be inhibited when bound to PLCβ2. To better isolate which enzyme is inhibited in the PLCβ2 ·PLCδ1 complex, we chemically treated PLCδ1 with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). This agent forms a covalent adduct with one or both of the catalytic His residues, thereby inactivating the histidine-dependent enzyme (34Vik S.B. Hatefi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 1981; 78: 6749-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Treatment of PLCδ1 resulted in complete loss of PLCδ1 activity but did not affect its ability to bind substrate membrane, and the apparent affinity with PLCβ2 on membrane surfaces fell within the error of its unmodified enzyme (Kapp ∼10 nm on 200 μm lipid). Most importantly, addition of DEPC-treated PLCδ1 to wild type PLCβ2 up to 20 nm did not change its rate of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis (Fig. 2B). We further tested whether PLCβ2 inhibits PLCδ1 activity by using a point mutant of PLCβ2, H327N. This residue is necessary to stabilize the transition state charge of the phosphate group, and mutation of the corresponding residue on PLCδ profoundly reduces activity (35Cheng H.F. Jiang M.J. Chen C.L. Liu S.M. Wong L.P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Ellis M.V. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We find that the enzymatic activity is reduced 50–100-fold, and as expected, its binding to membranes and Gβγ subunits is within error to the wild type enzyme (Kapp ∼180 mm in solution). At activating Ca2+ levels, PLCδ1 activity decreased ∼4-fold with increasing amounts of H327N-PLCβ2, with an EC50 similar to the Kd for PLCδ1 association (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that PLCβ2 suppresses the catalytic activity of PLCδ1 at activating levels of Ca2+. Gβγ Subunits Disrupt PLCβ2-PLCδ1 Association in Vitro— PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 both bind to Gβγ subunits, although binding to the former enzyme is of higher affinity and results in enzyme activation (33Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We tested whether Gβγ subunits could interfere with PLCβ2-PLCδ1 association by measuring complex formation on membranes in the absence or presence of Gβγ subunits by fluorescence resonance energy transfer using the coumarin-DABCSYL donor-acceptor pair. Addition of DABC-SYL-PLCβ2 to coumarin-PLCδ1 resulted in a decrease in donor fluorescence as the two proteins associate (Fig. 1C), but this decrease was largely prevented by the addition of 10 nm Gβγ. Association of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 in Living Cells—To determine whether the two PLC subtypes associate in living cells, we initially used indirect immunofluorescence to view endogenous PLC in fixed rat aorta smooth muscle cells (A10) because these cells express both PLCs (see Ref. 37Di Salvo J.

https://openalex.org/W2088708590,"BLM has been implicated in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, but its precise role remains obscure. To explore this, we generated BLM–/– and BLM–/–LIG4–/– cells from the human pre-B cell line Nalm-6. BLM–/– cells exhibited retarded growth, increased mutation rates, and hypersensitivity to agents that block replication fork progression. Interestingly, these phenotypes were significantly suppressed by deletion of LIG4, suggesting that nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is unfavorable for integrity and survival of cells lacking BLM. We propose that the absence of BLM leads to accumulation of replication-associated, one-ended DSBs, which are deleterious to cells and lead to genomic instability when repaired by NHEJ. In addition, the NHEJ pathway per se was marginally affected by BLM deficiency, as evidenced by x-ray sensitivity and I-SceI-based DSB repair assays. More intriguingly, however, these experiments revealed the presence of an alternative, DNA ligase IV-independent end-joining pathway, which was significantly affected by the loss of BLM. Collectively, our results provide the first evidence for genetic interactions between BLM and NHEJ in human cells.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; BS, Bloom syndrome; HR, homologous recombination; HU, hydroxyurea; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; NHEJ, nonhomologous end-joining; aEJ, alternative end-joining; SCE, sister chromatid exchange; 6TG, 6-thioguanine; SSB, single-strand break; SSA, single-strand annealing; Topo II, DNA topoisomerase II; VP-16, demethylepipodophyllotoxin ethylidene-β-d-glucoside (etoposide); HPRT, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; kb, kilobase(s). are caused by various endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. Efficient and faithful repair of DSBs is crucial for maintenance of genome integrity. If left unrepaired, such lesions may lead to cell death (1Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). There are two distinct major pathways to repair DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR is thought to be active in S to G2 phases of the cell cycle (2Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that HR plays a predominant role in the repair of replication-associated DSBs, caused by collision of a replication fork with single-strand breaks (SSBs) or gaps (3Arnaudeau C. Lundin C. Helleday T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NHEJ is thought to be active throughout the cell cycle, especially G1 phase (2Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). We have shown that DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor-induced DSBs are predominately repaired by NHEJ in vertebrate cells (4Adachi N. Suzuki H. Iiizumi S. Koyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35897-35902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Adachi N. Iiizumi S. So S. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutant cell lines deficient in HR or NHEJ have been shown to be hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, indicating that both pathways are important for the repair of radiation-induced DSBs (2Takata M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9742-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Together, it seems likely that the nature of DSBs directs which pathway is preferred to repair the damage. HR, which relies on a number of proteins such as RAD51, RAD51 paralogs, and RAD54 (1Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), undergoes a precise repair of DSBs by utilizing a homologous sequence as template. In contrast, NHEJ repairs DSBs by simply joining the broken ends, irrespective of sequence homology, with frequent nucleotide loss. Extensive biochemical studies have proposed a model for the mechanism of NHEJ (10Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 11Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The NHEJ reaction is initiated by binding of Ku protein (the heterodimer of Ku70 and Ku86) to broken ends. Then the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit-Artemis complex is recruited and the ends are processed to make them ligatable. Finally, the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)-XRCC4 complex is recruited for ligation. Targeted disruption of the LIG4 gene in the human pre-B cell line Nalm-6 has revealed that LIG4 is indispensable for V(D)J recombination that exclusively depends on the NHEJ pathway (6Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Knockout mouse models demonstrate that NHEJ plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity and suppressing carcinogenesis (12Gao Y. Ferguson D.O. Xie W. Manis J.P. Sekiguchi J. Frank K.M.

A. 1997; 94: 8076-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, NHEJ-deficient cells show increased chromosome aberrations such as breakage and translocations (14Karanjawala Z.E. Grawunder U. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Difilippantonio M.J. Zhu J. Chen H.T. Meffre E. Nussenzweig M.C. Max E.E. Ried T. Nussenzweig A.

Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by proportional dwarfism, immunodeficiency, sun sensitivity, male infertility, and a high incidence of a wide spectrum of cancer (16German J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Cells from BS patients (BS cells) show various types of chromosomal instability, including chromosomal breaks, gaps, deletions, and elevated levels of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs). This instability may be responsible for cancer proneness in BS. The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes DNA helicase belonging to the highly conserved RecQ family (17Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6868-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), have been implicated in genetic recombination. There are five RecQ-type helicases in human cells. Mutations in the BLM, WRN, and RTS genes cause genetic disorders, BS (17Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), Werner syndrome (22Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T.

Smithson W.A. Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), respectively. Biochemical studies have revealed that BLM helicase has a 3′-5′ DNA-unwinding activity in an ATP-dependent manner (24Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and that it interacts with a wide variety of proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (for review, see Ref. 25Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Of note, a physical interaction between BLM and RAD51 suggests a role for BLM in HR. Indeed, BLM is proposed to function in the HR pathway to promote proper intermediate resolution and suppress crossover (26Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Inactivation of BLM can lead to enhanced HR activity, as manifested by increased gene targeting efficiencies (27Luo G. Santoro I.M. McDaniel L.D. Nishijima I. Mills M. Youssoufian H. Vogel H. Schultz R.A. Bradley A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 28Traverso G. Bettegowda C.

Enomoto T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Aberrant HR in the absence of BLM could account for the genomic instability observed in BS cells. In fact, loss of heterozygosity is prominent in BS cells (27Luo G. Santoro I.M. McDaniel L.D. Nishijima I. Mills M. Youssoufian H. Vogel H. Schultz R.A. Bradley A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 28Traverso G. Bettegowda C. Kraus J. Speicher M.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8578-8581PubMed Google Scholar). It remains possible, however, that another DSB repair pathway, NHEJ, may contribute more directly to this genomic instability given that NHEJ, unlike HR, is typically an error-prone repair pathway. The fact that BS cells exhibit normal V(D)J recombination which exclusively depends on NHEJ (30Hsieh C.L. Arlett C.F. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20105-20109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) argues against a possible role of BLM in NHEJ. Consistent with this, BLM-null chicken cells show no increased sensitivity to the Topo II inhibitor VP-16 (29Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Sonoda E. Takeda S. Yamada K. Masuko T. Katada T. Enomoto T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, however, genetic interactions between BLM and NHEJ have been reported in Drosophila (31Kusano K. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Engels W.R. Science. 2001; 291: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Min B. Weinert B.T. Rio D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8906-8911Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This may suggest an as-yet undefined functional interplay between BLM and the NHEJ pathway in mammalian cells. Several groups have investigated NHEJ activity in BS cells. Using a plasmid-based in vivo joining assay, Rünger and Kraemer (33Rünger T.M. Kraemer K.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported earlier a reduced and error-prone end-joining in BS cells. However, recent in vitro end-joining assays with cell extracts have revealed confusing results; namely, whereas the efficiency and fidelity of DSB repair in BS and control cells are comparable when ligatable ends are present (34Langland G. Elliott J. Li Y. Creaney J. Dixon K. Groden J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2766-2770PubMed Google Scholar), BS cells display a highly increased and error-prone end-joining accompanied by frequent large deletions (35Gaymes T.J. North P.S. Brady N. Hickson I.D. Mufti G.J. Rassool F.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, Onclercq-Delic et al. (36Onclercq-Delic R. Calsou P. Delteil C. Salles B. Papadopoulo D. Amor-Gueret M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6272-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) described an accurate joining of linear plasmid introduced into BS cells. Taken together, the results and conclusions concerning the interaction between BLM and NHEJ are contradictory and unsettled. Thus, a role of BLM in the NHEJ pathway still remains elusive in mammalian cells. In this study, we generated BLM–/– and BLM–/–LIG4–/– cells by gene targeting using the human Nalm-6 cell line and its derivative null for the LIG4 gene, respectively. BLM–/– cells exhibited phenotypes characteristic of BS cells reported before (16German J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, we found that some of the phenotypes such as retarded growth, increased mutation rates, and hypersensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), UV, and hydroxyurea (HU) are significantly suppressed by LIG4 deficiency. These results suggest an unfavorable impact of NHEJ on growth and viability of BLM-deficient cells. Using an I-SceI-based DSB repair assay system designed in this study, we found that BLM–/– cells have an NHEJ activity similar to that of wild type. In sharp contrast, LIG4–/– cells displayed aberrant end-joining events such as frequent nucleotide loss and rearrangements, which were much more pronounced in a BLM–/– background. These results suggest the existence of an alternative end-joining pathway that is independent of LIG4 and highly error prone. Based on these results, we propose that BLM deficiency leads to accumulation of replication-associated, one-ended DSBs, which are deleterious to cells when repaired by NHEJ. Our results suggest the interdependence of the end-joining pathway and the function of BLM helicase. Vector Construction—A partial BLM cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR with primers 5′-TGATGCCAGTCTTCTTGGCTCA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGATGGGATAGGCAGC-3′. Using the cDNA as probe, a genomic fragment containing BLM exons 6–12 was obtained by screening a human genomic library (Stratagene). Two BLM-targeting constructs, pBLM-hyg and pBLM-his, were made by replacing a 1.8-kb region containing exons 11 and 12 with a hygromycin resistance or histidinol resistance gene flanked by loxP sequences, respectively. The diphtheria toxin A expression cassette, excised from pMC1DT-ApA (KURABO, Osaka), was added to the 5′-terminal BLM region. To generate an hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) targeting construct, an 8.9-kb human HPRT sequence containing exons 2 and 3 was excised from the BAC clone bWXD187 (Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Microbiology, Genome Sequencing Center, St Louis, MO). With this sequence, the targeting construct pHPRT-Sce was made by inserting the hygromycin resistance gene, which has an I-SceI site upstream of its promoter, into the XhoI site in exon 3. The diphtheria toxin A expression cassette was also added to the 5′ terminus of the HPRT sequence. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—The human pre-B cell line Nalm-6 and its LIG4–/– derivative were maintained in ES medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo) supplemented with 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% calf serum (Hyclone) (growth medium) at 37 °C. For colony formation, cells were grown for 2–3 weeks in ES medium supplemented with 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% calf serum, and 0.15% agarose (agarose medium). DNA transfection for gene targeting was performed as described previously (7Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were electroporated with 4 μg of linearized DNA constructs, cultured for 22 h, and replated at a density of 5–10 × 105 per 90-mm bacterial dish into agarose medium containing either 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin B (Wako, Osaka) or 1.2 mg/ml l-histidinol (Sigma-Aldrich). After a 2–3-week incubation, the resulting drug-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded to store frozen and to prepare genomic DNA for Southern blot analysis. Western Blot and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (37Kobayashi M. Adachi N. Aratani Y. Kikuchi A. Koyama H. Cancer Lett. 2001; 166: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 376 amino acids of human BLM protein (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed with logarithmically growing cells. Cells were harvested, resuspended with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Wako) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, treated with RNase, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed in a Coulter EPICS XL cytometer (Coulter). The significance of the differences was analyzed by t test. Clonogenic Assay—To determine sensitivity to genotoxic agents, 1 × 102–2 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm bacterial dishes containing 5 ml of agarose medium with various concentrations of the drugs. All the drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. To determine sensitivity to x-rays, 1× 102–2 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes containing 5 ml of agarose medium and exposed to various doses of x-rays as described (7Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine UV sensitivity, cells were exposed to different UV doses, inoculated in agarose medium, and cultured as above. After a 2–3-week incubation, resultant colonies were counted, and surviving fractions were calculated. The significance of differences at the highest dose point was analyzed by t test. SCE Assay—Cells were plated at a density of 105/ml and cultured for approximately two cell cycle periods in growth medium containing 2 μg/ml 5′-bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma). During the final 1–2 h, colcemid (0.05 μg/ml, Wako) was added to collect metaphase cells. The cells were harvested, washed once with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 75 mm KCl, and fixed with methanol-acetic acid (3:1). The samples were then air-dried, stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 15 min, rinsed with 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0)), exposed to UV light for 10 min at 65 °C, and stained with 2% Giemsa for 5 min. Fluctuation Test for 6-Thioguanine (6TG) Resistance—The spontaneous mutation rate was determined by the fluctuation test of Luria and Delbrück (38Luria S. Delbrück M. Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well plates, each containing 20–40 cells/well in 2 ml of growth medium, were incubated for 12–24 days until the cell number reached ∼1–2 × 106 cells/well. Then, aliquots (1 ml) of individual cultures were replated into 90-mm dishes containing 10 ml of agarose medium with 20 μm 6TG (Sigma). After a 2–3 week incubation, resultant colonies were counted. The spontaneous mutation rate was calculated by the mean method formulated by Capizzi and Jameson (39Capizzi R.L. Jameson J.W. Mutat. Res. 1973; 17: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). I-SceI-based DSB Repair Assay—pHPRT-Sce was linearized with NotI and transfected into wild-type and mutant cell lines as described above; the cells were selected doubly with 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin B and 10 μm 6TG. Targeted integration was screened by Southern blotting. The resulting targeted lines WTS, LIG4–/–S, BLM–/–S, and LIG4–/–BLM–/–S were used to assess chromosomal DSB repair. Each cell line was electroporated with 4 μg of the I-SceI expression vector pSceI (40Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plated into agarose medium, and cultured for 2–3 weeks to allow colony formation. The resulting single clones were isolated, expanded to mass cultures, and used to prepare genomic DNA. Genomic PCR analysis was carried out using primers Sce-F (5′-TGAGGGCAAAGGATGTGTTACG-3′) and Sce-R (5′-GTGAGTTCAGGCTTTTTCATGG-3′), located in intron 2 (immediately upstream of exon 3) of the HPRT gene and in the hygromycin resistance gene, respectively. Then, 1-μl aliquots of PCR products were digested with 1 unit of I-SceI (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2 h and electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels. PCR products resistant to digestion with I-SceI were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced with a Multi-capillary DNA Sequencer CEQ2000 (Beckman Coulter). Targeted Disruption of the BLM Locus—To disrupt two alleles of the BLM gene in Nalm-6 cells, we generated two targeting constructs, pBLM-hyg and pBLM-his, containing a hygromycin resistance gene or histidinol resistance gene, respectively, flanked by the 6.7- and 2.9-kb genomic BLM sequences (Fig. 1A). The constructs also contained a diphtheriatoxin A gene to exclude random integrants. Targeted disruption with the constructs resulted in loss of exons 11 and 12 and led to inactivation of the BLM gene. pBLM-hyg was first transfected into wild-type Nalm-6 cells; the resulting 168 hygromycin-resistant clones were isolated and examined by Southern blot analysis. We obtained 14 heterozygous (BLM+/hyg) clones. pBLM-his was then transfected into one of the clones, and 274 histidinol-resistant clones were isolated and analyzed. We obtained five doubly targeted (BLMhis/hyg) clones. Subsequently, both of the hygromycin and histidinol resistance genes in BLMhis/hyg cells were removed by transient expression of Cre recombinase, finally yielding BLM–/– cells. Removal of the marker genes was verified by Southern blotting (Fig. 1B). The disruption of the BLM gene was also confirmed by Western (Fig. 1C) and Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Likewise, to generate cells null for both LIG4 and BLM, targeted disruption of the BLM gene was done using LIG4–/– cells derived from the Nalm-6 cell line (6Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The above two BLM targeting constructs and the Cre expression vector were sequentially transfected into LIG4–/– cells. The disruption of the BLM gene and removal of the selective marker genes were also confirmed by Southern blotting (data not shown). Severe Growth Defect in BLM–/–Cells Is Suppressed by LIG4 Deficiency—To compare the growth properties of wild-type and mutant cell lines, we first monitored growth curves (Fig. 2A). The doubling times of wild-type, LIG4–/–, BLM–/–, and LIG4–/–BLM–/– cells were 22, 22, 41, and 35 h, respectively. It is obvious that BLM–/– cells have a remarkably slower growth rate than wild-type and LIG4–/– cells (p < 0.001). Intriguingly, LIG4–/–BLM–/– double-mutant cells were partially but significantly rescued from the growth defect seen in BLM–/– single mutant (p < 0.01). To confirm this rescue, we corrected one of the defective LIG4 alleles by gene targeting with a plasmid vector containing a 4.0-kb LIG4 genomic fragment and generated LIG4+/–BLM–/– clones. We found that the two clones assayed grew at a slightly slower rate than the parental LIG4–/–BLM–/– cells (date not shown). This finding supports the suppression of the retarded growth of BLM–/– cells by LIG4 deficiency. We also analyzed cell cycle phase distributions of logarithmically growing cells by flow cytometry. Fig. 2B shows that the distributions at G1, S, and G2/M phases were not significantly different among the cell lines. The sub-G1 fractions (representing apoptotic cells) in wild-type and LIG4–/– cells were essentially the same (1.1–1.3%), whereas BLM–/– showed a 4.4-fold higher percentage than wild-type cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, LIG4–/–BLM–/– cells exhibited a slightly lowered value compared with BLM–/– cells. Increased Mutation Rates, but Not SCE Levels, in BLM–/–cells Are Suppressed by LIG4 Deficiency—Similar to BS cells (16German J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), BLM-deficient cells (27Luo G. Santoro I.M. McDaniel L.D. Nishijima I. Mills M. Youssoufian H. Vogel H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have been shown to manifest increased levels of SCE. We examined the SCE level in wild-type and mutant cell lines. Table I shows that wild-type and LIG4–/– cells had 5.4 and 4.8 SCEs/cell, respectively. As expected, BLM–/– cells showed a 8.4-fold greater number of SCE than wild-type cells. LIG4–/–BLM–/– cells showed a similar level to BLM–/– cells. These results indicate that BLM–/– cells have elevated SCE levels and that LIG4 deficiency affects neither a normal SCE level in wild-type cells nor elevated SCE levels in BLM–/– cells.Table ISCE levels in Nalm-6 and mutant cell linesCell lineMetaphases analyzedAverage no. of SCEs per metaphaseWild-type235.4LIG4-/-344.8BLM-/-3143LIG4-/-BLM-/-3746 Open table in a new tab It has been reported that BS cells show elevated mutation rates compared with cells derived from normal individuals (41Tachibana A. Tatsumi K. Masui T. Kato T. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 17: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We determined spontaneous mutation rates at the HPRT locus in wild-type and mutant cell lines. Table II shows that the mutation rate in wild-type cells was 5.4 × 10–7/cell/generation, whereas LIG4–/– cells showed a 5.7-fold increased rate. As expected, BLM–/– cells showed a 6.9-fold higher rate than wild-type, indicating a mutator phenotype associated with BLM deficiency. Interestingly, the mutation rate in LIG4–/–BLM–/– cells appeared slightly reduced relative to that in BLM–/– cells, implying that LIG4 deficiency may improve genomic stability by suppressing the mutator phenotype associated with BLM deficiency.Table IISpontaneous mutation rates at the HPRT locus in Nalm-6 and mutant cell linesExp.Spontaneous mutation rateWild-typeLIG4-/-BLM-/-LIG4-/-BLM-/-×10-7/cell/generation16.422271924.4394724Mean5.4 (1)31 (5.7)37 (6.9)22 (4.0) Open table in a new tab Hypersensitivity to MMS, UV, and HU of BLM–/–Cells Is Suppressed by LIG4 Deficiency—BS cells and BLM–/– DT40 cells are known to be hypersensitive to genotoxic agents such as MMS (29Wang W.

Cancer. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), respectively. During the repair, SSBs (nick or gap) may arise as repair intermediates in one strand, whereas a single-strand region also arises in the opposite strand. HU, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, depletes NTP pools and stops replication fork progression, giving rise to a single-strand region ahead of a replication fork. We examined sensitivity of wild-type and mutant cell lines to these agents by clonogenic survival assays. BLM"
https://openalex.org/W2154056555,"Ras guanine-releasing factor 1 (RasGrf1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for members of the Ras and Rho family of GTPases, is highly expressed in the brain. It is regulated by two separate mechanisms, calcium regulation through interaction with its calcium/calmodulin-binding IQ domain and serine and tyrosine phosphorylation. RasGrf1 is activated downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, Src and Ack1. Previously, we demonstrated a novel interaction between the intracellular domain of the nerve growth factor-regulated TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase and an N-terminal fragment of RasGrf1. We now show that RasGrf1 is phosphorylated and interacts with TrkA, -B, and -C in co-transfection studies. This interaction and phosphorylation of RasGrf1 is dependent on the HIKE domain of TrkA (a region shown to interact with pleckstrin homology domains) but not on any of the phosphotyrosine residues that act as docking sites for intracellular signaling molecules such as Shc and FRS-2. The PH1 domain alone of RasGrf1 is sufficient for phosphorylation by the TrkA receptor. A potential role for Trk activation of RasGrf1 is suggested through transfection studies in PC12 cells in which RasGrf1 significantly increases neurite outgrowth at low doses of neurotrophin stimulation. Notably, this neurite outgrowth is dependent on an intact HIKE domain, as nnr5-S10 cells expressing a TrkA HIKE domain mutant do not exhibit potentiated neurite outgrowth in the presence of RasGrf1. These studies identify RasGrf1 as a novel target of neurotrophin activation and suggest an additional pathway whereby neurotrophin-stimulated neurite outgrowth may be regulated.

The neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, Dbl homology; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LTP, long term potentiation; RasGrf1, Ras guanine-releasing factor 1; Trk, tropomycin-related kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CC, coiled-coil motif; FRS, fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, Dbl homology; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LTP, long term potentiation; RasGrf1, Ras guanine-releasing factor 1; Trk, tropomycin-related kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CC, coiled-coil motif; FRS, fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5, are a family of growth factors that mediate diverse cellular responses such as mitogenesis, apoptosis, and neuritogenesis in the developing nervous system (1Meakin S.O. Recent Research Developments in Neurochemistry. 2000; 3: 75-91Google Scholar). Additionally, in the brain, the neurotrophins have been shown to be involved in the regulation of axonal growth (2McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 767-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), memory and long term potentiation (3Kang H. Welcher A.A. Shelton D. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), calcium signaling (4Ghosh A. Carnahan J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1994; 263: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), and synaptogenesis (5Martínez A. Alcántara S. Borrell V. Rio J.A.D. Blasi J. Otai R. Campos N. Boronat A. Barbacid M. Silos-Santiago I. Soriano E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7336-7350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptors for the neurotrophins are the low affinity p75NTR receptor, which binds all four neurotrophins, and the high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors TrkA, -B, and -C (6Meakin S.O. Shooter E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). TrkA binds specifically to NGF, and TrkB binds to BDNF and neurotrophin-4/5, whereas neurotrophin-3 binds primarily to TrkC. Upon NGF binding, TrkA dimerizes, and three residues in the activation loop, Tyr679, Tyr683, and Tyr684, become phosphorylated resulting in stabilization of the receptor in its active state. Subsequently, Tyr499 and Tyr794 are phosphorylated and serve as docking sites to recruit phosphotyrosine-binding and Src homology-2 domain-containing molecules such as the Shc and FRS adapters and phospholipase C γ-1, which, in turn, mediate several Trk-dependent signaling cascades. Shc binding to TrkA recruits Sos to the plasma membrane through Grb2, leading to the activation of Ras and Raf-1 resulting in the transient activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and a mitogenic response. An alternate pathway mediated through FRS-2 involves the adapter protein Crk and the guanine exchange factor C3G, which stimulates Rap1 and the B-Raf isoform, leading to prolonged activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and differentiation (7Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4210) Google Scholar, 8York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McClecksy E.W. Stork P.J.

Because the currently known signaling molecules do not explain all the diverse biological functions mediated by the neurotrophins, it is of considerable importance to identify new members of the Trk signaling pathway that may mediate or contribute to these processes. This will facilitate a better understanding of the role of the Trk receptors in neuronal development. Recently, the N-terminal region (residues Leu29–Asp528, Fig. 1A) of the brain-specific Ras guanine-releasing factor 1 (RasGrf1) was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner of the intracellular domain of TrkA (10MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The identification of RasGrf1 as a potential intracellular target of the Trk receptors, which are themselves involved in memory and long term potentiation (3Kang H. Welcher A.A. Shelton D. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), is intriguing as mice lacking RasGrf1 expression also have deficits in long term memory development (11Giese K.P. Friedman E. Telliez J.B. Fedorov N.B. Wines M. Feig L.A. Silva A.J. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Finkbeiner S. Dalva M.B. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). RasGrf1 is part of a larger family of proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which includes Sos and C3G. GEFs act as molecular switches to activate GTPases such as Ras and Rac by facilitating the release of GDP (13Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The structural domains of RasGrf1 include two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a coiled-coil motif (CC), an IQ motif, a Dbl homology domain (DH), a Ras exchange motif/PEST motif and a C-terminal CDC25 homology domain that is required for guanine exchange toward Ras (Fig. 1A). Pleckstrin homology domains interact with phosphoinositides in the lipid membrane (14Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (375) Google Scholar), can act as phosphotyrosine-binding domains (15Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M.

Cell. Signal. 2002; 1: 11-20Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and have been shown to interact with other proteins, such as the Gβγ subunit (17Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mutation studies, using a mutant of RasGrf1 in which the N-terminal PH domain has been deleted, have indicated that this domain is necessary for the localization of RasGrf1 to the plasma membrane (18Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). IQ domains bind the calcium-regulated protein calmodulin (19Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), whereas the RasGrf1 DH domain binds to Rac, a member of the Rho family of GTPases facilitating its activation (20Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown RasGrf1 interaction downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors (21Shou C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mattingly M. Macara I. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and Rho family members (23Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S.P. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Studies have also indicated that receptor tyrosine kinases are not involved in RasGrf1 activation (21Shou C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A.

There does, however, appear to be a role for non-receptor tyrosine kinases in RasGrf1 activation, namely Src (20Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Ack1 (24Kiyono M. Kato J. Kataoka T. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29788-29793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Specifically, c-Src phosphorylates multiple sites on RasGrf1, although these sites have not yet been identified (20Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although RasGrf1 tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Src is associated with increased Rac activity, Ack1-dependent phosphorylation increases the activity of Ras and Erk2 (24Kiyono M. Kato J. Kataoka T. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29788-29793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the following study we have examined the ability of the Trk receptors to tyrosine phosphorylate and to interact with RasGrf1 in transfected cells and have sought to determine which site(s) or domains are required for this interaction and phosphorylation. A potential role for Trk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of RasGrf1 in facilitating neurotrophin-dependent neurite outgrowth is suggested through transfection studies in PC12 cells.

PC12 or nnr5-S10 cells were transfected with EGFP alone or RasGrf1/EGFP and either unstimulated (-ve) or stimulated with NGF (2 μg/ml) for a 4-day period. On days 1 to 4, the number of EGFP-transfected cells from at least 10 separate fields (and over 200 cells) was counted for the total number of cells and number of cells with neurites greater than two cell bodies in length. The percentages were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance. S.E. was calculated and is represented by error bars. The results are the mean of three independent studies.

PC12 rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle media with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum (Hyclone). Nnr5-S10 cells are a PC12 cell line that no longer endogenously expresses wild-type TrkA but stably express the TrkA-S10 mutated receptor. This cell line was generated using techniques described previously (1Meakin S.O. Recent Research Developments in Neurochemistry. 2000; 3: 75-91Google Scholar, 32Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed following the standard DEAE-dextran (COS-7) (33Levesque J.P. Sansilvestri P. Hatzfeld A. Hatzfeld J. BioTechniques. 1991; 11 (316-318): 313-314PubMed Google Scholar), calcium phosphate (293T) (34Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), or Lipofectamine 2000 (PC12 cells, Invitrogen) transfection approaches. Lipofectamine transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with a ratio of DNA to Lipofectamine of 1:2. Basically, 1.5 × 106 cells (100-mm dish) were cotransfected with 0.5–5 μg of each indicated plasmid. Following 48 h of expression, lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin and assayed by immunoprecipitation. Lysates containing 0.5–3.5 mg of protein (concentrations determined using the DC protein assay kit from Bio-Rad) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Trk 203 (2 μg), anti-Trk 1478 (1 μg), anti-RasGrf1 (1 μg), anti-HA (3F10; 2 μg), or anti-Myc (9E10; 2 μg) antibodies or 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma) or glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for GST-fused proteins in addition to 5 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, bound proteins were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Pall Life Sciences), and visualized with anti-phosphotyrosine RC20 (1:2000) or p-Tyr-100 (1:10,000), anti-HA (3F10; 1:2500), or anti-Trk C-14 (1:10,000) antibodies as indicated. Blots were stripped and reprobed with rabbit anti-RasGrf1 (1:10,000), rabbit anti-Trk (1:10,000), anti-ShcB (1:10,000), mouse anti-Myc (9E10, 1:10,000), or mouse anti-HA (3F10, 1:4000) antibodies. Cell fractionation was performed as described previously (18Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Neurite Response Assay—PC12 cells or nnr5-S10 cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 60-mm dishes (Sigma) and transfected with pEGFP (0.5 μg) or both pEGFP (0.5 μg) and pEFP-RasGrf1 (1 μg) with transfection efficiencies of 70–90%. Fresh media and non-saturating levels of NGF (2 ng/ml) were added at 24-h intervals on each of 4 successive days. On each day (from day 1 at 24 h after transfection to day 4) the percentage of EGFP-transfected cells (at least 10 randomly selected fields and at least 200 cells) with neurites greater than two cell bodies in length were counted using an inverted fluorescent microscope. Three independent experiments were performed, and the percentage of EGFP-transfected cells extending neurites (between samples) was statistically determined by analysis of variance. TrkA and RasGrf1 expression and NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation were confirmed by immunoprecipitation of 500 μg–3.5 mg of protein and by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting following the counts performed on day 4. RasGrf1 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Trk Family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases—We previously isolated a 500-residue N-terminal fragment (Leu29–Asp528) of mouse RasGrf1 (Fig. 1A) as a direct binding target of the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, in a yeast two-hybrid assay and demonstrated that this fragment is tyrosine-phosphorylated by TrkA in COS cell co-transfection assays (10MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The relevance of this observation was not initially obvious because RasGrf1 is highly expressed in the brain, whereas TrkA is predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system. Although initial assays for interaction between the N-terminal fragment of RasGrf1 with TrkB and TrkC were weak (10MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the N-terminal fragment might not truly reflect interactions observed with the full-length protein. Thus, we reinvestigated the ability of full-length RasGrf1 (Fig. 1A) to interact with full-length TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC in two independent co-transfection assays. First, we co-expressed RasGrf1 as a fusion protein with GST (29Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) in COS cells along with HA-tagged wild-type TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. Prior to harvest, cells were stimulated with either NGF, BDNF, or neurotrophin-3 (100 ng/ml, 5 min), and lysates were assayed by Western blotting for the ability of glutathione-Sepharose to precipitate Trk. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-RasGrf1 (full-length) but not GST alone precipitated all three kinase-active Tr"

Here we show that it physically interacts with CcmE and CcmC, another essential component of the heme delivery system. We demonstrate the formation of a ternary complex consisting of CcmCDE. A deletion analysis of individual domains revealed that the central hydrophobic domain is essential for its function. Moreover, the C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain seems to require a net positive charge to be functional. Our topology analysis indicates that CcmD is an integral interfacial membrane protein with its N and C termini extruding into the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Interactions of CcmD with either ferrochelatase, the last heme biosynthetic enzyme, or directly with heme were not detectable. We postulate a function for CcmD in protein-protein interaction or membrane protein assembly required for the heme delivery process.

Cytochromes of the c type are a class of metal proteins that contain covalently bound heme as a prosthetic group to perform functions in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport. Three distinct systems for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes have evolved in nature, which are annotated as systems I, II, and III (reviewed in Ref. 1Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2Xie Z. Merchant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Kranz R. Lill R.

Sci. 2003; 358: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The hallmark of cytochrome c maturation in all three systems is the covalent attachment of heme via thioether bonds to cysteinyl residues of the conserved CXXCH signature motif of apo-cytochrome. The γ-proteobacterium Escherichia coli uses system I with eight membrane proteins encoded by the ccmABCDEFGH operon (7Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Künzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Grove J. Tanapongpipat S. Thomas G. Griffiths L. Crooke H. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A key intermediary step during this maturation pathway is the transfer and covalent attachment of heme to the cytochrome c maturation-specific heme chaperone CcmE (9Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); subsequently, heme is transferred from the holo-CcmE intermediate to apocytochrome c. It has been shown earlier that covalent binding of heme to an essential histidine (His130) of apo-CcmE requires the activity of the CcmC maturation factor. This activity as well as the levels of CcmE polypeptides in the membranes are significantly enhanced in the presence of the CcmD protein (10Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CcmD is essential for cytochrome c maturation, but a ccmD mutant phenotype can be bypassed by overexpression of the CcmCE proteins (10Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CcmD is a small polypeptide of 69 amino acid residues with a predicted N-terminal transmembrane helix and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain. The ccmD gene is present downstream of ccmC in most bacteria that use system I for cytochrome c maturation. Despite little sequence similarity between different CcmD homologues, the hydrophilic domains are rich in charged residues, predominantly arginines. The membrane topology of CcmD has been assumed to be like that of its Rhodobacter capsulatus homologue, HelD. In this case the C terminus was proposed to reside in the cytoplasm based on the activity of a LacZ fusion and on the inactivity of a corresponding PhoA fusion (11Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Bali A. Monika E.M. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, the absence of positive charges N-terminal to the predicted transmembrane helix is in agreement with an N terminus-out C terminus-in topology. Here, we investigated the function of CcmD in the CcmC-mediated transfer of heme to CcmE by testing its involvement in the formation and/or stability of a CcmCDE membrane protein complex, assessing its topology in the membrane, and defining functional domains and residues.

The expression plasmid pEC36, which codes for a N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged (His6-) CcmD was obtained by ligation of the NdeI- and BamHI-digested PCR-amplified ccmD fragment into the NdeI- and BamHI-treated 5.4-kb pET28a (Novagen). Plasmid pEC423 was then obtained by ligation of the 310-bp XbaI- and EcoRI-digested fragment from pEC36 into the 5.4-kb XbaI- and EcoRI-digested pEC411. Plasmid pEC474 coding for wild-type CcmD was constructed by re-ligation of NsiI-treated plasmid pEC99, thereby deleting ccmC. The plasmids pEC834 and pEC835 expressing N-terminal His6-tagged CcmD1–37 and CcmD1–53, respectively, were constructed by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis using pEC423 as a template and the primers listed in Table II. The plasmids pEC858 and pEC859 expressing His6-tagged CcmD1–53R44A and CcmD1–53R48A, respectively, were constructed by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis using pEC835 as a template. Plasmid pEC860 expressing the double mutant His6-CcmD1–53R44A/R48A was obtained by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis using pEC859 as a template. pEC842, expressing CcmD with a C-terminal strep-tag (-SAWSHPQFEK) was constructed by amplifying the ccmD gene from pEC86 with primers ccmDnNdeI and ccmDcstrepSalI-r. This fragment was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into the 5.4-kb NdeI- and SalI-digested pISC-2 (14Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Hennecke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). pEC856, expressing the N-terminal truncated CcmD14–69-strep was constructed by amplifying a 200-bp fragment by PCR with the primers ccmDnM14NdeI and ccmDcSalI-2, using pEC86 as a template. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into the 5.4-kb NdeI- and SalI-digested pISC-2. For the construction of a plasmid expressing wild-type CcmD-strep, the ccmD gene was amplified by PCR using a forward primer, pACYC184:1613–1629, containing a BfmI site and a reverse primer, ccmDcStrepSalI, with a SalI site and pEC474 as a template. The PCR-amplified fragment was digested with BfmI and SalI and ligated into the 3.7-kb BfmI- and SalI-digested pACYC184 (15Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was pEC857. For the expression of the C-terminal domain of CcmD, plasmid pEC843 was constructed by cloning the 102-bp PCR product obtained after amplification with primers solccmDNdeI and solccmDEcoRI and pEC86 as a template, digesting with NdeI and EcoRI and ligating it into the 5.4-kb NdeI- and EcoRI-digested fragment of pISC-2. Plasmid pEC848 expressing a C-terminal His6-tagged CcmH was constructed by amplifying the ccmH gene with primers ccmHNdeI and ccmHhis containing a XbaI site and using pEC86 as a template. The 1055-bp NdeI- and XbaI-digested fragment was then ligated into NdeI- and XbaI-digested 5.4-kb pISC-2. Plasmid pEC869 expressing N-terminal His6-tagged and C-terminal strep-tagged CcmD was constructed by ligating the 340-bp XbaI- and EcoRI-digested PCR product obtained with primers pING1araB and ccmDcstrepEcoRI-r and pEC423 as the template into the 5383-bp XbaI- and EcoRI-digested pEC423. Plasmid pEC841 expressing hemH that encodes the E. coli ferrochelatase with a C-terminal strep-tag (-SAWSHPQFEK) was constructed by amplifying the hemH gene including its natural ribosome binding site from chromosomal DNA obtained from E. coli strain MC1061 with primers uphemH-BamHI-f and hemHcstrepSalI-r. The 1041-bp fragment was digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into the 4-kb BamHI- and SalI-digested pACYC184.Table IIOligonucleotide primers used for plasmid construction and sequencingPrimerBasesNucleotide sequence (5′-3′)UsageccmDnNdeI26cggatccatatgacccctgcatttgcForward primer for cloning pEC36 and pEC842ccmDc21cgggatcctcatgcagcctccReverse primer for cloning pEC36ccmD37f29ggttttggtcgtgtgatcggtgatgcaacQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC832 and 834ccmD37r29gttgcatcaccgatcacacgaccaaaaccQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC832 and 834ccmD53f23ggcgcaacagtgagcgcgtgaggQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC833 and 835ccmD53r23cctcacgcgctcactgttgcgccQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC833 and 835ccmDCstrepSalI-r66tgcgtcgactcatttttcgaactgcgggtggctccaagcgcttgcagcctcctgctgttgcgcagcReverse primer for cloning pEC842 and pEC857solccmDNdeI35ggacgatccatatgcactcggtgatgcaacatcgcForward primer for cloning pEC843solccmDEcoRI25cgggaattctcatgcagcctcctgcReverse primer for cloning pEC843ccmHnNdeI29ggacgatccatatgaggtttttattgggcForward primer for cloning pEC848ccmHHis49gctctagagcta (gtg) 6tttactctcctgcggcgacReverse primer for cloning pEC848 and contains XbaI siteccmDnM14NdeI36cgggatcatatgggcggttacgccttttttgtctggForward primer for cloning pEC856ccmDcsalI-227tgcgtcgactcatttttcgaactgcggReverse primer for cloning pEC856pACYC184: 1613-162917cggcaccgtcacctggForward primer for cloning pEC857ccmDR44A-f22gatgcaacatgccgc aattctgQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC858 and pEC860ccmDR44A-r22cagaattgcggcatgttgcatcQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC858 and pEC860ccmDR48A-f23cgcaattctggctggcgtggcgcQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC859ccmDR48A-r23gcgccacgccagccagaattgcgQuikChange™ primer for cloning pEC859pING1araB18ggccgacgaaatcactcgPCR primer for cloning pEC869ccmDcstrepEcoRI-r66tgcgaattctcatttttcgaactgcgggtggctccaagcgcttgcagcctcctgctgttgcgcagcPCR primer for cloning pEC869ccmH442-46322gttgtttatctgccgggtattgSequencing primeruphemHBamHI-f29cgcggatccacttttccgctacaattatcForward primer for cloning pEC841hemHcstrepSalI-r66tgcgtcgactcatttttcgaactgcgggtggctcca agcgctgcgatacgcggcaacaagattagcReverse primer for cloning pEC841hemH461-47919cggggatatcgtttatacgSequencing primer Open table in a new tab DNA Sequencing—All plasmid constructs and mutants derived from PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). In plasmid pEC848, a spontaneous frameshift mutation was created by a T→C transition, extending the coding sequence for CcmH-His6 by two additional codons for Gln and Leu. Co-purification with Histidine-tagged Proteins—10 mg of membrane proteins obtained from anaerobically grown cells were solubilized in 10 ml of solubilization buffer containing 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (GLYCON Biochemicals, Luckenwalde, Germany) for 1 h at 4 °C. The insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The solubilized fraction (supernatant) was collected and directly loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The column was washed with washing buffers (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) with increasing concentrations of imidazole (5–30 mm). The proteins were eluted with equilibration buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunostained as described below. Co-purification with Strep-tagged Protein—10-mg membrane proteins obtained from anaerobically grown cells were solubilized as described above for 60 min at 4 °C and directly loaded onto a 1-ml StrepTactin-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The column was washed with equilibration buffer and the proteins were eluted with equilibration buffer containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. The eluted proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunostained as described below. Cell Fractionation—For the preparation of subcellular fractions bacterial cultures were grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate. Periplasmic proteins obtained from 1200-ml cultures were treated with polymyxin B sulfate as described previously (16Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the preparation of membrane proteins, 600 ml of anaerobically grown bacterial culture were harvested, and membrane proteins were extracted as described previously (16Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Biochemical Methods—Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Holo-cytochrome c550 and holo-CcmE formation was analyzed qualitatively by heme staining and immunoblot (17Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Soluble cytochrome c (c550) in the periplasmic fractions was quantified by absorption difference spectroscopy using a ϵ550–536 nm of 23.2 mm-1cm-1 (14Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Hennecke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of His6-tagged proteins was performed using monoclonal tetra-His antibodies (Qiagen) at a dilution of 1:2000. Immunoblot analysis of the strep-tagged CcmD versions was performed using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:4000. Antibodies directed against the CcmE peptide (9Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or CcmF peptides (18Ren Q. Ahuja U. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were used at a dilution of 1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively. Signals were detected using goat anti-mouse IgG (for His6-tag detection) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (for detection of other antigens) conjugated to either alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) or horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) as secondary antibody and CSPD (Roche Diagnostics) or ECL (Amersham Biosciences) reagents as substrate, respectively. Heme Binding Assays—150 μg of total membrane proteins were solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% lauroyl sarcosine). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with hemin-agarose (Sigma) or aminododecyl-agarose (Sigma) as described previously for CcmC (16Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Agarose beads were washed three times with solubilization buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound material, then treated with 2× SDS loading dye (containing 50 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were visualized by immunoblot analysis. Tricine 1The abbreviation used is: Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Gels—16% Tricine gels with a 10% spacer gel were used to separate smaller truncated versions of CcmD as initially described by Schägger and Jagow (19von Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10479) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—1–2-mg membrane proteins were solubilized and precipitated with 5 μl of undiluted anti-CcmE immunoglobulins, or 10 μl of anti-His6 tag antibodies according to the method described previously (16Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) except that solubilization was carried out in 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The proteins were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with avidine-alkaline phosphatase conjugate against the strep-tagged CcmD or the strep-tagged ferrochelatase. Pulse-Chase Experiment—The pulse-chase experiment was performed as described previously (14Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Hennecke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but with some modifications. Briefly, cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in M9 medium supplemented with glycerol and 18 amino acids, except methionine and cysteine. Cells in their mid-exponential growth phase were induced with 0.1% arabinose for 1 h prior to addition of 20 μCi/ml Tran35S-label™ (1175 Ci/mol, MP BIOMEDICALS). After 1 min, 1 ml of the culture was withdrawn and immediately trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and in parallel, the remaining culture was chased by adding unlabeled methionine and cysteine at 1 mg/ml each. For immunoprecipitation of the samples, 5 mg of pre-swelled protein-A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) per sample were incubated with 10 μl of anti-His6 tag antibody (0.2 mg/ml, Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C and then treated as described. Finally, the immunoprecipitated samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 2× SDS loading dye containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and then loaded on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Formation of Spheroplasts and Inside Out Vesicles and Proteinase K Treatment—Aerobically growing EC06 cells transformed with either plasmid pEC869 or pEC411 were induced with 0.1% arabinose at midlog growth phase for 3 h at 37 °C. The spheroplasting and proteinase K treatment was performed as described by de Gier et al. (20de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Saaf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. von Luirink J. Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For inside out vesicles cells were passed once through a French pressure cell (83 bars) and membrane vesicles were made as described previously (16Ren Q. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics) was added at a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml and incubated for 1 h on ice. Treatment of Membrane Vesicles with Various Chaotropic Agents—50 μg of membrane proteins obtained from bacterial cultures of strains EC06/pEC869 and EC06/pEC411 were treated with Na2CO3 (50 and 100 mm), pH 11.5, 500 mm LiClO4, and 1 m urea for 1 h on ice or by five freeze/thaw cycles, which involved quick freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C in a water bath. After the treatment, samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 150,000 × g. Supernatant and pellet was collected from each sample. Proteins in the supernatant were trichloroacetic acid precipitated prior to separation by 15% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-His6 tag antibodies. Functional Analysis of Truncated CcmD Derivatives—CcmD has three distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–10: MTPAFASWNE), a hydrophobic, putative transmembrane domain (amino acids 11–37: FFAMGGYAFFVWLAVVMTVIPLVVLVV), and a C-terminal highly charged domain (amino acids 38–69: HSVMQHRAILRGVAQQRAREARLRAAQQQEAA). To test whether each of these three domains is necessary for CcmD function, plasmids expressing derivatives lacking the N-terminal, C-terminal, and N-terminal plus membrane domains were constructed as depicted in Fig. 1. In addition, an N-terminal His6 tag and/or a C-terminal strep-tag were introduced to allow detection and/or purification of the proteins. In the ccmD in-frame deletion mutant EC76 (ΔM1-A69) the entire ccmD gene is deleted (10Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In our complementation experiments we overexpressed exogenous Bradyrhizobium japonicum cytochrome c550 to monitor cytochrome c maturation. The ΔccmD mutant strain was co-transformed with a plasmid expressing a His6-tagged B. japonicum cytochrome c550 plus a plasmid encoding either wild-type or mutant CcmD protein (Fig. 2A). Cytochrome c formation was assayed qualitatively by heme staining of periplasmic fractions (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Quantification of c-type cytochromes was done by absorption difference spectroscopy. The level of holo-cytochromes c produced by the ccmD mutant complemented with N-terminal His6-tagged CcmD was set to 100%. The N-terminal truncated mutant CcmD14–69 that in addition carried a C-terminal strep-tag (lane 2) was not inhibited in cytochrome c formation when compared with the wild type (lane 1), but even produced slightly higher levels of holo-cytochrome c. This showed that neither lack of the first 13 N-terminal residues nor a C-terminal strep-tag in CcmD negatively affected cytochrome c maturation. Thus, the hydrophobic and the C-terminal domain are sufficient for CcmD function. When the C-terminal domain was deleted completely, cytochrome c formation was below the level of detection (lane 4), indicating that the membrane domain alone is not functional. Likewise, when the C-terminal domain was expressed in the absence of the hydrophobic domain, i.e. as a soluble cytoplasmic protein (lane 8), no cytochrome c was formed. This suggested that the hydrophobic and C-terminal domains together provide the CcmD function. Deletion of the last 16 amino acids removed only half of the cytoplasmic domain and resulted in a ∼50% level of cytochrome c formation. One of the prominent features of the C-terminal region among all the CcmD homologues is the extraordinary abundance of basic residues, particularly arginines. E. coli CcmD protein has six arginines at positions 44, 48, 54, 56, 59, and 61 in its C-terminal region. The mutant CcmD1–53 retains two of six arginines and two histidines, whereas mutant CcmD1–37 lacks all of these basic residues. Our results show that the C-terminal region between the 37th and 53rd residue (HSVMQHRAILRGVAQQ) containing Arg44 and Arg48 is functionally important. In view of the abundance of positive charges in CcmD proteins, we constructed single point mutants R44A and R48A and a double mutant R44A/R48A of the His6-CcmD1–53 variant and tested them for cytochrome c maturation. The single mutants R44A (lane 5) and R48A (lane 6) produced similar levels of holo-cytochrome c as their parent CcmD derivative His6-CcmD1–53 (lane 3), whereas the double arginine mutant (lane 7) was drastically impaired in cytochrome c formation (20% residual cytochrome c level). We conclude that a C-terminal domain rich in positive charges is important for CcmD function.Fig. 2Functional analysis of ccmD mutants.A, cytochrome c formation. The ΔccmD strain EC76 was co-transformed with plasmid pEC701 (expressing B. japonicum cytochrome c550) and pEC423 (wild-type His6-CcmD; lane 1), pEC856 (CcmD14–69-strep; lane 2), pEC835 (His6-CcmD1–53; lane 3), pEC834 (His6-CcmD1–37lane 4), pEC858 (His6-CcmD1–53R44A; lane 5), pEC859 (His6-CcmD1–53R48A; lane 6), pEC860 (His6-CcmD1–53 R44AR48A; lane 7), pEC843 (CcmD38–69; lane 8), or pISC-3 (empty vector; lane 9).

Herein, using principles of irreversible thermodynamics it was shown that if the ATP-consuming pathways are more sensitive to extracellular glucose than glycolysis, then upon glucose addition glycolysis performance can switch from an efficient working regime to a dissipative regime, and vice versa, depending on glucose availability. The efficient regime represents a good compromise between high output power and low dissipation, whereas the dissipative working regime offers a higher output power although at a high glucose cost. The physiological and evolutionary implications of this switch strategy are discussed. The strong negative correlation between glycolytic flux and intracellular ATP concentration observed in yeast has long been an intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon, which has been referred to as the ATP paradox. Herein, using principles of irreversible thermodynamics it was shown that if the ATP-consuming pathways are more sensitive to extracellular glucose than glycolysis, then upon glucose addition glycolysis performance can switch from an efficient working regime to a dissipative regime, and vice versa, depending on glucose availability. The efficient regime represents a good compromise between high output power and low dissipation, whereas the dissipative working regime offers a higher output power although at a high glucose cost. The physiological and evolutionary implications of this switch strategy are discussed. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway providing cells with energy in the form of ATP, which can be used to drive cellular processes. Thus, glucose is a metabolic substrate acting as an extracellular source of free energy powering life. In yeast, a strong negative correlation between glycolytic flux and intracellular ATP concentration has been widely documented (1Theobald U. Mailinger W. Reuss M. Rizzi M. Ann. Biochem. 1993; 214: 31-37Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2Larsson C. Nilsson A. Blomberg A. Gustafsson L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7243-7250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Somsen O.J.G. Hoeben M.A. Esgalhado E. Snoep J.L. Visser D. van der Heijden R.T.J.M. Heijnen J.J. Westerhoff H.V. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because glucose catabolism is the main source of ATP-derived free energy, this observation (the higher the rate of glycolysis the lower the ATP content) is a counterintuitive phenomenon, which has been referred to as the ATP paradox. A sudden transition from glucose limitation to glucose excess leads to a new steady state at increased glycolytic flux with a sustained decrease in the ATP levels (3Somsen O.J.G. Hoeben M.A. Esgalhado E. Snoep J.L. Visser D. van der Heijden R.T.J.M. Heijnen J.J. Westerhoff H.V. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because ADP phosphorylation is tightly coupled to glucose breakdown, a higher glycolytic flux implies that more ATP is being formed. The subsequent increase in the flux throughout ATP-consuming reactions was thought to be brought about by an increased ATP/ADP ratio. Therefore, the decreased steady state level of ATP constitutes an intriguing observation. Somsen et al.(3Somsen O.J.G. Hoeben M.A. Esgalhado E. Snoep J.L. Visser D. van der Heijden R.T.J.M. Heijnen J.J. Westerhoff H.V. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in an elegant work employing metabolic control analysis and a simple model, concluded that the experimental ATP changes can only be explained if the sensitivities of ATP-consuming routes to extracellular glucose are higher than that of the glycolytic pathway. Although this particular sensitivity of anabolic pathways solves the problem of how a drop in ATP concentration triggered by high glucose levels is possible, one question still remains open. What are the physiological implications of this behavior we have termed as the ATP paradox? In other words, what is the purpose of the stronger sensitivity to the level of extracellular fuel exhibited by ATP-utilizing pathways with respect to that of ATP-producing pathways?Herein, using principles of irreversible thermodynamics it is shown that the glycolytic pathway can perform under two different thermodynamic regimes. One is optimal for obtaining a maximum output power from glucose degradation, although this high output power is at the expense of a high degree of dissipation. Thus, this regime is referred to as dissipative maximum output power (DMOP). 1The abbreviations used are: DMOP, dissipative maximum output power; EMOP, efficient maximum output power.1The abbreviations used are: DMOP, dissipative maximum output power; EMOP, efficient maximum output power. The other regime represents an excellent compromise between high output power and low dissipation, so it is named efficient maximum output power (EMOP). More interestingly, it will be shown that the ATP paradox can be the expression of a molecular mechanism linking, throughout the intracellular level of ATP, the signal (low or high fuel levels) with the appropriate thermodynamic regime (EMOP or DMOP, respectively).THEORYEvolutionary Trade-off between Efficiency and Rate—In the energetic metabolism, for fundamental reasons that will be introduced later, there is always a trade-off between efficiency and rate (4Pfeiffer T. Schuster S. Bonhoeffer S. Science. 2001; 292: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 5Aledo J.C. Esteban del Valle A. J. Chem. Educ. 2002; 79: 1336-1339Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, thermodynamic analyses have concluded that a dissipative use of substrates may help cells to grow fast (6Aledo J.C. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Westerhoff H.V. Hellingwerf K.J. van Dam K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 80: 305-309Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In fact, rapidly dividing cells have been described by some authors as dissipative devices (8Medina M.A. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2539-2542Crossref Google Scholar). Although the purpose of this apparent waste of fuel has been a matter of discussion for a long time (9Newsholme E.A. Board M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1991; 31: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it seems clear now that this dissipative use of fuels can be understood as the cost the organism must pay to grow rapidly (6Aledo J.C. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It seems understandable that under conditions of abundance, evolutionary pressure may have resulted in the selection of the fastest growing cells (dissipative genotype).On the other hand, for most of other cells living in environments where energetic limitation is an important factor introducing metabolic constraints, the evolutionary pressure might be different. A cell exhibiting an efficient metabolism at the expense of a low rate, can produce more offspring from a given amount of resources. Hence, a selection favoring those cells able to grow as fast as possible but at optimal efficiency (efficient genotype) would be expected during periods of famine. One could argue that in an ecosystem containing a heterogeneous population of cells in resource competition, the fastest growing cells always will outgrow the competitors that grow more efficiently. Although only those cells that consume the resource more rapidly benefit from the higher rate of ATP production, all competitors exploiting the resource share the consequences of the more rapid fuel exhaustion. However, Pfeiffer and Bonhoeffer (10Pfeiffer T. Bonhoeffer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1095-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have drawn an evolutionary scenario where the cooperative use of external energy resources may have evolved in spatially structured environments favoring efficient genotypes.We then expect that the properties of ATP-producing and -consuming pathways have been under strong selection pressure during evolution. Hitherto, most of the studies have focused their attention on those conditions favoring one or other genotype and on analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each one (4Pfeiffer T. Schuster S. Bonhoeffer S. Science. 2001; 292: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 7Westerhoff H.V. Hellingwerf K.J. van Dam K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nevertheless, an interesting and unexplored possibility is to consider an organism endowed with a genotype enabling the cell to commute between dissipative and efficient glycolytic phenotypes depending on the environmental conditions. This strategy would be especially suitable for cells that live, or have evolved, under highly variable conditions as is the case for most unicellular organisms of free life exposed to environments that have rapidly changing substrate availability. The remainder of this article will be devoted to investigate this possibility.A Linear Irreversible Thermodynamic Approach to Glycolysis—Because we are only concerned with a phenomenological description of the energetics of glycolysis, we do not need to make any assumption on the reaction network. In other words, herein, glycolysis must be understood as a free energy transducing process (see Fig. 1). Thus, the only thing we have to know is that the splitting of glucose is an exergonic process strictly coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP, which is an endergonic process. In the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics, the rate of ATP production (J1) is related to its conjugated force (X1). Similarly, the flow from glucose to ethanol or lactate (J2) is driven by the corresponding force (X2). The generalized forces X1 and X2 can also be referred to as chemical affinities (equal to minus the actual change in free energy) and can be interpreted as the distance from equilibrium of each process. As known from irreversible thermodynamics, close to equilibrium one can be confident that the flows Ji are linear functions of the forces Xi. To accommodate multiple fluxes and forces, the equation may be generalized asJi=∑j=1nLijXj(Eq. 1) although far from equilibrium we lose the mathematical guarantee of linearity (13Westerhoff H.V. van Dam K. Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free-energy Transduction. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 228-256Google Scholar), it does not mean at all that linear flow-force relations cannot be established. In fact, from an empirical analysis of different cellular processes, a linear relation is often found between the flow and the driving force, even if the process operates far from equilibrium (14Stucki J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 15Vieira F.L. Caplan S.R. Essig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1972; 59: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16van Rotterdam B.J. Crielaard W. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To explain these findings some authors have suggested that because linear flow-force relations might lead to higher efficiencies of free energy transduction, evolution may have resulted in biological energy converters operating around inflection points where flow-force relations would be identical to the near equilibrium flow-force relations (17Essig A. Caplan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). van der Meer et al. (18van der Meer R. Westerhoff H.V. van Dam K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that this might be a consequence of the particular kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Westerhoff and van Dam (13Westerhoff H.V. van Dam K. Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free-energy Transduction. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 228-256Google Scholar) also analyzed diverse kinetic expressions, and in all cases they found that for a certain range of forces a linear relation could be assumed, suggesting that nearly linear relations between fluxes and forces are much more trivial than perhaps expected. In any event, the assumption of linear relations in the case of glycolysis is not without precedents (4Pfeiffer T. Schuster S. Bonhoeffer S. Science. 2001; 292: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 5Aledo J.C. Esteban del Valle A. J. Chem. Educ. 2002; 79: 1336-1339Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Santillán M. Arias-Hernández L.A. Angulo-Brown F. Nuovo Cimento D. 1997; 19: 99-109Google Scholar, 19Heinrich R. Meléndez-Hevia E. Montero F. Nuño J.C. Stephani A Waddell T.G. Biochem. Soc.

Educ. 1999; 27: 12-13Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Focusing on the essential, our core model also considers a load imposed on glycolysis by the ATP-utilizing reactions (Fig. 1). As pointed by Stucki (14Stucki J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the ATP-utilizing process is driven by the phosphate potential (–X1). Thus, we have three fluxes that are linearly dependent on two forces, J1 = L11X1 + L12X2 (Equation 2), J2 = L21X1 + L22X2 (Equation 3), and J3 = –L33X1 (Equation 4).To have a steady state, we shall consider X2 a constant parameter. Although steady states can also be obtained by setting J2 or J2X2 constant, the X2 constant seems to be the case in many biological systems (12Santillán M. Arias-Hernández L.A. Angulo-Brown F. Nuovo Cimento D. 1997; 19: 99-109Google Scholar, 21Meléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Heinrich R. Montero F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A variation of the glucose level in the medium, for instance, would mean a change for the parameter X2, which will lead to a new steady state. The validity of Onsager's reciprocity theorem is also assumed, which establishes the symmetry of the matrix of phenomenological coefficients. Hence, L12 = L21. For this sort of linear converter, Kedem and Caplan (22Kedem O. Caplan S.R. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1965; 61: 1897-1911Crossref Scopus (317) Google Scholar) have introduced some useful concepts such as the degree of coupling, q=L12/L11L22 (Equation 5), which represents a dimensionless measure of how tightly the driven process is coupled to the driver process. The absolute value of the coupling coefficient will always be between 0 and 1. For glycolysis, where glucose degradation and ADP phosphorylation are tightly coupled, we can take q = 1. Another interesting concept is the so-called phenomenological stoichiometry Z=L11/L22 (Equation 6).A physically meaningful definition of the thermodynamic efficiency is, as proposed by Kedem and Caplan (22Kedem O. Caplan S.R. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1965; 61: 1897-1911Crossref Scopus (317) Google Scholar), the ratio between the output power of the driven process and the input power of the driver process η = –J1X1/J2X2 (Equation 7). It may also be convenient to normalize the output force (X1) with respect to the input force (X2) by defining the force ratio as x = Z·X1/X2 (Equation 8). Hence, the force ratio can be seen as a relative, dimensionless, measure of the output force. Now, we are in conditions to express J1, J2, J3, and η as explicit functions of the normalized variable x (see supplemental material), J1 = ZL22X2·(x + 1) (Equation 9), J2 = L22X2·(x + 1) (Equation 10), J3 = –(L33X2/Z)·x (Equation 11), and η = –x (Equation 12). Within the driving region, where the endergonic process 1 (substrate-level phosphorylation) is driven by the exergonic process 2 (glucose splitting), the domain of all these functions lies between the origin and –1, x taking the value –1 only when the system is at equilibrium, and the change in free energy for the global process is zero (ZX1 + X2 = 0). Once we have established a core model for glycolysis, which has been described using a linear irreversible thermodynamic approach, we are in a position to further explore the working regimes that are accessible to our system.Glycolytic Working Regimes—Above we have advanced the concept that energetic metabolism can perform either under a dissipative and fast regime (DMOP) or under an efficient although slower regime (EMOP). With the description of glycolysis as a free energy converter connected to a cellular load, it should be possible to identify and analyze the specific functions characterizing these thermodynamic regimes. Furthermore, because we have also noted that the phosphate potential can play a major role in determining the optimal working regime, the force ratio will be a convenient variable for these thermodynamic functions. The remainder of this section will be devoted to analyzing the restrictions imposed on x to satisfy each of the considered working regimes. Then, the comparison of these theoretical values with the in vivo observed force ratio, under conditions either of resource abundance or scarcity, will help us to draw conclusions regarding the ATP paradox.As deduced by simple inspection of Equation 9, the flow of ATP synthesis is maximal when the phosphate potential vanishes, x = 0. Hence this maximal rate of ATP production is of doubtful biological interest. Alternatively, one could hypothesize that instead of the flow of ATP formation, it is more convenient to maximize the phosphate potential (–X1). However, from Equation 9 it becomes obvious that this potential is highest (x = –1) when the rate of ATP synthesis is reduced to nil (J1 = 0). This again lacks any physiological sense. The conclusion to be drawn from this trivial analysis is that despite the fact that rapid ATP formation is an important task for glycolysis, the pathway may have evolved to optimize working regimes other than maximum flow or maximum phosphate potential.When considered alone, neither J1 nor X1 are variables that must take extreme values. In contrast, their product defines a new function referred to as output power (Po), whose optimization by natural selection may be of biological interest as seen here, Po = –J1X1 = –L22X22 (x2+ x) (Equation 13). Now, the value of x can be calculated, dPo/dx = –L22X22 (2x + 1) = 0 (Equation 14), for which a maximum output power regime is achieved. Thus, the output power exhibits an extremum for x = –1/2 = xDMOP (Equation 15), because in d2Po/dx2 =–2L22X22 < 0 (Equation 16) this extremum is a maximum.In the foregoing, we have maximized Po without considering the energy costs to obtain a maximal output power; for that reason this state is described as dissipative (DMOP). However, as pointed out by Maddox (23Maddox J. Nature. 1991; 350: 653Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), for biological systems a high degree of fitness implies not only high output powers but also high efficiencies, low entropy productions, and low energy consumption rates, requirements that are considered next.We looked for a function representing a compromise between high output power and low fuel cost. In this sense, Stucki (14Stucki J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) has proposed that the appropriate parameter to introduce the constraints of minimal energy costs into the previous optimization problem is the efficiency, which can be considered as a weight on the function Po, Po η = L22X22 (x3 + x2) (Equation 17). The value of force ratio permitting an EMOP can be found by the maximization of the above function, which occurs at x = –2/3 = xEMOP (Equation 18).Conductance Matching—Although the term “conductance matching” was originally coined by Stucki (14Stucki J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) to describe the condition enabling oxidative phosphorylation to operate in steady state at optimal efficiency, in what follows we would like to extend the application of this term to indicate the necessary and sufficient conditions to be satisfied to have glycolysis performing in the steady state and optimal Ω, omega being either the dissipative output power function (Equation 13) or the efficient output power function (Equation 17).Because our immediate aim is to analyze DMOP- and EMOP-working regimes operating under stationary conditions, we shall determine the constraints imposed on x to allow the system to operate under steady state conditions. For this purpose, Prigogine's theorem of minimum entropy production (MEP) can be useful. This celebrated theorem claims that in a steady state, the entropy production rate shows a minimum value. The dissipation function, defined as the rate of entropy production, can be formulated as the sum of products of all fluxes and their corresponding driving forces (24Kondepudi D. Prigogine I. Modern Thermodynamics: From Heat Engines to Dissipative Structures. Wiley, Chichester1999: 333-350Google Scholar). In our model the dissipation function takes the form ϕ = T·diS/dt = J1X1 + J2X2–J3X1 (Equation 19). Substitution of Equations 2, 3, and 4 into Equation 19 yields ϕ = T·diS/dt = (L11 + L33) X 21 + 2L12·X1X2 + L22X22 (Equation 20). Bearing in mind the definitions of coupling degree (Equation 5), phenomenological stoichiometry (Equation 6), and force ratio (Equation 8), a straight-forward calculation (see supplemental material) leads to ϕ = L22X22 [(1 + L33/L11)·x2 + 2x + 1] (Equation 21). Because under steady state conditions ϕ displays a minimum, the force ratio must satisfy the equation given by dϕ/dx = 0, x = –1/(1 + L33/L11) = xMEP (Equation 22).If the system is to operate under a DMOP regime installed in a steady state (minimum entropy production), there is a double condition derived from equating Equations 15 and 22, that needs to be satisfied, –1/(1 + L33/L11) = –1/2 (Equation 23). After simplification we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition L33 = L11 (Equation 24).To obtain now the conductance matching allowing the system to perform at EMOP in steady state, we have to resolve the system of equations formed by Equations 18 and 22, –1/(1 + L33/L11) = –2/3 (Equation 25) and L33 = ½·L11 (Equation 26). The double conditions, in terms of force ratio and conductance matching, which the system must satisfy to operate in steady state under either DMOP or EMOP regime, are summarized in Table I. These conditions must be born in mind when addressing the next section.Table IConductance matching for optimal glycolysis performance under two different working regimesPhysical meaningFunction Ω = f(x)x making Ωmax (q = 1)Conductance matchingDissipative output powerPo = -x2 - x-1/2L33 = L11Efficient output powerPo η = x3 + x2-2/3L33 = 1/2·L11 Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONResolving the ATP Paradox—It is important to realize that the EMOP regime represents an excellent compromise between high output power and low entropy production. Fig. 2 illustrates the advantages of EMOP on DMOP when the system is required to deliver high output power but at the same time to use the fuel as efficiently as possible. In other words, EMOP entails a good modus operandi under conditions of resource scarcity. In contrast, when the fuel is in excess and rapid resource exhaustion is not an imminent threat, then DMOP offers an adequate strategy, because it provides a higher output power than that developed under an EMOP regime (Fig. 2). In conclusion, the optimal strategy depends on the environmental conditions. Hence, the best strategy in environments that have rapidly changing substrate availability may be to develop a sort of switch mechanism enabling the cell to change from a dissipative to an efficient phenotype, or vice versa depending on glucose availability. For instance, a sudden transition from a state of scarcity to another state of plentiful substrates would require a commutation from an EMOP to a DMOP regime. In formal terms, the conductance matching would have to change from L33 = ½L11 to L33 = L11 (Table I).Fig. 2Comparison of DMOP and EMOP regimes.

As it can graphically be deduced from this figure, the EMOP regime represents an excellent compromise between high output power and low entropy production.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In our core model, L33 is an overall phenomenological conductance lumping together the conductances of all ATP-consuming processes in the cell, whereas L11 is the phenomenological conductance for the glycolytic phosphorylation. Thus, the transition from EMOP to DMOP would be only possible if the sensibility of L33 to extracellular resource is twice that of the glycolytic conductance. Here, it may be convenient to remember that the conductance or phenomenological coefficients are kinetic in nature, because they can incorporate attributes of chemical rate constants. For example, the influence of an allosteric effector can dramatically influence the proportionality between the flux and its conjugate force, as reflected in the corresponding conductance. If, as proposed by Somsen et al. (3Somsen O.J.G. Hoeben M.A. Esgalhado E. Snoep J.L. Visser D. van der Heijden R.T.J.M. Heijnen J.J. Westerhoff H.V. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), upon glucose addition the anabolic pathways are stimulated in ways other than via ATP level and more strongly than glycolysis, then a logic consequence might be a suitable change in the conductance matching allowing the transition from EMOP to DMOP.Furthermore, this transition from EMOP to DMOP after glucose addition also predicts the decrease in the ATP chemical potential (see force ratios in Table I) that is observed in yeast and that we have referred to as the ATP paradox. One important difference between mammalian cells and yeast cells is the relative constant glucose concentration encountered by the former as compared with that encountered by the latter. Hence, we would like to suggest that reversible regulation of the working regime under which glycolysis performs might have evolved specifically to cope with sudden and large variations in the extracellular glucose concentration. If that is the case, a sustained decrease in the intracellular ATP concentration when extra glucose is available may be a counterintuitive phenomenon, but it makes indeed a great deal of metabolic sense. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway providing cells with energy in the form of ATP, which can be used to drive cellular processes. Thus, glucose is a metabolic substrate acting as an extracellular source of free energy powering life. In yeast, a strong negative correlation between glycolytic flux and intracellular ATP concentration has been widely documented (1Theobald U. Mailinger W. Reuss M. Rizzi M. Ann. Biochem. 1993; 214: 31-37Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2Larsson C. Nilsson A. Blomberg A. Gustafsson L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7243-7250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Somsen O.J.G.

Because glucose catabolism is the main source of ATP-derived free energy, this observation (the higher the rate of glycolysis the lower the ATP content) is a counterintuitive phenomenon, which has been referred to as the ATP paradox. A sudden transition from glucose limitation to glucose excess leads to a new steady state at increased glycolytic flux with a sustained decrease in the ATP levels (3Somsen O.J.G. Hoeben M.A. Esgalhado E. Snoep J.L. Visser D. van der Heijden R.T.J.M. Heijnen J.J. Westerhoff H.V. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because ADP phosphorylation is tightly coupled to glucose breakdown, a higher glycolytic flux implies that more ATP is being formed. The subsequent increase in the flux throughout ATP-consuming reactions was thought to be brought about by an increased ATP/ADP ratio. Therefore, the decreased steady state level of ATP constitutes an intriguing observation. Somsen et al.(3Somsen O.J.G. Hoeben M.A. Esgalhado E. Snoep J.L. Visser D. van der Heijden R.T.J.M. Heijnen J.J. Westerhoff H.V. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in an elegant work employing metabolic control analysis and a simple model, concluded that the experimental ATP changes can only be explained if the sensitivities of ATP-consuming routes to extracellular glucose are higher than that of the glycolytic pathway. Although this particular sensitivity of anabolic pathways solves the problem of how a drop in ATP concentration triggered by high glucose levels is possible, one question still remains open. What are the physiological implications of this behavior we have termed as the ATP paradox? In other words, what is the purpose of the stronger sensitivity to the level of extra"

During development, the organism must continuously adapt its metabolism to the nutritional environment because the availability and quality of the nutrients varies widely throughout the different developmental stages. In rodents, as for most mammals, the fetus receives through the placenta a diet enriched in carbohydrates but very poor in fat (1Battaglia F.C. Meschia G. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 499-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Immediately after birth, the maternal supply of substrates ceases abruptly, and the newborn is fed at intervals with milk, a high fat, low carbohydrate diet (2Dils R.R. Knudsen J. Biochem. Soc.

Toward the end of the suckling period the milk is progressively replaced by the solid food diet of the adult, enriched in carbohydrates.

It is synthesized as a precursor form anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, SREBPs form a complex with the SREBP cleavage-activating protein. SREBP cleavage-activating protein escorts the SREBPs to the Golgi apparatus where they are processed by two proteases. After proteolytic cleavage, the mature transcriptionally active form of SREBP migrates into the nucleus where it can bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) or E boxes of target genes (6Kim J.B.

INSIG-1 and INSIG-2 proteins have been identified as proteins that promote SREBP retention in the ER through their interaction with SREBP cleavage-activating protein, thus preventing SREBP translocation to the Golgi apparatus for proteolytic processing (9Yabe D.

Indeed, previous studies have shown that SREBP-1c expression is transcriptionally stimulated by insulin (11Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In addition to insulin, hepatic SREBP-1c is also under control of the oxysterols, which are ligands of the nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) (17Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L.

LXR directly activates SREBP-1c transcription through two LXRE-binding sites present in the SREBP-1c promoter. α and β isoforms of LXR form heterodimers with the ubiquitous dimerizing partner, RXR (18Willy P.J.

Apart from activation of lipogenesis through SREBP-1c, the LXR transcription factors are crucial because they regulate multiple genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport, including cholesterol 7α hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acids production (19Peet D.J.

The current experiments were designed to explore the in vivo regulation of SREBP-1c levels in the liver during late gestation, suckling, and the weaning period and the respective roles of LXR and insulin on SREBP-1c transcriptional activity throughout these developmental stages. Animals—C3H mice (Charles River) were used in this study. The animals were housed in a controlled environment (constant temperature and humidity, light from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and fed ad libitum with a standard chow diet: composition (calories) 65% carbohydrates, 11% lipids, and 24% proteins (UAR A 03). Adult Mice—Adult mice were fasted for 16 h and then refed with standard chow and water containing 20% sucrose for 6 h. After cervical dislocation, the liver was collected for protein preparations. For LXR agonist gavage experiments, 10-week-old fed male mice were force fed a solution containing the LXR synthetic agonist T0-901317 (Sigma) at a dose of 50 mg/kg in 1% carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma) or with the vehicle for the control mice. After 12 h, the mice were sacrificed, and the livers were collected for RNA isolation Fetuses—Following mating, noon of the day of the appearance of a vaginal plug was taken to be 0.5 day of gestation. Fetuses at stages 16.5, 17.5, and 19.5 days post coitum (pc) were removed from uteri, transferred to dishes containing phosphate-buffered saline, sacrificed, and dissected. The liver was collected for RNA and nuclear protein extraction. For insulin injection (Actrapid®; NovoNordisk), the abdominal wall of pregnant mice was incised under anesthesia, and subcutaneous injections were made through the uterine wall into the fetus with an insulin syringe (U 40 Insulin; Terumo). The incisions in the mothers were then sutured. Four hours later, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the livers of the fetuses were removed for RNA isolation. Plasma was stored at -80 °C. Pups—After mating C3H mice, noon of the day of birth was considered as time 0. The mice were sacrificed at days 1, 8, 13, 15, 21, and 28 after birth. The mice were weaned at day 20 onto standard chow. Real Time PCR—RNA were isolated from fresh tissue samples according to Chirgwin et al. (21Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Specific primers for each gene (Table I) were designed using primer express software (PerkinElmer Life Science). Real time PCRs were performed starting with 50 ng of reverse transcribed total RNA subsequently mixed with fast start DNA master Sybr Green mix (Roche Applied Science), 3 mm MgCl2, and various sets of 525 nm gene-specific forward and reverse primers (Table I) in a final volume of 10 μl. The relative amount of each mRNA was calculated using the second derivative comparative Ct method. Quantification was obtained after normalization to 18 S rRNA and correction for interplate variation using a reverse transcription calibrator (22PerkinElmer Life, SciencesRelative Quantification of Gene Expression: Bulletin 2.

The livers were then transferred into a beaker, on ice, containing the homogenization buffer (2 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and minced with scissors. After processing in a Dounce apparatus in fresh buffer on ice, the homogenates were layered on 2 m sucrose cushions and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 35 min at 0 °C. The nuclear pellets were then rinsed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2; resuspended in a 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer; and incubated 15 min on ice. After spinning 5 min at 10,000 rpm, aliquots of the supernatants were stored at -80 °C. The protein content was determined as described by Bradford, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Electromobility Shift Assay—The DNA probes were prepared by annealing both strands of the SRE and LXRE binding sequences (Table II) (23Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H.

Statistical Analyses—The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using a Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. Liver SREBP-1c Binding Activity Increases with Plasma Insulin during Fetal Development—To investigate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of SREBP-1c expression during development, we first measured hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA in fetal livers from 16.5 days pc to day 1 after birth. Fig. 1A shows that SREBP-1c is expressed in the fetal liver at 16.5 days pc. Earlier stages show very low amounts of SREBP-1c mRNA (results not shown). SREBP-1c mRNA levels increase from 16.5 days pc to 19.5 days pc and then fall dramatically at birth. The level of SREBP-1c mRNA expression at day 1 after birth is the lowest detected throughout our experiments including in the fasted mice (data not shown). These variations in SREBP-1c mRNA expression closely paralleled insulin plasma levels (Fig. 1A), before and after birth. Two SREBP-1 isoforms are derived from a single gene by the use of two distinct promoters and yield two differently regulated isoforms, SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c. In our experiments, SREBP-1a mRNA levels were low and did not change significantly between 16.5 days pc and 19.5 days pc (Fig. 1A). We then assessed the potential SREBP-1c binding activity in the liver during development by EMSA using the SRE-binding site of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene (Table II). As shown in Fig. 1B, SREBP-1 binding activity was detected from 17.5 days pc. As for SREBP-1c mRNA levels, there is a gradual increase in nuclear binding of SREBP-1 to the SRE probe from 16.5 to 19.5 days pc followed by a dramatic fall at birth. The specificity of the binding activity is confirmed by SREBP-1 antibody competition of the 19.5 days pc binding activity (Fig. 1B). The lowest band (Fig. 1B, band NS) is not displaced by the specific antibody and thus corresponds to a nonspecific binding activity. These experiments provide evidence that SREBP-1c mRNA and nuclear binding to the SRE increase progressively from mid-gestation to late gestation and drop just after birth in parallel with plasma insulin. In the adult liver, SREBP-1c is a major transcriptional mediator of insulin action on glycolytic and lipogenic enzyme genes such as the glucokinase (GK) and FAS genes (12Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le L.X Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 13Foretz M.

Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). A similar pattern as described for SREBP-1c mRNA and binding activity was observed for GK and FAS mRNA expression, characterized by an increase between 16.5 days pc and 19.5 days pc and a drastic fall at birth (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that GK and FAS are SREBP-1c target genes during late gestation and that SREBP-1c expression is itself related to plasma insulin concentrations. SREBP-1c Expression Occurs in the Absence of LXRs Binding to LXRE during the Fetal Development in the Liver—In addition to insulin, the nuclear receptor LXR is also able to control SREBP-1c gene expression in the adult liver (24Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 25DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ou J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Janowski B.A. Shan B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of LXR are known. LXRα is primarily expressed in the liver, whereas LXRβ expression is ubiquitous with low levels in the adult liver (27Lu T.T. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37735-37738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Expression of LXRα remains low from day 16.5 to day 19.5 pc when compared with the values observed after birth (Fig. 2A). LXRβ expression increases between day 16.5 and 19.5 pc and shows minor variations thereafter. The potential binding activity of the LXR nuclear receptors was then assessed in the fetal liver by EMSA, using one functional LXRE-binding site of the SREBP-1c promoter (23Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) (Table II). Despite LXRα and β mRNA expression, there was no detectable LXRα or β binding activity between 16.5 and 19.5 days pc, whereas it was clearly present in the 21-day-old weaned mouse. Thus, SREBP-1c gene expression during fetal life is independent of both LXRα and β binding on its promoter at these stages. In Utero Insulin Injections Can Trigger a Premature Increase of the SREBP-1c mRNAs and Expression of SREBP-1c Target Genes in the Fetus—To determine the involvement of insulin in the transcriptional regulation of SREBP-1c during fetal life, insulin was injected in utero at 16.5 days pc, a developmental stage characterized by low plasma insulin, low SREBP-1c mRNA level, and the absence of LXRs binding on the LXRE of the SREBP-1c gene. Within 4 h, insulin administration to the 16.5-day-old fetuses induces an increase of SREBP-1c mRNA (Fig. 3A). As shown by EMSA (Fig. 3B), a precocious strong binding activity of SREBP-1 is also triggered by the insulin injection. In contrast, no LXR binding activity was detected upon insulin injection (Fig. 3C). Moreover, no effect on LXR mRNA levels was observed (data not shown). Therefore, insulin is able to trigger a premature increase of SREBP-1c mRNA in the 16.5 day pc fetal liver in the absence of any LXR binding activity (Fig. 3C). This transcriptional activation of the SREBP-1c gene by insulin is followed by an increase in expression of SREBP-1c target genes, FAS and GK (Fig. 3D). LXR Binding to SREBP-1c LXRE Could Explain High SREBP-1c mRNA Levels during the Suckling Period—Directly after birth, during the suckling period, pups ingest milk, which is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet, inducing low plasma insulin and high plasma glucagon levels. At weaning, the transition from a milk diet to a high carbohydrate, low fat diet (animal chow) is responsible for a rise in plasma insulin and a decrease in plasma glucagon (28Girard J. Ferré P. Kervran A. Pégorier J.P. Assan R. Foa P.P. Bajaj J.S. Foa N.L. Glucagon: Its Role in Physiology and Clinical Medicine. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1977: 563-581Google Scholar, 29Girard J. Ferré P. Jones C.T. Biological Development of the Fetus and Neonate. Elsevier, Amsterdam1982: 517-551Google Scholar). Following our observation of the insulin-mediated regulation of SREBP-1c in the fetal liver, we then went on to examine the hepatic expression of SREBP-1c mRNA at days 1, 8, and 13 after birth (suckling period) and after weaning. Surprisingly, hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA levels were high during the suckling period, reaching a level of expression even higher than levels observed in weaned mice (Fig. 4A) or high carbohydrate-refed adult mice (data not shown). The low plasma insulin concentrations during suckling (under 20 microunits/ml) cannot account for this peak of SREBP-1c expression; thus another factor must be responsible for this induction. Given that LXR is known to increase SREBP-1c transcription in the adult, we then hypothesized that this transcription factor could be responsible for the elevated hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA level during suckling. LXRα mRNA expression during suckling is increased 2-fold between days 1 and 8 after birth and peaks at day 13. LXRα expression decreases somewhat after weaning (Fig. 5A). At the same time, no statistically significant variation of LXRβ mRNA expression is observed (Fig. 5A). To assess LXR binding activity during suckling, we performed EMSA with nuclear extracts from days 1 to 15 after birth and from weaned mice (Fig. 5B). Contrary to what we observed during gestation, a strong LXR binding activity is detectable throughout the suckling period. Moreover, LXR target genes such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (30Zhang Y. Repa J.J. Gauthier K. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43018-43024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and ABC-A1 (20Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 31Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) have significantly elevated mRNA levels during suckling in comparison with weaned values and show the same expression pattern as SREBP-1c (Fig. 4B). The stronger decrease in the expression of SREBP-1c, LPL, and ABC-A1 mRNA in comparison with the LXR mRNA expression levels at weaning is more likely a reflection of the availability of the LXR agonists decreasing when the animals are weaned from a high fat diet (maternal milk) onto a high carbohydrate diet (standard chow). Thus, during the suckling period and in contrast with the late gestation, LXR appears the more likely activator of SREBP-1c expression. Despite High SREBP-1c mRNA Expression, Glucokinase and Fatty Acid Synthase Gene Expression Remains Very Low throughout the Suckling Period—To determine whether the high level of SREBP-1c mRNA during the suckling period is followed by the transcriptional activation of its potential target genes, we measured GK and FAS expression at days 1, 8, and 13 after birth and at weaning by real time quantitative PCR (Fig. 6). As previously described (32Perdereau D. Narkewicz M. Coupé C. Ferré P. Girard J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1990; 30: 91-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Girard J. Perdereau D. Narkewicz M.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), GK and FAS mRNA levels remain very low during the suckling period and increase only at weaning when the animal switches to a high carbohydrate diet. Recently, it has been shown by Botolin and Jump (35Botolin D. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6959-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that the SREBP-1c precursor protein was present in the ER of suckling rats, indicating that SREBP-1c mRNA is well translated at that time but absent from the nuclei. We have also detected high levels of expression of SREBP-1 precursor protein in the suckling mice (data not shown). In EMSA analysis of SREBP-1c binding activity of nuclear extracts from mouse livers, no SREBP-1 binding is detected during the suckling period, whereas a shift is evident using extracts from weaned mice (Fig. 7). This indicates an absence of nuclear binding of SREBP-1c on SRE probes during suckling. These results reveal that the absence of hepatic SREBP-1c target gene induction during suckling, despite elevated SREBP-1c mRNA and ER precursor protein, is due to the absence of nuclear SREBP-1 binding activity. Thus, these studies indirectly suggest that a specialized mechanism should promote SREBP-1c retention in the ER preventing nuclear translocation. INSIG-2a but Not INSIG-1 Might Be Implicated in the Lack of SREBP-1c Binding Activity during the Suckling Period— INSIGs are recently discovered ER-specific proteins that function as SREBPs precursor retention factors, preventing their cleavage in the Golgi apparatus and further nuclear translocation. INSIG-1 and INSIG-2a are the two isoforms predominantly expressed in the liver. Because insulin is able to down-regulate INSIG-2a mRNA expression and because insulin plasma concentration during the suckling period is very low, we hypothesized that INSIG-2a expression could be high during suckling and may interfere with SREBP-1c cleavage. We first measured hepatic INSIG-2a mRNA levels from 16.5 days pc to weaned mice (Fig. 8A). INSIG-2a expression is barely detectable during gestation in the liver. INSIG-2a expression increases gradually throughout suckling until day 15, when expression is maximal, and falls at the suckling/weaning transition. Thus, elevated INSIG-2a levels during suckling could be at least partly responsible for the retention of SREBP-1c into the ER compartment. It is interesting to note that INSIG-1 mRNA displays a totally opposite expression profile (Fig. 8A); high during gestation, INSIG-1 mRNA levels drop at birth and remain low throughout suckling until weaning when expression increases again. LXR Synthetic Agonist T0-901317 Induces INSIG-2a mRNA— Because LXR binding activity and INSIG-2a mRNA are both elevated during the suckling period, we tested the hypothesis that LXR might regulate the INSIG-2a gene expression. We force-fed adult mice a LXR agonist, T0-901317. The results show a 3-fold induction of hepatic INSIG-2a mRNA after 12 h of LXR agonist treatment (Fig. 8B). In this study, we have shown that insulin stimulates SREBP-1c transcriptional activity in the absence of LXR binding activity, and this results in the increased expression of SREBP-1c target genes during the late gestation period. In contrast, the suckling period is a unique situation in which a high LXRα transcriptional activity but a low plasma insulin results in the retention of SREBP-1c precursor form into the ER, possibly because of a high INSIG-2a expression. During late gestation, several lines of evidence suggest that insulin is a major factor triggering SREBP-1c expression. SREBP-1c expression increases in parallel with fetal plasma insulin concentration, and insulin administration is sufficient to stimulate SREBP-1c expression and transcriptional activity. It is interesting that in contrast with what has been observed in the adult liver (17Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45408-45416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), SREBP-1c mRNA primary expression occurs in the complete absence of LXRα binding activity. It has been recently reported (36Cheng G. Liang G. Ou J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11245-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 37Cagen L.M. Deng X. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. J. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) that insulin activates SREBP-1c expression through LXR binding on the SREBP-1 promoter. In our experiments, it is clear that during late gestation LXR binding activity is absent, and thus the contribution of LXR on insulin-induced SREBP-1c transcription must be negligible at this stage of development. The regulation of SREBP-1c after birth displays drastic and unexpected changes throughout the suckling period. Our studies support the recent findings of Botolin and Jump (35Botolin D. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6959-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which show that despite high SREBP-1c mRNA content and SREBP-1c precursor protein, the SREBP-1c mature form and SREBP-1c target genes are very low. However, in the previous study, the authors gave no explanation as to why this may occur. During the suckling period, plasma insulin concentration is very low, and thus another factor must be responsible for the induction of SREBP-1c transcription. Here, we propose that LXR, a known activator of SREBP-1c transcription, is responsible for the high SREBP-1c gene expression during the suckling period. This is supported by the fact that we observed high LXRα mRNA, high LXR binding activity, and high expression of other known LXR target genes such as ABC-A1 and LPL during that period. Furthermore, milk is rich in cholesterol, which could induce an increased level of oxysterols, the natural LXR ligands. Oxysterols, through binding to the LXR, trigger mainly the expression of enzymes involved in bile acids production. Because the diet of suckling animals is extremely rich in triglycerides, the hepatic production of bile acids is an absolute requirement for complete fat digestion. We also propose that the absence of SREBP-1c nuclear form during the suckling period is linked to the induction of INSIG-2a through LXR stimulation (Fig. 8B). During suckling and at weaning, the pattern of INSIG-2a expression is similar to the expression of known LXR target genes, including SREBP-1c. The presence of INSIG-2a during the suckling period would then explain the absence of the nuclear mature form of SREBP-1c and thus the absence of SREBP-1c target gene expression. At weaning, the decrease in the diet cholesterol content would reduce the synthesis of LXR ligands, and the increase in plasma insulin would lead to a rapid decrease in INSIG-2a (Fig. 8A) and thus the appearance of a SREBP-1c binding activity in the nucleus (Fig. 7). Moreover, our observations have shown an opposite expression profile for INSIG-1 and INSIG-2a mRNA. This suggests that in contrast with INSIG-2a, INSIG-1 does not interact with SREBP-1c to induce its retention in the ER. In fact, SREBP-1c is present in liver nuclei during late gestation and at weaning despite elevated INSIG-1 mRNA level. Conversely, because mature SREBP-2 is present in the liver nuclei during suckling (35Botolin D. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6959-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this tends to indicate that INSIG-2a does not interact with SREBP-2. What could be the physiological significance of this unique regulation of SREBP-1c during suckling? SREBP-1c can be considered as a transcription factor reflecting carbohydrate availability.

SREBP-1c together with the glucose-responsive carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein transcription factor induces also lipogenic genes such as FAS, acetyl CoA carboxylase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (38Uyeda K.

Finally, SREBP-1c is also able to repress genes involved in hepatic glucose production such as the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (41Chakravarty K. Leahy P. Becard D. Hakimi P. Foretz M. Ferré P.

SREBP-1c expression is also inducible in the presence of a high cholesterol diet through LXR activation. This link between cholesterol and lipid metabolism could allow achievement of a proper cellular cholesterol/fatty acid ratio, an important membrane parameter. However, when a high cholesterol/triglyceride, low carbohydrate diet is absorbed (suckling period), fatty acid synthesis is not anymore necessary, and low glucose availability precludes lipid synthesis from this substrate. Induction of SREBP-1c transcriptional activity in these conditions would be deleterious because it would favor glucose utilization and repress glucose production by the liver in a period of glucose shortage, leading to hypoglycemia. The mechanism that we are describing with a potential role for INSIG-2a would then be a safety mechanism allowing escape from such an adverse situation. One would predict that this mechanism is switched on each time a high cholesterol, triglyceride/low carbohydrate diet is consumed. At weaning, when the plasma insulin concentration increases, this leads to a decrease of INSIG-2a, then allowing the maturation and translocation of SREBP-1c to the nucleus, where it activates its target genes.

However, whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway solely accounts for the induction of cell cycle or antiapoptotic activity of the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase is not clear. Here we report that cell cycle inducer Cks1, which triggers ubiquitination and degradation of p27Kip1, associates with the unphosphorylated form of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2), an adaptor protein that is phosphorylated by FGFR kinases and recruits downstream signaling molecules. FGF-dependent activation of FGFR tyrosine kinases induces FRS2 phosphorylation, causes release of Cks1 from FRS2, and promotes degradation of p27Kip1 in 3T3 cells. Since degradation of p27Kip1 is a key regulatory step in activation of the cyclin E/A-Cdk complex during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, the results suggest a novel mitogenic pathway whereby FGF and other growth factors that activate FRS2 directly activate cyclin-dependent kinases.

The FGF ligands are single polypeptides consisting of 22 genetically distinct homologues, and the FGF receptors (FGFRs) are transmembrane tyrosine kinases encoded by four homologous gene products, which complex with pericellular matrix heparan sulfates independent of the FGF ligand (1McKeehan W.L.

Academic/Elsevier Press, New York2003: 265-270Google Scholar). Binding of FGF ligands to FGFR-heparan sulfate complexes activates the kinase activity and transmits regulatory signals to downstream signaling mediators or targets. Accumulating reports demonstrate that FGFRs elicit diverse regulatory activities that are cell type- and FGFR-specific as well as redundant among the four FGFRs. The molecular mechanisms that would explain both specificity and redundant activities are not well understood. Two proximal substrates (FRS1 and FRS2) interact with the activated FGFR tyrosine kinases that are tyrosine-autophosphorylated. FRS1 is phospholipase Cγ, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine 766 of FGFR1, and is phosphorylated by the kinase. Activation of FRS1 is not obligatory for the mitogenic activity of FGFR1 (3Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J.

However, it is important for prostate epithelial cells to acquire a mitogenic response to FGFR1 and for other cellular activities stimulated by phospholipase Cγ (5Wang F. McKeehan K. Yu C. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1898-1903PubMed Google Scholar). FRS2 (also called SNT1, for suc1-associating nuclear target protein 1) is an adaptor protein that is anchored to the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation at the N terminus (6Kouhara H.

FRS2 interacts with the intracellular juxtamembrane sequence of the FGFR through a conserved phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain adjacent to the C terminus of the myristoylation consensus sequence (9Dhalluin C.

The PTB domain of FRS2 is homologous to and exhibits a similar three-dimensional structure as PTB domains of several other signaling adaptor proteins, including insulin receptor substrate 1. Phosphorylation of FRS2 in response to FGF treatment is associated with the FGF mitogenic signaling (6Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of FRS2 has multiple candidate phosphorylation sites as well as numerous signaling molecule binding sites, which include Grb2 that recruits upstream activators of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in the MAP kinase pathway. Therefore, FRS2 is considered an adaptor that connects FGFR to the MAP kinase pathway (5Wang F. McKeehan K. Yu C. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1898-1903PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lopez M.E.

The fact that not all FGFR signaling is tightly associated with activation of the MAP kinase pathway (16Ribisi Jr., S. Mariani F.V. Aamar E. Lamb T.M. Frank D. Harland R.M. Dev.

Development. 2003; 130: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate alternative and potentially more direct means by which the FGFR transmits mitogenic signals. The interaction of FRS2 with p13suc1, a yeast cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-binding protein important for cell cycle regulation (18Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), has been utilized together with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to precipitate and assess FGF-dependent phosphorylation of FRS2 for decades. Although a useful experimental tool, the interaction has not been associated with FGF signal transduction. Two mammalian homologues of Suc1, Cks1 and Cks2, have been identified (19Hadwiger J.A.

Cks1 is required for p27Kip1 to interact with the Skp-2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) ubiquitin ligase complex and promotes p27Kip1 degradation (22Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B.

The degradation of p27Kip1 in the late G1 phase activates Cdk2-cyclin E and Cdk2-cyclin A complexes that, in turn, signal the cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle (22Ganoth D. Bornstein G.

Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that Cks1 and Cks2 are homologues, the function of Cks2 is not clear. Cks2 has been implicated in the first metaphase/anaphase transition of mammalian meiosis (25Spruck C.H. de Miguel M.P. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Stein P. Schultz R.M. Lincoln A.J. Donovan P.J. Reed S.I. Science. 2003; 300: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Cks2 are viable, but both sexes are sterile, in contrast to mice lacking Cks1 that are smaller than wild type (23Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cells derived from the Cks1 null mice proliferate at a reduced rate, consistent with elevated levels of p27Kip1 (23Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of p27Kip1 are tightly controlled. The expression of p27Kip1 is frequently down-regulated in human tumors (26Cordon-Cardo C. Koff A. Drobnjak M. Capodieci P. Osman I. Millard S.S. Gaudin P.B. Fazzari M. Zhang Z.F. Massague J.

Physiol. 2000; 183: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the reduction correlates with a poor prognosis (28Philipp-Staheli J. Payne S.R. Kemp C.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 148-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although the interaction of Cks1 with p27Kip1 and Skp-2 triggers the G1/S transition by inducing p27Kip1 ubiquitination and degradation, the potential upstream regulators of Cks1 have not been identified. Because of the homology of Suc1 to Cks1 and the historic interaction of Suc1 with the major FGFR kinase substrate FRS2, we asked whether the FGFR kinase might directly affect Cks1-mediated p27Kip1 degradation as a mechanism of FGFR induction of the G1/S transition. Here we report that Cks1 associated with unphosphorylated FRS2 through the sequence encoding the PTB and myristoylation domains. Phosphorylation of FRS2 by the FGFR1 kinase in response to activating FGF ligands reduced the interaction and induced p27Kip1 degradation in mouse 3T3 cells. The release of Cks1 from FRS2 via activation of the FGFR kinase suggests a novel signaling pathway whereby a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase may directly activate the cell cycle through Cks1-mediated activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. Construction of Cks-GST/GFP Fusion Proteins—Full-length cDNA for mouse Cks1 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse embryo RNA pools with forward primer cks1a (CTCCTGCA-GAGCGATCATGTCGCACAAACA) and reverse primer cks1b (CTG-CAGGTACCTTTCTTTGGTTTC). Similarly, full-length cDNA for Cks2 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with forward primer cks2a (TTTCTGCAGCGCGCCGGCAGGATGGCCCAC) and reverse primer cks2b (TAAGGTACCTTTTTGTTGTTCTTT). The PCR products were cloned in pBluescript SK vector at PstI and KpnI restriction sites. After sequence verification, the PCR fragments of Cks1 and Cks2 were inframe ligated to the 5′-end of the coding sequence for Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST). The resulting cDNAs were subcloned into vector pVL1393 for preparation of recombinant baculoviruses. Expression of Cks1- and Cks2-GST fusion proteins was evaluated with the anti-GST polyclonal antibody (29Wang F. Lu W. McKeehan K. Mohamedali K. Gabriel J.L. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Cks cDNAs were also cloned into vector pEGFP-N3 for expression in mammalian cells as GFP-Cks fusion proteins that had a green fluorescence protein (GFP) tag at the N terminus or into vector pEGFP-C3 for expression as Cks-GFP fusion proteins that had a GFP tag at the C terminus. Construction of FRS2 Mutants—The cDNA encoding the N terminus of ΔmFRS2-His that had a His tag at the C terminus was PCR-amplified from the full-length FRS2 coding sequence with forward primer dm1 (CTGTTGCCCGGGTCCAGATAAAGACACTGT) and reverse primer dm2 (TCCACTAACTTGATCTCTTCCAAG). The cDNA coding for ΔpFRS2-His was PCR-amplified from the same template with forward primer ts1 (ACACCTGCCACCATGGGATTTGCTGCTCAGAAC) and reverse primer FRS2hisb (5Wang F. McKeehan K. Yu C. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1898-1903PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for PTB-His was PCR-amplified with forward primer FRS2a (5Wang F. McKeehan K. Yu C. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1898-1903PubMed Google Scholar) and reverse primer ptb2 (GTTCTGAGTACTAAATCCTGGAGT); the cDNA coding for ΔmPTB-His was PCR-amplified with forward primer dm1 and reverse primer ptb2. The cDNA fragments were ligated to C-terminal coding sequences of FRS2-His, and the resulting fragments were cloned in vector pBluescript SK for sequence verification. Due to the lack of a translational initiation site, coding sequences for ΔmFRS2 and ΔmPTB were inframe ligated to pCMV-Tag2 vector containing an artificial FLAG tag downstream of the translational initiation site. The molecular weights of the fusions were slightly higher than those of FRS2 and PTB, respectively, due to coding sequences of the vector. The cDNA fragments were then subcloned to vector pVL1393 for preparation of recombinant baculoviruses (29Wang F. Lu W. McKeehan K. Mohamedali K. Gabriel J.L. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Full-length FRS2-His fusion proteins were prepared as previously described (30Wang F. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2002; 38: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Pull-down with Glutathione Beads—sf9 cells (5 × 106) were infected with the indicated recombinant viruses for 3 days and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100-phosphate-buffered saline. The cell lysates were mixed as indicated and incubated with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) or p13suc1-GST beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed with 0.1% Tritonphosphate-buffered saline four times, and specifically bound fractions were recovered with the SDS-sample buffer. Pull-down with Nickel Beads—The cell lysates were mixed as indicated and diluted with equal volumes of the washing buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m imidazole, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The mixtures were gently rocked with 30 μl of nickel-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. The FRS2-His-nickel-agarose complexes were then washed three times with the washing buffer, and specifically bound fractions were recovered from beads with the SDS-sample buffer. Phosphorylation of FRS2 by FGFR1 Kinase—sf9 insect cells (5 × 106) were co-infected with the indicated FRS2- and FGFR1-bearing baculoviruses for 3 days. The cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml heparin and 20 ng/ml FGF1 for 30 min at 27 °C where indicated and lysed as described above. The cell lysates were mixed and incubated with glutathione beads or nickel beads as indicated. Specifically bound fractions were divided into three aliquots, and electroblotted to nylon membranes. Tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 and FGFR1 were detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). The total FRS2-His proteins were detected with anti-His tag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and total FGFR1 proteins were detected with anti-FGFR1 antibody 17A3 as indicated. The corresponding bands were visualized with ECL-plus chemiluminescent detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of Cellular p27Kip1 Proteins—The cells (2 × 105) in 6-well plates were brought to quiescence by incubation in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Then the cells were incubated with cycloheximide (2 mg/ml) for 1 h where indicated, followed by incubation with FGF2 (20 ng/ml) and heparin (2 μg/ml) for the indicated time. The cells were then lysed with 0.5% Triton-phosphate-buffered saline. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Aliquots equal to 5 μg of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted to nylon membranes. Cellular levels of p27Kip1 were detected with anti-p27Kip1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The corresponding bands were visualized with the ECL-plus chemiluminescent detection reagents. FRS2-His Was Tyrosine-phosphorylated by the FGFR1 Kinase in sf9 Cells—To generate enough recombinant FRS2 proteins for biochemical studies, recombinant baculovirus bearing coding sequence for FRS2-His with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus was generated. To determine whether FRS2-His was phosphorylated by the FGFR1 kinase, FRS2-His was co-expressed with FGFR1 kinase in sf9 cells and pulled down with nickel-Sepharose beads. The bound fractions were subjected to Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-His tag antibodies. Fig. 1A shows that FRS2-His was specifically tyrosinephosphorylated by the FGFR1 kinase. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed multiple bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 55 to 85 kDa (Fig. 1A), which reflects differential phosphorylation of FRS2 (5Wang F. McKeehan K. Yu C. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1898-1903PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphorylated FRS2-His exhibited the expected association with p13suc1, the recombinant FRS2-His was incubated with p13suc1-agarose beads, and the bound fractions were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies (30Wang F. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2002; 38: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, FRS2-His proteins were pulled down with the p13suc1-GST beads independent of the presence of the FGFR1 kinase (Fig. 1B). This showed that the interaction of FRS2 and p13suc1 was tyrosine phosphorylation-independent. Phosphorylation-dependent Association of FRS2 with Cks1— To determine whether the mammalian counterparts of yeast p13suc1 also associated with FRS2 and played roles in FGF signaling, mouse cDNAs coding for Cks1 and Cks2 were cloned and expressed with a GST tag at the N terminus to facilitate purification and identification (32Wang F. Kan M. McKeehan K. Jang J.H. Feng S. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23887-23895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Cks1-GST and Cks2-GST fusion proteins expressed in sf9 cells were soluble and bound to GSH-agarose beads (Fig. 2). In addition, Cks1-GFP and Cks2-GFP that had a GFP tag either at the N terminus or the C terminus were distributed in both cytosol and nucleus when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). This is similar to p13suc1 that gradually accumulates in the nucleus after it is microinjected into the cells (33Hepler P.K. Sek F.J. John P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2176-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether FRS2 associated with Cks1 and Cks2 and whether the association was tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent, sf9 cell-expressed FRS2 recombinant proteins, with and without coexpression with the FGFR1 kinase, were applied to GSH-agarose beads together with Cks1-GST or Cks2-GST. The bound fractions were divided into three aliquots and Western blotted with the indicated antibodies (Fig. 2A). Co-expression with the FGFR1 kinase abrogated the FRS2-Cks1 interaction, whereas it only reduced the FRS2-Cks2 interaction (Fig. 2A, top panel). Consistently, Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that more phosphorylated FRS2 was pulled down by Cks2 than by Cks1 (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Under similar conditions, FRS2 was not pulled down by GSH-agarose beads in the presence or absence of the FGFR1 kinase (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the pull-down occurs through interactions between FRS2 and Cks1-GST or Cks2-GST. To confirm that the negative impact of FGFR1 kinase on FRS2-Cks1 interactions was due to activity of FGFR1 kinase and not due to competition between Cks1 and FGFR in interaction with FRS2, similar experiments were carried out with FRS2 coexpressed with a kinase-inactive mutant of FGFR1 (R1KN). The results showed that R1KN failed to phosphorylate FRS2 and also failed to abrogate the FRS2-Cks1 interaction (Fig. 2A). Together with the fact that the direct binding of FRS2 and FGFR1 is weak, since most of FRS2 cannot be pulled down by FGFR1, the data suggest that there is no competition between Cks and FGFR1 for interaction with FRS2. To determine whether the incubation with Cks1-GST or Cks2-GST caused FRS2 degradation, FRS2-His, with and without co-expression with FGFR1 kinase, was incubated with lysates of sf9 cells expressing Cks1-GST or Cks2-GST at 4 °C for 2 h. The FRS2-His in the mixtures was then pulled down with nickel-agarose beads, and the bound fractions were analyzed with the antibodies indicated in Fig. 3. The results showed that incubation with Cks1- and Cks2-GST did not induce FRS2 degradation. Together the results here suggest that unphosphorylated FRS2 associates with both Cks1 and Cks2 and that tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 by the FGFR1 kinase selectively causes release of Cks1 from FRS2, presumably as a consequence of interference of the FRS2-Cks1 interaction by tyrosine phosphorylation on FRS2. Cks Associated with FRS2 via Conserved PTB and Myristoylation Domains—The N terminus of FRS2 has a short myristoylation consensus sequence followed by a conserved PTB domain that interacts with FGFR1 kinase and other receptor tyrosine. The C terminus has multiple candidate sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with downstream molecules. To identify FRS2 structural domains required for association with Cks1 and Cks2, a panel of FRS2 mutants was constructed for coexpression and interaction studies in sf9 cells. All of the mutants were hexahistidine-tagged at the C terminus (Fig. 4A) and, therefore, specifically bound to nickel-agarose beads (Fig. 4B). Affinity pull-down assays with GSH-agarose beads in the presence of Cks1- or Cks2-GST fusions showed that deletion of the sequence coding for PTB and myristoylation domain (ΔpFRS2) abolished the association of FRS2 with both Cks1 and Cks2. Deletion of the myristoylation sequence alone (ΔmFRS2) also significantly impaired the association (Fig. 4C). This suggests that conserved myristoylation and PTB domains of FRS2 are required for the interaction with Cks1 and Cks2. In all cases, the GSH-agarose beads alone failed to pull-down FRS2 and FRS2 constructs under the same conditions (Fig. 4C). We then determined whether FRS2 associated with Cks1 and Cks2 directly through the PTB domain by construction of mutant PTB composed of solely the myristoylated N-terminal PTB domain and ΔmPTB without the myristoylation site (Fig. 4A). Pull-down assays showed that the PTB strongly interacted with both Cks1- and Cks2-GST independent of the FGFR1 kinase (Fig. 5A). Deletion of the N-terminal myristoylation sequence also significantly reduced the association with Cks1 and Cks2 (Fig. 5A). Separate results not shown here revealed that the FGFR1 kinase failed to phosphorylate the isolated PTB domain. Fig. 5B indicates that there was no interaction between FRS2 and GST and that the pull-down was specifically through the FRS2-Cks interaction. FGF Induced p27Kip1 Degradation without New Protein Syntheses—Cks1 mediates degradation of p27Kip1, a Cdk inhibitor, through the ubiquitination pathway during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle and promotes cell cycle progression (22Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of the FGFR1 kinase induced degradation of p27Kip1 through releasing Cks1 from FRS2, NIH 3T3 cells expressing endogenous FGFR1 kinase (5Wang F. McKeehan K. Yu C. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1898-1903PubMed Google Scholar) were synchronized by incubation in medium containing 0.1% serum for 48 h and then exposed to FGF2 for up to 48 h. The cellular levels of p27Kip1 protein were measured with anti-p27Kip1 antibodies (Fig. 6A). The results demonstrated that FGF2 significantly induced reduction of p27Kip1 at the protein level 6 h after the treatment. Cells constantly synthesize p27Kip1 during the cell cycle (27Sgambato A. Cittadini A. Faraglia B. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tightly controlled oscillation of p27Kip1 is primarily achieved by post-translational regulation. To determine whether activation of the FGFR1 kinase accelerated p27Kip1 degradation instead of reducing new protein synthesis, quiescent 3T3 cells were treated with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, for 1 h before incubation with FGF2. Fig. 6B shows that p27Kip1 protein in the cycloheximide-treated cells was reduced 1 h after incubation with FGF2 and then decreased to below the detection limits 6 h after incubation with FGF2. This was significantly faster than that of the cells without exposure to FGF2 or cycloheximide. The results revealed that activation of the FGFR1 kinase accelerates degradation of p27Kip1, and the degradation is independent of new protein synthesis. This suggests that degradation of p27Kip1 is a result of cascade reactions in the existing signaling networks (Fig. 7) rather than a result of changes at the gene expression level.Fig. 7Schematic of the direct regulation of Cdk by the FGFR1 mitogenic signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of FRS2 by the FGFR1 kinase releases Cks1. The freed Cks1 associates with the p27Kip1-Cdk-cyclin complex, induces the formation of the p27Kip1-SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, triggers degradation of p27Kip1, and signals cells to undergo the G1/S transition by releasing and activating the Cdk-cyclin A/E complexes.

However, the interaction has largely been assumed to be fortuitous and not of functional significance in FGF signaling. Here we report that Cks1, a mammalian homologue of p13suc1, associated with the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2. Activation of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase led to tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2, released Cks1 from FRS2, and promoted p27Kip1 degradation. In addition, FRS2 bound to Cks1 via the conserved N-terminal sequence consisting of the PTB and myristoylation domains; deletion of the sequence abrogated the association. Deletion of the myristoylation domain alone also impaired the interaction. The FRS2 myristoylation site is composed of 6 amino acid residues (MGSCCS) located at the N terminus, which affixes FRS2 to the plasma membrane when it is myristoylated. It is likely that myristoylation and the membrane anchorage of FRS2 are important for the three-dimensional structure of the PTB domain to interact with Cks1 and Cks2, although the possibility that the myristoylation domain is a part of the Cks binding site cannot be ruled out. FRS2 utilizes different sets of amino acid residues for interacting with Trk and other receptor tyrosine kinases (9Dhalluin C. Yan S.K. Plotnikova O. Lee W.K. Zeng L. Kuti M. Mujtaba S. Goldfarb P.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17088-17094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Currently, it is unknown how the PTB domain interacts with Cks1, although the data here suggest that the sequence downstream of the PTB domain inhibits the interaction when it is phosphorylated by FGFR1 kinase. Unlike Cks1 that only bound to unphosphorylated FRS2, Cks2 also bound to phosphorylated FRS2. The functional significance of the interaction remains to be determined. p27Kip1 belongs to the Cip/Kip family that negatively regulates Cdk kinase activity and plays a pivotal role in regulating mitogenic responses of cells to extracellular signals. The mRNA level of p27Kip1 is fairly constant during cell cycles, and the cellular level of p27Kip1 proteins is regulated primarily at the posttranslational level through ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis. Cks1 is required for association of p27Kip1 to the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex consisting of S-phase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), Cul-1, and ROC1/Rbx1. The results here show that unphosphorylated FRS2 bound to Cks1; the FGFR phosphorylates FRS2 upon stimulation by the FGF and releases Cks1 from FRS2. Thereafter, the freed Cks1 may induce degradation of p27Kip1 and signal the cells entering mitosis by activating Cdk-cyclin A/E complexes (22Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The results firstly suggest that the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase may transmit mitogenic signals to downstream cascades directly through regulating Cdk-cyclin complexes, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Expression of p27Kip1 is frequently down-regulated at the protein and mRNA levels in tumor cells (28Philipp-Staheli J. Payne S.R. Kemp C.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 148-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the decrease is significantly correlated with malignancy of tumors (35Macri E. Loda M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Fernandez P.L. Hernandez L. Farre X. Campo E. Cardesa A. Pathobiology. 2002; 70: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that p27Kip1 acts as a rheostat rather than as an on-off switch to control growth and neoplasia, since tumor suppression by p27Kip1 is critically dependent on the absolute level of p27Kip1 protein within cells (28Philipp-Staheli J. Payne S.R. Kemp C.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 148-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Unlike epithelial cells from benign prostate tumors and normal prostate that express the FGFR2 isoform, malignant prostate cells often express the nonresident FGFR1 isoform (1McKeehan W.L. Wang F.

Feng S. McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1509-1514PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic appearance of constitutively active FGFR1 kinase in prostate epithelial cells induces prostate hyperplasia and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in transgenic mice (40Jin C.

Prostate. 2004; 58: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, chronic FGFR1-mediated p27Kip1 degradation may play a role in perturbation of prostate tissue homeostasis and tumor promotion. Sequestration of Cks1 by FRS2 and its control by FGFR1 kinase may be of therapeutic value in cancer prevention and treatment. The kinase domains of the four FGFRs share a high similarity in amino acid sequence and elicit similar and redundant regulatory activities in some experimental systems (1McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In other experimental systems, the FGFRs elicit individual isotype-specific and sometimes even opposite regulatory activities (2Wang F. McKeehan W.L. Bradshaw R. Dennis E.

This is in contrast to the ectopic FGFR1 that appears in malignant tumors and promotes proliferation and tumorigenesis (1McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

McKeehan W.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5369-5378PubMed Google Scholar). The resident FGFR2 and ectopic FGFR1 differently phosphorylate FRS2 and activation of the MAP kinase pathway in prostate epithelial cells (2Wang F. McKeehan W.L. Bradshaw R. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 1. Academic/Elsevier Press, New York2003: 265-270Google Scholar, 30Wang F. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2002; 38: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Currently, we do not know whether the FGFR2 also mediates release of Cks1 from FRS2 or whether activation of the MAP kinase pathway affects release of Cks1 from tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 or vice versa in prostate epithelial cells. In summary, here we report that the release of Cks1 from tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 possibly mediates mitogenic signals of the FGFR1 kinase. Determination of whether the four FGFR kinases differ in releasing Cks1 from FRS2 by phosphorylation and whether the release is regulated by other signaling pathways will shed light on understanding the mechanism underpinning the FGF signaling pathway.

The contribution of procollagen VII to the mechanical stability of the dermal-epidermal junction depends on the ability of single molecules to self-assemble into highly ordered anchoring fibrils. The self-assembly of collagen VII includes an enzymatic cleavage of procollagen to collagen, and it depends on the binding between specific regions of the interacting molecules (18Colombo M.

By employing genetically modified recombinant procollagen VII variants, we have demonstrated previously that formation of collagen VII-collagen VII dimers depends on the binding of an intact NC2 domain with the region encompassing Cys-2634, and we postulated that this binding depends on an electrostatic interaction (18Colombo M.

The importance of a correct structure of the anchoring fibrils for the integrity of the cutaneous basement membrane zone is demonstrated by the occurrence of pathological changes within the dermal-epidermal junction resulting from mutations in the COL7A1 gene encoding human procollagen VII. Over 300 distinct mutations in COL7A1 have been identified in a group of heritable blistering diseases, collectively known as the dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), which can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (DDEB) or an autosomal recessive (RDEB) pattern (23Pulkkinen L.

In contrast, the G2623C substitution identified in a patient with DDEB led to significant changes in morphology of anchoring fibrils (27Christiano A.M. Lee J.Y. Chen W.J. LaForgia S. Uitto J. Hum.

To study how the mutations occurring in the region of procollagen VII encompassing Cys-2634 influence intermolecular interactions, we employed recombinant mini-procollagen VII (mProVII) variants in which mutations found in DEB patients were introduced. The G2575R, R2622Q, and G2623C mProVII mutants were engineered and employed in binding studies by using an optical biosensor. Results indicate that mutations in the region encompassing Cys-2634 change the structure and physicochemical properties of sites critical for the collagen VII-collagen VII interaction, thereby altering the kinetics of assembly or completely precluding dimer formation. DNA Constructs Encoding mProVII Mutants—Procollagen VII mutants were engineered by introducing single base substitutions into cDNA encoding mini mouse procollagen VII (mProVII), as described in detail by Colombo et al. (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Deleting the central region of procollagen VII enabled site-directed mutagenesis, which was not possible to achieve with the use of the full-length cDNA, which is characterized by a high content of cytosine and guanine, a feature that makes gene engineering difficult. The mutations in codons corresponding to those encoding amino acid residues 2575, 2622, and 2623 of the human procollagen VII were generated using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The G2575R mutant was created by changing the -GGA- codon for glycine to the -AGA- codon for arginine. The R2622Q mutant was created by changing the -AGG- codon for arginine to the -CAG- codon for glutamine. The G2623C mutant was created by changing the -GGC- codon for glycine to the -TGC- codon for cysteine. Fidelity of mutation sites in DNA constructs was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Transfection of Mammalian Cells and Selection of mProVII-positive Clones—DNA constructs cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen), which contains a G418 resistance gene and the cytomegalovirus promoter, were used to transfect human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (ATCC, CRL-1573) by use of the calcium phosphate precipitation method (ProFection™, Promega). The G418-resistant clones were collected and analyzed independently for secretion of the mProVII mutants, as described by Colombo et al. (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, the clones were grown in 6-well cell culture plates, and upon reaching confluence the cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium supplemented with l-ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium salt n-hydrate (Wako Inc., Japan) at a concentration of 40 μg/ml. Proteins secreted into the media were precipitated with 5% polyethylene glycol (Mr 8000; Sigma), and pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. Proteins were then analyzed by electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The presence of mProVII variants in the analyzed samples was determined by Western blot analysis with the polyclonal anti-NC1 antibody (NC1AF7) and secondary anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bands corresponding to the procollagen VII α1 chains were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences). Purification of mProVII Variants—Cells expressing mProVII mutants were grown in serum-free medium supplemented with l-ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium salt n-hydrate. After 24 h, cell culture media were collected, filtered through a 1.6-μm glass-fiber filter (Millipore) to remove cell debris, and supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and 1 mmp-aminobenzamidine. On average, 3 liters of culture media were collected for 7 consecutive days. Subsequently, proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 300 mg/ml of ammonium sulfate. mProVII mutants were purified by ion exchange chromatography as described (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J.

In brief, the precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed against chromatography loading buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmp-aminobenzamidine). Following dialysis, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min and discarded, and the supernatant was passed over a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 m NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Peak fractions were combined and concentrated 25-fold by ultrafiltration (YM-100, Millipore). To separate low molecular weight proteins coeluted from the Q-Sepharose column in some preparations, the concentrated samples were further purified by size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography. The samples were run at 1 ml/min through a size exclusion column (G3000SW, 2.15 × 60 cm, Tosohaas, Japan) connected to a high pressure liquid chromatography system equipped with a UV detector and fraction collector (Pro Star™, Varian, Inc.). Peak fractions containing purified mutant mProVII were collected and analyzed by PAGE. Transmission Electron Microscopy of mProVII Molecules—For rotary shadowing, the recombinant mProVII mutants were dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Rotary shadowing was done as described previously (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Procollagen molecules were examined with the Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Inc.). Photographs were taken at magnification ×30,000 or ×40,000. Biosensor Assays of Kinetics of Homotypic and Heterotypic Binding between mProVII Variants—Intermolecular interaction assays were carried out using an optical biosensor (Iasys; Affinity Sensors, UK). To bind covalently purified mProVII variants, described as acceptors, onto the surface of a sensor, carboxylate groups present on the surface were activated by injection of a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 mN-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 mN-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Pierce). Recombinant mProVII at concentration of 100 μg/ml dissolved in PBS was then allowed to bind to the activated surface until a response plateau was reached. Because of the same molecular mass of analyzed mProVII variants, similar responses of the instrument indicated the same amount of immobilized acceptors. The residual active groups were blocked by an injection of 200 μl of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by the injection of 200 μl of 1% solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in PBS. Excess BSA was removed by washing the cuvette with PBS containing 0.05% of Tween 20 (PBST), followed by three consecutive washes with 10 mm HCl. After re-equilibration with PBST, the cuvettes were ready for the binding assays. In addition, a control cuvette with immobilized BSA was prepared by using the same procedure. The following homotypic and heterotypic interactions were analyzed separately: (i) between wild type mProVII (WTmProVII) molecules; (ii) between G2575R mutant molecules; (iii) between R2622Q mutant molecules; (iv) between G2623C mutant molecules; and (v) between WTmProVII and each of the G2575R, R2622Q, or G2623G mutant molecules. Cuvettes with immobilized collagens were primed with PBST at 25 °C for 15 min. A 200-μl sample containing free mProVII dissolved in PBST was added to the cuvette, and then the association phase was recorded. Subsequently, the sample was removed; analyte-free PBST was added to the cuvette, and the dissociation phase was recorded. After each assay, the surface of the cuvette was regenerated by washing with 10 mm HCl, followed by equilibration with PBST. During each regeneration cycle, attention was paid to completely remove surface-bound analyte, and the washing continued until a response equal to a base-line value was reached. For binding assays, free mProVII variants were added at concentrations ranging from 5.14 × 10-9 to 1.11 × 10-7m. Data from the biosensor were analyzed by the global fitting method described by Myszka and Morton (31Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For each assay, the kon and koff values were obtained, and the Kd values were calculated from a ratio of koff/kon. Subsequently, the Ka values were derived as the inverse of Kd. Biotinylation of Recombinant mProVII Variants—To analyze effects of mutations on formation of assemblies formed from PCP-processed mProVII variants, we employed solid-state binding assays utilizing biotinylated mProVII molecules as described (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Purified mProVII variants were biotinylated using sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-biotin, Pierce) (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To analyze biotinylated proteins, samples containing 0.5 μg of procollagen VII variants were electrophoresed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% biotin-free non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad), and dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Next, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with avidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence. Cleavage of mProVII Variants with PCP—To study the effects of mutations on formation of homotypic and heterotypic assemblies, mProVII variants were enzymatically cleaved with recombinant human PCP (BMP-1/PCP, R & D Systems, Inc.). For test cleavage with PCP, 1 μg of the mProVII variants in 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 10 mm CaCl2 was incubated at 30 °C with 0.3 units of PCP. In addition, by employing similar experimental conditions, the activity of PCP was tested with recombinant procollagen II as a substrate (32Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Products of enzymatic cleavage were analyzed by PAGE in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Solid-state Assays of Interaction between PCP-processed mProVII Variants—Because of the high sensitivity of biosensors assays, analysis of the interaction between macromolecules in multicomponent systems in which many binding events are taking place at the same time is complex. Because cleavage of procollagen VII with PCP and formation of the collagen VII-collagen VII dimers represent such a complex system, involving binding of PCP to the substrate, cleavage of NC2, and formation of a dimer, employing a biosensor to monitor these processes generates data that are difficult to interpret. Moreover, biosensor assays are designed to study binding kinetics, which require various concentrations of a free interactant. Although binding assays without cleavage of a surface-bound interactant with PCP allow for multiple use of the same cuvette, its cleavage with PCP would render such a cuvette “single use.” Finally, by taking into consideration the fact that experiments with use of PCP are not aimed at kinetics studies, we concluded that there would be no advantage in employing a biosensor to study the effects of selected mutations on assembly of PCP-generated collagen VII variants. Consequently, we employed biotinylated procollagen VII variants in solid-state binding assays, as described previously (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The following homotypic and heterotypic interactions were studied: (i) between WTmProVII molecules; (ii) between G2575R mutant molecules; (iii) between R2622Q mutant molecules; (iv) between G2623C mutant molecules; and (v) between WTmProVII and each of the G25275R, R2622Q, or G2623G mutant molecules. To study these interactions, we employed a modified experimental system utilizing immobilized nonbiotinylated mProVII acceptors and free biotinylated mProVII interactants (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, wells of the 8-well plastic strips (Nalge Nunc) were coated with nonbiotinylated mProVII variants at a concentration 10 μg/ml for 18 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the wells were washed with PBST and blocked with 5% blotting-grade biotin-free and fat-free dry milk (Bio-Rad) followed by a wash with 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Equal binding of different mProVII variants to plastic wells was confirmed as described (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Biotinylated samples in 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm ZnCl2 were added to wells at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. The samples were preincubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by an addition of 0.3 unit of PCP/μg of mProVII and incubation at 30 °C for 18 h. After incubation, the excess nonbound biotinylated procollagens was washed out with 0.5 m CH3COOH followed by high stringency PBST, in which the NaCl concentration was increased to 0.5 m. Next, the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (ImmunoPure™ AP-streptavidin, Pierce) diluted 1:20,000 in PBST. Subsequently, wells were washed extensively with PBST and followed by three washes with 0.05 m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. To detect the nonbiotinylated collagen VII-biotinylated collagen VII-AP-streptavidin complexes, 3 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer was used as a substrate for AP. Relative amounts of bound biotinylated collagens were determined colorimetrically at 405 nm using a plate reader (Benchmark, Bio-Rad). The following controls were used: (i) samples prepared in a similar way but without biotinylated procollagen VII variants; (ii) samples with biotinylated variants but without AP-streptavidin; (iii) samples without PCP; (iv) wells coated only with 5% blotting-grade dry milk; and (v) wells coated with PCP. In all experiments, data were collected from three independent experiments and evaluated by employing a computer program (GraphPad Prizm program; GraphPad Software Inc.). Computer Analysis of the Regions Adjacent to Mutation Sites—To determine structural and physicochemical properties of the regions surrounding Arg-2575, Gln-2622, and Cys-2623 mutation sites and the ability of the Cys-2623 residues in the G2623C mutant to form intramolecular disulfide bonds, computer analysis of these regions was performed by employing a modeling program (Sybyl 6.9; Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) installed on an Octane computer station (Silicon Graphics, Inc.). The 36-amino acid regions spanning the mutation sites were generated and analyzed as described (18Colombo M. Brittingham R.J. Klement J.F. Majsterek I. Birk D.E. Uitto J. Fertala A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The electron density surface, which represents an isosurface of electron densities, was calculated (33Vijayakumar M. Vaidehi N. Gopinathan M.S. Phys. Rev. A. 1989; 40: 6834-6851Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the electrostatic potential (expressed as kcal/mol·e) and lipophilicity potential of the surfaces were then evaluated.

https://openalex.org/W2066600886,"The active polymerase complex of Borna disease virus is composed of the viral proteins N, P, and L. The viral X (negative regulatory factor) protein acts as a regulator of polymerase activity. Interactions of P with N and X were previously studied, but interactions with L were poorly defined. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system, we observed that L specifically interacts with P but not with N, X, or itself. Mapping of the L-binding domain in the P molecule revealed that it overlaps with two adjacent domains required for multimerization and interaction with N. Competition experiments showed that the interaction between L and P was inefficient when N was present, indicating that L may preferentially interact with free P in infected cells. Interestingly, a multimerization-defective P mutant maintained the ability to interact with L, N, and X but failed to support reporter gene expression from an artificial Borna disease virus minigenome. Furthermore, dominant negative effects on minigenome activity were only observed when P mutants with an intact multimerization domain were used, suggesting that P multimers, rather than monomers, exhibit biological activity. P mutants lacking functional interaction domains for L or N still formed complexes with these viral proteins when wild-type P was available as a bridging molecule, indicating that P multimers have the potential to act as scaffolds on which the RNA polymerase complex is assembled.

The active transcription and replication complex of non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses, termed ribonucleoprotein complex (1Murphy M.F. Lazzarini R.A. Cell. 1974; 3: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), consists of the viral polymerase (L), 1The abbreviations used are: L, viral polymerase; P, phosphoprotein; N, nucleoprotein; M, matrix protein; G, glycoprotein; X, negative regulatory factor; BDV, Borna disease virus; ORF, open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: L, viral polymerase; P, phosphoprotein; N, nucleoprotein; M, matrix protein; G, glycoprotein; X, negative regulatory factor; BDV, Borna disease virus; ORF, open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type. the phosphoprotein (P), the nucleoprotein (N), and the viral RNA (2Pattnaik A.K. Ball L.A. LeGrone A.W. Wertz G.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). P is a co-transcriptional factor of L, whereas N encapsidates the viral genome to form N·RNA complexes (3Horikami S.M. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Moyer S.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Sendai virus, a prototype paramyxovirus, it was shown that P acts as a scaffold protein, which brings L into close proximity to the N·RNA complex (4Curran J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4274-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus allowing RNA synthesis. In the absence of P, the N·RNA complexes are not recognized by L (5Horikami S.M. Moyer S.A. Virology. 1995; 211: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The viral P protein exerts this scaffolding function by employing independent binding sites for L and the N·RNA complex (6Curran J. Pelet T. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1994; 202: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). P of Sendai virus contains an additional but distinct binding domain for free N (not bound to viral RNA) (7Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a domain required for multimer formation (8Curran J. Boeck R. Lin-Marq N. Lupas A. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1995; 214: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Complex formation between P and free N prevents aggregation of N (7Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligomerization is an essential prerequisite for Sendai virus P function in viral transcription and replication (4Curran J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4274-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of oligomeric P is unclear. It is assumed that oligomer formation facilitates movement of P (and most likely of the complete polymerase complex) on the RNA template, thereby maintaining polymerase processivity (4Curran J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4274-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A requirement of P oligomers for viral RNA synthesis was also described for P proteins of other viruses of the order Mononegavirales, including vesicular stomatitis virus (10Gao Y. Lenard J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7718-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gao Y. Lenard J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (12De B.P. Hoffman M.A. Choudhary S. Huntley C.C. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5886-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the P protein of Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus type 3, a defined coiled coil region is sufficient for oligomer formation (8Curran J. Boeck R. Lin-Marq N. Lupas A. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1995; 214: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Choudhary S.K. Malur A.G. Huo Y. De B.P. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 2002; 302: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By contrast, vesicular stomatitis virus P oligomerization only occurs prior to phosphorylation of two amino acid residues in the N-terminal acidic region (11Gao Y. Lenard J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation-negative vesicular stomatitis virus P mutants are fully active in replication but defective in transcription (14Pattnaik A.K. Hwang L. Li T. Englund N. Mathur M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8167-8175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the viral transcriptase and replicase are two distinct entities with different subunit composition.BDV is the prototype member of the family Bornaviridae in the order Mononegavirales. It replicates in the nucleus of infected cells (15Briese T. de la Torre J.C. Lewis A. Ludwig H. Lipkin W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11486-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 16Cubitt B. de la Torre J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and uses alternative splicing for maturation of viral transcripts (17Schneider P.A. Schneemann A. Lipkin W.I. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5007-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schneemann A. Schneider P.A. Kim S. Lipkin W.I. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6514-6522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BDV persistently infects the central nervous systems of a broad range of warm-blooded animals (19Staeheli P. Sauder C. Hausmann J. Ehrensberger F. Schwemmle M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2123-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Dependent on host and age, BDV infection can result in symptomless viral persistence or severe immune-mediated neurological disease (20de la Torre J.C. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: S241-S247Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Seroepidemiological surveys suggest that BDV or a related virus can infect humans (21Billich C. Sauder C. Frank R. Herzog S. Bechter K. Takahashi K. Peters H. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. Biol. Psychiatry. 2002; 51: 979-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although the association with specific diseases awaits further clarification. The viral genome includes six open reading frames (ORFs) encoding N, X, P, matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and L (22Briese T. Schneemann A. Lewis A.J. Park Y.S. Kim S. Ludwig H. Lipkin W.I.

Virology. 1995; 210: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Similar to other members of the family Mononegavirales, BDV-P can form oligomers and is able to interact with N and L (24Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Walker M.P. Jordan I. Briese T. Fischer N. Lipkin W.I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4425-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). BDV-P also interacts with the viral X (negative regulatory factor) protein (24Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The domains mediating the interactions with N and X were mapped, whereas the domain of P required for the interaction with L was unknown. Functional analysis of the BDV polymerase complex based on artificial minigenomes demonstrated that N, P, and L are sufficient for viral replication and transcription and that X has a negative regulatory function on polymerase activity (26Perez M.

Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It was further observed that viral RNA synthesis was only efficient when the N to P ratio was ∼10:1 (26Perez M. Sanchez A. Cubitt B. Rosario D. de la Torre J.C. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicating that the P protein is a key regulator of polymerase activity.In analogy to P proteins of other Mononegavirales, we hypothesized that the ability of BDV-P to function as a transcriptional cofactor is dependent on oligomer formation. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system to detect protein-protein interactions and a viral minireplicon assay to study functional aspects of the BDV polymerase, we mapped the L-binding site on P and found that it overlaps with the domains for interaction with N and itself. We further showed that the viral negative regulatory factor X can interact with P·L and P·N complexes, and we provide evidence that P multimers are of critical importance for polymerase activity. Based on these various results, we suggest that P multimers act as central regulatory elements of assembly and activity of the polymerase complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructions—Primer sequences used in PCR to clone wild-type and mutant BDV sequences into the various vectors are available on request. PCR was performed with proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) and standard reaction conditions in the GeneAmp PCR cycler 9600 (Applied Biosystems). The integrity of all PCR-derived DNA fragments was verified by sequencing.To assemble cDNAs encoding VP16/L and Gal4/L fusion proteins in the pCA expression vector, the VP16 transactivation domain and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain were amplified from pVP16/P and pGal4/P (24Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using primer pairs VP16(+, EcoRI) and VP16(–, NotI) or Gal4(+, EcoRI) and Gal4(–, NotI). The PCR fragments were EcoRI/NotI-digested and inserted together with the NotI/DraIII fragment (∼750 bp) excised from pCA-FLAGL (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) into EcoRI/DraIII-opened pCA-FLAGL plasmid, resulting in expression constructs pCA-VP16/L and pCA-Gal4/L. To generate vectors pCA-VP16/P and pCA-VP16/X, the L ORF was excised from pCA-VP16/L by NotI/HindIII digestion and replaced with NotI/HindIII fragments containing the P and X ORFs derived from vectors pCA-FLAGP and pCA-FLAGX, respectively. Due to the presence of additional HindIII sites, the N ORF had to be amplified from vector pCA-N (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using primer pair N(+, NotI) and N(–, XbaI). After NotI/XbaI digestion, the PCR product was ligated into NotI/HindIII-opened pCA-VP16/L together with the NheI/HindIII fragment excised from modified pCA vector (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ligation of these fragments was possible because NheI and XbaI create identical nucleotide overhangs.The ORFs encoding C-terminally truncated forms of P were amplified from template pCA-P (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using primer P(+, NotI) in combination with either of the primers P135(–, XbaI), P172(–, XbaI), P183(–, XbaI) and P197(–, XbaI), which all insert a stop codon and an XbaI restriction site directly downstream of the indicated C-terminal residue. The cDNA encoding N-terminally truncated protein P56–201 (P′) was amplified using primer pair P56(+, NotI) and P201(–, XbaI). The PCR fragments were NotI/XbaI-digested and cloned together with the pCA-derived NheI/HindIII fragment into NotI/HindIII-opened pCA-N and pCA-FLAGN (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) vectors, respectively, resulting in pCA expression vectors encoding either the untagged or the FLAG-tagged version of these P deletion mutants.To generate the various pGal4/P constructs, the cDNAs encoding C-terminally truncated P proteins were reamplified from the corresponding pCA vectors using primer P(+, BamHI), which inserts a BamHI site upstream of the P initiation codon, and primer pCA(–, KpnI), which hybridizes to a pCA sequence located downstream of the open reading frame. The cDNAs encoding N-terminally truncated P proteins were amplified from pCA-P using primers P56(+, BamHI), P94(+, BamHI), P135(+, BamHI), P155(+, BamHI), and P172(+, BamHI), which all insert a BamHI restriction site and an initiation codon directly upstream of the indicated N-terminal residue, in combination with primer pCA(–, KpnI). The PCR fragments were BamHI/KpnI-digested and ligated into BamHI/KpnI-opened pGal4/N plasmid (24Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), thereby replacing the N ORF with the different P ORFs.Point mutations inserting two glycine residues in positions 141 and 148 of BDV-P were introduced into pGal4/P and pGal4/P1–197 by mutagenesis PCR using complementary primers PLM2G(+) and PLM2G(–) and the Turbo-Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), resulting in constructs pGal4/PLM2G and pGal4/PLM2G/197. To subclone PLM2G and PLM2G/197 into pCA and pCA-FLAG vectors, their ORFs were amplified from pGal4/PLM2G using primer P(+, NotI) in combination with either primer P197(–, XbaI) or primer P201(–, XbaI). The resulting PCR fragments were NotI/XbaI-digested and ligated together with the pCA NheI/HindIII fragment into NotI/HindIII-opened pCA-N and pCA-FLAGN (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) vectors, respectively.Cells and Transfections—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Unmodified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 293T cells (human embryonic kidney) and with 10% fetal calf serum plus 1.0 mg/ml G418 for BSR-T7 cells (baby hamster kidney) stably expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (28Buchholz U.J. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere.Semiconfluent layers of 293T and BSR-T7 cells were grown in 15-mm (24-well) or 25-mm (12-well) dishes before transfection with the various plasmids using Metafectene (Biontex, Munich, Germany). DNA dilutions were prepared in 25 μl of DMEM for the transfection of the 15-mm dishes and in 50 μl of DMEM for the transfection of the 25-mm dishes. The DNA preparations were subsequently mixed with 25 μl of DMEM containing 2.5 μl of Metafectene and 50 μl of DMEM containing 5 μl of Metafectene, respectively. The transfection solutions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then applied directly to the cell supernatants.Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Semiconfluent 293T cells in 24-well dishes were transfected with the indicated plasmids as described above. Twenty-four h post-transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase expression were analyzed using the dual luciferase kit from Promega, basically as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega) and incubated for 15 min on a shaking table. Ten μl of the cellular extract were mixed with 50 μl of ice-cold firefly luciferase substrate (Promega), and the emitted photons were measured as relative light units for 10 s in a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold). Then 50 μl of ice-cold stop and glow Renilla luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to the mixture, and the Renilla luciferase-mediated light emission was measured again for 10 s in the LB9501 luminometer.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Semiconfluent 293T cells in 25-mm dishes were transfected with the indicated amount of plasmids as described above. Twenty-four h post-transfection, the cells were washed in 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate) supplemented with 8 μl of a 25× stock of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 0.4 μl of Benzonase (Merck). The tubes were incubated for 30 min on ice and vortexed every 10 min to allow for complete lysis of the cells. The supernatant was clarified and transferred to a fresh tube. After addition of 0.4 μg of M2 monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG tag (Sigma), the cellular extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h under continuous rotation before 50 μl of washed protein A-coated Sepharose beads (Bio-Rad) were added and incubation was continued for another 1.5 h. Thereafter, the beads were sedimented by quick centrifugation, and the supernatant was replaced by 500 μl of washing buffer 1 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) followed by 5 min of incubation at 4 °C under continuous rotation. This washing step was repeated twice using washing buffer 2 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for the second and washing buffer 3 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for the third washing step. Finally, all liquid was carefully removed and bound protein complexes were released by boiling in 30 μl of Laemmli gel loading buffer (64.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS) supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Eluted proteins were size-fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Milipore) for Western blot analysis. The membrane was treated in blocking solution (Genosys) supplemented with 0.05 g/ml of saccharose and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a goat anti-HA polyclonal antiserum (Sant Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After intense washing, the blot was incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of a peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-goat polyclonal antiserum (Dianova) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, bound enzymatic activity was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL+) from Amersham Biosciences.Gel Filtration—Semiconfluent 293T cells in 75-mm dishes were transfected with 12 μg of pCA-P or pCA-PLM2G using Metafectene (Biontex) as described above. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the plates and centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 rpm at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 600 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mix (Roche)). After 10 min of incubation, 200 μl of buffer B (50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 1.26 m K-acetate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mix) were added to the suspension. Disruption of the cell nuclei was achieved by homogenization (20 strokes) using a tight fitting glass douncer. The resulting cell extract was subjected to centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 rpm to remove cell debris. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g in a TLA-120.2 fixed angle rotor, and 200 μl of this supernatant were loaded onto a Superose 12 HR10/30 column (Pharmacia Corporation) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Minireplicon Assay—BSR-T7 cells in 25-mm dishes were transfected with the indicated plasmids as described above. After overnight incubation, the transfection solution was removed from the BSR-T7 cells, fresh medium was added, and the incubation was continued. Three days post-transfection, the cells were lysed, and CAT and luciferase expression were quantified as described previously (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of the L-binding Domain in BDV-P by Mammalian Two-hybrid Analysis—To study the interaction of BDV-L with itself and with other viral proteins in the mammalian two-hybrid assay (29Takacs A.M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10375-10379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we generated expression constructs pCA-VP16/L and pCA-Gal4/L that code for the complete L protein of BDV fused at the N terminus to either the transactivation domain of VP16 or the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. Semiconfluent 293T cells were co-transfected with pCA-VP16/L and either pGal4/N, pGal4/P, pGal4/X (24Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), or pCA-Gal4/L, respectively. The transfection mixtures further contained two different reporter constructs, one containing a Gal4 promoter-controlled firefly luciferase gene and one containing a constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase gene. Firefly luciferase activity (which indicates protein-protein interaction) was normalized for transfection efficacy by taking the Renilla luciferase activity into account. Expression of VP16/L together with Gal4/P resulted in >200-fold increased luciferase activity over the Gal4/MxA negative control (Fig. 1A). No enhanced luciferase expression was detected when VP16/L was expressed with Gal4/N, Gal4/X, Gal4/L, or the Gal4/MxA negative control (Fig. 1A), indicating specific interaction between the viral L and P proteins. BDV-L still interacted exclusively with BDV-P when the VP16 and Gal4 fusion partners were swapped (data not shown).Unmodified N and X proteins were expressed together with VP16/L and GAL4/P to determine whether their presence would interfere with the L-P interaction. The X interaction domain is located between P residues 72 and 87 (30Kobayashi T. Zhang G. Lee B.J. Baba S. Yamashita M. Kamitani W. Yanai H. Tomonaga K. Ikuta K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8099-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the N interaction domain includes P residues 197–201 (24Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of pCA-N (encoding BDV-N) reduced luciferase activity some 5-fold (Fig. 1B). By contrast, co-transfection of pCA-X (encoding BDV-X) had no detectable impact on the L-P interaction (Fig. 1B). These data indicated that the domain of P required for interaction with L overlapped at least partially with the N but not with the X interaction domain.Because X acts as regulator of BDV transcription and replication (27Schneider U. Naegele M. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11781-11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we asked whether P would mediate the association of X with L and N. To address this question, we determined whether unmodified wild-type P could serve as a bridging molecule in the mammalian two-hybrid assay that brings Gal4/X into physical contact with either VP16/L or VP16/N (see schematics included in Fig. 1, C and D). In the presence of unmodified wild-type P, strongly enhanced luciferase activity was observed (Fig. 1, C and D) indicating that the formation of X·P·L and X·P·N complexes was induced.To map the domain in P responsible for binding to BDV-L, we generated a series of constructs in which various Nor C-terminally truncated P proteins were fused to Gal4 (Fig. 2A). Truncations were designed to selectively remove one or more of the previously defined domains on BDV-P known to mediate interaction with the viral proteins N, X, and P (24Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Selective elimination of parts of the N-binding domain (Gal4/P1–197) or of the complete X-binding domain (Gal4/P94–201) did not significantly alter the ability of the resulting P fusion proteins to interact with VP16/L (Fig. 2B). In contrast, elimination of the P oligomerization domain (Gal4/P1–135 and Gal4/P172–201) abolished the interaction with VP16/L almost completely, suggesting that this region contains essential sequences for interaction with L. The Gal4/P1–172 fusion protein did not interact with VP16/L, whereas Gal4/P1–183 did (Fig. 2B), indicating that P residues 172–183 (which are not required for P oligomerization) are important for the interaction with L. Because Gal4/P135–201 (but not Gal4/P155–201) interacted with VP16/L (Fig. 2B), amino acid positions 135 and 183 determine the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the L interaction domain on BDV-P, as indicated in Fig. 2A.Fig. 2Identification of the domain in BDV-P responsible for interaction with L. A, schematic linear representation of P showing the previously defined domains responsible for direct interaction with BDV-N, -P, -X (gray boxes). The translation initiation site of a naturally occurring N-terminally truncated BDV-P isoform (P56–201) is indicated. The horizontal black bar indicates the location of the newly identified L interaction domain. Note that the N-terminal boundary of the N interaction domain is not mapped. B, mammalian two-hybrid analysis of the VP16/L interaction with N- and C-terminally truncated P mutants fused to the Gal4-binding domain. Semiconfluent 293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.4 μg of pCA-VP16/L, 0.2 μg of the indicated pGal4 constructs, 0.2 μg of pluc and 0.05 μg of pRL-SV40. All transfection mixtures were prepared as duplicates and used to transfect two wells in parallel. One day post-transfection the cells were lysed and analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase expression using the dual luciferase kit. Values were normalized to the MxA Renilla value as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Shown are the normalized firefly luciferase values. The value of wild-type BDV-P was set to 100%.

To determine whether P monomers can interact with other viral proteins, we mutated a leucine zipper motif in the oligomerization domain of P (Fig. 3A) by inserting two point mutations that replaced leucine 141 and methionine 148 by glycine residues. The resulting construct encoding PLM2G was further engineered to encode a variant with an N-"

The workshop, Human Genome Variation and 'Race', and this special issue of Nature Genetics were proposed by scientists at Howard University and financially supported by the Genome Programs of the US Department of Energy, through its Office of Science; the Irving Harris Foundation; the National Institutes of Health, through the National Human Genome Research Institute; and Howard University. As summarized by Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the workshop focused on several key questions: does the current body of scientific information say about the connections among race, ethnicity, genetics and health? What remains unknown? What additional research is needed? How can this information be applied to benefit human health? How might this information be applied in nonmedical settings? How can we adopt policies that will achieve beneficial societal outcomes?

https://openalex.org/W2054288184,"F plasmid TraM, an autoregulatory homotetramer, is essential for F plasmid bacterial conjugative transfer, one of the major mechanisms for horizontal gene dissemination. TraM cooperatively binds to three sites (sbmA, -B, and -C) near the origin of transfer in the F plasmid. To examine whether or not tetramerization of TraM is required for autoregulation and F conjugation, we used a two-plasmid system to screen for autoregulation-defective traM mutants generated by random PCR mutagenesis. A total of 72 missense mutations in TraM affecting autoregulation were selected, all of which also resulted in a loss of TraM function during F conjugation. Mutational analysis of TraM defined three regions important for F conjugation, including residues 3–10 (region I), 31–53 (region II), and 80–121 (region III); in addition, residues 3–47 were also important for the immunoreactivity of TraM. Biochemical analysis of mutant proteins indicated that region I defined a DNA binding domain that was not involved in tetramerization, whereas regions II and III were important for both tetramerization and efficient DNA binding. Mutations in region III affected the cooperativity of binding of TraM to sbmA, -B, and -C. Our results suggest that tetramerization is important for specific DNA binding, which, in turn, is essential for traM autoregulation and F conjugation. These findings support the hypothesis that TraM functions as a “signaling” factor that triggers DNA transport during F conjugation.

These findings support the hypothesis that TraM functions as a “signaling” factor that triggers DNA transport during F conjugation. Bacterial conjugation is a major mechanism for horizontal gene transfer and is defined as the unidirectional transfer of single-stranded DNA from a donor to a recipient cell. This process occurs in response to an uncharacterized mating signal generated by mating pair formation initiated by intimate cell-to-cell contact (1Willetts N.S. Wilkins B. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 24-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Conjugation requires an origin of transfer (oriT) in cis to the transferred DNA that contains a nic site as well as multiple binding sites for DNA-binding proteins that together form the relaxosome. Cleavage and re-ligation at the nic site by TraI, the relaxase, is in equilibrium until a stable mating pair has formed, which triggers DNA unwinding and transport between cells (2Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Sherman J.A. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26220-26226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The F plasmid is the paradigm for a large group of conjugative plasmids in the IncF incompatibility complex that carries genes important for human and veterinary medicine, such as antibiotic resistance and toxin production (4Ippen-Ihler K.A. Skurray R.A. Bacterial Conjugation. Clewell, D. B. Plenum Publishing, New York1993: 23-52Crossref Google Scholar). The genes responsible for F conjugation are located in the 33-kb F major transfer (tra) region with traM and traJ upstream of the major tra operon (traY to traI) (5Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F plasmid TraM, which is essential for F conjugation, is not required for pilus synthesis, mating pair formation, or nicking at oriT in vivo (1Willetts N.S. Wilkins B. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 24-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Achtman M. Willetts N. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 831-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kingsman A. Willetts N. J. Mol.

Consequently, TraM is thought to signal that donor and recipient cell contact has been made, thereby activating DNA transfer (1Willetts N.S. Wilkins B. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 24-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TraM (127 aa, 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid(s); PtraM, the traM promoters; oriT, origin of transfer; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 14.5 kDa) is a cytoplasmic protein that cooperatively binds to three sites (sbmA, -B, and -C) near oriT in the F plasmid (9Di Laurenzio L.

Deletion of sbmA and sbmB from an oriT fragment cloned into a multicopy plasmid decreases conjugative transfer by 100-fold, whereas removal of sbmC decreases transfer by an additional 100-fold (12Fu Y.H. Tsai M.M. Luo Y.N. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TraM forms tetramers in solution; the oligomerization equilibrium between tetramers and monomers can be described as two-state, suggesting that other oligomerization intermediates are not detectable (13Miller D.L. Schildbach J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10400-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This is consistent with evidence that R1 TraM binds to DNA as a tetramer (14Verdino P. Keller W. Strohmaier H. Bischof K. Lindner H. Koraimann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37421-37428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but argues against a model in which TraM initially binds to DNA as a dimer (10Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16705-16711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis has indicated that a TraM fragment of aa residues 2–55 forms dimers, whereas a TraM fragment consisting of the C-terminal 70 aa (58–127) residues forms tetramers (13Miller D.L. Schildbach J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10400-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), suggesting that both regions are involved in TraM oligomerization. The N-terminal region of TraM is important for specific DNA binding and is required for traM autoregulation and F conjugation (13Miller D.L. Schildbach J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10400-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Schwab M. Reisenzein H. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, the role of the C-terminal region remains ambiguous. The importance of TraM tetramerization for autoregulation and F conjugation is unclear; similarly, the structural domains of TraM responsible for the specificity and cooperativity of DNA binding are unknown. A preliminary mutational analysis of TraM has shown that a missense mutation in either the C- or N-terminal regions can affect TraM in both autoregulation and F conjugation (16Lu J. Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this work, 76 point mutations in traM were characterized for their effect on autoregulation and F conjugation; selected mutants were also characterized for their immunoreactivity, oligomerization, and DNA binding specificity. The results suggest that oligomerization is crucial for TraM function in DNA binding that, in turn, is essential for autoregulation and F conjugation. Growth Media and Bacterial Strains—Cells were grown in LB (Luria-Bertani) broth or on LB solid medium containing appropriate antibiotics or other supplements (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibiotics were used at the following final concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; kanamycin, 25 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 100 μg/ml; nalidixic acid, 40 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml. X-gal was used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. The following Escherichia coli strains were used: XK1200 (F– ΔlacU124 Δ(nadA gal attλ bio) gyrA (Nalr) (18Moore D. Wu J.H. Kathir P. Hamilton C.M. Ippen-Ihler K. J.

DNA Manipulation, PCR, DNA Sequencing, and Sequence Analysis—DNA purification, manipulation, and PCR reactions followed standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or protocols from the manufacturers. Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used for all PCR reactions except for random PCR mutagenesis that used Taq DNA polymerase. Miniprep and Gel Extraction kits (Qiagen) were used for plasmid purification and extraction of DNA fragments from agarose gels, respectively. DNA sequencing was performed using the Amersham Biosciences DY-Enamic™ ET terminator cycle sequencing kit and an Applied Biosystems 373-S DNA Sequencer with XL upgrade. DNA and protein sequences were compiled and analyzed using Genetool® and Peptool® software. Plasmids, Oligonucleotides, and Plasmid Construction—Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA synthesizer in the Department of Biological Sciences. Plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this work are listed in Table I. The 0.7-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragments of the PCR products generated by random PCR mutagenesis of traM (see below) were ligated to a 2.5-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pRFM200, resulting in pRFM200 derivatives named after the corresponding traM mutations. The 0.7-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragments containing wild type or mutated traM from pRFM200 or its derivatives were cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pBluescript KS+, resulting in pJLM400 or pJLM400 derivatives, respectively. To reduce TraM expression from pJLM400 or its derivatives, glucose was added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 0.4% (w/v). A 0.7-kb BstBI-KpnI fragment from pRFM200, K31E, or I109T was used to replace the 0.5-kb BstBI-KpnI fragment in pLDLF007, resulting in pJLM102, pJLM103, or pJLM104, respectively.Table IBacterial plasmids and oligonucleotidesPlasmid and oligonucleotideDescription and referencespACPM24fs::lacZpACYC184 with a PtraM-lacZ fusion (16Lu J.

Open table in a new tab Random PCR Mutagenesis of traM—Oligonucleotides JLU3 and JLU4 were used as primers for amplification of traM under error-prone PCR conditions (16Lu J. Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained: 5 ng of pRFM200, 7 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 2 μl of 100 mm MgSO4, 50 pmol of JLU3 and JLU4 each, 1 μlof Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl; Roche Diagnostics), 10 μl of 10× Taq incubation buffer, and double distilled H2O to take the total volume to 100 μl. The PCR reactions were performed in the following steps: 1) 95 °C for 30 s; 2) 55 °C for 30 s; 3) 72 °C for 1 min; and 4) repeat of steps 1, 2, and 3 for 40 cycles. Selection of Autoregulation-defective traM Mutants—The detailed procedure for selecting autoregulation-defective traM mutants was described previously (16Lu J. Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, potential traM mutants cloned in pRFM200 derivatives were transformed into DH5α cells containing pACPM24fs::lacZ. The transformed cells were plated on solid LB medium containing X-gal, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Transformants were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C; dark blue colonies were collected for further characterization. Plasmid DNA from each dark blue colony was extracted and sequenced using primers JLU3 and JLU4 to locate mutations in traM. β-Galactosidase Assays—A fresh, single colony was inoculated into LB broth containing appropriate antibiotics and grown at 37 °C with shaking for 16 h. A 200-μl sample was used for determining β-galactosidase activity as described by Miller (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and reported as Miller units. The values were calculated using the equation: 1000 (A420/tvA600), where t = time of reaction (minutes) and v = volume of culture added (ml). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—0.1 A600 (except where specified) of exponentially growing cells or a specified amount of pure protein were separated by a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 7% stacking gel. TraM was assayed by Coomassie Blue staining (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by immunoblot as described by Penfold et al. (11Penfold S.S. Simon J. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit anti-TraM antiserum (9Di Laurenzio L. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) at a 1:10,000 dilution and donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Donor Ability Assays—E. coli XK1200 and ED24 were used as donor and recipient strains, respectively. The mating experiments were performed as previously described (22Lu J. Manchak J. Klimke W. Davidson C. Firth N. Skurray R.A. Frost L.S. Plasmid. 2002; 48: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Donor ability was calculated as the number of transconjugants divided by the number of donors. Blue Native PAGE—Native gel samples were prepared as previously described (16Lu J. Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A 6 to 15% gradient polyacrylamide gel (pH 7.0) with a 4% stacking gel (pH 7.0) was used for electrophoresis following the procedures described by Schagger and von Jagow (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) and Schagger et al. (24Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Proteins separated by blue native gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblot analysis with anti-TraM antiserum. Overexpression and Purification of TraM and Its Mutants—BL21-DE3 cells containing pRFM200 or its derivatives were grown in 250 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. After 3 h, isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for another 2 h before harvesting. Approximately 150 A600 of cells were used for purification of each protein. The cell pellet was suspended in 6 ml of B-Per® bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) with one tablet of Complete, Miniprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science); the soluble fraction of the cells was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the following steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Ammonium sulfate (720 mg) was dissolved in the extracted soluble fraction. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred into a new centrifuge tube, in which 480 mg of ammonium sulfate was dissolved. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was carefully aspirated and discarded. The precipitate was dissolved in 2 ml of malonic acid (50 mm, pH 5.5), and the solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was brought to 2.5 ml with malonic acid (50 mm, pH 5.5) and was desalted on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). After passing through a 0.45-μm Millex® syringe-driven filter (Millipore), the desalted protein extract was loaded onto a cation-exchange column (Mono S HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences) using an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatograph, model LCC-500. The column was eluted with malonic acid (50 mm, pH 5.5) and a 0 to 1 m NaCl gradient. Because TraM has very low UV absorbance, eluted fractions were examined by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Blue staining, and protein peaks were further confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-TraM antiserum. Wild type TraM and the mutants V4A, F35S, A37V, Q53L, and F120L were eluted at 0.5–0.7 m NaCl. Mutants N5D, N10D, R48C, and S79* were eluted at 0.3–0.5 m NaCl. I109T, F120S, F121V, and F121S were eluted at 0.45–0.65 m NaCl. The pooled Mono S fractions (3–5 ml) of TraM or its mutant proteins were loaded onto a size exclusion column (Hiload® 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade, Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with SEC buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), and the eluate was collected in 2-ml fractions. Fractions from B9 (void volume) to E12 (one column volume) were examined. The major peak fractions of each protein were concentrated and desalted, and the buffer was exchanged for Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.6) using an Amicon® ultracentrifuge filter (Millipore) to a final volume of 50 μl. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assays (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Purified TraM or its mutants (5 μg) were brought to 1 ml with SEC buffer and loaded onto a Hiload® 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column at 4 °C in fast protein liquid chromatography. The column was eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 120 ml (one column volume) of SEC buffer, and the eluate was collected in 2-ml fractions. Samples (10 or 30 μl) from different fractions were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-TraM antiserum. The column was calibrated with molecular weight markers (Sigma) under the same chromatographic conditions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—DNA fragments containing sbmA and sbmABC were amplified by PCR from pRF911 and pRF940, respectively, using primers JLU80 and JLU81. The resulting mixtures were concentrated in a Savant SpeedVac and separated by a 2% agarose gel. The sbmA and sbmABC fragments were isolated from the agarose gel and were quantified using an Ultrospec 3000 (Amersham Biosciences). Each binding reaction contained 40 nm of sbmA or sbmABC, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.5 μg poly(dI:dC) with a final volume of 15 μl. After addition of a specified amount of purified TraM or its mutant proteins, each reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The resulting mixture was added with 3 μl of 6× load dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 30% glycerol) and loaded onto a 2% agarose gel that had been pre-run at 4 °C and 30 mA in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min. The gel was run at 4 °C and 30 mA until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Isolating Autoregulation-defective traM Mutants—A two-plasmid system was developed to select autoregulation-defective traM mutants generated by random PCR mutagenesis (16Lu J. Fekete R.A. Frost L.S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this system, pRFM200 expresses traM at a level comparable to that of the F plasmid. pACPM24fs::lacZ is a transcriptional fusion vector that carries the PtraM promoter fused to lacZ with a –1 frameshift mutation at the beginning of lacZ to drastically reduce (∼500-fold) its activity and allow differentiation of regulated and unregulated lacZ expression. This results in a simple detection method for autoregulation-defective TraM mutants that give dark blue colonies rather than the pale blue colonies characteristic of wild-type TraM (see “Experimental Procedures”). A total of 234 mutant colonies were selected from ∼25,000 transformants. DNA sequencing analysis revealed 135 pRFM200 derivatives with point mutations in traM, whereas the remaining 99 colonies contained frameshift mutations, multiple point mutations, or mutations within the ribosome binding site or start codon of traM, which were discarded. The 135 point mutants included 72 missense, 4 nonsense, and 59 redundant mutations that were located in 56 different amino acid residues of TraM (Fig. 1). To assay the effect of the mutations on autoregulation, β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity assays were performed on cells containing pACPM24fs::lacZ and the mutant derivatives of pRFM200. Cells containing pRFM200 derivatives had LacZ activities ranging from 18 to 45 Miller units, whereas cells containing pRFM200 (wild type traM) or pRFM200-Mdel (a traM-deleted pRFM200 derivative) had activities of 8 Miller units or 42 Miller units, respectively (Table II). Except for nonsense mutations, the cells with LacZ activities of ∼40 Miller units contained point mutations within the first 47 codons of traM.Table IIProperties of traM and its mutants cloned in pRFM200 and its derivatives, respectivelyWild-type or mutant traMaMutants are named after their codon changes.Codon changeLacZ activitybDetermined by assaying the β-galactosidase activity of cells containing pACPM24fs::lacZ and pRFM200 or one of its derivatives.ImmunoreactivitycDetermined by immunoblot analysis of 0.1A600 cells containing pRFM200 or one of its mutant derivatives using anti-TraM antiserum.

https://openalex.org/W1969075700,"Stromelysin-3 (ST3, MMP-11) has been shown to be strongly overexpressed in stromal fibroblasts of most invasive human carcinomas. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to ST3 expression in nonmalignant fibroblasts remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to analyze the signaling pathways activated in normal pulmonary fibroblasts after their interaction with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and leading to ST3 expression. The use of selective signaling pathway inhibitors showed that conventional and novel protein kinase Cs (PKC) were required for ST3 induction, whereas Src kinases exerted a negative control. We observed by both conventional and real time confocal microscopy that green fluorescent protein-tagged PKCα and PKCϵ, but not PKCδ, transfected in fibroblasts, accumulate selectively at the cell-cell contacts between fibroblasts and tumor cells. In agreement, RNAi-mediated depletion of PKCα and PKCϵ, but not PKCδ significantly decreased co-culture-dependent ST3 production. Finally, a tetracycline-inducible expression model allowed us to confirm the central role of these PKC isoforms and the negative regulatory function of c-Src in the control of ST3 expression. Altogether, our data emphasize signaling changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment that may define new stromal targets for therapeutic intervention.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; CM, conditioned medium; EGF, epithelial growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ST3, stromelysin-3; Tet, tetracycline; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; Ab, antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA; cPKC, conventional PKC; nPKC, novel PKC; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant negative; GFP green fluorescent protein. are zinc-dependent endopeptidases primarily involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tissue remodeling (1Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 2Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The expression and activity of these extracellular enzymes are controlled at different levels, including transcription, secretion, zymogen activation, and inhibition of their active forms by a family of natural tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs has been implicated in various physiological but also in pathological tissue remodeling processes, notably in multiple steps of tumorigenesis (3Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). MMPs represent promising therapeutic targets for cancer therapy but additional studies are required to identify the regulatory mechanisms that control MMPs synthesis and activity in the tumor microenvironment (4Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 5Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 657-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Most MMPs that have been identified in human carcinomas are expressed by the stroma, including fibroblasts, vascular, and inflammatory cells, rather than by tumor cells (6Lynch C.C. Matrisian L.M. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Among these MMPs, stromelysin-3 (ST3, MMP-11) has received much attention as its expression is elevated at early stages in virtually all invasive human primary carcinomas and in a large part of their associated metastases. Moreover, high ST3 levels have been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcome in various human carcinomas (7Engel G. Heselmeyer K. Auer G. Backdahl M. Eriksson E. Linder S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Chenard M.P. O'Siorain L. Shering S. Rouyer N. Lutz Y. Wolf C. Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Duffy M.J. Int. J.

Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1375-1382PubMed Google Scholar). ST3 has therefore been proposed as an attractive target for therapeutic approaches directed against the stromal compartment of human carcinomas (8Chenard M.P. O'Siorain L. Shering S. Rouyer N. Lutz Y. Wolf C. Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 69: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Rouyer N. Wolf C. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Bellocq J.P. Basset P. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 269-275PubMed Google Scholar). However, this enzyme exhibits specific properties and both its regulation and its specific function at the tumor-stroma interface remain largely unknown. Although ST3 possesses the characteristic structure of MMPs, it does not degrade classic ECM components (11Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M.C. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and its only known substrates are serine protease inhibitors (12Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (13Manes S. Mira E. Barbacid M.M. Cipres A. Fernandez-Resa P. Buesa J.M. Merida I. Aracil M. Marquez G. Martinez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25706-25712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike most of others MMPs that are secreted as inactive zymogens, the ST3 prodomain contains a recognition site for furin convertase, resulting in the secretion of a 45-kDa active enzyme (14Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 15Santavicca M. Noel A. Angliker H. Stoll I. Segain J.P. Anglard P. Chretien M. Seidah N. Basset P. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The near uniform expression of ST3 in early stage tumors strongly suggested that it might participate in the initial development of carcinomas. In agreement with this hypothesis, ST3 expression has been associated with increased tumor take and incidence (16Noel A.C. Lefebvre O. Maquoi E. VanHoorde L. Chenard M.P. Mareel M. Foidart J.M.

Biochem. 2001; 82: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in various experimental models of tumorigenesis. Our recent data have further confirmed and extended this new function by showing that active ST3 increases tumor cell survival via activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway (21Fromigue O. Louis K. Wu E. Belhacene N. Loubat A. Shipp M. Auberger P. Mari B. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, other studies have recently shown that while ST3 promotes cancer cell implantation in connective tissue, its expression is also associated with a decrease in metastatic incidence, illustrating a dual role of this paracrine factor (22Andarawewa K.L. Boulay A. Masson R. Mathelin C. Stoll I. Tomasetto C. Chenard M.P. Gintz M. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5844-5849PubMed Google Scholar). At a molecular level, ST3 is induced by phorbol esters (23Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a compound that usually represses the expression of other MMPs. The ST3 promoter strongly differs from that of other MMPs and contains three conserved regulatory elements including a C/EBP binding site (23Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), several retinoic acid responsive elements, and a thyroid responsive element (29Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39981-39990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, aside from thyroid and retinoic acid receptors that appear to control the expression of ST3 during the developmental processes associated with apoptosis (26Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Damjanovski S. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4738-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Dupe V. Ghyselinck N.B. Thomazy V. Nagy L. Davies P.J. Chambon P. Mark M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the factors regulating its expression in other physiological and pathological processes have not been identified. Tumor-stroma co-culture assays allow analysis of such a complex regulation in a model that resembles the in vivo situation observed in human carcinoma. Using such assays, we and others have demonstrated that the fibroblastic expression of ST3 required a direct contact between fibroblasts and tumor epithelial cells. In addition, its expression was not affected by neutralizing antibodies (Ab) directed against several growth factors including basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, EGF, and transforming growth factor-β (31Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning Y. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Wang C.S. Tetu B. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating that these growth factors are not involved. The nature of the tumor-associated factors initiating the stromal response, as well as the signaling pathways activated in fibroblasts and implicated in the induction of ST3 are still unknown. In the present study, we have therefore analyzed the signaling pathways activated in human fibroblasts following their interaction with cancer epithelial cells and we have shown that both classical and novel PKCs are central regulators of ST3 expression. Cell Culture and Treatments—The human fibroblast-like cells CCD-19Lu (CCL-210), derived from normal lung tissue, the human NSCLC cell line A549 and the rhabdomyosarcoma tumor cell line RD (CCL 136) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and routinely cultured as previously described (23Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Direct co-culture was carried out as previously described (31Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning Y. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol.

For inhibitory studies, drugs were added 15 min before treatments at the following concentrations: cycloheximide (Sigma), 10 μm; GF109203X (Calbiochem), 5 μm; Gö6976 (Calbiochem), 2–5 μm; PD98059 (Calbiochem), 15 μm; PP2 (Calbiochem), 10 μm; SB202190 (Calbiochem), 30 μm; SB203580 (Calbiochem), 15 μm; LY294002 (Calbiochem), 10 μm; U0126 (Promega), 10 μm. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were extracted by phenol/chloroform, separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred, and hybridized with [α-32P]dATP probes as previously described (33Fromigue O.

Following exposure of the membranes to storage phosphorscreen, images were quantified using ImageQuant™ software (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Conditioned media (CM) were concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration (Ultrafree 5K, Millipore Corp.). Cell monolayers were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min under agitation, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (21Fromigue O. Louis K. Wu E. Belhacene N. Loubat A. Shipp M. Auberger P. Mari B. Int. J.

Ab raised against phospho-p42/p44 came from New England Biolabs. Anti-c-Src Ab was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Myc mAb (clone 9E10) was provided by UBI. Other Abs were purchased from Cell Signaling. Transient Transfection and Cell Fractionation—Transient transfection of CCL-210 by constructs coding for hPKCα-GFP, hPKCϵ-GFP, and hPKCδ-GFP was performed with Exgen 500 (Euromedex, France) in 6-well plates as previously described (34Vallentin A.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, 3 × 105 A549 tumor cells or PMA were added for different incubation times. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by scraping into homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells were then sonicated at 4 °C (10 s, 3 times) and centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were collected and correspond to the soluble fractions. Pellets, corresponding to the membrane fraction, were resuspended in homogenization buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 45 min on ice. Both fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-GFP mAb (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transient Transfection and Observation of Fusion Protein Localization in Living Cells—CCL-210 cells were seeded on 12-mm round coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with hPKC-GFP constructs as described elsewhere (0.5 μg of DNA and 2.5 μl of Exgen-500/well). Twenty-four hours later, cells were stimulated with either PMA or addition of 106 A549 tumor cells. The localization of fusion proteins in living cells was examined by conventional or confocal fluorescence microscopy at different times following stimulation as previously described (35Vallentin A. Lo T.C. Joubert D. Mol. Cell.

Plasmid containing human PKCα-EGFP cDNA (PKCα-EGFP Mercury™ probe, Clontech) was digested with SacII/XhoI to extract PKCα and the resulting insert was cloned into the pCDNA4/TO vector. Single mutations were introduced to generate CA PKCαA25E and DN PKCαK368R with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the following mutation oligonucleotides primers: CA PKCα, sense: 5′-CCCGCAAAGGGGAGCTGAGGCAGAAG-3′, antisense: 5′-CTTCTGCCTCAGCTCCCCTTTGCGGG-3′; DN PKCα, sense: 5′-GAACTGTATGCAATCAGAATCCTGAAGAAGGATGTGG-3′, antisense: 5′-CCACATCCTTCTTCAGGATTCTGATTGCATACAGTTC-3′. cDNA coding for PKCδ was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from RD cells mRNA using the following primers (sense: 5′-ACCATG-GCGCGTTCCTGCGCATC-3′; antisense: 5′-ATCTTCCAGGAGGTGCT-CGAATTT-3′), ligated into the PCRscript plasmid, digested with Eco-RV/NotI, and finally subcloned into pcDNA4/TO plasmid. Single mutations were introduced to generate CA PKCδA148E and DN PKCδK379R as described above using the following mutation oligonucleotide primers: CA PKCδ, sense, 5′-GAACCGCCGCGGAGAAATCAAACAGGCCA-AAATCC-3′, antisense, 5′-GGATTTTGGCCTGTTTGATTTCTCCGCG-GCGGTTC-3′; DN PKCδ, sense, 5′-GTACTTTGCCATCAGGGCCCTC-AAGAAGG-3′, antisense, 5′-CCTTCTTGAGGGCCCTGATGGCAAAG-TAC-3′. All constructions were entirely sequenced. c-Src cDNA was extracted with XbaI from pSG5 plasmid containing chicken CA c-Src Y527F cDNA (kindly provided by Sarah Courtneidge, San Francisco, CA), ligated into PCRscript plasmid, digested by EcoRI and finally subcloned into pcDNA4/TO plasmid. Generation of Stable RD Transfectants Expressing Tetracycline-inducible CA/DN Forms of PKCs and c-Src—T-REX™ system (Invitrogen Corp.) was used to obtain a Tet-induced expression system in RD cells. We first established a stable cell line that constitutively expressed the Tet repressor by RD cells electroporation (400 V, 125 μF) with the pcDNA6/TR plasmid followed by selection with 10 μg/ml blasticidin. Twenty independent subclones were expanded and tested for Tet-inducible gene expression by transient transfection with a positive control plasmid expressing β-galactosidase. The clone with the lowest level of basal transcription and the highest level of β-galactosidase expression after addition of Tet was selected for subsequent transfection with the different expression plasmids (RD-TR cells). RD-TR cells were electroporated with the different kinase constructs described above and a second selection was performed using 5 μg/ml blasticidin and 200 μg/ml Zeocin. Following selection, positive clones were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin and 200 μg/ml Zeocin and expanded. In all experiments, at least two independent clones were analyzed for each construct. Stimulation of Stable RD Transfectants Expressing Tetracycline-inducible Kinases—RD-TR clones expressing the CA or DN forms of kinases were stimulated by either 20 ng/ml PMA, 4 μg/ml Tet, or a combination of the 2 drugs in the absence of serum. At different times following stimulation, CM were harvested and cells were lysed as described elsewhere. Transient Transfection of RD-TR Cells and Luciferase Assay— RD-TR cells at 80% confluence in 6-well dishes were transiently transfected with Exgen-500 using luciferase reporter plasmid 2.5-ST3-LUC (–2447 to +15) (23Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or a control pGL3-Basic reporter plasmid. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stimulated by either 20 ng/ml PMA, 4 μg/ml Tet, or a combination of the 2 drugs in the absence of serum for 32 h before determination of luciferase activity, as previously described (21Fromigue O.

Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. and statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test with a statistical significance of at least p < 0.05. Time Course of ST3 Induction in Normal Human Pulmonary Fibroblasts following Co-culture with NSCLC A549 Cells— Using a co-culture assay in which A549 cells are grown on a monolayer of normal pulmonary fibroblasts, we had previously shown that direct contact between the two cell types specifically induces ST3 mRNA in fibroblasts (31Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning Y. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism leading to ST3 expression in these conditions, the induction kinetic of ST3 mRNA in co-culture was compared with that of fibroblasts treated with the phorbol ester (PMA), whose AP1-independent transcriptional activation has been demonstrated (23Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the induction pattern of ST3 was similar in both conditions, with no detectable levels of mRNA before 24 h and a stable expression of the transcript after 32 h. Because PMA-mediated induction of ST3 is dependent on de novo protein synthesis (23Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of cycloheximide on ST3 induction in the tumor-stroma co-culture. As shown in Fig. 1B, cycloheximide totally blocked ST3 transcript induction in both co-culture and PMA conditions, indicating that the fibroblastic induction of ST3 by cancer cells also requires protein neosynthesis. Effect of Major Signaling Pathways Inhibitors on PMA- and Co-culture-mediated ST3 Induction—To determine the potential role of specific signaling pathways in PMA or co-culture-mediated ST3 induction, we tested known inhibitors of kinases for their ability to affect ST3 expression (Fig. 2). TIMP-1, a gene constitutively expressed in both fibroblasts and A549, was used as an internal control and its expression was evaluated by Northern blot analysis together with that of ST3 (Fig. 2A). The induction of ST3, observed after 32 h stimulation by PMA or co-culture, was totally abolished by GF109203X, an inhibitor of both conventional (cPKC) and novel PKCs (nPKC) but only partially by the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976 (Fig. 2, A and B). SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK had a low but significant inhibitory effect on ST3 induction, an effect that was more pronounced with SB202190, a dual inhibitor of p38 and JNK kinases. No alteration of ST3 expression was observed in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059, indicating that p42/p44 MAPK was not involved in this process. Similar findings were obtained in the presence of the selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Interestingly, treatment with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 led to a significant increase in ST3 transcript in co-culture (+80%, Fig. 2B). Concerning TIMP-1 transcript level, GF109203X abrogated PMA-mediated induction, whereas other inhibitors had no significant effect (Fig. 2A, left panel). As previously described, the level of the TIMP-1 transcript did not vary in co-culture conditions (33Fromigue O. Louis K. Dayem M. Milanini J. Pages G. Tartare-Deckert S. Ponzio G. Hofman P. Barbry P. Auberger P. Mari B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8487-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and none of these inhibitors significantly affected its level, thereby indicating that these drugs had no toxic effect under these conditions (Fig. 2A, right panel). To test the effect of these various kinase inhibitors at the protein level, analysis of conditioned media from 48-h stimulated fibroblasts was performed by Western blot in the same conditions (Fig. 2C). No ST3 secretion was detected in the medium of the NSCLC cell line cultured alone (data not shown). Consistent with the transcriptional activation of the ST3 gene observed in Fig. 2A, a major secreted ST3 species of 45 kDa was detected in fibroblasts exposed to PMA or to the NSCLC cancer epithelial cells. This 45-kDa secreted ST3 results from the intracellular cleavage of the inactive ST3 precursor pro-enzyme by furin (14Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Its activity was previously demonstrated for the purified recombinant enzyme (11Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Manes S. Mira E. Barbacid M.M. Cipres A. Fernandez-Resa P. Buesa J.M. Merida I. Aracil M. Marquez G. Martinez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25706-25712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), as well as for the enzyme secreted in the same co-cultures as those used in the present study (31Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning Y. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The secretion of this active 45-kDa ST3 enzyme (E) was significantly inhibited by PKC inhibitors and to a lesser extent by stress kinase inhibitors in co-culture conditions, whereas it was induced by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that alteration of the ST3 transcript level also results in a similar modification of the amount of active enzyme in conditioned media. Altogether, these data indicate that PMA and co-culture-dependent ST3 induction require common signaling pathways, involving essentially c- and nPKCs and stress-activated kinases, whereas Src kinases exerted an inhibitory action. Finally, similar results were obtained by using other tumor cell types (breast tumor cell line MCF-7, squamous tumor of the tongue CAL-33) or other fibroblasts (fetal human fibroblasts CCL-153, infiltrated fibroblasts from the CAL 33 carcinoma) (data not shown), indicating that this mechanism is not restricted to a specific type of cancer cells or fibroblasts. Specific Accumulation of Fibroblast PKCα- and PKCϵ-GFP at the Cell-Cell Contact with Tumor Cells—Because activation of c- and nPKCs isoforms is likely to represent an early and central event in the control of ST3 expression, we analyzed the expression and the potential relocalization of several PKC isoforms in normal fibroblasts cultured alone or co-cultured with NSCLC cells. Western blot analysis using specific Abs directed against the main isoforms of c- and nPKCs indicated that PKCα, PKCϵ, and PKCδ are constitutively expressed in fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). These 3 isoforms are also present in the epithelial tumor cells A549, with PKCδ being mainly produced as a 42-kDa fragment that is likely to correspond to its C-terminal catalytic fragment (38Emoto Y.
