Host genetic variants associated with critical illness may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development3. Here we report the results of the GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care) genome-wide association study in 2,244 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from 208 UK intensive care units. We have identified and replicated the following new genome-wide significant associations: on chromosome 12q24.13 (rs10735079, P = 1.65 × 10-8) in a gene cluster that encodes antiviral restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3); on chromosome 19p13.2 (rs74956615, P = 2.3 × 10-8) near the gene that encodes tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2); on chromosome 19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 × 10-12) within the gene that encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9); and on chromosome 21q22.1 (rs2236757, P = 4.99 × 10-8) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. We identified potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications: using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that low expression of IFNAR2, or high expression of TYK2, are associated with life-threatening disease; and transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte-macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe COVID-19. Our results identify robust genetic signals relating to key host antiviral defence mechanisms and mediators of inflammatory organ damage in COVID-19. Both mechanisms may be amenable to targeted treatment with existing drugs. However, large-scale randomized clinical trials will be essential before any change to clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3108711749,"The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR diagnostics can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable, and accurate. Here, we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA that can be read with a mobile phone microscope. The assay achieved ∼100 copies/μL sensitivity in under 30 min of measurement time and accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity and directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Integrated with a reader device based on a mobile phone, this assay has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening for SARS-CoV-2."

Cells are often exposed to stress conditions such as oxidative stress, temperature changes, viral infection, or presence of toxins. To protect against these unfavorable conditions and minimize the damage during stress, cells activate an evolutionarily conserved pathway termed the integrated stress response (Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016Pakos-Zebrucka K. Koryga I. Mnich K. Ljujic M. Samali A. Gorman A.M. The integrated stress response.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1374-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). This pathway triggers the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, leading to inhibition of translation of most mRNAs. This translational repression allows cells to conserve energy and shift their resources toward the restoration of cellular homeostasis (Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016Pakos-Zebrucka K. Koryga I. Mnich K. Ljujic M. Samali A. Gorman A.M. The integrated stress response.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1374-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Along with the reprogramming of translation, the integrated stress response also leads to the assembly of stress granules (SGs), phase-separated membraneless organelles, in the cytoplasm. A fraction of cytoplasmic mRNAs localize to SGs upon their assembly, and translation inhibition and RNA length have been shown to correlate with SG association (Khong et al., 2017Khong A. Matheny T. Jain S. Mitchell S.F. Wheeler J.R. Parker R. The Stress Granule Transcriptome Reveals Principles of mRNA Accumulation in Stress Granules.Mol. Cell. 2017; 68: 808-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition to mRNAs, SGs are enriched in RNA-binding proteins and translation initiation factors (Nunes et al., 2019Nunes C. Mestre I. Marcelo A. Koppenol R. Matos C.A. Nóbrega C. MSGP: the first database of the protein components of the mammalian stress granules.Database (Oxford). 2019; 2019: baz031Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There has been significant effort toward understanding SG composition, material properties, and role in diseases, however, their biological function remains largely unknown (Alberti and Dormann, 2019Alberti S.

Recent studies using single-molecule imaging techniques in living cells have begun to shed light on the kinetics of mRNA recruitment to SGs (Moon et al., 2019Moon S.L. Morisaki T. Khong A. Lyon K.

Despite this progress, we know little about the functional consequence of these interactions, as it remains unclear whether sequestration of mRNAs to SGs has any impact on gene expression (Guzikowski et al., 2019Guzikowski A.R.

Because SG formation coincides with global silencing of translation, it is often speculated that SGs are directly contributing to this repression during stress (Adjibade et al., 2015Adjibade P.

Translational control of aberrant stress responses as a hallmark of cancer.J. Pathol. 2018; 244: 650-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This stems from the assumption that SGs contain exclusively non-translating mRNA and help to keep them in an inhibited state. There is, however, little direct evidence supporting this model because single-molecule methods for measuring the translation and location of transcripts within individual cells have only recently been described (Halstead et al., 2015Halstead J.M.

Furthermore, previous studies have characterized transcripts that are translationally inhibited during stress, making it difficult to disentangle the specific contribution of SGs to this process (Moon et al., 2019Moon S.L. Morisaki T. Khong A. Lyon K. Parker R. Stasevich T.J. Multicolour single-molecule tracking of mRNA interactions with RNP granules.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; Wilbertz et al., 2019Wilbertz J.H. Voigt F. Horvathova I. Roth G. Zhan Y. Chao J.A. Single-Molecule Imaging of mRNA Localization and Regulation during the Integrated Stress Response.Mol. Cell. 2019; 73: 946-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although most transcripts are repressed during stress, there are transcripts such as ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) that are necessary for mounting the stress response and are preferentially translated when eIF2ɑ is phosphorylated (Harding et al., 2000Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Regulated translation initiation controls stress-induced gene expression in mammalian cells.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar). In order to characterize the relationship between translational status and SG recruitment of mRNAs during stress, we generated ATF4-SunTag reporter transcripts for single-molecule imaging of translation in living cells. Using this approach, we find direct evidence that mRNAs localized to SGs can undergo translation. ATF4-SunTag transcripts localized to SGs can initiate translation, elongate, and terminate, indicating that the SG environment does not repress any step of the translation cycle. Translating mRNAs can also be observed to dynamically exchange between the cytosol and SGs. Additionally, we show that SG-associated translation is not limited to transcripts whose translation is enhanced during stress because our measurements are sensitive enough to also detect SG-associated translation for transcripts that are inhibited during stress. Because membraneless organelles are now proposed to play a key role in cellular compartmentalization, these experiments highlight the importance of direct observation of biochemical reactions inside and outside of biomolecular condensates in order to understand their biological function. In order to characterize the relationship between mRNA localization and translation during stress, we combined live-cell imaging of SGs with SunTag-based single-molecule imaging of translation (Pichon et al., 2016Pichon X. Bastide A. Safieddine A. Chouaib R. Samacoits A. Basyuk E. Peter M. Mueller F. Bertrand E. Visualization of single endogenous polysomes reveals the dynamics of translation in live human cells.J.

This approach allows visualization of individual reporter mRNAs via MS2 stem-loops and simultaneous visualization of nascent peptide chains via the SunTag, which consists of an array of antibody epitopes that are recognized by genetically encoded single-chain antibodies (scFv). To accomplish this, we engineered a HeLa cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged scFv and Halo-tagged MS2 coat protein (MCP) (Voigt et al., 2017Voigt F. Zhang H. Cui X.A. Triebold D. Liu A.X. Eglinger J. Lee E.S. Chao J.A. Palazzo A.F. Single-Molecule Quantification of Translation-Dependent Association of mRNAs with the Endoplasmic Reticulum.Cell Rep. 2017; 21: 3740-3753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reporter mRNA encodes the SunTag array in frame with Renilla luciferase, enabling the measurement of protein synthesis by two complementary assays. The reporter mRNA further contains a destabilized FKBP domain to enhance the degradation of the mature protein, thereby facilitating imaging of nascent peptide chains during translation (Banaszynski et al., 2006Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.-C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G.L. Wandless T.J. A rapid, reversible, and tunable method to regulate protein function in living cells using synthetic small molecules.Cell. 2006; 126: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). To enable visualization of translation during stress, we placed the 5′UTR of ATF4 in front of the SunTag array (Figure 1A). This enables the mRNA to be efficiently translated during stress conditions when most other mRNAs are inhibited. The reporter mRNA was integrated into the genome at a site-specific locus and was under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter, which enables precise mRNA tracking and minimizes potential artifacts of overexpression. Using luciferase assays, we confirmed that translation of this ATF4-SunTag reporter is specifically upregulated during arsenite stress compared to normal growth conditions (Figure 1B), as previously reported for endogenous ATF4 (Andreev et al., 2015Andreev D.E. O’Connor P.B.F. Fahey C. Kenny E.M. Terenin I.M. Dmitriev S.E. Cormican P. Morris D.W. Shatsky I.N. Baranov P.V.

Vander Jagt D.L. Abcouwer S.F. The oxidative stressor arsenite activates vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA transcription by an ATF4-dependent mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20331-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Importantly, ATF4-SunTag was efficiently translated at an oxidative stress condition (100 μM arsenite) that also triggered robust SG formation in all cells (Figure 1B), thus enabling us to visualize the translation of this mRNA in SG-containing cells. It should be noted that at higher arsenite concentrations, ATF4-SunTag translation was inhibited. Because ATF4 translation is enhanced during stress, it is interesting that it has been previously reported that the chemotherapeutic drug sorafenib, which triggers the integrated stress response, results in accumulation of ATF4 mRNA in SGs (Adjibade et al., 2015Adjibade P. St-Sauveur V.G. Quevillon Huberdeau M. Fournier M.-J. Savard A. Coudert L. Khandjian E.W. Mazroui R. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, induces formation of stress granules in hepatocarcinoma cells.Oncotarget. 2015; 6: 43927-43943Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This paradoxical finding was interpreted as a means to buffer ATF4 translation during stress by sequestration and translational repression in SGs. Using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with immunofluorescence, we confirmed that endogenous ATF4 mRNAs as well as ATF4-Suntag transcripts accumulate in SGs also during oxidative stress (Figures S1A and S1B). Next, to label SGs in living cells, we introduced SNAP-tag-labeled G3BP1 to our cell line and confirmed that G3BP1-SNAP forms SGs only during stress and colocalizes with other SG components such as endogenous TIA-1 (Figure S1C). We then performed live-cell imaging of this cell line exposed to oxidative stress and observed that ATF4-SunTag mRNAs are frequently recruited to SGs as described for other mRNAs that are translationally inhibited (Moon et al., 2019Moon S.L. Morisaki T. Khong A. Lyon K. Parker R. Stasevich T.J. Multicolour single-molecule tracking of mRNA interactions with RNP granules.Nat.

SG-localized mRNAs can be clearly distinguished from cytosolic mRNAs, because they colocalize with G3BP1-labeled SGs and are much less mobile compared to freely moving cytosolic mRNAs (Video S1). Translating and non-translating mRNAs can be distinguished by the presence of the SunTag signal. As expected, we often observe non-translating mRNA localized to SGs (Figure S1D). Surprisingly, we also observe that translating ATF4-SunTag mRNAs are frequently localized to SGs (Figure 1C; Video S1), suggesting that localization to SGs does not require inhibition of mRNA translation. Because SG-localized mRNAs are more static than cytosolic transcripts, we were able to follow them in longer time-lapse imaging experiments that revealed translating mRNAs often remain localized to SGs for more than 5 min (Figure 1D; Video S2). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/b6a16b5c-435f-4ac6-97e9-bdc76cfa5382/mmc10.mp4Loading ...

Translating mRNAs Localized to SGs, Related to Figure 1Example of SG-associated translation in cells treated with 100 μM sodium arsenite for 1 h and imaged with 0.5 s intervals. Arrows indicate ATF4-SunTag mRNAs labeled with SunTag signal and localized to SGs. Considering that we observe both non-translating and translating mRNAs in SGs as well as in the cytosol, we set out to quantify whether there is any correlation between translational status and localization to SGs. To this end, we developed an image analysis workflow enabling us to assign translation status and localization to thousands of ATF4-SunTag mRNAs. Specifically, we determined the translation status of mRNAs using single-particle tracking of MS2 and SunTag foci followed by pairwise colocalization analysis of the trajectories. The localization to SGs was determined by measuring the G3BP1 signal at the mRNA coordinates and in the cytoplasm (Figures S2A–S2D; STAR Methods). As expected, SG-localized mRNA tracks showed dramatically reduced mobility regardless of translation status (Figures S2E and S2F), demonstrating these mRNAs are stably bound to the stress granule. The analysis revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability in the fraction of mRNAs undergoing translation. On average, 30% of SG-localized ATF4-SunTag mRNAs were found to co-localize with SunTag signal, indicating that SG-associated translation is not a rare event for this type of transcript (Figure 2A). Cytosolic mRNAs had a slightly higher percentage of translating mRNAs (44% of mRNAs). After addition of the translational inhibitor puromycin, virtually all mRNAs (both cytosolic and SG-localized) are devoid of SunTag signal, demonstrating that our analysis is stringent and SunTag-labeled mRNAs represent bona fide translation sites (Figure 2A). Importantly, SG-localized and cytosolic mRNAs did not dramatically differ in their SunTag signal intensities (Figure 2B). As SunTag intensity correlates with the number of ribosomes, this indicates that ribosome occupancy on translating mRNAs is similar in the cytosol and SGs.Figure 2Quantification of mRNA Localization and Translation Based on Single-Particle TrackingShow full caption(A) Fraction of ATF4-SunTag mRNAs undergoing translation was quantified separately for mRNAs localized to SGs or mRNAs localized to cytosol.

Mean ± SEM: 16% ± 2.0% versus 36% ± 1.9%; p < 0.0001. See also Figure S2. To further examine how mRNAs are distributed based on their translational status, we divided all ATF4-SunTag mRNAs into translating and non-translating populations and quantified their distribution in SGs and the cytosol. For both translating and non-translating transcripts, only a small percentage of these two populations were localized to SGs (translating: 12%, non-translating: 19%), whereas the majority of both types of transcripts remained in the cytosol (Figure 2C and 2D). The slight enrichment of non-translating mRNAs in SGs can have two possible explanations. One possibility is that the localization to SGs reduces the translation activity of mRNAs. The second explanation is that the ribosome occupancy of mRNAs influences the partitioning between cytosol and SG. To test this, we compared the extent of mRNA localization to SGs between arsenite-treated cells and cells co-treated with puromycin. This analysis revealed that puromycin-treated cells have a significantly higher fraction of SG-localized mRNAs (36% versus 16%), indicating that non-translating mRNAs are more likely to be recruited to SGs (Figure 2E). This strongly suggests that the observed correlation between localization to SGs and slightly lower translation activity can be explained by the higher propensity of non-translating mRNAs to localize to SGs. As the majority of mRNAs are translationally repressed during stress, this may explain the difficulty in separating SG localization from translation inhibition. It has been reported that SGs are not homogeneous and contain substructures. In particular, several studies support a model where SGs contain stable cores surrounded by a more dynamic shell (Cirillo et al., 2020Cirillo L. Cieren A. Barbieri S. Khong A. Schwager F. Parker R.

Previously, it was also shown that gurken transcripts in Drosophila embryos are translated on the outside edge of P-bodies, another type of membraneless organelle, but not within them (Davidson et al., 2016Davidson A. Parton R.M. Rabouille C. Weil T.T. Davis I.

Therefore, we set out to determine if the translational status of mRNAs was related to their position within a SG. To this aim, we performed a 3D spot detection and SG segmentation in fixed cells and measured the distances from each ATF4-SunTag mRNA in SGs to the closest SG boundary. It should be noted that SG boundaries are not precisely defined, and it has been shown that some SG components, such as eIF4A, can extend beyond the boundary defined by G3BP1 (Tauber et al., 2020Tauber D. Tauber G. Khong A. Van Treeck B. Pelletier J. Parker R. Modulation of RNA Condensation by the DEAD-Box Protein eIF4A.Cell. 2020; 180: 411-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consequently, our measurement of the distance from the boundary could be an underestimate. The analysis revealed that the majority of translating (76%) and non-translating (65%) mRNAs in SGs are located within 0.3 μm of the detected SG boundary, with a slight bias for translating mRNAs to be closer to the surface (mean distance ± SD: 0.22 ± 0.16 μm versus 0.27 ± 0.18 μm) (Figure 3A). Translating mRNAs, however, could also be detected deeper inside SGs and were observed up to 1 μm from the boundary in larger SGs (Figures 3B and 3C). Importantly, the distance from the SG boundary did not correlate with SunTag intensity of the translating mRNAs (Figure 3C). This indicates that translational status is not the major determinant of the position of mRNAs within SGs and confirms previous observations that many mRNAs localize to the outer layers of SGs.

To aid in this effort, we developed a general population risk calculator for COVID-19 mortality based on various sociodemographic factors and pre-existing conditions for the US population, combining information from the UK-based OpenSAFELY study with mortality rates by age and ethnicity across US states. We tailored the tool to produce absolute risk estimates in future time frames by incorporating information on pandemic dynamics at the community level. We applied the model to data on risk factor distribution from a variety of sources to project risk for the general adult population across 477 US cities and for the Medicare population aged 65 years and older across 3,113 US counties, respectively. Validation analyses using 54,444 deaths from 7 June to 1 October 2020 show that the model is well calibrated for the US population. Projections show that the model can identify relatively small fractions of the population (for example 4.3%) that might experience a disproportionately large number of deaths (for example 48.7%), but there is wide variation in risk across communities. We provide a web-based risk calculator and interactive maps for viewing community-level risks. A new risk calculator calibrated specifically for the US population provides estimates of risk for COVID-19 for individuals and at the community level, using socioeconomic factors, demography, pre-existing conditions and mortality rates by age and ethnicity."
https://openalex.org/W3111258557,"Lymphocyte migration is essential for adaptive immune surveillance. However, our current understanding of this process is rudimentary, because most human studies have been restricted to immunological analyses of blood and various tissues. To address this knowledge gap, we used an integrated approach to characterize tissue-emigrant lineages in thoracic duct lymph (TDL). The most prevalent immune cells in human and non-human primate efferent lymph were T cells. Cytolytic CD8+ T cell subsets with effector-like epigenetic and transcriptional signatures were clonotypically skewed and selectively confined to the intravascular circulation, whereas non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell subsets with stem-like epigenetic and transcriptional signatures predominated in tissues and TDL. Moreover, these anatomically distinct gene expression profiles were recapitulated within individual clonotypes, suggesting parallel differentiation programs independent of the expressed antigen receptor. Our collective dataset provides an atlas of the migratory immune system and defines the nature of tissue-emigrant CD8+ T cells that recirculate via TDL."

https://openalex.org/W3110916323,"Magnitude of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations and their duration have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI), however published thresholds for injury vary and uncertainty about these levels has received relatively little attention. In this study, we have analyzed high-resolution ICP monitoring data in 227 adult patients in the CENTER-TBI dataset. Our aim was to identify thresholds of ICP intensity and duration associated with worse outcome, and to evaluate the uncertainty in any such thresholds. We present ICP intensity and duration plots to visualize the relationship between ICP events and outcome. We also introduced a novel bootstrap technique to evaluate uncertainty of the equipoise line. We found that an intensity threshold of 18 ± 4 mmHg (2 standard deviations) was associated with worse outcomes in this cohort. In contrast, the uncertainty in what duration is associated with harm was larger, and safe durations were found to be population dependent. The pressure and time dose (PTD) was also calculated as area under the curve above thresholds of ICP. A relationship between PTD and mortality could be established, as well as for unfavourable outcome. This relationship remained valid for mortality but not unfavourable outcome after adjusting for IMPACT core variables and maximum therapy intensity level. Importantly, during periods of impaired autoregulation (defined as pressure reactivity index (PRx)&gt;0.3) ICP events were associated with worse outcomes for nearly all durations and ICP levels in this cohort and there was a stronger relationship between outcome and PTD. Whilst caution should be exercised in ascribing causation in observational analyses, these results suggest intracranial hypertension is poorly tolerated in the presence of impaired autoregulation. ICP level guidelines may need to be revised in the future taking into account cerebrovascular autoregulation status considered jointly with ICP levels."

Toxicity of polyamines and their metabolic products.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2013; 26: 1782-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cellular polyamine homeostasis is tightly controlled by fine-tuning polyamine biosynthesis, degradation, export, and cellular uptake of exogenous polyamines via the polyamine transport system (PTS) (2Pegg A.E. Mammalian polyamine metabolism and function.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Polyamine synthesis starts from ornithine that is converted to PUT by ornithine decarboxylase, followed by PUT metabolism to SPD and SPM via SPD and SPM synthase, respectively (Fig. S1) (2Pegg A.E. Mammalian polyamine metabolism and function.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This pathway is strictly regulated mainly through controlling the levels and activity of the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase via antizyme and antizyme inhibitor (Fig. S1) (6Miller-Fleming L.

Polyamine synthesis can also be prevented by synthetic blockers such as difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a selective inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, or methylglyoxal bis-(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG), an SPD analog that inhibits the formation of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, a precursor of SPD and SPM (Fig. S1) (7Heaton M.A. Flintoff W.F.

However, despite serious efforts, the defective polyamine transporter(s) in the CHO-MG model remain(s) to be identified. Based on studies in CHO-MG cells and other models, several polyamine transport routes have been proposed to account for experimental observations of cellular polyamine uptake, but a unifying theory is lacking, presumably because of the existence of multiple parallel systems (12Wang M. Phanstiel O. von Kalm L. Evaluation of polyamine transport inhibitors in a drosophila epithelial model suggests the existence of multiple transport systems.Med. Sci.

Also, a vesicular SLC18B1 importer has been reported presenting SPD and SPM selectivity (27Hiasa M. Miyaji T. Haruna Y. Takeuchi T. Harada Y. Moriyama S. Yamamoto A. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Identification of a mammalian vesicular polyamine transporter.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, we characterized the ubiquitous P5B-ATPase, ATP13A2, as a polyamine transporter in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment that preferentially sequesters SPM and SPD out of the late endosomal/lysosomal lumen into the cytosol (28van Veen S. Martin S. Van den Haute C. Benoy V. Lyons J. Vanhoutte R. Kahler J.P. Decuypere J.-P. Gelders G. Lambie E. Zielich J. Swinnen J.V. Annaert W. Agostinis P. Ghesquière B. et al.ATP13A2 deficiency disrupts lysosomal polyamine export.Nature. 2020; 578: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ATP13A2 removes polyamines from the lysosome, which benefits lysosomal health and functionality. This process is compatible with the glypican-dependent endosomal uptake route that contributes to the cellular uptake of polyamines complementing the polyamine synthesis in the cytosol. ATP13A2 may mediate cellular polyamine uptake via a two-step mechanism involving cellular entry of polyamines through endocytosis, followed by sequestration of polyamines out of the late endosomal/lysosomes by ATP13A2 (28van Veen S. Martin S. Van den Haute C. Benoy V. Lyons J. Vanhoutte R. Kahler J.P. Decuypere J.-P. Gelders G. Lambie E. Zielich J. Swinnen J.V. Annaert W. Agostinis P. Ghesquière B. et al.ATP13A2 deficiency disrupts lysosomal polyamine export.Nature. 2020; 578: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether the other orphan P5B-ATPases, ATP13A3-5, may also be polyamine transporters of the mammalian PTS (29Sørensen D.M. Holemans T. van Veen S. Martin S. Arslan T. Haagendahl I.W. Holen H.W. Hamouda N.N. Eggermont J. Palmgren M. Vangheluwe P. Parkinson disease related ATP13A2 evolved early in animal evolution.PLoS One. 2018; 130193228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that the underlying molecular defect of the CHO-MG phenotype might be due to a dysfunction of one or more members of the P5B-ATPases. In CHO-MG cells, we identified mutations in the coding sequence of the ATP13A3 gene, which encodes for a P5B-ATPase expressed in the early and recycling endosomes (29Sørensen D.M. Holemans T. van Veen S. Martin S. Arslan T. Haagendahl I.W. Holen H.W. Hamouda N.N. Eggermont J. Palmgren M. Vangheluwe P. Parkinson disease related ATP13A2 evolved early in animal evolution.PLoS One. 2018; 130193228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We demonstrated ATP13A3 expression deficiency at both the mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, reintroducing WT ATP13A3 restores the polyamine uptake and MGBG resistance phenotype of CHO-MG cells, whereas ATP13A3 knockdown in WT cells induces these phenotypes. Therefore, ATP13A3 represents a novel member of the mammalian PTS. First, we confirmed via viability assays the resistance of CHO-MG cells against MGBG-induced toxicity as compared with CHO control cells (CHO-WT) (Fig. 1A) (9Byers T.L. Wechter R. Nuttall M.E. Pegg A.E. Expression of a human gene for polyamine transport in Chinese-hamster ovary cells.Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Mandel J.-L. Flintoff W.F.

Furthermore, we verified whether the PTS was defective in the CHO-MG cell line. We assessed the cellular polyamine uptake capacity using boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-conjugated SPD and SPM (Fig. 1B) that are taken up by the PTS (30Vanhoutte R. Kahler J.P. Martin S. van Veen S. Verhelst S.H.L. Clickable polyamine derivatives as chemical probes for the polyamine transport system.ChemBioChem. 2018; 19: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and transported by ATP13A2 (28van Veen S. Martin S. Van den Haute C. Benoy V. Lyons J. Vanhoutte R. Kahler J.P. Decuypere J.-P. Gelders G. Lambie E. Zielich J. Swinnen J.V. Annaert W. Agostinis P. Ghesquière B. et al.ATP13A2 deficiency disrupts lysosomal polyamine export.Nature. 2020; 578: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but both CHO cell lines exhibited similar levels of BODIPY–SPD and BODIPY–SPM uptake (Fig. 1B). Also, CHO-WT and CHO-MG models were equally sensitive to the toxicity of high SPD and SPM concentrations (Fig. S2). Because no obvious SPD or SPM phenotype was observed in CHO-MG, we next evaluated PUT uptake and toxicity. We, therefore, synthesized BODIPY-labeled PUT for this study and observed that its uptake was approximately 5-fold lower in CHO-MG than in CHO-WT (Fig. 1B), confirming a defective PTS in CHO-MG. Benzyl viologen (BV), a known inhibitor of the PTS (31Saunders N.A. Ilett K.F. Minchin R.F. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages express a polyamine transport system.J. Cell Physiol. 1989; 139: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), blocked BODIPY–PUT uptake in CHO-WT to the levels observed in CHO-MG cells (Fig. 1B). We then investigated the effect of increasing concentrations of exogenous PUT on the toxicity of 50-μM MGBG, a concentration that caused a significant reduction in CHO-WT viability, as previously shown in Figure 1A. Supplementation of PUT on itself did not induce toxicity in either of the two CHO models (Fig. 1C), in line with previous observations (28van Veen S. Martin S. Van den Haute C. Benoy V. Lyons J.

Overall, CHO-MG cells are resistant to MGBG and present a reduced BODIPY–PUT uptake capacity, which may relate to a defective polyamine transporter of MGBG and PUT. Based on the recent discovery that ATP13A2 is a polyamine transporter that regulates the cellular polyamine content (28van Veen S. Martin S. Van den Haute C. Benoy V. Lyons J. Vanhoutte R. Kahler J.P. Decuypere J.-P. Gelders G. Lambie E. Zielich J. Swinnen J.V. Annaert W. Agostinis P. Ghesquière B. et al.ATP13A2 deficiency disrupts lysosomal polyamine export.Nature. 2020; 578: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ATP13A2, or one of the other related P5-type orphan transporters such as ATP13A1 (a P5A-ATPase) or ATP13A3-5 (P5B-ATPases) (29Sørensen D.M. Holemans T. van Veen S. Martin S. Arslan T. Haagendahl I.W. Holen H.W. Hamouda N.N. Eggermont J. Palmgren M. Vangheluwe P. Parkinson disease related ATP13A2 evolved early in animal evolution.PLoS One. 2018; 130193228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), may be implicated in the CHO-MG phenotype. The Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) genome does not contain an ATP13A5 gene (32Hammond S. Kaplarevic M. Borth N. Betenbaugh M.J. Lee K.H. Chinese hamster genome database: an online resource for the CHO community at www.CHOgenome.org.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), so we compared the relative mRNA expression levels of the P5A-ATPase, ATP13A1, and the P5B-ATPases, ATP13A2-4, between CHO-WT and CHO-MG via quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2A), for which the primer sets were validated (Fig. S3A). Whereas the relative mRNA levels of ATP13A1 and ATP13A2 were not significantly different, ATP13A3 mRNA was significantly decreased in CHO-MG compared with CHO-WT cells (Fig. 2A). Importantly, we confirmed the decreased expression of ATP13A3 in CHO-MG cells at the protein level via proteomic analysis (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3B). ATP13A4 mRNA expression was hardly detected in the CHO models although the ATP13A4 primers were validated with cDNA derived from hamster brain, the tissue that shows the highest ATP13A4 expression in mice (33Schaum N. Karkanias J. Neff N.F. May A.P. Quake S.R. Wyss-Coray T. Darmanis S. Batson J. Botvinnik O. Chen M.B. Chen S. Green F. Jones R.C. Maynard A. Penland L. et al.Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris.Nature. 2018; 562: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) (Fig. S3C). The low ATP13A4 expression in CHO cells is in line with the poor ATP13A4 expression in human ovaries (34Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. Sivertsson Å. Kampf C. Sjöstedt E. Asplund A. Olsson I. Edlund K. Lundberg E. Navani S. Szigyarto C.A.-K. et al.Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 347: 1260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). As CHO-MG cells were generated by random mutagenesis (13Mandel J.-L. Flintoff W.F. Isolation of mutant mammalian cells altered in polyamine transport.J. Cell Physiol. 1978; 97: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we analyzed the DNA sequence of the CHO-MG ATP13A3 gene. Genome sequencing revealed 54 DNA mutations in the CHO-MG ATP13A3 gene as compared with the reference CHO genome (RefSeq Assembly GCF_000223135.1). Only two of the 54 mutations were found in the coding sequence and both of them were heterozygous. The first coding sequence mutation is located on nucleotide 45284 of contig NW_003615339.1 (genotype = 0/1; read depth for each allele = 21,33; read depth = 54; genotype quality = 99; phred-scaled genotype likelihoods rounded to the closest integer = 1216,0,715), leading to a nonsense mutation at the protein level converting the Trp codon 511 (TGG) to a stop codon (TGA) (p.Trp511X) (Fig. 2C). The second coding sequence mutation results in a frameshift at the protein level at position 936 (p.Phe936Serfs25X) (Fig. 2C). Here, nucleotide 57302 in contig NW_003615339.1 is deleted (genotype = 0/1; read depth for each allele = 25,27; read depth = 52; genotype quality = 99; phred-scaled genotype likelihoods rounded to the closest integer = 855,0,777), removing the first thymine in the Phe codon (TTC) at position 936 of the ATP13A3 protein sequence. Both mutations in the coding sequence of ATP13A3 are compatible with the decreased mRNA and protein expression of ATP13A3 in CHO-MG cells. Next, we verified whether the impaired ATP13A3 expression is responsible for the CHO-MG phenotype by restoring ATP13A3 levels via lentiviral transduction. We generated stable CHO-WT and CHO-MG cells expressing comparable levels of human WT (A3-WT) or a catalytically dead mutant of ATP13A3 that is defective in the autophosphorylation activity (D498N; A3-DN) and hence predicted to be transport deficient (Fig. 3A) (29Sørensen D.M. Holemans T. van Veen S. Martin S. Arslan T. Haagendahl I.W. Holen H.W. Hamouda N.N. Eggermont J. Palmgren M. Vangheluwe P. Parkinson disease related ATP13A2 evolved early in animal evolution.PLoS One. 2018; 130193228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Note that the ATP13A3 antibody fails to detect a clear band in CHO-WT, indicating that the antibody may react weaker with the endogenous hamster ATP13A3 protein than with the overexpressed human ATP13A3 protein (9 residues are different in the epitope region), and/or the endogenous signal may be overshadowed by the relatively higher overexpression in CHO-WT+A3-WT. Importantly, compared with the nontransduced CHO-MG cells, there was a significant increase in the uptake of BODIPY–PUT in CHO-MG+A3-WT cells, comparable with the uptake level observed in CHO-WT+A3-WT cells (Fig. 3B), demonstrating successful recovery of BODIPY–PUT uptake. However, this rescue was not observed in CHO-MG+A3-DN cells expressing the catalytically dead ATP13A3 mutant (Fig. 3B), indicating that the transport function of ATP13A3 was essential for the recovery of BODIPY–PUT uptake. Note that the uptake of BODIPY–PUT in CHO-WT+A3-WT cells, exhibiting the highest ATP13A3 expression, still falls within the linear range (Fig. S4). The resistance to MGBG-induced toxicity was also significantly reduced by 40% in CHO-MG+A3-WT cells as compared with the nontransduced CHO-MG and CHO-MG+A3-DN cell lines (Fig. 3C). To further establish ATP13A3 dysfunction as a key contributor in the CHO-MG phenotype, we induced stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATP13A3 in the CHO-WT background and checked if that would lead to a phenotype comparable with CHO-MG cells. Via quantitative RT-PCR, we observed a major reduction in ATP13A3 expression in two independent knockdown models (Fig. 4A), which reduced the uptake of BODIPY–PUT to the same level as in CHO-MG cells (Fig. 4B) and significantly increased the resistance of the cells against MGBG by 40% (Fig. 4C), in line with the rescue results (Fig. 3C). Together, the complementary data in the rescue and knockdown cell models convincingly demonstrate that defective ATP13A3-mediated transport underlies the impaired BODIPY–PUT uptake in CHO-MG cells and is at least partially responsible for the MGBG resistance phenotype. We examined the likely substrate specificity of ATP13A3-dependent transport via cellular uptake experiments. Overexpression of WT ATP13A3 in CHO-MG caused no significant difference in the uptake of BODIPY–PUT, BODIPY–SPD, and BODIPY–SPM as compared with CHO-WT+A3-WT (Fig. 5A). Via competition assays, we observed that the unlabeled PUT competed with BODIPY–PUT uptake in cells expressing WT ATP13A3 (Fig. 5C), further confirming that PUT is most likely a substrate transported through ATP13A3. Interestingly, nonfluorescent SPD and SPM also competed with the uptake of BODIPY–PUT in all cell lines with functional ATP13A3, possibly hinting at a broad polyamine substrate specificity (Fig. 5D). Moreover, MGBG showed competition against BODIPY–PUT uptake in a dose-dependent manner in CHO-WT+A3-WT and CHO-MG+A3-WT (Fig. 5B), confirming that MGBG and BODIPY–PUT follow the same uptake route via ATP13A3. Also, SPD and SPM protected against MGBG toxicity in CHO-WT cells (Fig. S5, A–B). Next, we independently verified substrate specificity in viability experiments with DFMO, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting step in polyamine synthesis. Blocking endogenous polyamine synthesis by DFMO (Fig. S1) makes cells more dependent on cellular uptake of polyamines (9Byers T.L. Wechter R. Nuttall M.E. Pegg A.E. Expression of a human gene for polyamine transport in Chinese-hamster ovary cells.Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ATP13A3 expression significantly reduced DFMO toxicity in the CHO-MG background, mainly when exogenous PUT was provided, and more mildly when SPD or SPM was administered (Fig. 5, E–G), demonstrating that polyamine uptake via ATP13A3 complements a lower ornithine decarboxylase activity. Note that PUT exhibits no toxicity in the concentration range we used, whereas SPD and SPM become toxic at higher concentrations, which explains why ATP13A3 protection against DFMO fades at higher concentrations of SPD and SPM (Fig. 5, E–G). Overall, our data indicate that ATP13A3-dependent transport presents a broad specificity to polyamines including PUT, SPD, and SPM, as well as MGBG. Because ATP13A3 localizes to th"

Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, preparedness, counselling practices of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19, and the perceived barriers to adequately prevent and control COVID-19 in Yemen. Methods Healthcare workers (HCWs) from major healthcare facilities participated in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire comprising of five main domains (demographics, knowledge, self-preparedness, counselling practice, perceived barriers) was distributed among HCWs after obtaining informed consent. A convenient sampling technique was used. Descriptive and inferential analyses were applied using SPSS software. Results A total of 1000 participants were initially targeted to participate in the study with 514 (51.4%) responding, of which 55.3% were female. Physicians and nurses constituted the largest proportion of participants, with 39.5% and 33.3%, respectively. The median scores for knowledge, self-preparedness, and counselling practice were 8 (out of 9), 9 (out of 15), and 25 (out of 30), respectively. The physician group showed a statistically significant association with better knowledge compared to the nurse group only, P&lt;0.001. Males had higher preparedness scores than females, p&lt;0.001. Also, the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency departments presented a statistically significant difference by which the participants from these departments were more prepared compared to the others (e.g. outpatients, paediatrics and surgery) with P &lt; 0.0001. The lack of awareness among the general population about COVID-19 preventive measures was perceived as the most common barrier for the adequate prevention and control of COVID-19 in Yemen (89.1%). Conclusion The major highlight of this study is that HCWs have, overall, good knowledge, suboptimal preparedness, and adequate counselling practices prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen, despite the high number of perceived barriers. However, urgent action and interventions are needed to improve the preparedness of HCWs to manage COVID-19. The perceived barriers also need to be fully addressed by the local healthcare authorities and international organisations working in Yemen for adequate prevention and control measures to be in place in managing COVID-19."

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of stress, depression and anxiety on the IVF outcomes in Kazakhstan. Methods The prospective cohort study was performed using questionnaires to assess psychological distress in 304 infertile female in three different cities in Kazakhstan. Results The average age of participants was 33.7 years with infertility duration of 5.9 years. Regarding stress, depression and anxiety we found that more than 80% of all respondents had CES-D score higher than 16, indicating that they are at risk of developing clinical depression. On average, FPI subscales’ scores, global stress score and anxiety scale (STAI-S and STAI-T) scores were statistically significantly higher among not pregnant women than pregnant women. Similarly, in simple logistic regression analysis all FPI subscales scores, global stress scale score and anxiety scales’ scores were negatively associated with clinical pregnancy. Conclusion Rates of stress, anxiety and depression among IVF patients are higher than in general population. If the level of infertility-related stress is higher, IVF success rate is lower. Findings of our study indicate the need for the specific psychological interventions for all infertility women, to improve IVF success rate."

Here, we report a molecular technology for stable genetic tagging of cells that exhibit activity-related increases in intracellular calcium concentration (FLiCRE). We used FLiCRE to transcriptionally label activated neural ensembles in the nucleus accumbens of the mouse brain during brief stimulation of aversive inputs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we detected FLiCRE transcripts among the endogenous transcriptome, providing simultaneous readout of both cell-type and calcium activation history. We identified a cell type in the nucleus accumbens activated downstream of long-range excitatory projections. Taking advantage of FLiCRE’s modular design, we expressed an optogenetic channel selectively in this cell type and showed that direct recruitment of this otherwise genetically inaccessible population elicits behavioral aversion. The specificity and minute resolution of FLiCRE enables molecularly informed characterization, manipulation, and reprogramming of activated cellular ensembles."
https://openalex.org/W3112026679,"Ticks transmit a diverse array of microbes to vertebrate hosts, including human pathogens, which has led to a human-centric focus in this vector system. Far less is known about pathogens of ticks themselves. Here, we discover that a toxin in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) horizontally acquired from bacteria-called domesticated amidase effector 2 (dae2)-has evolved to kill mammalian skin microbes with remarkable efficiency. Secreted into the saliva and gut of ticks, Dae2 limits skin-associated staphylococci in ticks while feeding. In contrast, Dae2 has no intrinsic ability to kill Borrelia burgdorferi, the tick-borne Lyme disease bacterial pathogen. These findings suggest ticks resist their own pathogens while tolerating symbionts. Thus, just as tick symbionts can be pathogenic to humans, mammalian commensals can be harmful to ticks. Our study underscores how virulence is context-dependent and bolsters the idea that ""pathogen"" is a status and not an identity."

While high expression of miR-375 is a characteristic of MCC, it seems not to contribute to the malignant phenotype of MCC cells. miR-375 enrichment in MCC-derived extracellular vesicles suggests its intercellular signaling function. Here, we demonstrate that horizontally transferred miR-375 causes fibroblast polarization toward cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The polarization is evidenced by phenotypic changes and induction of α-SMA, CXCL2, and IL-1β. Fibroblast polarization is inhibited by specific antagomirs and mimicked by experimental miR-375 expression. Mechanistically, miR-375 downregulates RBPJ and p53, two key players regulating fibroblast polarization. In clinical MCC samples, in situ hybridization located miR-375 in CAFs, which correlated with high α-SMA protein and low RBPJ and TP53 expression; single-cell RNAseq revealed a disparate fibroblast polarization negatively correlating with p53 pathway-related gene expression. Thus, the functional role of miR-375 in MCC is to generate a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment by inducing fibroblast polarization."
https://openalex.org/W3111172566,"Converging empirical evidence indicates that exposure to adversity in childhood is associated with increased vulnerability to mental health problems in adulthood. As early life adversity has the potential to alter an individual’s appraisal of threat, we hypothesized that individuals exposed to adversity in childhood may also exhibit increased threat from environmental stressors, which in turn may impact their state anxiety levels. We examined the relations between adverse childhood experiences, assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACEs), perceived threat from COVID-19, and state anxiety in a sample of adults. Additionally, flexibility is implicated in adaptive coping with life’s stressors so we also assessed participants’ cognitive flexibility. Parallel mediation regression analyses revealed that both perceived threat from COVID-19 and flexibility in the appraisal of challenges mediated the influence of maltreatment, but not household dysfunction, on state anxiety. Our data indicate that experience with early life adversity in the form of maltreatment is associated with increased perceived threat from COVID-19, which results in higher anxiety levels for the individual. In contrast, childhood maltreatment is associated with reduced flexibility in appraising challenges, which in turn mediates the relationship between maltreatment and anxiety. The findings of this study adds to the limited literature on the impact of early life adversity on cognitive flexibility and highlights the psychological toll of COVID-19 on individuals who have been exposed to adverse childhood experiences."

https://openalex.org/W3112654702,"Sucrose metabolism contributes to the growth and development of plants and helps plants cope with abiotic stresses, including stress from Cd. Many of these processes are not well-defined, including the mechanism underlying the response of sucrose metabolism to Cd stress. In this study, we investigated how sucrose metabolism in maize varieties with low (FY9) and high (SY33) sensitivities to Cd changed in response to different levels of Cd (0 (control), 5, 10, and 20 mg L −1 Cd). The results showed that photosynthesis was impaired, and the biomass decreased, in both varieties of maize at different Cd concentrations. Cd inhibited the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose synthase (SS) (sucrose synthesis), and stimulated the activities of acid invertase (AI) and SS (sucrose hydrolysis). The total soluble sugar contents were higher in the Cd-treated seedlings than in the control. Also, Cd concentrations in the shoots were higher in SY33 than in FY9, and in the roots were lower in SY33 than in FY9. The decreases in the photosynthetic rate, synthesis of photosynthetic products, enzyme activity in sucrose synthesis direction, and increases in activity in hydrolysis direction were more obvious in SY33 (the sensitive variety) than in FY9 (the tolerant variety), and more photosynthetic products were converted into soluble sugar in SY33 than in FY9 as the Cd stress increased. The transcript levels of the sugar transporter genes also differed between the two varieties at different concentrations of Cd. These results suggest that sucrose metabolism may be a secondary response to Cd additions, and that the Cd-sensitive variety used more carbohydrates to defend against Cd stress rather than to support growth than the Cd-tolerant variety."
https://openalex.org/W3111483840,"This study posits that Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) can function as an extrinsic motive stimulating sport event consumption by inducing consumers to overcome leisure constraints. Also, FOMO-driven consumption is proposed to affect consumption experience for being grounded on extrinsic than intrinsic rewards. In Study 1, the moderation of FOMO between intrapersonal and structural constraints and sport media viewing intention are tested. In Study 2, the relations among FOMO-driven consumption, intrinsic rewards (i.e., enjoyment), extrinsic rewards (i.e., social adherence), and consumer satisfaction are assessed. Study 1 results support the notion that FOMO can boost sport media viewing intention through two mechanisms: by directly stimulating intention and by lifting the negative effect of constraints on intention. In Study 2, FOMO-driven consumption shows a stronger link to extrinsic than intrinsic rewards, extrinsic reward is marginally but negatively associated with intrinsic reward, and intrinsic reward is a stronger predictor of satisfaction. Overall, FOMO is identified as a meaningful extrinsic motive for sport event consumption though its effects on consumer satisfaction are arguable. Implications for FOMO-driven marketing are discussed."

The use of 16S rRNA and ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing for analysis of complex microbial communities have increased dramatically in recent years, establishing links between wine specificity and, environmental and viticultural factors, which are framed into the elusive terroir concept. Given the diverse and complex role these factors play on microbial soil structuring of agricultural crops, the main aim of this study is to evaluate how external factors, such as vintage, vineyard location, cultivar and soil characteristics, may affect the diversity of the microbial communities present. Additionally, we aim to compare the influence these factors have on the structuring of bacterial and fungal populations associated with Malbec grapevine rhizosphere with that of the more widespread Cabernet Sauvignon grapevine cultivar. Samples were taken from Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon cultivars from two different vineyards in the San Juan Province of Argentina. Total DNA extracts from the rhizosphere soil samples were sequenced using Illumina’s Miseq technology, targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable 16S rRNA region in prokaryotes and the ITS1 region in yeasts. The major bacterial taxa identified were Proteobacteria , Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes , while the major fungal taxa were Ascomycetes , Basidiomycetes , Mortierellomycetes and a low percentage of Glomeromycetes . Significant differences in microbial community composition were found between vintages and vineyard locations, whose soils showed variances in pH, organic matter, and content of carbon, nitrogen, and absorbable phosphorus."

As in other regions, women’s participation in STEM drops progressively moving up the education and career ladder, with women currently constituting 30% of Africa’s STEM researchers. This study elucidates gender-based differences in PhD performance using new survey data from 227 alumni of STEM PhD programs in 17 African countries. We find that, compared to their male counterparts, sampled women had about one less paper accepted for publication during their doctoral studies and took about half a year longer to finish their PhD training. Negative binomial regression models provide insights on the observed differences in women’s and men’s PhD performance. Results indicate that the correlates of publication productivity and time to PhD completion are very similar for women and men, but some gender-based differences are observed. For publication output, we find that good supervision had a stronger impact for men than women; and getting married during the PhD reduced women’s publication productivity but increased that of men. Becoming a parent during the PhD training was a key reason that women took longer to complete the PhD, according to our results. Findings suggest that having a female supervisor, attending an institution with gender policies in place, and pursuing the PhD in a department where sexual harassment by faculty was perceived as uncommon were enabling factors for women’s timely completion of their doctoral studies. Two priority interventions emerge from this study: (1) family-friendly policies and facilities that are supportive of women’s roles as wives and mothers and (2) fostering broader linkages and networks for women in STEM, including ensuring mentoring and supervisory support that is tailored to their specific needs and circumstances."

However, our understanding about how physical loading affects recovery of viscoelastic functions, collagen production and tissue organisation is limited. The objective of this study was to investigate how different magnitudes of loading affects biomechanical and collagen properties of healing Achilles tendons over time. Achilles tendon from female Sprague Dawley rats were cut transversely and divided into two groups; normal loading (control) and reduced loading by Botox (unloading). The rats were sacrificed at 1, 2- and 4-weeks post-injury and mechanical testing (creep test and load to failure), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and histological analysis were performed. The effect of unloading was primarily seen at the early time points, with inferior mechanical and collagen properties (SAXS), and reduced histological maturation of the tissue in unloaded compared to loaded tendons. However, by 4 weeks no differences remained. SAXS and histology revealed heterogeneous tissue maturation with more mature tissue at the peripheral region compared to the center of the callus. Thus, mechanical loading advances Achilles tendon biomechanical and collagen properties earlier compared to unloaded tendons, and the spatial variation in tissue maturation and collagen organization across the callus suggests important regional (mechano-) biological activities that require more investigation."

We aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in GEP-NEN G3 and evaluate its correlation to clinical parameters. In a cohort of 136 patients, 14 (10%) expressed PD-L1 immunoreactivity; four (3%) patients in the tumor cells and 10 (7%) had immunoreactive immune cells. PD-L1 expression did not correlate to clinical parameters, progression-free survival or overall survival. We conclude that PD-L1 expression is present only in a subset of GEP-NEN G3 patients. Further studies are needed to fully understand the role of PD-L1 in patients with GEP-NEN G3, including the future possibility for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors."

In Peninsular Malaysia, 3.0 million hectares or 61 percent of its Permanent Reserved Forests is officially assigned for commercial selective logging. Understanding how wildlife adapts and uses logged forest is critical for its management and, for threatened species, their conservation. In this study, we quantify the population status of four tropical ungulate species in a large selectively logged forest reserve and an adjacent primary forest protected area. We then conduct finer scale analyses to identify the species-specific factors that determine their occurrence. A combined indirect sign-camera trapping approach with a large sampling effort (2,665 km and 27,780 trap nights surveyed) covering a wide area (560 km 2 ) generated species-specific detection probabilities and site occupancies. Populations of wild boar were widespread across both logged and primary forests, whereas sambar and muntjac occupancy was lower in logged forest (48.4% and 19.2% respectively), with gaur showing no significant difference. Subsequent modelling revealed the importance of conserving lower elevation habitat in both habitat types, particularly &lt;1,000 m asl, for which occupancies of sambar, muntjac and gaur were typically higher. This finding is important because 75 percent (~13,400 km 2 ) of Peninsular Malaysia’s Main Range Forest (Banjaran Titiwangsa) is under 1,000 m asl and therefore at risk of being converted to industrial timber plantations, which calls for renewed thinking around forest management planning."
https://openalex.org/W3112435142,"Many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies require binding to Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) for full effect and increasing the binding affinity increases efficacy. Preeminent among the five activating human FcγRs is FcγRIIIa/CD16a expressed by natural killer (NK) cells. CD16a is heavily processed, and recent reports indicate that the composition of the five CD16a asparagine(N)-linked carbohydrates (glycans) impacts affinity. These observations indicate that specific manipulation of CD16a N-glycan composition in CD16a-expressing effector cells including NK cells may improve treatment efficacy. However, it is unclear if modifying the expression of select genes that encode processing enzymes in CD16a-expressing effector cells is sufficient to affect N-glycan composition. We identified substantial processing differences using a glycoproteomics approach by comparing CD16a isolated from two NK cell lines, NK92 and YTS, with CD16a expressed by HEK293F cells and previous reports of CD16a from primary NK cells. Gene expression profiling by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR revealed expression levels for glycan-modifying genes that correlated with CD16a glycan composition. These results identified a high degree of variability between the processing of the same human protein by different human cell types. N-glycan processing correlated with the expression of glycan-modifying genes and thus explained the substantial differences in CD16a processing by NK cells of different origins.

However, it is unclear if modifying the expression of select genes that encode processing enzymes in CD16a-expressing effector cells is sufficient to affect N-glycan composition. We identified substantial processing differences using a glycoproteomics approach by comparing CD16a isolated from two NK cell lines, NK92 and YTS, with CD16a expressed by HEK293F cells and previous reports of CD16a from primary NK cells. Gene expression profiling by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR revealed expression levels for glycan-modifying genes that correlated with CD16a glycan composition. These results identified a high degree of variability between the processing of the same human protein by different human cell types. N-glycan processing correlated with the expression of glycan-modifying genes and thus explained the substantial differences in CD16a processing by NK cells of different origins. The antibody-binding Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) capture target tissue through a linking antibody to elicit a cytotoxic cell-mediated response. Of the five activating human FcγRs, FcγRIIIa/CD16a expressed by natural killer (NK) cells appears predominant for clearing cancerous cells following the administration of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) such as rituximab (1Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V. Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytotoxicity against tumor targets.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the therapeutic potential of expressing the antibody-binding Fc γ receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa/CD16a) on a cultured NK cell line, NK92, alone or fused to the signaling Fc ε receptor γ chain is under active investigation (2Jochems C.

The success of these strategies in total provides a validated mechanism to administer engineered transmembrane receptors, opening the possibility of developing engineered FcγRs to enhance many treatments. Recent reports using mutation to prevent activation-induced CD16a shedding or fusing the high affinity FcγRI/CD64 extracellular domain with the CD16a transmembrane and intracellular domains further highlight the potential of engineered FcγRs (9Zhu H.

CD16a is expressed by most people as the only FcγR on NK cells and is required for NK cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (11Chiesa S. Tomasello E. Vivier E. Vely F. Coordination of activating and inhibitory signals in natural killer cells.Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CD16a also exhibits substantial structural and functional variability. Two predominant CD16a polymorphic variants provide either greater (V158) or weaker (F158) antibody binding affinity (12Hayes J.M. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Muller S. Martin S.M. Pauers M. Reuss F.

Other mechanisms to increase affinity exist, including altering posttranslation modifications that may be more widely tolerated than engineered polypeptides. The extracellular domain of CD16a contains five asparagine(N)-linked carbohydrates (glycans) at positions N38, N45, N74, N162, and N169 (15Shibata-Koyama M. Iida S. Okazaki A. Mori K.

Of the five sites, N-glycans at N162 and N45 directly contribute to high-affinity antibody binding and protein stability in vitro (17Subedi G.P. Barb A.W.

Manipulating the CD16a N162-glycan composition increases IgG binding affinity, which correlates with mAb efficacy. Hayes and coworkers showed that removing N-acetylneuraminic acid residues from the CD16a N-glycan termini increased binding affinity (12Hayes J.M. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Muller S. Martin S.M.

An analysis of the N162-glycan structures from CD16a isolated from primary human NK cells revealed the presence of both high-affinity and low-affinity CD16a glycoforms (21Patel K.R. Nott J.D. Barb A.W. Primary human natural killer cells retain proinflammatory IgG1 at the cell surface and express CD16a glycoforms with donor-dependent variability.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2019; 18: 2178-2190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our group also identified multiple other surprising features on CD16a purified from primary NK cells including the presence of hybrid-type N-glycans at N45 and extensive processing including N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) repeats at the N38 and N74 sites (Fig. 1A). N-Glycans are synthesized without a template, resulting in the formation of oligomannose, hybrid and complex type N-glycan structures that can all occur on the same protein (Fig. 1B) (22Essentials of Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2015-2017Google Scholar). Compositional heterogeneity originates from competing processing pathways, incomplete processing by hydrolases and glycosyltransferases, variable enzyme and substrate concentrations, enzyme–substrate exposure time, substrate affinities, accessibility to the glycosylation site, as well as the physiological state of the cell (22Essentials of Glycobiology. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2015-2017Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear which parameters must be tuned to successfully engineer lymphocyte glycans. An ability to identify and modulate carbohydrate structures likewise provides the ability to prevent the formation of potentially undesirable structures, including oligomannose-type N-glycans on biotherapeutics that are rapidly cleared through binding the mannose receptor (23Alessandri L. Ouellette D. Acquah A. Rieser M. Leblond D. Saltarelli M. Radziejewski C. Fujimori T. Correia I. Increased serum clearance of oligomannose species present on a human IgG1 molecule.MAbs. 2012; 4: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although many possible factors affect glycan composition, the presence of specific surface carbohydrate structures correlated with the expression of transcripts encoding required glycan-modifying enzymes in mouse stem cells and other systems (24Taniguchi T.

It is currently unknown if CD16a glycans expressed by human NK cells are as sensitive to gene expression levels. Here we describe the glycogene expression profiles of primary and cultured cell lines including two that exhibit an NK cell phenotype, are widely used to investigate NK cell function, and are candidates for allogenic transplantation (26Gunesch J.T.

Immunol. 2019; 115: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results are compared with the high-resolution mass spectrometry–based glycoproteomics analysis of CD16a expressed by two NK cell lines and HEK293 cells and compared with a previous characterization of CD16a from primary human NK cells (21Patel K.R. Nott J.D. Barb A.W. Primary human natural killer cells retain proinflammatory IgG1 at the cell surface and express CD16a glycoforms with donor-dependent variability.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2019; 18: 2178-2190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We analyzed CD16a mobility using SDS-PAGE. Slower mobility associates with greater processing for many mammalian N-glycoproteins. We immunoprecipitated full-length CD16a containing the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains from suspension HEK293F, NK92, and YTS cells. The NK92 cell line, established from a 50-year-old male patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was recently engineered to express CD16a (27Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P.

The YTS cell line originated from a 15-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and thymoma and was later transformed to express CD16a using the cytomegalovirus promoter (31Peruzzi G. Femnou L. Gil-Krzewska A. Borrego F. Weck J. Krzewski K. Coligan J.E. Membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase regulates the activation-induced downmodulation of CD16 in human primary NK cells.J. Immunol. 2013; 191: 1883-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although there are developmental differences between both cell lines, both NK92 and YTS cells perform antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity once transformed with CD16a (32Hsu H.T. Mace E.M.

Biol. 2016; 215: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A Western blot, detected with a different anti-CD16a antibody than that used for immunoprecipitation, showed differences in the mobility of CD16a from HEK, YTS, and NK92 cells (Fig. 2A). These results are representative of multiple independent experiments. The following purification enriched CD16a. The YTS purification showed a weak band at ∼50 kDa in the lysate that is depleted in the flow-through fraction and enriched in the elution. The mobility of YTS CD16a was less than the mobility of the truncated CD16a protein containing only the extracellular domain (HEK soluble) that lacks 7 kDa corresponding to the transmembrane and intracellular domains. The full-length CD16a purified from HEK and NK92 cells revealed different features. NK92 cells showed a sharp dark band at ∼50 kDa that did not purify. Because this band was recognized by the detection antibody but not the immunoprecipitation antibody we do not regard this material as properly folded CD16a and did not include it in the study (Fig. 2A). HEK and NK92 CD16a showed two distinct purifying bands, one at 40 kDa and another diffuse band >50 kDa (Fig. 2A). The lower 40-kDa band was not observed with CD16a from YTS cells. It is possible that the lower band represents unprocessed CD16a. To test this hypothesis, we treated the full-length purified CD16a fragments with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) that removes N-glycans by cleaving the linkage to the side-chain asparagine N atom. This treatment collapsed the diffuse 50- to 60-kDa band and the 40-kDa band observed with the HEK and NK92 CD16a revealing a doublet at ∼31 kDa (Fig. 2B). Thus, the 40-kDa bands observed in Figure 2A do not correspond to non-N-glycosylated CD16a but likely represent CD16a with incompletely processed N-glycans. The presence of complex-type N-glycans further reduces mobility upon comparison with the same protein with the less processed oligomannose N-glycans in support of this possibility (Fig. S1). It is also possible that the lower 40-kDa band observed with CD16a from HEK and NK92 cells lacks one or more, but not all, N-glycans. It is surprising that, PNGaseF-digested CD16a from YTS cells revealed a second doublet at a greater molecular weight (∼34 kDa; Fig. 2B). It is possible that YTS CD16a contains an additional non-N-glycan modification or that a protein complex preserved during detergent lysis shielded one or more N-glycans from PNGaseF digestion. It is notable that each PNGaseF-digested protein migrated as a doublet (Fig. 2B); our laboratory observed a similar doublet for PNGaseF-treated CD16a purified from primary human NK cells (33Roberts J.T.

Proteomics. 2020; 19: 362-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization–MS/MS analysis of CD16a did not reveal the presence of an additional modification that could explain this result (data not shown). The apparent mobility differences could be due to partial proteolysis or modification of a portion proximal to the transmembrane domain; we have been unable to identify peptides from this region of the protein in MS-based analyses (21Patel K.R. Nott J.D. Barb A.W. Primary human natural killer cells retain proinflammatory IgG1 at the cell surface and express CD16a glycoforms with donor-dependent variability.Mol.

In summary, these results demonstrate substantial processing differences between the full-length CD16a expressed by three different mammalian cell lines. High-resolution glycoproteomics allows for site-specific identification of intact N-glycopeptides, providing a measure of N-glycan processing at each site. Proteolysis of the purified CD16a samples generated glycopeptides that contained a single N-glycan, allowing assignment of individual glycoforms to a single site within the protein. We identified a total of 276 unique N-glycopeptides that displayed 121 individual N-glycan species from the four different CD16a samples (Table 1). The numbers of individual glycopeptides from each source ranged from 60 for N162 of the HEK CD16a to zero for the N169 site of YTS CD16a. The average absolute mass error for the glycopeptides was <0.005 Da (Table 1).Table 1Distinct glycopeptides identified for each sampleN-glycosylation siteHEK-solubleHEKNK92YTSTotalAbs mass error ± SD (Da)N383844712680.0056 ± 0.0087N4534441818500.0040 ± 0.0039N74302966520.0046 ± 0.0048N16253601510730.0049 ± 0.0037N169281380330.0042 ± 0.0032Mass error (all data)0.0047 ± 0.0054# of Distinct N-glycans86993036121 Open table in a new tab We observed striking differences in the processing at individual CD16a N-glycan sites resulting from expression with different cell types (Fig. 3). For example, N38 from HEK-soluble CD16a contained nearly exclusively complex-type N-glycoforms in contrast to NK92, which showed 99.4% oligomannose types. HEK and YTS CD16a reveal comparable N38 profiles with ∼40% oligomannose, ∼10% hybrid, and ∼50% complex types. Comparable processing across all cell lines likewise emerged for the N74 site, which is proximal to N38 in the folded protein (Fig. 1). It is surprising that the processing at N45 on all cell types was comparable with that observed for primary human NK cells with CD16a containing 60% to 70% hybrid forms, except CD16a from NK92 cells, which showed hybrid but a larger percentage of oligomannose forms. The N162 site exhibited substantial variability with HEK-soluble displaying 83% complex types and YTS with 78% hybrid types. Although we observed fewer N169-containing glycopeptides, likely owing to incomplete proteolysis that is required to separate this peptide from the transmembrane domain for the full-length proteins, HEK and HEK-soluble displayed primarily complex types and NK92 cells showed predominantly hybrid types. An examination of the most abundant glycoforms at each site likewise revealed substantial differences between the CD16a expressed by each cell line (Figs. 4 and S2). N38 and N74 from HEK-soluble CD16a appear as the most processed sites with a high degree of branching and branch processing with the most abundant forms showing complete sialylation. However, none of these expression hosts generated N38 and N74 glycans with LacNAc repeats that are a predominant feature of CD16a expressed in primary monocytes and NK cells (21Patel K.R. Nott J.D.

These two sites from HEK and NK92 CD16a show a high percentage of oligomannose and partially processed forms, with exclusively oligomannose forms from NK92 cells. It is notable that YTS CD16a, but not NK92 CD16a, shows a high degree of terminal branch processing that is revealed by the extensive galactosylation, sialylation, and branch fucosylation (Fig. 4). CD16a isolated from primary NK cells likewise showed a high degree of galactosylation and sialylation at the branch termini with more modest fucosylation (19Patel K.R. Roberts J.T. Subedi G.P.

CD16a isolated from NK92 cells showed the least N-glycan processing, especially at the N38 and N74 sites, lacking many of the features observed with CD16a from primary NK cells (19Patel K.R.

In addition to the aforementioned high levels of oligomannose glycoforms from NK92, the few complex-type N-glycans at N45 and N162 contained substantially less branching than CD16a from the four other sources. The glycoproteomics strongly supported the SDS-PAGE mobility analysis and demonstrated the appearance of substantial processing differences between CD16a isolated from different human cell lines. Transcriptional regulation of the enzymes responsible for N-glycan processing is one mechanism to modulate cellular glycosylation. We evaluated the expression of genes that encode glycan-modifying enzymes using RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR with RNA isolated from primary NK cells from three healthy donors in addition to samples taken from the HEK293F, NK92, and YTS cells lines. A principal component analysis of the RNA-Seq data showed the formation of distinct clusters formed by each cell line (Fig. S3). Furthermore, changes in the expression of key transcripts encoding N-glycan-modifying enzymes from each cell line relative to primary NK cells showed a strong correlation with data from the qRT-PCR including an R2 value of 0.98 and 0.84 comparing changes between methods for HEK293F cells and NK92 cells, respectively (Tables S1 and S2). The correlation of the YTS data was lower, with an R2 of 0.31; however, this correlation is strongly influenced by a single observation that is expressed at low levels in only two of the seven YTS cell samples and showed no significant difference in the qRT-PCR data (ST8SIA2). Removing this data point increases the correlation to 0.68. We will discuss changes from the RNA-Seq data in the following discussion owing to the high similarity of the RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR and the greater depth of gene coverage in the RNA-Seq data. A pairwise comparison of the normalized mean count for each transcript revealed thousands of differences between different cell lines. One striking difference was the ∼1000-fold higher expression of the B3GAT1 transcript in primary NK cells as compared with NK92 and YTS cells (Table S1).

https://openalex.org/W3111377503,"Reproduction is highly sensitive to changes in physiology and the external environment. Neuropeptides are evolutionarily conserved signaling molecules that regulate multiple physiological processes. However, the potential reproductive roles of many neuropeptide signaling pathways remain underexplored. Here, we describe the results of RNAi-based screens in Drosophila melanogaster to identify neuropeptides/neuropeptide receptors with potential roles in oogenesis. The screen read-outs were either the number of eggs laid per female per day over time or fluorescence microscopy analysis of dissected ovaries. We found that the orphan neuropeptide receptor encoded by moody (homologous to mammalian melatonin receptors) is likely required in somatic cells for normal egg production and proper germline stem cell maintenance. However, the egg laying screens had low signal-to-noise ratio and did not lead to the identification of additional candidates. Thus, although egg count assays might be useful for large-scale screens to identify oogenesis regulators that result in dramatic changes in oogenesis, more labor-intensive microscopy-based screen are better applicable for identifying new physiological regulators of oogenesis with more subtle phenotypes."

However, specificity is a kinetic phenomenon and the roles of Mg2+ ions in each step in the catalysis have not been resolved. We first examined the roles of Mg2+ by kinetic analysis of single nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by HIV reverse transcriptase. We show that Mg.dNTP binding induces an enzyme conformational change at a rate that is independent of free Mg2+ concentration. Subsequently, the second Mg2+ binds to the closed state of the enzyme–DNA–Mg.dNTP complex (Kd = 3.7 mM) to facilitate catalysis. Weak binding of the catalytic Mg2+ contributes to fidelity by sampling the correctly aligned substrate without perturbing the equilibrium for nucleotide binding at physiological Mg2+ concentrations. An increase of the Mg2+ concentration from 0.25 to 10 mM increases nucleotide specificity (kcat/Km) 12-fold largely by increasing the rate of the chemistry relative to the rate of nucleotide release. Mg2+ binds very weakly (Kd ≤ 37 mM) to the open state of the enzyme. Analysis of published crystal structures showed that HIV reverse transcriptase binds only two metal ions prior to incorporation of a correct base pair. Molecular dynamics simulations support the two-metal ion mechanism and the kinetic data indicating weak binding of the catalytic Mg2+.

Metal ions play critical roles in many biological activities including DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription as well as other phosphoryl-group transfer reactions, including some ribozymes, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinases (1Steitz T.A.

Magnesium ion (Mg2+) serves as the primary metal ion for catalysis, owing to its natural abundance in vivo and restricted coordination geometry conferring high stereoselectivity (7Fenstermacher K.J.

The role of metal ions in DNA polymerization and hydrolysis was first described by Steitz in 1993 (1Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) who proposed a two-metal-ion mechanism in which one metal ion forms a tight complex with the incoming nucleotide by coordinating with nonbridging oxygens from all three phosphates (8Martell L.

A second metal ion reduces the pKa of the 3'-OH group for polymerization (or of a water molecule for hydrolysis), thereby activating the nucleophile and bringing it close to the α-phosphate at the reaction center. The coordinated action of two metal ions, water molecules, and several surrounding acidic residues helps to stabilize the transition state (6Yang L.J. Arora K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Schlick T.

After polymerization, Mg-pyrophosphate (Mg.PPi) is released from the enzyme (1Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA polymerases: structural diversity and common mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, crystal structures only provide a static picture of the active site, do not reveal weakly bound metal ions or their dynamic movements, and do not reveal the pathway or thermodynamics of the reaction. Moreover, dideoxy-terminated primer, calcium ions, or nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs are usually used in crystal structures to prevent catalysis and these may disrupt the active site geometry and the conformational state of the enzyme. Recently it has been proposed that a third metal ion may be required for catalysis (12Nakamura T. Zhao Y. Yamagata Y. Hua Y.J. Yang W. Watching DNA polymerase eta make a phosphodiester bond.Nature. 2012; 487: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Yang W. Weng P.J. Gao Y. A new paradigm of DNA synthesis: three-metal-ion catalysis.Cell Biosci. 2016; 6: 51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The third metal ion is seen predominantly in DNA repair enzymes and may be associated with the stabilization of the product pyrophosphate (PPi) (14Stevens D.R. Hammes-Schiffer S. Exploring the role of the third active site metal ion in DNA polymerase eta with QM/MM free energy simulations.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140: 8965-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but the role of a possible third metal ion in catalysis remains unresolved (15Tsai M.D. Catalytic mechanism of DNA polymerases-Two metal ions or three?.Protein Sci. 2019; 28: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and has not been seen in higher-fidelity enzymes. Enzyme mechanism and specificity are kinetic phenomena that cannot be addressed by structural studies alone. Rather, structural studies provide the framework to design and interpret kinetic and mechanistic experiments, so the two approaches together provide new insights. To further understand the role of Mg2+ in catalysis and specificity, studies on the dynamics of the metal ions under biologically relevant conditions are required. HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) belongs to the A family of moderate- to high-fidelity enzymes. It serves as a good candidate for studying the two-metal-ion mechanism because kinetic characterization of single nucleotide incorporation has established the mechanistic basis for polymerase fidelity and has defined the role of a nucleotide-induced conformational change step in specificity (16Kellinger M.W. Johnson K.A. Role of induced fit in limiting discrimination against AZT by HIV reverse transcriptase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5008-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. A new paradigm for DNA polymerase specificity.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These studies have established the following minimal pathway for nucleotide incorporation for HIV-RT. Specificity for cognate nucleotide incorporation by HIV-RT is a function on an induced-fit mechanism where kcat/Km is defined by the rate of the fast conformational change to the closed state (k2) divided by the Kd for the weak binding of nucleotide to the open state of the enzyme (18Kellinger M.W. Johnson K.A. Nucleotide-dependent conformational change governs specificity and analog discrimination by HIV reverse transcriptase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 7734-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Johnson K.A. Kinetic Analysis for the New Enzymology: Using Computer Simulation to Learn Kinetics and Solve Mechanisms. KinTek Corporation, Austin, TX2019Google Scholar) as shown in Figure 1 (kcat/Km = K1k2). The closed state traps the nucleotide and aligns catalytic residues to facilitate fast catalysis. Under the conditions used in this study, the release of Mg.PPi is fast, so the data collected for the forward reaction cannot define k−3, the reverse of chemistry. With an RNA template, release of Mg.PPi is slow, so the chemical reaction approaches an equilibrium to provide an estimate of k−3 based on the concentration dependence of the amplitude of the reaction (20Li A. Gong S.Z. Johnson K.A. Rate-limiting pyrophosphate release by HIV reverse transcriptase improves fidelity.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 26554-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that Mg.dNTP is the substrate for the reaction, the roles of the second Mg2+ in each of these steps are not known, and without this information the role of Mg2+ in specificity cannot be established. For example, what is the order of binding the second Mg2+ relative to other steps in the pathway? Does Mg2+ bind to the open state? What is the net Kd for binding the catalytic Mg2+ to either the open or the closed state? How does free Mg2+ ion affect ground-state binding, conformational change, chemistry, and PPi release? How does the free Mg2+ concentration alter nucleotide specificity? Is there evidence for the involvement of a third metal ion? In this study, we addressed these questions by examining the Mg2+ concentration dependence of each step in the reaction pathway in order to estimate the initial binding affinity of Mg.dNTP to the open state of the enzyme, the rate of the nucleotide-induced conformational change, the rate of nucleotide release before chemistry, the rate of the chemical reaction, and the rate of product release. This analysis allows us to resolve the contributions of each metal ion toward enzyme specificity. We also use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to view the binding of Mg2+ to multiple sites on the enzyme–DNA complex. The results from MD simulations are consistent with experimental measurements of binding affinity and provide molecular details for aspects of Mg2+ binding that cannot be observed directly. The studies performed here provide new insights toward understanding the role of metal ions in DNA polymerase fidelity. We show that Mg.dNTP is necessary and sufficient to induce the conformational change from the open to the closed state. The second Mg2+ binds after the conformational change, stabilizes the closed state, and stimulates the chemical reaction. Accordingly, we will refer the second metal ion as the catalytic Mg2+ to distinguish it from the nucleotide-bound Mg2+, although it must be clear that both metal ions are required for catalysis. In the course of performing these experiments, we also developed a simplified method to accurately define concentrations of free Mg2+ and Mg.dNTP in solution using a Mg-EDTA buffer. To address the role of Mg2+ in catalysis and specificity, we systematically studied the effects of free Mg2+ concentration on each step of the nucleotide incorporation pathway outlined in Figure 1: ground-state binding (K1), forward and reverse rates of the conformational change (k2 and k−2), chemistry (k3), and PPi release (k4). We began by measuring the rate and equilibrium constants governing nucleotide binding and enzyme conformational dynamics. To study the kinetics and equilibria for binding of Mg.dTTP to HIV-RT, we used HIV-RT labeled with MDCC (7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl) coumarin) on the fingers domain as described previously. The labeling provides a signal to measure the conformational changes between open and closed states (16Kellinger M.W. Johnson K.A. Role of induced fit in limiting discrimination against AZT by HIV reverse transcriptase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5008-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fluorescence change was recorded using a stopped flow instrument after rapidly mixing various concentrations of Mg.dTTP with an enzyme–DNA complex formed with a dideoxy-terminated primer (EDdd) so that Mg.dTTP binds but does not react to mimic conditions used to solve crystal structures (21Huang H.F. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Structure of a covalently trapped catalytic complex of HIV-I reverse transcriptase: implications for drug resistance.Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The fluorescence signal is due to the fast closing of the enzyme after Mg.dTTP binding, but at low concentrations of nucleotide the rate is limited by the kinetics of binding, affording measurement of the net second-order rate constant for Mg.dNTP binding (Fig. 2). Under conditions of rapid equilibrium substrate binding, the reaction follows a single exponential with an observed decay rate (eigenvalue, λ) that is a hyperbolic function of the substrate concentration. At low substrate concentrations, the slope of the concentration dependence defines the apparent second-order rate constant for substrate binding, kon.Y=A0+A1(1−e−λt)λ=K1k2[Mg.dNTP]K1[Mg.dNTP]+1+k−2kon=dλd[Mg.dNTP]=K1k2When[Mg.dNTP]<<1/K1koff=k−2Kd=koff/kon(1) Because binding data were collected only at low nucleotide concentrations, the data did not resolve K1 and k2; rather, we only determined the apparent second-order rate constant for Mg.dNTP binding given by the product K1k2. The kinetics of binding are shown at various concentrations of Mg.dTTP in Figure 3, A and C in the presence of 10 and 0.25 mM free Mg2+, respectively. It should be noted that the Kd for Mg2+ binding to nucleotide is 29 μM (9Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Concentration of MgATP2- and other ions in solution. Calculation of the true concentrations of species present in mixtures of associating ions.Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), so the Mg.dTTP complex is saturated even at the lowest concentrations of Mg2+ used in this study. The need to maintain saturation of the Mg.dTTP complex set a lower limit for the concentrations of free Mg2+ that we could explore. In Figure 3, A and C, the rate and amplitude of the reaction increase as a function of Mg.dTTP concentration so that both the forward and reverse rate constants can be defined from the data. That is, the rate of binding is a function of the sum of the forward and reverse rate constants, while the fluorescence endpoint defines the equilibrium constant, which gives the ratio of the rate constants. In global data fitting, the information is combined to define both forward and reverse rate constants (kon = K1k2 and koff = k−2). As a further test, we performed equilibrium titrations (Fig. 3, B and D for 10 and 0.25 mM Mg2+, respectively). Global fitting of the two experiments at each Mg2+ concentration using the model shown in Figure 2 allows us to accurately define the net dissociation constant for Mg.dTTP, Kd = koff/kon = 1/(K1(1 + K2)) ≈ 1/K1K2, as well as the rate constants governing binding and dissociation as summarized in Table 1. From these results we concluded that the free Mg2+ concentration has little effect on the net nucleotide binding affinity. In the studies described below, we resolved these two constants (K1 and k2) using the full reaction with a normal DNA primer. The experiments reported here correlate our fluorescence signal with published structures and serve as a control for the effects of the dideoxy-terminated primer on the binding kinetics. In the next set of experiments, we measured the kinetics of reaction with a normal primer.Table 1Kinetic and equilibrium constants for Mg.dTTP binding to EDdd[Mg2+] mMKd (μM)kon (μM−1 s−1)koff (s−1)100.67 ± 0.016 ± 0.14 ± 0.060.251.2 ± 0.078.8 ± 0.59.7 ± 0.2Rate and equilibrium constants were derived in globally fitting data in Figure 3, according to the scheme in Figure 2. Open table in a new tab Rate and equilibrium constants were derived in globally fitting data in Figure 3, according to the scheme in Figure 2. To measure the effects of free Mg2+ concentration on each step of the nucleotide incorporation pathway, experiments to measure the kinetics of nucleotide binding and dissociation, enzyme conformational changes, chemistry, and PPi release were all fitted globally at each free Mg2+ concentration. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 show the results obtained at 10, 1, and 0.25 mM free Mg2+, respectively. Figure 4A shows the time dependence of the fluorescence change after mixing the enzyme–DNA complex with various concentrations of Mg.dTTP. In each single turnover experiment, the decrease in fluorescence is due to enzyme closing after nucleotide binding, whereas the increase in fluorescence is due to enzyme opening after chemistry.Figure 5Correct nucleotide binding and incorporation in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+.

Experiments were performed as described in Figure 4, but at 0.25 mM Mg2+, except that the method to measure nucleotide dissociation was modified owing to the low efficiency of the nucleotide trap at low Mg2+ concentration. We used a combination of two enzymes (unlabeled HIV-RT-DNA and apyrase) to trap and digest free nucleotides in solution (Fig. 6B). The k−2 value obtained by this method was 9.9 ± 0.4 s−1. Four experiments were fit simultaneously to define each kinetic parameter governing nucleotide incorporation in the presence of 0.25 mM free Mg2+ as shown in Figure 1 and summarized in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To measure the rate of the reverse of the conformational change, the nucleotide dissociation rate was measured by rapidly mixing a preformed enzyme–DNAdd–dTTP complex (100 nM MDCC-labeled HIV-RT, 150 nM 25ddA/45 nt, 1 μM Mg.dTTP) with a nucleotide trap that consists of 2 μM unlabeled enzyme–DNA complex (Fig. 4B). Because the DNA primer was dideoxy terminated, premixing the EDdd complex with the incoming nucleotide allows the binding but not the chemistry. After the addition of the large excess of the unlabeled enzyme–DNA complex, the rate of the fluorescence change defines the rate for the reverse of the conformational change, allowing rapid release of the nucleotide. Because these data were fit using computer simulation and we included the known kinetics of the nucleotide binding to the enzyme–DNA nucleotide trap, it was not necessary to repeat this experiment at multiple concentrations of the nucleotide trap. These results define Mg.dNTP binding and release and agree with the measurement of the net equilibrium constant shown in Figure 3, B and D. In the next experiment, the rate of chemistry was measured in a rapid quench-flow assay (Fig. 4C). An enzyme–DNA complex (32P-labeled primer) was rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of incoming nucleotide. The rate of product formation as a function of nucleotide concentration was used to define the maximum polymerization rate (kcat) of the reaction and the specificity constant (kcat/Km). The data in Figure 4 (as well as Figs. 5 and 6) were fit globally using Figure 1. The estimated rate constants were used to calculate kcat and kcat/Km using Equation 4 (Experimental procedures). To measure the rate of PPi release, a coupled pyrophosphatase/phosphate sensor assay was performed as described (22Hanes J.W. Johnson K.A. Real-time measurement of pyrophosphate release kinetics.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Hanes J.W. Johnson K.A. A novel mechanism of selectivity against AZT by the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6973-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because there is a large fluorescent change upon phosphate binding to MDCC-PBP (MDCC-labeled phosphate binding protein) and the rate of phosphate binding to MDCC-PBP is much faster than that of the PPi release from HIV-RT (24Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Mechanism of inorganic phosphate interaction with phosphate binding protein from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the time course of the fluorescent change defines the rate of PPi release (22Hanes J.W. Johnson K.A. Real-time measurement of pyrophosphate release kinetics.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our data show that the rate of PPi release was coincident with the rates of chemistry and of reopening the enzyme as measured by the signal from fluorescently labeled HIV-RT. In modeling the data by computer simulation, a lower limit on the rate of the PPi release was set at >5-fold faster than the rate of the chemistry (Table 2), assuming opening was followed by PPi release. In fitting the data by simulation, the minimum rate of PPi release was defined as the value sufficient to make the two processes appear to coincide. Of course, we do not know the order of PPi release and enzyme opening because the two signals are coincident.Table 2Kinetic constants for Mg.dTTP binding, conformational change, incorporation, and PPi release[Mg2+] (mM)1/K1 (μM)k2 (s−1)k−2 (s−1)K2k3 (s−1)k4 (s−1)10275 ± 32000 ± 673.9 ± 0.1513 ± 2221 ± 0.1>1001213 ± 31960 ± 1739.4 ± 0.2209 ± 196 ± 0.1>1600.25216 ± 21910 ± 1789.7 ± 0.2197 ± 190.6 ± 0.01>20Rate and equilibrium constants were derived in globally fitting data in Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 as described in the Results. Rate constants refer to Figure 1. Open table in a new tab Rate and equilibrium constants were derived in globally fitting data in Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 as described in the Results. Rate constants refer to Figure 1. The four experiments were fit simultaneously to rigorously define kinetic parameters governing nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 1) to get the results summarized in Table 2. To investigate the effects of free Mg2+ concentration on each step of the pathway, similar experiments and analyses were repeated at 1 and 0.25 mM free Mg2+ as shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The results show that Mg2+ concentrations (from 0.25 to 10 mM) do not significantly affect the ground-state Mg.dNTP binding (K1) or the rate of the conformational change (k2) but greatly affect the rate of the chemistry (k3) and less so the reverse of the conformational change (or enzyme reopening) (k−2). Although it appears that Mg2+ concentrations affect the rate of PPi release, this reflects the rates of chemistry—our simulation only gives a lower limit and therefore no direct measurement of the PPi release rate was possible. Our data support the conclusion that PPi release was not rate limiting at any of the Mg2+ concentrations examined. The experiments shown in Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 are not sufficient to resolve the rate of the conformational change step because it is too fast to measure directly at 37 °C. Therefore, we measured the concentration dependence of the fluorescence transient at several temperatures and then extrapolated the observed rate constant (k2) to estimate the value at 37 °C. The enzyme–DNA complex was rapidly mixed with various concentrations of dTTP as described in Figures 4A and 5A, and 6A but repeated at temperatures of 5, 10, 18, and 25 °C. At each dTTP concentration the fluorescence transient was biphasic and was fit to a double exponential function:Y=A1e−λ1t+A2e−λ2t+cλ1=K1k2[MgdNTP]1+K1[MgdNTP]+k−2+k3(2) The concentration dependence of the rate of the fast phase of the fluorescence transient was then fit to a hyperbolic equation to obtain the maximum rate of the observed conformational change (λmax = k2 + k−2 + k3) at each temperature. Note that k−2 and k3 are much smaller than k2 so λmax ≅ k2. The experiments were repeated at various concentrations of free Mg2+: 0.25 mM (Fig. 7A), 1 mM (Fig. 7C), and 10 mM (Fig. 7E). The observed maximum decay rate (λmax) observed at each temperature was then graphed on an Arrhenius plot (Fig. 7, B, D and F) and the values of k2 at 37 °C at each of three different free Mg2+ concentrations were obtained by extrapolation by linear regression. The results indicate that Mg2+ concentrations (from 0.25 to 10 mM) do not affect the rate constant for the conformational change (k2) (Tables 2 and 3). These results imply that Mg2+ binding from solution (at a concentration greater than 0.25 mM) is not required for the conformational change step, but it is required for the chemical reaction. By combining the rate constant for the conformational change (k2) with the estimates of k−2 from the nucleotide dissociation rate, we can calculate the equilibrium constant for the conformational change step (K2, Table 2).Table 3Temperature dependence of HIV-RT conformational change at various concentrations of free Mg2+[Mg2+] (mM)k2 value at 5 °C, (s−1)k2 value at 10 °C, (s−1)k2 value at 18 °C, (s−1)k2 value at 25 °C, (s−1)0.25104 ± 10157 ± 7343 ± 34707 ± 691110 ± 12163 ± 14388 ± 56702 ± 2710150 ± 6225 ± 13461 ± 17805 ± 68Kinetic parameters were derived in fitting data in Figure 7 as described in the Results. Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were derived in fitting data in Figure 7 as described in the Results. The substrate, Mg.dTTP, binds initially to the open state with a relatively weak affinity, Kd = 275 μM at 10 mM Mg2+, which is followed by the conformational change leading to a much tighter nucleotide binding. The net Kd for the two-step binding is defined by:Kd,net=1K1(1+K2) Accordingly, the net Kd for Mg.dTTP binding at 10 mM Mg2+ was 0.5 μM and increased to values of 1.0 and 1.1 μM at 1 and 0.25 mM Mg2+, respectively (Table 2). Thus, the nucleotide binding gets slightly tighter as the Mg2+ concentration increases, but this net effect is a product of opposing effects in the two-step binding, which we explore further below. The apparent binding affinity for the catalytic Mg2+ was measured more accurately by examining the Mg2+ concentration dependence of the rate of catalysis in a single turnover experiment. The experiment was performed by mixing an ED complex with"
https://openalex.org/W3112725876,"X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disease linked to an insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA)-type retrotransposon within an intron of TAF1 . This SVA insertion induces aberrant TAF1 splicing and partial intron retention, thereby decreasing levels of the full-length transcript. Here we sought to determine if these altered transcriptional dynamics caused by the SVA are also accompanied by local changes in histone acetylation, given that these modifications influence gene expression. Because TAF1 protein may itself exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity, we also examined whether decreased TAF1 expression in XDP cell lines and post-mortem brain affects global levels of acetylated histone H3 (AcH3). The results demonstrate that total AcH3 are not altered in XDP post-mortem prefrontal cortex or cell lines. We also did not detect local differences in AcH3 associated with TAF1 exons or intronic sites flanking the SVA insertion. There was, however, a decrease in AcH3 association with the exon immediately proximal to the intronic SVA, and this decrease was normalized by CRISPR/Cas-excision of the SVA. Collectively, these data suggest that the SVA insertion alters histone status in this region, which may contribute to the dysregulation of TAF1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W3113067074,"The main ingredient of sunless tanning products is dihydroxyacetone (DHA). DHA reacts with the protein and amino acid composition in the surface layers of the skin, producing melanoidins, which changes the skin colour, imitating natural skin tan caused by melanin. The purpose of this study was to characterise DHA-induced skin colour changes and to test whether we can predict the outcome of DHA application on skin tone changes. To assess the DHA-induced skin colour shift quantitatively, colorimetric and spectral measurements of the inner forearm were obtained before, four hours and 24 hours after application of a 7.5% concentration DHA gel in the experimental group ( n = 100). In a control group ( n = 60), the same measurements were obtained on both the inner forearm (infrequently sun-exposed) and the outer forearm (frequently sun-exposed); the difference between these two areas was defined as the naturally occurring tan. Skin colour shifts caused by DHA tanning and by natural tanning were compared in terms of lightness ( L *), redness ( a *) and yellowness ( b *) in the standard CIELAB colour space. Naturalness of the DHA-induced skin tan was evaluated by comparing the trajectory of the chromaticity distribution in ( L *, b *) space with that of naturally occurring tan. Twenty-four hours after DHA application, approximately 20% of the skin colour samples became excessively yellow, with chromaticities outside the natural range in ( L *, b *) space. A principal component analysis was used to characterise the tanning pathway. Skin colour shifts induced by DHA were predicted by a multiple regression on the chromaticities and the skin properties. The model explained up to 49% of variance in colorimetric components with a median error of less than 2 ΔE. We conclude that the control of both the magnitude and the direction of the colour shift is a critical factor to achieve a natural appearance."
https://openalex.org/W3112237985,"A large number of psychophysical and neurophysiological studies have demonstrated that smooth pursuit eye movements are tightly related to visual motion perception. This could be due to the fact that visual motion sensitive cortical areas such as meddle temporal (MT), medial superior temporal (MST) areas are involved in motion perception as well as pursuit initiation. Although the directional-discrimination and perceived target velocity tasks are used to evaluate visual motion perception, it is still uncertain whether the speed of visual motion perception, which is determined by visuomotor reaction time (RT) to a small target, is related to pursuit initiation. Therefore, we attempted to determine the relationship between pursuit latency/acceleration and the visual motion RT which was measured to the visual motion stimuli that moved leftward or rightward. The participants were instructed to fixate on a stationary target and press one of the buttons corresponding to the direction of target motion as soon as possible once the target starts to move. We applied five different visual motion stimuli including first- and second-order motion for smooth pursuit and visual motion RT tasks. It is well known that second-order motion induces lower retinal image motion, which elicits weaker responses in MT and MST compared to first-order motion stimuli. Our results showed that pursuit initiation including latency and initial eye acceleration were suppressed by second-order motion. In addition, second-order motion caused a delay in visual motion RT. The better performances in both pursuit initiation and visual motion RT were observed for first-order motion, whereas second-order (theta motion) induced remarkable deficits in both variables. Furthermore, significant Pearson’s correlation and within-subjects correlation coefficients were obtained between visual motion RT and pursuit latency/acceleration. Our findings support the suggestion that there is a common neuronal pathway involved in both pursuit initiation and the speed of visual motion perception."

Research has highlighted gaps in the surveillance for tuberculosis that range from failure to collect real-time data to lack of standardization of data for informed decision-making at different levels of the health system. Our research aims to advance conceptual and methodological foundations for the development of a learning surveillance system for Tuberculosis, that involves systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and feedback of outcome-specific data. It would concurrently involve the health care delivery system, public health laboratory, and epidemiologists. For our study, we systemically framed the cyber environment of TB surveillance as an ontology of the learning surveillance system. We validated the ontology by binary coding of dimensions and elements of the ontology with the metadata from an existing surveillance platform—GPMS TB Transportal. Results show GPMS TB Transportal collects a critical range of data for active case investigation and presumptive case screening for identifying and detecting confirmed TB cases. It is therefore targeted at assisting the Active Case Finding program. Building on the results, we demonstrate enhanced surveillance strategies for GPMS that are enumerated as pathways in the ontology. Our analysis reveals the scope for embedding learning surveillance pathways for digital applications in Direct Benefit Transfer, and Drug Resistance Treatment in National TB Elimination Programme in India. We discuss the possibilities of developing the transportal into a multi-level computer-aided decision support system for TB, using the innumerable pathways encapsulated in the ontology."
https://openalex.org/W3112045484,"Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in optic neuropathies results in permanent partial or complete blindness. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors have been shown to play a pivotal role in neuronal systems, and in particular MEF2A knockout was shown to enhance RGC survival after optic nerve crush injury. Here we expanded these prior data to study bi-allelic, tri-allelic and heterozygous allele deletion. We observed that deletion of all MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D alleles had no effect on RGC survival during development. Our extended experiments suggest that the majority of the neuroprotective effect was conferred by complete deletion of MEF2A but that MEF2D knockout, although not sufficient to increase RGC survival on its own, increased the positive effect of MEF2A knockout. Conversely, MEF2A over-expression in wildtype mice worsened RGC survival after optic nerve crush. Interestingly, MEF2 transcription factors are regulated by post-translational modification, including by calcineurin-catalyzed dephosphorylation of MEF2A Ser-408 known to increase MEF2A-dependent transactivation in neurons. However, neither phospho-mimetic nor phospho-ablative mutation of MEF2A Ser-408 affected the ability of MEF2A to promote RGC death in vivo after optic nerve injury. Together these findings demonstrate that MEF2 gene expression opposes RGC survival following axon injury in a complex hierarchy, and further support the hypothesis that loss of or interference with MEF2A expression might be beneficial for RGC neuroprotection in diseases such as glaucoma and other optic neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W3113310116,"Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by massive intracellular accumulation of cholesterol. In most cases, loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 gene that encodes lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 are responsible for the disease, and more than half of the mutations are considered to interfere with the biogenesis or folding of the protein. We previously identified a series of oxysterol derivatives and phenanthridine-6-one derivatives as pharmacological chaperones, i.e., small molecules that can rescue folding-defective phenotypes of mutated NPC1, opening up an avenue to develop chaperone therapy for Niemann-Pick disease type C. Here, we present an improved image-based screen for NPC1 chaperones and we describe its application for drug-repurposing screening. We identified some azole antifungals, including itraconazole and posaconazole, and a kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, as probable pharmacological chaperones. A photo-crosslinking study confirmed direct binding of itraconazole to a representative folding-defective mutant protein, NPC1-I1061T. Competitive photo-crosslinking experiments suggested that oxysterol-based chaperones and itraconazole share the same or adjacent binding site(s), and the sensitivity of the crosslinking to P691S mutation in the sterol-sensing domain supports the hypothesis that their binding sites are located near this domain. Although the azoles were less effective in reducing cholesterol accumulation than the oxysterol-derived chaperones or an HDAC inhibitor, LBH-589, our findings should offer new starting points for medicinal chemistry efforts to develop better pharmacological chaperones for NPC1."
https://openalex.org/W3111444324,"This study aimed to directly analyze the potential relationship of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) before and after the administration of TNF-α inhibitors (TNFi) with the appearance of anti-drug antibodies (ADrA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 121 cases, viz., 38, 53, and 30 cases treated with infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA), and etanercept (ETN), respectively, were enrolled. The ANA titers were measured using indirect immunefluorescence assay (IF-ANA) and multiplex flow immunoassay (ANA Screen) before and serially during the therapy. The anti-IFX antibodies (HACA) and anti-ADA antibodies (AAA) were measured with a radioimmunoassay. ADrA turned positive in 14 (36.8%) among 38 patients treated with IFX, and 16 (30.2%) among 53 treated with ADA. All of them were positive for IF-ANA before TNFi administration, while ADrA never appeared in any of the 15 patients negative for IF-ANA (&lt; 40). IF-ANA of high titers (≥ 320 and ≥ 640) before IFX treatment showed a significant association with the appearance of HACA 52 weeks after IFX ( P = 0.040 and 0.017, respectively), whereas AAA appearance was not related to IF-ANA titers before treatment. Moreover, IF-ANA of high titers before IFX treatment was significantly associated with inefficacy and discontinuation of the treatment. The positivity of anti-SS-A antibodies before therapy might be a risk factor for ADrA appearance in patients treated with IFX or ADA. The percentage of patients whose IF-ANA titers increased was significantly higher with IFX than with ADA or ETN treatments ( P = 0.026 and 0.022, respectively). High ANA titers and positive ANA Screen after IFX therapy showed a significant association with HACA appearance and possibly led to treatment failure. Among the three TNFi, only IFX showed a close relationship with IF-ANA and ADrA appearance, suggesting the interaction of immunogenicity with autoimmunity as well as the advantage of ANA measurement before TNFi therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3111746929,"Mental disorders (MD) are associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) and with higher CHD-related morbidity and mortality. There is a strong recommendation to routinely screen CHD patients for MDs, diagnosis, and treatment by recent guidelines. The current study aimed at mapping CHD patients' (1) state of diagnostics and, if necessary, treatment of MDs, (2) trajectories and detection rate in healthcare, and (3) the influence of MDs and its management on quality of life and patient satisfaction. The design was a cross-sectional study in three settings (two hospitals, two rehabilitation clinics, three cardiology practices). CHD patients were screened for MDs with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and, if screened-positive, examined for MDs with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I). Quality of Life (EQ-5D), Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC), and previous routine diagnostics and treatment for MDs were examined. Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared tests, and ANOVA were used for analyses. Analyses of the data of 364 patients resulted in 33.8% positive HADS-screenings and 28.0% SCID-I diagnoses. The detection rate of correctly pre-diagnosed MDs was 49.0%. Physicians actively approached approximately thirty percent of patients on MDs; however, only 6.6% of patients underwent psychotherapy and 4.1% medication therapy through psychotherapists/psychiatrists. MD patients scored significantly lower on EQ-5D and the PACIC. The state of diagnostic and treatment of comorbid MDs in patients with CHD is insufficient. Patients showed a positive attitude towards addressing MDs and were satisfied with medical treatment, but less with MD-related advice. Physicians in secondary care need more training inadequately addressing mental comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3111987521,"Targeted proteomics utilizing antibody-based proximity extension assays provides sensitive and highly specific quantifications of plasma protein levels. Multivariate analysis of this data is hampered by frequent missing values (random or left censored), calling for imputation approaches. While appropriate missing-value imputation methods exist, benchmarks of their performance in targeted proteomics data are lacking. Here, we assessed the performance of two methods for imputation of values missing completely at random, the previously top-benchmarked ‘missForest’ and the recently published ‘GSimp’ method. Evaluation was accomplished by comparing imputed with remeasured relative concentrations of 91 inflammation related circulating proteins in 86 samples from a cohort of 645 patients with venous thromboembolism. The median Pearson correlation between imputed and remeasured protein expression values was 69.0% for missForest and 71.6% for GSimp (p = 5.8e-4). Imputation with missForest resulted in stronger reduction of variance compared to GSimp (median relative variance of 25.3% vs. 68.6%, p = 2.4e-16) and undesired larger bias in downstream analyses. Irrespective of the imputation method used, the 91 imputed proteins revealed large variations in imputation accuracy, driven by differences in signal to noise ratio and information overlap between proteins. In summary, GSimp outperformed missForest, while both methods show good overall imputation accuracy with large variations between proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3112897364,"A widening evidence base across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) points towards mutually reinforcing linkages between poverty and mental health problems. The use of validated and culturally relevant measures of mental health outcomes is crucial to the expansion of evidence. At present, there is a paucity of measures that have been tested and validated in contexts of extreme poverty. Using data from adult women living in extreme poverty in rural Haiti this study assesses the cross-cultural validity of the widely used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and its applicability in assessing linkages between poverty and mental health outcomes. We find no evidence for a one-dimensional 10-factor structure of the RSES within our data and agree with other authors that the standard self-esteem model does not fit well in this cultural context. Comparisons with another widely used measure of mental health–the K6 measure–indicate that the RSES cannot be used as a proxy for mental health outcomes. We conclude that the use of the RSES in different cultural contexts and with samples with different socioeconomic characteristics should be undertaken with caution; and that greater consideration of the validity of psychosocial constructs and their measurement is vital for gaining robust and replicable insights into breaking the cycle between poverty and mental health problems."
https://openalex.org/W3113171760,"We sought to develop a smooth and low cost sample preparation and DNA extraction protocol, streamlined with a ready-to-use qPCR in a portable instrument to overcome some of the existing hurdles. Several solutions were evaluated as to their ability to liquefy a mucin-based matrix. Each liquefied matrix, supplemented with either Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) H37Rv strain DNA or intact cells, was aliquoted onto a filter paper embedded with solubilizing agents, and was subsequently dried up. Most of the nucleic acids, including genomic DNA from the bacilli and the host, binds to the filter paper. Next, several protocols were evaluated to elute the DNA from the paper, using qPCR to detect the insertion sequence IS6110, a M . tuberculosis complex genomic marker. The limit of detection (LOD) of the best protocol was then evaluated using parallel seeding and colony counting. The protocol was also evaluated using seventeen sputum samples, previously characterized by the GeneXpert or culture. Two instruments (the ABI7500 Standard and the Q3-Plus system) and two reagents storage formats (frozen or ready-to-use) were evaluated. Solutions containing guanidine isothiocyanate exerted the best liquefying effect on the mucin-based matrix extracted from one 6-mm punches, followed by a brief incubation at 95°C. The resulting DNA contained impurities, but a simple 1:10 dilution elicited the detection of MTB and human genomic targets. The described protocol presented an apparent LOD of 02 CFU/mL of MTB. Challenging the protocol with previously characterized samples showed substantial agreement with GeneXpert MTB/RIF results (sensitivity of 90%, agreement of 88.9%, kappa coefficient of 0.77), and moderate agreement with culture results (sensitivity of 100%, agreement of 78.9%, kappa coefficient of 0.58). This work presents a sensitive proof–of-concept protocol for sputum liquefaction and decontamination followed by a simple DNA extraction procedure, in which the extraction steps are streamlined with a ready-to-use qPCR in a portable instrument that can be employed in low infrastructure settings."
https://openalex.org/W3113231317,"Hypertension is an important risk factor for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We have previously demonstrated that hypertensive rats fed a high fat and cholesterol (HFC) diet incurred a more severe hepatic inflammatory response and fibrosis. Here we investigated the role of hypertension in NASH by comparing HFC-induced hepatic fibrogenesis between spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and their normotensive Wistar Kyoto counterpart. Compared to the counterpart, the HFC diet led to stronger aggregation of CD68-positive macrophages in SHRs. HFC feeding also resulted in significantly higher upregulation of the fibrosis-related gene alpha-smooth muscle actin in SHR. The HFC diet induced higher overexpression of serum tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1) and greater suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2):TIMP1, MMP8:TIMP1, and MMP9:TIMP1 ratios, as a proxy of the activities of these MMPs in SHR. Administration of the antihypertensive agent hydralazine to SHRs significantly ameliorated HFC-induced liver fibrosis; it suppressed the aggregation of CD68-positive macrophages and the upregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and collagen, type 1, alpha-1 chain. In conclusion, a hypertensive environment exacerbated the hepatic fibrogenetic effects of the HFC diet; while the effects were partially reversed by the antihypertensive agent hydralazine. Our data suggest that antihypertensive drugs hold promise for treating NASH exacerbated by hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3111719622,"Background The etiology of postpartum psychopathologies are not well understood, but folate metabolism pathways are of potential interest. Demands for folate increase dramatically during pregnancy, low folate level has been associated with psychiatric disorders, and supplementation may improve symptomatology. The MTHFR C677T variant influences folate metabolism and has been implicated in depression during pregnancy. Objective To conduct a prospective longitudinal study to explore the relationship between MTHFR C677T genotype, folate levels, and postpartum psychopathology in at-risk women. Hypothesis In the first three months postpartum, folate will moderate a relationship between MTHFR genotype and depression, with TT homozygous women having more symptoms than CC homozygous women. Methods We recruited 365 pregnant women with a history of mood or psychotic disorder, and at 3 postpartum timepoints, administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M) and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and drew blood for genotype/folate level analysis. We used robust linear regression to investigate interactions between genotype and folate level on the highest EPDS and CARS-M scores, and logistic regression to explore interactions with PANSS psychosis scores above/below cut-off. Results There was no significant interaction effect between MTHFR genotype and folate level on highest EPDS (p = 0.36), but there was a significant interaction between genotype, folate level and log(CARS-M) (p = 0.02); post-hoc analyses revealed differences in the effect of folate level between CC/CT , and TT genotypes, with folate level in CC and CT having an inverse relationship with symptoms of mania, while there was no relationship in participants with TT genotype. There was no significant interaction between MTHFR genotype and folate level on the likelihood of meeting positive symptom criteria for psychosis on the PANSS (p = 0.86). Discussion These data suggest that perhaps there is a relationship between MTHFR C677T , folate level and some symptoms of postpartum psychopathology."

The objective of this study was to determine the outflow rates of two GF formulations (GF 1 04-14-08 and GF 2 04-30-10) using three types of fertilizer spreader—with one spiral roller (A), two spiral rollers (B), or a fluted roller (C)—and three operating speeds (1,11, 1.94, and 2.77 m s -1 ). The following parameters were determined in GFs: density, angle of repose, water content, and segregation (particle size). In the designed test bench, GFs were transferred from a reservoir to a spreader, and ultimately to a container, where they were weighed, and data were transmitted to the data acquisition system (DAS). A total of 7,560 outflow data points were collected (g s -1 ) and subjected to descriptive analysis of measures of central tendency, dispersion, asymmetry, and kurtosis, and Shewhart control charts were generated. Particle density and segregation were significantly different between the GFs, whereas the angle of repose and water content were not significantly different. The bench design and the DAS allowed measuring the outflow of GFs in different spreaders and demonstrated that this parameter was influenced by particle segregation. The segregation of GF 1 was higher than that of GF 2 . The outflow variability at the speed of 1.11 m s -1 was lower, and the spreader with a fluted roller had the highest uniformity and was the most suitable for application with variable rates."

Drastic changes on the theoretical eye anterior corneal asphericity have been performed to simulate myopic and hyperopic refractive surgeries. The effect of IOL misalignment and tilt on the image quality has been evaluated using a commercial optical software design for the three eye models. Image quality was assessed from the modulation transfer function (MTF), root mean square (RMS) values of defocus, astigmatism, coma and spherical aberration ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M2""><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> ), and retinal images obtained from a visual simulator using an aleatory optotype of 0.00 LogMar visual acuity (VA).

https://openalex.org/W3112056205,"Background The survival time of patients with early pancreatic cancer (PC) is still disappointing, even after surgical resection. PC has an extremely poor prognosis. Herein, we aimed to investigate the survival effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on resected stage I to II PC. Material and methods A large eligible sample of patients was identified from 2010 to 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Survival analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of PORT. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to reduce selection bias and to make the groups comparable. Results A total of 3219 patients with resected stage I to II PC was included after rigid screening. The median overall survival (OS) was 26 months with PORT (n = 1055) versus 21 months with non-PORT (n = 2164) before matching (p&lt;0.001). By multivariable analysis, PORT remained a favorable prognostic predictor for OS. In PSM analysis, receiving PORT was associated with improved OS (median, 26 months vs. 23 months; at 2 years, 51.7% vs. 46.7%; at 5 years, 23.3% vs. 17.4% (P = 0.006). After further meticulous exploration, only the stage IIB subgroup benefited from PORT (p&lt;0.001). This result was due to the positive lymph node state (N+), whose mortality risk was cut by 23.4% (p&lt;0.001) by PORT. Conclusion Addition of PORT to the treatment of patients with resected stage I to II PC conveys a survival benefit, particularly among those with N-positive or stage IIB disease."
https://openalex.org/W3112812882,"The substrates O2 and NO cooperatively activate the NO dioxygenase function of Escherichia coli flavohemoglobin. Steady-state and transient kinetic measurements support a structure-based mechanistic model in which O2 and NO movements and conserved amino acids at the E11, G8, E2, E7, B10, and F7 positions within the globin domain control activation. In the cooperative and allosteric mechanism, O2 migrates to the catalytic heme site via a long hydrophobic tunnel and displaces LeuE11 away from the ferric iron, which forces open a short tunnel to the catalytic site gated by the ValG8/IleE15 pair and LeuE11. NO permeates this tunnel and leverages upon the gating side chains triggering the CD loop to furl, which moves the E and F-helices and switches an electron transfer gate formed by LysF7, GlnE7, and water. This allows FADH2 to reduce the ferric iron, which forms the stable ferric–superoxide–TyrB10/GlnE7 complex. This complex reacts with internalized NO with a bimolecular rate constant of 1010 M−1 s−1 forming nitrate, which migrates to the CD loop and unfurls the spring-like structure. To restart the cycle, LeuE11 toggles back to the ferric iron. Actuating electron transfer with O2 and NO movements averts irreversible NO poisoning and reductive inactivation of the enzyme. Together, structure snapshots and kinetic constants provide glimpses of intermediate conformational states, time scales for motion, and associated energies."
https://openalex.org/W3110864055,"The integral membrane zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 plays a key role in the proteolytic processing of farnesylated prelamin A, the precursor of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A. Failure of this processing step results in the accumulation of permanently farnesylated forms of prelamin A which cause the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), as well as related progeroid disorders, and may also play a role in physiological aging. ZMPSTE24 is an intriguing and unusual protease because its active site is located inside of a closed intramembrane chamber formed by seven transmembrane spans with side portals in the chamber permitting substrate entry. The specific features of prelamin A that make it the sole known substrate for ZMPSTE24 in mammalian cells are not well-defined. At the outset of this work it was known that farnesylation is essential for prelamin A cleavage in vivo and that the C-terminal region of prelamin A (41 amino acids) is sufficient for recognition and processing. Here we investigated additional features of prelamin A that are required for cleavage by ZMPSTE24 using a well-established humanized yeast system. We analyzed the 14-residue C-terminal region of prelamin A that lies between the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site and the farnesylated cysteine, as well 23-residue region N-terminal to the cleavage site, by generating a series of alanine substitutions, alanine additions, and deletions in prelamin A. Surprisingly, we found that there is considerable flexibility in specific requirements for the length and composition of these regions. We discuss how this flexibility can be reconciled with ZMPSTE24’s selectivity for prelamin A."

The mechanism by which DAF-16 activity is regulated during aging has not been defined. Since phosphorylation of DAF-16 generally leads to its inhibition, we asked whether phosphatases might be necessary for its increased transcriptional activity in adult C . elegans . We focused on the PP2A/4/6 subfamily of phosphoprotein phosphatases, members of which had been implicated to regulate DAF-16 under low insulin signaling conditions but had not been investigated during aging in wildtype animals. Using reverse genetics, we functionally characterized all C . elegans orthologs of human catalytic, regulatory, and scaffolding subunits of PP2A/4/6 holoenzymes in postreproductive adults. We found that PP2A complex constituents PAA-1 and PPTR-1 regulate DAF-16 transcriptional activity during aging and that they cooperate with the catalytic subunit LET-92 to protect adult animals from ultraviolet radiation. PP4 complex members PPH-4.1/4.2, and SMK-1 also appear to regulate DAF-16 in an age-dependent manner, and together with PPFR-2 they contribute to innate immunity. Interestingly, SUR-6 but no other subunit of the PP2A complex was necessary for the survival of pathogen-infected animals. Finally, we found that PP6 complex constituents PPH-6 and SAPS-1 contribute to host defense during aging, apparently without affecting DAF-16 transcriptional activity. Our studies indicate that a set of PP2A/4/6 complexes protect adult C . elegans from environmental stress, thus preserving healthspan. Therefore, along with their functions in cell division and development, the PP2A/4/6 phosphatases also appear to play critical roles later in life."
https://openalex.org/W3112825673,"Background The search for a SARS-CoV-2 treatment has emerged as a worldwide priority. We evaluated the role of chloroquine and its derivatives in COVID-19 in Spanish individuals. Methods We performed a survey addressed to patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives for the control of their autoimmune diseases. The survey was distributed with special attention to Spanish patient associations centred on autoimmune diseases and rheumatology and to the general population. A sample of untreated subjects was matched to the treated group according to sex, age range and incidence region. COVID-19 disease prevalence was compared between treated and untreated-matched control sample. Results A total of 319 surveys of patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives were recovered for further analysis. The prevalence of declared COVID-19 status in the treated group was 5.3% and the mean prevalence among the untreated-matched groups was 3.4%. A community exposition to COVID-19 was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 in both, treated (17.0% vs. 3.2%; p-value&lt;0.001) and untreated groups (13.4% vs. 1.1%; p-value = 0.027). Conclusion We did not find differences of reported COVID-19 cases between treated and untreated groups, indicating a lack of protection by regular administration of chloroquine and its derivative drugs on COVID-19 infection. Of relevance, data indicates that patients that regularly take chloroquine derivatives are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and must take the same protection measures as the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3112927097,"Humans are notoriously bad at understanding probabilities, exhibiting a host of biases and distortions that are context dependent. This has serious consequences on how we assess risks and make decisions. Several theories have been developed to replace the normative rational expectation theory at the foundation of economics. These approaches essentially assume that (subjective) probabilities weight multiplicatively the utilities of the alternatives offered to the decision maker, although evidence suggest that probability weights and utilities are often not separable in the mind of the decision maker. In this context, we introduce a simple and efficient framework on how to describe the inherently probabilistic human decision-making process, based on a representation of the deliberation activity leading to a choice through stochastic processes, the simplest of which is a random walk. Our model leads naturally to the hypothesis that probabilities and utilities are entangled dual characteristics of the real human decision making process. It predicts the famous fourfold pattern of risk preferences. Through the analysis of choice probabilities, it is possible to identify two previously postulated features of prospect theory: the inverse S-shaped subjective probability as a function of the objective probability and risk-seeking behavior in the loss domain. It also predicts observed violations of stochastic dominance, while it does not when the dominance is “evident”. Extending the model to account for human finite deliberation time and the effect of time pressure on choice, it provides other sound predictions: inverse relation between choice probability and response time, preference reversal with time pressure, and an inverse double-S-shaped probability weighting function. Our theory, which offers many more predictions for future tests, has strong implications for psychology, economics and artificial intelligence."
https://openalex.org/W3113005925,"Background Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a severe inherited arrhythmic disease associated with a risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Aims We aimed at identifying RYR2 P2328S founder mutation carriers and describing the clinical course associated with the mutation. Methods The study population was drawn from the Finnish Inherited Cardiac Disorder Research Registry, and from the present genealogical study. Kaplan-Meier graphs, log-rank test and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the clinical course. Results Genealogical study revealed a common ancestor couple living in the late 17 th century. A total of 1837 living descendants were tested for RYR2 P2328S mutation unveiling 62 mutation carriers aged mean 39±23 years old. No arrhythmic deaths were documented among genotyped subjects, but 11 SCDs were detected in non-genotyped family members since 1970. Three genotyped patients (5%) suffered an aborted cardiac arrest (ACA), and 15 (25%) had a syncope triggered by exercise or stress. Rate of cardiac events was higher among patients who in exercise stress test showed a maximum rate of premature ventricular contractions &gt;30/min (68% vs 17%, p&lt;0.01; hazard ratio = 7.1, p = 0.02), in comparison to patients without the respective finding. A cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted to 13 (22%) patients, with an appropriate ICD shock in four (31%) subjects. All ICD shocks, one ACA, and one syncope occurred during β-blocker medication. Conclusions Previously undiagnosed CPVT patients may be identified by well-conducted genealogical studies. The RYR2 P2328S mutation causes a potentially severe phenotype, but its expression is variable, thus calling for additional studies on modifying factors."
https://openalex.org/W3113201731,"Firefly luciferase-based ATP detection assays are frequently used as a sensitive, cost-efficient method for monitoring hygiene in many industrial settings. Solutions of detection reagent, containing a mixture of a substrate and luciferase enzyme that produces photons in the presence of ATP, are relatively unstable and maintain only a limited shelf life even under refrigerated conditions. It is therefore common for the individual performing a hygiene test to manually prepare fresh reagent at the time of monitoring. To simplify sample processing, a liquid detection reagent with improved thermal stability is needed. The engineered firefly luciferase, Ultra-Glo™, fulfills one aspect of this need and has been valuable for hygiene monitoring because of its high resistance to chemical and thermal inactivation. However, solutions containing both Ultra-Glo™ luciferase and its substrate luciferin gradually lose the ability to effectively detect ATP over time. We demonstrate here that dehydroluciferin, a prevalent oxidative breakdown product of luciferin, is a potent inhibitor of Ultra-Glo™ luciferase and that its formation in the detection reagent is responsible for the decreased ability to detect ATP. We subsequently found that dialkylation at the 5-position of luciferin (e.g., 5,5-dimethylluciferin) prevents degradation to dehydroluciferin and improves substrate thermostability in solution. However, since 5,5-dialkylluciferins are poorly utilized by Ultra-Glo™ luciferase as substrates, we used structural optimization of the luciferin dialkyl modification and protein engineering of Ultra-Glo™ to develop a luciferase/luciferin pair that shows improved total reagent stability in solution at ambient temperature. The results of our studies outline a novel luciferase/luciferin system that could serve as foundations for the next generation of bioluminescence ATP detection assays with desirable reagent stability."
https://openalex.org/W3112603951,"Economic inequality is a collective issue that affects all citizens. However, people often fail to support redistribution strategies aimed at redressing inequality. In this work we investigated personal optimism and collective pessimism as psychological processes that contribute to hampering vs. promoting the demand for redistribution. Our prediction was that support for redistribution would require both a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective level and the perception of being economically disadvantaged. In two studies, one of which pre-registered, Italian participants (Study 1: N = 306; Study 2: N = 384) were led to feel relatively poor or rich, rated their perceived control over either their personal or the nation’s future and estimated either personal or national economic and general future risks. To measure support for redistribution, participants were invited to allocate their desired level of taxation to each of the five tax brackets included in the Italian personal income tax. Results showed that participants were optimistic about their personal future, but pessimistic about the fate of their nation. This difference was explained by respondents’ greater perceived control over personal future than over the nation’s future. Importantly, greater pessimism about national economic risks led to greater support for progressive taxation only for participants who felt relatively poor."
