Based on the panel data of 115 resource-based cities in China from 2011 to 2019, this paper discusses the influence mechanism of digital inclusive finance on industrial transformation from the perspectives of the optimization of industrial structure (OIS) and the rationalization of industrial structure (RIS). The empirical results show that digital inclusive finance has a positive effect on both the optimization of industrial structure and the rationalization of industrial structure. Digital inclusive finance influences industrial transformation through residents' income and technological innovation. In addition, in the analysis of income gap and innovation gap, low-income regions have a better effect on the industrial transformation of industrial structure optimization, while high-income regions have a better effect in manufacturing upgrading, thus resulting in a more significant effect of industrial transformation on the rationalization of industrial structure. Obviously, the development of high-innovation regions has relative advantages with more channels for industrial transformation, which have significant effect of industrial transformation. Therefore, it is necessary to provide differentiated reform on the basis of unified development reform."

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been suggested to play a major role in liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been previously implicated in the regulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-SMAD3 pathway that plays a significant role in liver fibrosis. In this work, we aimed to identify other important players during hepatic fibrogenesis, which are modulated by SIRT6. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ or WWTR1), key players in the Hippo pathway, have been implicated in the promotion of hepatic fibrosis. Our data show that HSC-specific Sirt6 knockout mice are more susceptible to high-fat-cholesterol-cholate diet-induced hepatic fibrosis than their wildtype counterparts. Our signaling analyses suggest that in addition to the TGFβ-SMAD3 pathway, YAP and TAZ are also highly activated in the SIRT6-deficient HSCs. As it is not clear how SIRT6 might regulate YAP and TAZ, we have decided to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of YAP and TAZ by SIRT6 in HSCs. Overexpression or knockdown of SIRT6 corroborates the role of SIRT6 in the negative regulation of YAP and TAZ. Further biochemical analyses reveal that SIRT6 deacetylates YAP and TAZ and reprograms the composition of the TEA domain transcription factor complex to suppress their downstream target genes, particularly those involved in hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hippo pathway to protect against hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4293492272,"Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction has received considerable attention from industry and academia. Most existing methods predict DDIs from drug attributes or relationships with neighbors, which does not guarantee that informative drug embeddings for prediction will be obtained. To address this limitation, we propose a multitype drug interaction prediction method based on the deep fusion of drug features and topological relationships, abbreviated DM-DDI. The proposed method adopts a deep fusion strategy to combine drug features and topologies to learn representative drug embeddings for DDI prediction. Specifically, a deep neural network model is first used on the drug feature matrix to extract feature information, while a graph convolutional network model is employed to capture structural information from the adjacency matrix. Then, we adopt delivery operations that allow the two models to exchange information between layers, as well as an attention mechanism for a weighted fusion of the two learned embeddings before the output layer. Finally, the unified drug embeddings for the downstream task are obtained. We conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrated that DM-DDI achieved more accurate prediction results than state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, in two tasks that are more similar to real-world scenarios, DM-DDI outperformed other prediction methods for unknown drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4293493089,"Self-identified race/ethnicity is a correlate of both genetic ancestry and socioeconomic factors, both of which may contribute to racial disparities in mortality. Investigators often hold a priori assumptions, rarely made explicit, regarding the relative importance of these factors. We studied 2,239 self-identified African Americans (SIAA) from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian screening trial enrolled from 1993–1998 and followed prospectively until 2019 or until death, whichever came first. Percent African genetic ancestry was estimated using the GRAF-Pop distance-based method. A neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) index was estimated using census tract measures of income, housing, and employment and linked to participant residence in 2012. We used Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent causal models favoring (1) biomedical and (2) social causes of mortality. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood covariates guided by each DAG. 901 deaths occurred over 40,767 person-years of follow-up. In unadjusted (biomedical) models, a 10% increase in percent African ancestry was associated with a 7% higher rate of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.12). This effect was attenuated in covariate adjusted (social) models (aHR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.06). Mortality was lower comparing participants in the highest to lowest nSES quintile following adjustment for covariates and ancestry (aHR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.98, P trend = 0.017). Higher African ancestry and lower nSES were associated with higher mortality, but African ancestry was not associated with mortality following covariate adjustment. Socioeconomic factors may be more important drivers of mortality in African Americans."

Maintenance of GABAA receptor protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in cells utilizing its interacting proteins is essential for the function of GABAA receptors. However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates GABAA receptor biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum is not well understood. Here, we employed a proteomics-based approach to systematically identify the interactomes of GABAA receptors. We carried out a quantitative immunoprecipitation-tandem mass spectrometry analysis utilizing stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. Furthermore, we performed comparative proteomics by using both WT α1 subunit and a misfolding-prone α1 subunit carrying the A322D variant as the bait proteins. We identified 125 interactors for WT α1-containing receptors, 105 proteins for α1(A322D)-containing receptors, and 54 overlapping proteins within these two interactomes. Our bioinformatics analysis identified potential GABAA receptor proteostasis network components, including chaperones, folding enzymes, trafficking factors, and degradation factors, and we assembled a model of their potential involvement in the cellular folding, degradation, and trafficking pathways for GABAA receptors. In addition, we verified endogenous interactions between α1 subunits and selected interactors by using coimmunoprecipitation in mouse brain homogenates. Moreover, we showed that TRIM21 (tripartite motif containing-21), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, positively regulated the degradation of misfolding-prone α1(A322D) subunits selectively. This study paves the way for understanding the molecular mechanisms as well as fine-tuning of GABAA receptor proteostasis to ameliorate related neurological diseases such as epilepsy.

For one specific client protein, its interaction with a network of proteins, especially its proteostasis network components, in the crowded cellular environment is critical to maintain its proteostasis. However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates the biogenesis of multisubunit multispan ion channel proteins is poorly understood.

Proteostasis maintenance of cys-loop receptors.Adv. Protein Chem. Struct. Biol. 2016; 103: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which is currently understudied. GABAA receptors are the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in mammalian central nervous systems (14Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. GABA(A) receptor channels.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar) and provide most of the inhibitory tone to balance the tendency of excitatory neural circuits to induce hyperexcitability, thus maintaining the excitatory–inhibitory balance (15Akerman C.J.

There are 19 known GABAA receptor subunits in mammals, including α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, θ, ε, π, δ, and ρ1–3. Loss of function of GABAA receptors is a prominent cause of genetic epilepsies, and recent advances in genetics have identified a growing number of epilepsy-associated variants in over ten genes that encode the subunits of GABAA receptors, including over 150 variants in those encoding major synaptic subunits (α1, β2, and γ2 subunits) (Fig. 1A, top right figure) (16Fu X.

GABAA receptors belong to the Cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, sharing common structural characteristics with other Cys-loop receptor members (21Dougherty D.A. Cys-loop neuroreceptors: structure to the rescue?.Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A functional GABAA receptor is composed of five subunits. Each subunit has a large extracellular (or the endoplasmic reticulum [ER] luminal) N terminus, four TM helices (TM1–TM4, with TM2 domain lining the interior of the pore), and a short extracellular (or the ER luminal) C terminus (Fig. 1A) (22Laverty D.

GABA binding to GABAA receptors in the extracellular domain induces conformational changes, opens the ion pore to conduct chloride, hyperpolarizes the plasma membrane, and inhibits neuronal firing in mature neurons. To function properly, GABAA receptors need to fold into their native structures and assemble correctly to form a pentamer on the ER membrane and traffic efficiently through the Golgi en route to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Misfolded GABAA receptors are recognized by the cellular protein QC machinery. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is one major cellular pathway to target misfolded GABAA receptors to the cytosolic proteasome for degradation (7Needham P.G. Guerriero C.J. Brodsky J.L.

Here, we used quantitative immunoprecipitation–tandem mass spectrometry (IP–MS/MS) analysis utilizing stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells to identify the interactomes for both WT and a misfolding-prone GABAA receptor. Endogenous interactions between selected interactors and GABAA receptors were verified in mouse brain homogenates. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis enabled us to assemble a proteostasis network model for the cellular folding, assembly, degradation, and trafficking pathways of GABAA receptors. We employed a proteomics-based approach to identify the interactomes of GABAA receptors in HEK293T cells by carrying out a quantitative IP–MS/MS analysis utilizing SILAC (Fig. 1B) (38Mann M. Functional and quantitative proteomics using SILAC.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Since HEK293T cells do not own endogenous GABAA receptors, precise control of the subtypes and variants of GABAA receptors can be achieved by exogenously expressing their subunits (39Thomas P. Smart T.G. HEK293 cell line: a vehicle for the expression of recombinant proteins.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2005; 51: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we performed comparative proteomics by using both WT α1 subunit and a well-characterized misfolding-prone α1 subunit carrying the A322D variant as the bait proteins to determine the potential difference between them (40Gallagher M.J.

The A322D variant introduces an extra negative charge in the third TM (TM3) helix of the α1 subunit, causing its substantial misfolding and excessive degradation by ERAD (40Gallagher M.J. Ding L.

HEK293T cells stably expressing either WT α1β2γ2 or α1(A322D)β2γ2 GABAA receptors were labeled with heavy media, whereas HEK293T cells that were transfected with empty vector (EV) plasmids were cultured in normal light media. The same amount of light and heavy cell lysates was mixed. The α1 or α1(A322D) complexes were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal region of the α1 subunit before being subjected to SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion and tandem MS analysis. Coomassie blue–stained gels showed numerous clearly visible bands in samples expressing GABAA receptors (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3), which represented potential interacting proteins for α1 subunit–containing GABAA receptors, indicating efficient coimmunoprecipitations. In addition, Western blot analysis detected α1 subunits effectively at ∼50 kDa postimmunoprecipitation in samples expressing GABAA receptors (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3), whereas no α1 band was observed in the EV control sample (Fig. 1D, lane 1), supporting the efficient isolation of the α1 subunit–containing GABAA receptor complexes. The α1 subunit–containing GABAA receptor interactomes were identified using the SILAC ratio with arbitrary yet strict criteria to remove potential false positives. To be included as an interactor, it must (1) have a SILAC ratio of WT α1/EV or α1(A322D)/EV to be at least 1.30; (2) have a p < 0.05; and (3) have a Benjamini and Hochberg correction (42Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate - a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B-Methodological. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) of false discovery rate (FDR) of no more than 0.10. The top right green area in Figure 2, A contains high-confidence interactors for GABAA receptors. As a result of the stringent criteria, the WT α1-containing GABAA receptor interactome contains 125 proteins, the α1(A322D)-containing GABAA receptor interactome contains 105 proteins, and 54 proteins overlap within two interactomes (Fig. 2B). These 176 interactors for GABAA receptors are used for the following bioinformatics analysis (see Table S1 for protein list). Since GABAA receptors inhibit neuronal firing in the mammalian central nervous system, we first compared the expression abundance of their interactors between HEK293 cells and the nervous system. ProteomicsDB (https://www.proteomicsdb.org/) provides an MS-based navigation of the human proteome from tissues, cell lines, and body fluids, enabling the comprehensive mapping of the protein abundance of GABAA receptor interactors (43Wilhelm M. Schlegl J. Hahne H. Gholami A.M. Lieberenz M. Savitski M.M. et al.Mass-spectrometry-based draft of the human proteome.Nature. 2014; 509: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that these interactors have comparable protein levels between HEK293 cells and human brain tissues (Fig. 2C and Table S2). For example, many molecular chaperones, such as Hsp90s (Hsp90AA1, Hsp90AB1, and Hsp90B1), Hsp70s (HspA5 and HspA8), Hsp40s (DNAJA1, DNAJA2, and DNAJB11), calnexin (CANX), and Hsp47 (SerpinH1), are abundantly expressed in both systems. In addition, tissue-based map of the human proteome based on quantitative transcriptomics (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) enabled us to compare RNA levels of GABAA receptor interactors between HEK293 cells, a human neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line, and human brain tissues (44Sjöstedt E.

Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that many interactors, including molecular chaperones and ubiquitin-dependent degradation factors, such as UBA1, UBR5, UBE3C, SEL1L, and VCP, have similar RNA expression patterns between these systems (Fig. 2D and Table S2). These results are consistent with the report that most proteins are well conserved among human tissues (45Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. et al.Proteomics.

GFP-affinity purification from the cerebral cortex using Venus-tagged α1 subunits as bait led to the identification of 18 proteins in the inhibitory synaptic complexes, including 11 GABAA receptor subunits, five scaffolding and adhesion proteins (gephrin [GPHN], neuroligin 2 [NLGN2], neuroligin 3 [NLGN3], collybistin [ARHGEF9], and neurexin 1 [NRXN1]), and two proteins with less known functions (neurobeachin [NBEA] and LHFPL4) (37Heller E.A.

However, because of the use of size-exclusion chromatography during the protein complex purification process, proteins that are potentially involved in the cellular folding and trafficking of GABAA receptors were not well identified. GFP-trap purification from hippocampus and cortex using pHluorin-Myc-tagged α2 subunits as bait resulted in the identification of 174 proteins, including 14 GABAA receptor subunits, known GABAA receptor interactors such as gephrin, neuroligins, and collybistin, and 149 novel binding partners (36Nakamura Y.

The novel interactors were further categorized into five groups, including G protein–coupled receptors, ion channels, and transporters (26 interactors), factors that regulate protein trafficking, stability, and cytoskeletal anchoring (38 interactors), factors that regulate phosphorylation and GTP exchange (26 interactors), miscellaneous enzymes (27 interactors), and miscellaneous proteins (32 interactors) (36Nakamura Y.

Comparison between the α2 subunit–containing GABAA receptor interactome and our α1 subunit–containing GABAA receptor interactome showed overlapping interactors, including factors that regulate protein folding and degradation (DNAJA1, RPN2, SQSTM1, USP9X, and DDB1), transporters (SLC25A3, SLC25A4, and SLC25A5), and miscellaneous proteins (PHB2 and IMMT). Furthermore, tandem affinity purification from whole brain homogenates using His6-FLAG-YFP-tagged γ2 subunits as bait gave rise to the identification of 11 known associated proteins (GABAA receptor subunits, gephrin and neuroligin 2) and 39 novel binding partners (32Ge Y.

The novel interactors were further classified into five groups, including ion channels (two interactors), factors that regulate protein folding and trafficking (six interactors), mitochondria proteins (six interactors), miscellaneous enzymes (seven interactors), and miscellaneous proteins (18 interactors). Comparison between the γ2 subunit–containing GABAA receptor interactome and our α1 subunit–containing GABAA receptor interactome showed overlapping interactors, including a factor that regulate protein degradation (PSMC2), an enzyme (PTPLAD1), and a miscellaneous protein (EMD). Among the three GABAA receptor proteomic analyses using knockin mice, six synaptic proteins were recognized from at least two studies, including gephrin, neuroligin 2, neuroligin 3, collybistin, neurobeachin, and LHFPL4. However, such synaptic proteins were not identified in our α1 subunit–containing GABAA receptor interactome possibly because of their lack of expression in HEK293T cells. The only other overlapping interactor from at least two knockin mice proteomic studies is CACNA1E, the α1E subunit of R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, which could indicate that different subunits utilize differentiating cellular interaction networks. Moreover, the limited interactome overlapping from these proteomic analyses could arise from using different purification procedures to isolate the GABAA receptor–containing complex, such as using different detergents. Nonetheless, in addition to certain GABAA receptor subunits, our α1 subunit–containing GABAA receptor interactome showed 13 overlapping interactors with one other proteomic study, providing promising candidates for future investigation. To annotate cellular component for GABAA receptor interactors, we used Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to carry out Gene Ontology (GO) analysis (46Huang da W.

Since many proteins reside in more than one cellular location, we only choose one primary subcellular location for them manually. To aid such an assignment, we also integrate subcellular location information from UniProt Database (https://www.uniprot.org/) and GeneCards: The Human Gene Database (https://www.genecards.org/). GABAA receptor interactors are distributed in various cellular locations, including the nucleus (33 interactors), ER (25 interactors), Golgi (2 interactors), proteasome (4 interactors), lysosome (1 interactor), mitochondria (21 interactors), cytoskeleton (23 interactors), cytosol (59 interactors), plasma membrane (5 interactors), and extracellular space (3 interactors) since biogenesis and function of GABAA receptors require their interactions with a network of proteins throughout the cell (Fig. 2E and Table S3). Because of the essential role of the ER in protein QC, 25 interactors (14 for WT α1-containing GABAA receptor only, three for α1(A322D) variant–containing GABAA receptor only, and eight for both) are located to this organelle. Eight overlapping interactors in the ER include molecular chaperones (CANX, HspA5, DNAJB11, Hsp90B1, and SerpinH1), factors involved in N-linked glycosylation (RPN1 and DPM1), and a Ca2+-bi"
https://openalex.org/W4293452387,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is well-acknowledged as one of the most common complications in diabetes mellitus. Recent studies have demonstrated the promising role of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) as a cell-free treatment strategy for DKD. The present study sought to investigate the therapeutic potential and the underlying mechanisms of MSC-exos in DKD. The authentication of MSC-exos was validated by western blot, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and nanosight tracking analysis (NTA). Apoptosis was detected by western blot, TUNEL staining, and flow cytometry. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence. The relationship between miR-424-5p and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) was revealed by dual luciferase reporter assay. We observed that MSC-exos could attenuate DKD by decreasing cell apoptosis and inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in diabetic kidneys in db/db mice. Besides, we documented that MSC-exos could reverse high glucose-induced apoptosis and EMT in HK2 cells. Interestingly, miR-424-5p derived from MSC-exos could inhibit YAP1 activation in HK2 cells, resulting in alleviation of high glucose-induced cell apoptosis and EMT. Our study provides novel insights into MSC-exos-mediated protective effect in DKD. MSC-exos could inhibit high glucose-induced apoptosis and EMT through miR-424-5p targeting of YAP1."
https://openalex.org/W4293491684,"Quantifying a node's importance is decisive for developing efficient strategies to curb or accelerate any spreading phenomena. Centrality measures are well-known methods used to quantify the influence of nodes by extracting information from the network's structure. The pitfall of these measures is to pinpoint nodes located in the vicinity of each other, saturating their shared zone of influence. In this paper, we propose a ranking strategy exploiting the ubiquity of the community structure in real-world networks. The proposed community-aware ranking strategy naturally selects a set of distant spreaders with the most significant influence in the networks. One can use it with any centrality measure. We investigate its effectiveness using real-world and synthetic networks with controlled parameters in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) diffusion model scenario. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed ranking strategy over all its counterparts agnostic about the community structure. Additionally, results show that it performs better in networks with a strong community structure and a high number of communities of heterogeneous sizes."

The specimens were photographed once without any white balance calibration (raw), then independently alongside an 18% neutral gray card and Macbeth color chart for calibration in a post-processing (PPWBC) software, and once after camera calibration (CWBC) using a gray card. The LAB color values were extracted from the images and color variations (ΔE) were calculated after referring to the corresponding spectrophotometric values as control.Images in windowless and windowed clinics exhibited highly significant differences (p < 0.001) with spectrophotometer (control). CWBC demonstrated no significant differences (p > 0.05) in LAB values across windowed clinics. PPWBC using Macbeth color chart produced no significant differences for a* values (p > 0.05) across all clinics while PPWBC by gray card showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in LAB values when only similar clinics (either windowed or windowless) were compared.Significant color variations were present for maxillofacial prosthetic specimens owing to natural ambient light. CWBC and PPWBC using color charts were more suitable for color correction across windowed clinics while CWBC and PPWBC using gray cards had better outcomes across windowless setups."
https://openalex.org/W4293475526,"Canonical transient receptor potential-6 (TRPC6) has been reported to be involved in cell damage after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in target organs. While the effect and of TRPC6 on pyroptosis in renal I/R injury remain unclear. In our study, we first established the renal I/R mouse model and oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation (OGD/R) cell model, and investigated the impacts of TRPC6 on the pyroptosis-related proteins using CCK-8, western blot, ELISA, and immunofluorescence probes. Besides, we also explored the mechanism of TRPC6 in pyroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells through A20 knockdown or overexpression and zinc chloride (ZnCl2 ) or a zinc ion chelator (TPEN) treatment. Our results indicated that I/R injury could cause downregulation of TRPC6 both in vivo and in vitro. In the I/R injury murine model, TRPC6 inhibition exacerbated tissue damage and upregulated NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-18, and IL-1β, which could be alleviated by the administration of ZnCl2 . In the OGD/R cell model, inhibitor of TRPC6 (SAR7334) reduced zinc ion influx, aggravated cell death and upregulated pyroptosis-related protein. The pyroptosis phenotype also could be alleviated by ZnCl2 and intensified by TPEN. Overexpression of A20 reduced the expression of pyroptosis-related protein, increased cell viability in the sh-TRPC6 and TPEN-treated OGD/R cell models, while A20 deficiency impaired the protective effect of zinc ion. Therefore, our results indicate that TRPC6 could promote zinc ion influx in renal tubular epithelial cells, thereby upregulating intracellular A20, inhibiting the activation of inflammasome NLRP3, and ultimately attenuating renal I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W4293492984,"X-ray directional dark-field imaging is a recent technique that can reveal a sample's small-scale structural properties which are otherwise invisible in a conventional imaging system. In particular, directional dark-field can detect and quantify the orientation of anisotropic structures. Here, we present an algorithm that allows for the extraction of a directional dark-field signal from X-ray speckle-based imaging data. The experimental setup is simple, as it requires only the addition of a diffuser to a full-field microscope setup. Sandpaper is an appropriate diffuser material in the hard x-ray regime. We propose an approach to extract the mean scattering width, directionality, and orientation from the recorded speckle images acquired with the technique. We demonstrate that our method can detect and quantify the orientation of fibres inside a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sample within one degree of accuracy and show how the accuracy depends on the number of included measurements. We show that the reconstruction parameters can be tuned to increase or decrease accuracy at the expense of spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W4293493091,"Background People with disabilities deal with widespread exclusion from healthcare services, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH) rights. Studies analyzing the relationship between disability and key SRH utilization outcomes have often reported mixed findings. In Pakistan, very little to no literature is available on this topic, therefore we aim to determine inequalities in the utilization of essential maternal and reproductive health services between women with and without disabilities in Pakistan. Methods This was a secondary analysis of Pakistan Demographic Health Survey 2017–18 performed on a weighted sample of 6,711 women aged 15–49 years with a live birth in the 5 years preceding the survey. Six types of disabilities were assessed i.e. vision, hearing, communication, cognition, walking and self-care. Utilization of essential maternal and reproductive health services was assessed through a set of four outcome variables: (i) modern contraceptive use; (ii) skilled antenatal care (ANC); (iii) skilled birth attendance (SBA); and (iv) skilled postnatal care (PNC). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. Data were analyzed using Stata MP Version 16.0. Results A total of 6,711 women were included out of which 14.1% (n = 947) live with at least one form of disability. Mean age was 29.4 (S.E = 0.13) years. The most prevalent form of disability was vision (7.0%), followed by walking (4.8%), cognition (4.8%) and hearing (1.8%). Women with disabilities were comparatively less educated, belonged to older age group, and had higher parity than their non-disabled counterparts. With the exception of modern contraceptive use, which was more prevalent in the group with disabilities, women with disabilities were less likely to utilize skilled ANC, SBA and PNC in bivariate analysis. However, these associations turned insignificant in the adjusted model. Overall, no statistically significant differences were observed in the utilization of essential reproductive health services between women with and without disabilities after adjusting for important covariates. Conclusion Our analyses did not find any statistically significant differences in the utilization of essential maternal and reproductive health services between women with and without disabilities. In-depth research utilizing qualitative or mixed methods is required to understand how well the healthcare system in Pakistan is responsive to the different needs of disabled women."
https://openalex.org/W4293493137,"Climate change plays a key role in changing vegetation productivity dynamics, which ultimately affect the hydrological cycle of a watershed through evapotranspiration (ET). Trends and correlation analysis were conducted to investigate vegetation responses across the whole Upper Jhelum River Basin (UJRB) in the northeast of Pakistan using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), climate variables, and river flow data at inter-annual/monthly scales between 1982 and 2015. The spatial variability in trends calculated with the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test on NDVI and climate data was assessed considering five dominant land use/cover types. The inter-annual NDVI in four out of five vegetation types showed a consistent increase over the 34-year study period; the exception was for herbaceous vegetation (HV), which increased until the end of the 1990s and then decreased slightly in subsequent years. In spring, significant (p&lt;0.05) increasing trends were found in the NDVI of all vegetation types. Minimum temperature (Tmin) showed a significant increase during spring, while maximum temperature (Tmax) decreased significantly during summer. Average annual increase in Tmin (1.54° C ) was much higher than Tmax (0.37° C ) over 34 years in the UJRB. Hence, Tmin appears to have an enhancing effect on vegetation productivity over the UJRB. A significant increase in NDVI, Tmin and Tmax during spring may have contributed to reductions in spring river flow by enhancing evapotranspiration observed in the watershed of UJRB. These findings provide valuable information to improve our knowledge and understanding about the interlinkages between vegetation, climate and river flow at a watershed scale."
https://openalex.org/W4293493138,"This paper investigates the impacts of migration characteristics on rural migrant households’ farmland use arrangements in China. The results reveal that trailing migration, duration of migration and the proportion of co-migrants have a significant effect on the probability of rural migrant households’ farmland abandonment. Commercial employment migration has a negative impact on the abandonment of farmland by migrant families. Migrant households are most likely to choose farmland abandonment in the western and middle regions of China and in small farmland areas. In the eastern region, and first tier and second tier Chinese cities, migrant households are more inclined to choose farmland transfer. Household earnings increase, which induces households to gradually give up the cultivation of farmland or to transfer farmland, constituting a mechanism in Chinese households’ farmland use arrangements. Notably, the consolidation of arable land should be the focus in areas of low economic development. Furthermore, an effective mechanism for the transfer of farmland should be established."

Through 12 focus group discussions with the public and energy experts, this study found that energy information flows from scientists to the public through both direct (e.g., roadshows, scientists' blogs) and indirect (via agents, e.g., school, news media) channels. However, communication gaps remain between scientists and the public. First, the public commonly obtains information from personal experience and the media but not directly from scientists. Second, while the public stressed the importance of mass media and social media, only a few experts reported writing news commentaries or making social media posts about energy. Third, while scientists emphasize their relationships with the government and other agencies in disseminating information, the public shows relatively weak trust in these agencies. Implications are made for future research and public communication on energy issues."
https://openalex.org/W4293569591,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases affect millions of Americans every year. One factor linked to the formation of aggregates associated with these diseases is damage sustained to proteins by oxidative stress. Management of protein misfolding by the ubiquitous Hsp70 chaperone family can be modulated by modification of two key cysteines in the ATPase domain by oxidizing or thiol-modifying compounds. To investigate the biological consequences of cysteine modification on the Hsp70 Ssa1 in budding yeast, we generated cysteine null (cysteine to serine) and oxidomimetic (cysteine to aspartic acid) mutant variants of both C264 and C303 and demonstrate reduced ATP binding, hydrolysis, and protein folding properties in both the oxidomimetic and hydrogen peroxide-treated Ssa1. In contrast, cysteine nullification rendered Ssa1 insensitive to oxidative inhibition. Additionally, we determined the oxidomimetic ssa1-2CD (C264D, C303D) allele was unable to function as the sole Ssa1 isoform in yeast cells and also exhibited dominant negative effects on cell growth and viability. Ssa1 binds to and represses Hsf1, the major transcription factor controlling the heat shock response, and we found the oxidomimetic Ssa1 failed to stably interact with Hsf1, resulting in constitutive activation of the heat shock response. Consistent with our in vitro findings, ssa1-2CD cells were compromised for de novo folding, post-stress protein refolding, and in regulated degradation of a model terminally misfolded protein. Together, these findings pinpoint Hsp70 as a key link between oxidative stress and proteostasis, information critical to understanding cytoprotective systems that prevent and manage cellular insults underlying complex disease states."
https://openalex.org/W4293491898,"CCL21 has an essential role in anti-tumor immune activity. Epitopes of IL1β have adjuvant activity without causing inflammatory responses. CCR7 and its ligands play a vital role in the immune balance; specifically, in transport of T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells to the lymph nodes. This study aimed to produce epitopes of CCL21 and IL1β as a recombinant protein and characterize its in vitro anti-tumor and immunogenic activity. A codon-optimized ccl21/IL1β gene was designed and synthesized from human genes. Stability and binding affinity of CCL21/IL1β protein and CCR7 receptor were examined through in silico analyses. The construct was introduced into N. tabacum to produce this recombinant protein and the structure and function of CCL21/IL1β were examined. Purified protein from transgenic leaves generated a strong signal in SDS PAGE and western blotting assays. FTIR measurement and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrography showed that ccl21/IL-1β was correctly expressed in tobacco plants. Potential activity of purified CCL21/IL1β in stimulating the proliferation and migration of MCF7 cancer cell line was investigated using the wound healing method. The results demonstrated a decrease in survival rate and metastasization of cancer cells in the presence of CCL21/IL1β, and IC50 of CCL21 on MCF7 cells was less than that of non-recombinant protein. Agarose assay on PBMCsCCR7+ showed that CCL21/IL1β has biological activity and there is a distinguishable difference between chemokinetic (CCL21) and chemotactic (FBS) movements. Overall, the results suggest that CCL21/IL1β could be considered an effective adjuvant in future in vivo and clinical tests."
https://openalex.org/W4293492524,"In addition to estimating the prevalence of intentional abortion in Iranian female sex workers (FSWs), this study identified related factors using the data of a national study.This cross-sectional study utilizes the third round of integrated bio-behavioral surveillance-III data in Iranian FSWs in December 2019 and August 2020, and 1515 Participants were selected in 8 geographically diverse cities in Iran. Logistic regression was performed using unweighted analysis to identify factors associated with intentional abortion. Stata software (version 14), respondent-driven sampling analyses, and R (version 4.1.2) was used for data analysis.From 1390 participants with valid responses to the abortion question, 598 (37.3%; 95% CI: 32.43, 42.11%) reported intentional abortion during their life. According to the age groups, the highest prevalence of abortion was in the age group of 31 to 40 years (42.60%). In the multivariate logistic regression model, the marital status (divorced women (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.27), concubines (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.11)), work experience in brothels (AOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.84), the type of sex (AOR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.35, 5.58), the history of sexual violence (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.01), and alcohol consumption (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.01) were significantly associated with a history of intentional abortion.Intentional abortion's prevalence among Iranian FSWs has been much higher than that of the general female population in Iran, which is an alarming issue in the public health of this group and needs more effective interventions. In addition, alcohol consumption, working in a brothel, and being divorced are essential factors in increasing abortions among sex workers."

It can compromise pregnancy outcomes, as well as it may affect the newborn's overall health. Every pregnant woman plays a critical role in shaping the oral hygiene habits adopted by her if she is aware of pregnancy-related oral health and result in good perinatal outcomes. This study aimed to assess knowledge of oral health during pregnancy and associated factors among pregnant mothers who attend antenatal care at South Omo Zone public hospitals, Southern Ethiopia, 2021.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women attending routine antenatal care from October 01 to November 30. A systematic random sampling method was conducted to select study participants. Data had been collected through face-to-face interviews using semi-structured questionnaires. Data were entered using epi data version 3.1 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 for data analysis. Descriptive statistics had calculated for each variable, and binary logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals was carried out to assess the factors associated with the outcome variables. Variables with P-value less than 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.Overall good knowledge of pregnant mothers regarding oral health was 34.1% with 95% CI, (32.76, 35.44). Having access to health facility (AOR = 2.60, 95% CI, 1.44, 4.70), having the educational status of secondary and above (AOR 1.37, 95% CI, 1.44, 4.31), having the educational status of primary education (AOR = 0.43, 95% CI, 0.20, 0.92), having a median income of > = 1500 Ethiopian birr (AOR = 0.41, 95% CI, 0.23, 0.72), being governmental employee (AOR = 0.11, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.41), received oral health hygiene counseling during pregnancy (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI, 1.62, 2.84) were significantly associated with good knowledge of oral health of pregnant mothers.This study showed that the knowledge of pregnant mothers about oral health was 34.1%. Educational status, monthly income, occupation, access to health services, and receiving counseling on oral hygiene at antenatal care were some factors associated with good knowledge of oral health during pregnancy. Therefore strengthening counseling during antenatal care, improving access to a health facility, improving educational status, monthly income, and being government employee are crucial to enhance knowledge of women towards oral health during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4293493223,"The evaluation of protein antigens as putative serologic biomarkers of infection has increasingly shifted to high-throughput, multiplex approaches such as the protein microarray. In vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) systems-a similarly high-throughput protein expression method-are already widely utilised in the production of protein microarrays, though purified recombinant proteins derived from more traditional whole cell based expression systems also play an important role in biomarker characterisation. Here we have performed a side-by-side comparison of antigen-matched protein targets from an IVTT and purified recombinant system, on the same protein microarray. The magnitude and range of antibody responses to purified recombinants was found to be greater than that of IVTT proteins, and responses between targets from different expression systems did not clearly correlate. However, responses between amino acid sequence-matched targets from each expression system were more closely correlated. Despite the lack of a clear correlation between antigen-matched targets produced in each expression system, our data indicate that protein microarrays produced using either method can be used confidently, in a context dependent manner, though care should be taken when comparing data derived from contrasting approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4293493372,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the gastrointestinal tract. While therapies exist, response can be limited within the patient population. Researchers have thus studied mouse models of colitis to further understand pathogenesis and identify new treatment targets. Flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing can phenotype immune populations with single-cell resolution but provide no spatial context. Spatial context may be particularly important in colitis mouse models, due to the simultaneous presence of colonic regions that are involved or uninvolved with disease. These regions can be identified on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained colonic tissue slides based on the presence of abnormal or normal histology. However, detection of such regions requires expert interpretation by pathologists. This can be a tedious process that may be difficult to perform consistently across experiments. To this end, we trained a deep learning model to detect 'Involved' and 'Uninvolved' regions from H&E-stained colonic tissue slides. Our model was trained on specimens from controls and three mouse models of colitis-the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) chemical induction model, the recently established intestinal epithelium-specific, inducible Klf5ΔIND (Villin-CreERT2;Klf5fl/fl) genetic model, and one that combines both induction methods. Image patches predicted to be 'Involved' and 'Uninvolved' were extracted across mice to cluster and identify histological classes. We quantified the proportion of 'Uninvolved' patches and 'Involved' patch classes in murine swiss-rolled colons. Furthermore, we trained linear determinant analysis classifiers on these patch proportions to predict mouse model and clinical score bins in a prospectively treated cohort of mice. Such a pipeline has the potential to reveal histological links and improve synergy between various colitis mouse model studies to identify new therapeutic targets and pathophysiological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4293493670,"The term ""community-based health insurance"" refers to a broad range of nonprofit, prepaid health financing models designed to meet the health financing needs of disadvantaged populations, particularly those in the rural and informal sectors. Due to their voluntary nature, such initiatives suffer from persistently low coverage in low- and middle-income countries. In Ethiopia, the schemes' membership growth has not been well investigated so far. This study sought to examine the scheme's enrollment trend over a five-year period, and to explore the various challenges that underpin membership growth from the perspectives of various key stakeholders.The study employed a mixed methods case study in two purposively selected districts of northeast Ethiopia: Tehulederie and Kallu. By reviewing the databases of health insurance schemes, quantitative data were collected retrospectively from 2017 to 2021 to examine enrollment trends. Trends for each performance indicator were analyzed descriptively for the period under study. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with nine community members and 19 key informants. Study participants were purposely selected using the maximum variation technique. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated into English. Thematic analysis was employed with both deductive and inductive coding approaches.Over the course of the study period, enrollment in the scheme at both districts exhibited non-linear trends with both positive and negative growth rates being identified. Overall, the scheme in Tehulederie has a relatively higher population coverage and better membership retention, which could be due to the strong foundation laid by a rigorous public awareness campaign and technical support during the pilot phase. The challenges contributing to the observed level of performance have been summarized under four main themes that include quality of health care, claims reimbursement for insurance holders, governance practices, and community awareness and acceptability.The scheme experienced negative growth ratios in both districts, indicating that it is not functionally viable. It will fail to meet its mission unless relevant stakeholders at all levels of government demonstrate political will and commitment to its implementation, as well as advocate for the community. Interventions should target on the highlighted challenges in order to boost membership growth and ensure the scheme's viability."

In a recent study made in Octopus maya was proposed the hypothesis postulating that high temperatures could restrain female reproduction due to the limited capacity of the animals' heart to sustain oxygen flow to the body, affecting in this manner energy production in the rest of the organs, including the ovarium Meza-Buendia AK et al. (2021). Unfortunately, until now, no reports have shown temperature effects and other environmental variables on cephalopod mitochondria activity because of the lack of a method to evaluate mitochondrial respiratory parameters in those species' groups. In this sense and for the first time, this study developed a method to obtain mitochondrial respirometry data of adult Octopus maya's heart. This protocol illustrates a step-by-step procedure to get high yield and functional mitochondria of cephalopod heart and procedure for determining the corresponding respiratory parameters. The procedure described in this paper takes approximately 3 to 4 hours from isolation of intact mitochondria to measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4293492127,"Background Caesarean section and associated factors require detailed investigation globally. This study aims to determine the rate and associated factors of caesarean deliveries in urban areas of Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional study using questionnaire answered by women who had infants aged under 30 months was conducted from March to May 2021. Data were collected in 18 commune health centres in two cities during the day of routine immunization. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess factors associated with caesarean section. Results The overall caesarean section rate was 49.6%. The caesarean section rate in private hospitals (57.8%) were significantly higher than in public hospitals (49.1%). Caesarean section rate in first-time mothers (47.1%) were as high as this rate among mothers who had given birth before (50.6%). Factors associated with higher rate of caesarean section include increasing in women’s age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, and infant’s birth weight; first-time mothers; mothers living in urban areas; and mothers giving birth in private hospitals. Conclusions This study revealed a high rate of caesarean deliveries in urban areas of Vietnam. Comprehensive investigations of both medical and non-medical reasons for caesarean deliveries in Vietnam are urgent needs to shape the prioritized interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4293492475,"Species of colourful arboreal snails of the genus Amphidromus from Southeast Asia commonly exhibit high intraspecific variation in shell morphology. Although highly polymorphic Amphidromus specimens with different colouration have been collected at the same locality and were revealed to possess similar genital organs, there is yet no morphometric or DNA analyses of these different shell morphs. This study is the first to reveal that both striped and stripeless morphs of A . cruentatus from Laos and Vietnam belong to the same mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) lineage. Although the shell colouration between the striped and stripeless morphs is markedly different, morphometric and shell outline-based analyses indicated an overall similarity in shell shape. We also revised the systematics of A . cruentatus , in which we treated similar related species, namely A . eudeli , A . fuscolabris , A . thakhekensis , A . gerberi bolovenensis , A . goldbergi , A . pengzhuoani , A . eichhorsti and A . pankowskiae as junior synonyms of A . cruentatus . Amphidromus daoae , A . anhdaoorum , A . stungtrengensis , A . yangbayensis and A . yenlinhae , which were formerly regarded as junior synonyms, are considered as species different from A . cruentatus based on shell morphology and morphometric analyses. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses also retrieved some Amphidromus species groups as distinct mitochondrial lineages."
https://openalex.org/W4293492832,"Neuroblastoma (NBL), one of the main death-causing cancers in children, is known for its remarkable genetic heterogeneity and varied patient outcome spanning from spontaneous regression to widespread disease. Specific copy number variations and single gene rearrangements have been proven to be associated with biological behavior and prognosis; however, there is still an unmet need to enlarge the existing armamentarium of prognostic and therapeutic targets. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of samples from 18 primary tumors and six relapse samples originating from 18 NBL patients. Our cohort consists of 16 high-risk, one intermediate, and one very low risk patient. The obtained results confirmed known mutational hotspots in ALK and revealed other non-synonymous variants of NBL-related genes ( TP53 , DMD , ROS , LMO3 , PRUNE2 , ERBB3 , and PHOX2B ) and of genes cardinal for other cancers ( KRAS , PIK3CA , and FLT3 ). Beyond, GOSeq analysis determined genes involved in biological adhesion, neurological cell-cell adhesion, JNK cascade, and immune response of cell surface signaling pathways. We were able to identify novel coding variants present in more than one patient in nine biologically relevant genes for NBL, including TMEM14B , TTN , FLG , RHBG , SHROOM3 , UTRN , HLA-DRB1 , OR6C68 , and XIRP2 . Our results may provide novel information about genes and signaling pathways relevant for the pathogenesis and clinical course in high-risk NBL."
https://openalex.org/W4293492840,"We present our agent-based CoronAvirus Lifelong Modelling and Simulation (CALMS) model that aspires to predict the lifelong impacts of Covid-19 on the health and economy of a population. CALMS considers individual characteristics as well as comorbidities in calculating the risk of infection and severe disease. We conduct two sets of experiments aiming at demonstrating the validity and capabilities of CALMS. We run simulations retrospectively and validate the model outputs against hospitalisations, ICU admissions and fatalities in a UK population for the period between March and September 2020. We then run simulations for the lifetime of the cohort applying a variety of targeted intervention strategies and compare their effectiveness against the baseline scenario where no intervention is applied. Four scenarios are simulated with targeted vaccination programmes and periodic lockdowns. Vaccinations are targeted first at individuals based on their age and second at vulnerable individuals based on their health status. Periodic lockdowns, triggered by hospitalisations, are tested with and without vaccination programme in place. Our results demonstrate that periodic lockdowns achieve reductions in hospitalisations, ICU admissions and fatalities of 6-8% compared to the baseline scenario, with an associated intervention cost of £173 million per 1,000 people and targeted vaccination programmes achieve reductions in hospitalisations, ICU admissions and fatalities of 89-90%, compared to the baseline scenario, with an associated intervention cost of £51,924 per 1,000 people. We conclude that periodic lockdowns alone are ineffective at reducing health-related outputs over the long-term and that vaccination programmes which target only the clinically vulnerable are sufficient in providing healthcare protection for the population as a whole."

While numerous studies exist , from which a broad understanding of such attitudes can be garnered , there is currently no attendant measurement which quantifies educators attitudes regarding the promotion of student wellbeing . The aim of this study was to address this gap in knowledge by quantifying the degree to which educators are positively or negatively disposed to the promotion of student wellbeing . The Attitudes Toward Wellbeing Promotion (ATWP) scale was administered to a diverse participant sample (n = 324) , which was opportunistically recruited from the population of post-primary educators in Ireland . Analyses using General Linear Modelling (GLM) identified several statistically significant differences in attitude . Main effects included position held in school and the presence/absence of practices such as streaming and vertical education , while Interactions included educator gender*age and educator gender*single-sex/co-educational school status . The results of this study suggest that , overall , educators appear to be positively disposed toward the promotion of student wellbeing . The highest levels of positivity were observed among female educators , particularly those working in all-girls schools . The lowest levels of positivity were observed among older male educators and educators working in schools that adopt streaming and vertical education practices . This study provides the first baseline data pertaining to the degree to which post-primary educators may be positively or negatively disposed to the promotion of students’ social and emotional wellbeing."

These viruses were selected as they are associated with severe disease in pigeons across the world. A total of 192 cloacal swabs were collected from young (&lt;1 year old) pigeons from 16 different private pigeon flocks across Turkey, between 2018 and 2021 as part of routine diagnostic sampling. PiCV genetic material was the most frequently detected 4/16 (25%), PiAdV-1 and CoHV-1 DNA were both found in one flock each, while neither PiAdV-2 and FAdV were detected in any of the studied pigeon flocks. PiCV and PiHV genetic material were both detected in the same pigeon flock’s cloacal samples as a co-infection with the identification of PiHV being a first in Turkey."
https://openalex.org/W4293493111,"Implementation of Robotic Assisted Surgery (RAS) is complex as it requires adjustments to associated physical infrastructure, but also changes to processes and behaviours. With the global objective of optimising and improving RAS implementation, this study aimed to: 1) Explore the barriers and enablers to RAS service adoption, incorporating an assessment of behavioural influences; 2) Provide an optimised plan for effective RAS implementation, with the incorporation of theory-informed implementation strategies that have been adapted to address the barriers/enablers that affect RAS service adoption.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with RAS personnel and stakeholders, including: surgeons, theatre staff, managers, industry representatives, and policy-makers/commissioners. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to identify barriers and enablers that represent individual behaviours, capabilities, attitudes, beliefs, and external organisational factors that influence the implementation of RAS.Findings suggest that implementation planning has three separate phases-pre-, early, and late implementation. For pre-implementation, barriers and enablers identified included the cost of RAS equipment and issues of economic viability, weak outcome evidence for RAS, a preponderance of an eminence driven model, the clinician/manager relationship, and views around the uptake and expansion of RAS in the future. Early implementation findings revealed role changes for theatre personnel and an enhanced team approach, reliance on industry for training provision, and changes in skill sets and attentional processes. Late implementation factors included equipment maintenance costs, technological limitations, changes to cognition during RAS routine use, and benefits to institutions/healthcare professionals (such as ergonomic improvement).Together, findings suggest the factors that affect RAS implementation are multi-faceted and change across the life-cycle of intervention adoption. Theory-informed strategies are suggested which can optimise implementation of RAS. Optimisation strategies need planning from the outset."
https://openalex.org/W4293493119,"Current estimates of terrestrial bird losses across Europe from ingestion of lead ammunition are based on uncertain or generic assumptions. A method is needed to develop defensible European-specific estimates compatible with available data that does not require long-term field studies. We propose a 2-step method using carcass data and population models. The method estimates percentage of deaths diagnosed as directly caused by lead poisoning as a lower bound and, as an upper bound, the percentage of possible deaths from sublethal lead poisoning that weakens birds, making them susceptible to death by other causes. We use these estimates to modify known population-level annual mortality. Our method also allows for potential reductions in reproduction from lead shot ingestion because reductions in survival and reproduction are entered into population models of species with life histories representative of the most groups of susceptible species. The models estimate the sustainability and potential population decreases from lead poisoning in Europe. Using the best available data, we demonstrate the method on two taxonomic groups of birds: gallinaceous birds and diurnal raptors. The direction of the population trends affects the estimate, and we incorporated such trends into the method. Our midpoint estimates of the reduction in population size of the European gallinaceous bird (< 2%) group and raptor group (2.9-7.7%) depend on the species life history, maximum growth rate, population trend, and if reproduction is assumed to be reduced. Our estimates can be refined as more information becomes available in countries with data gaps. We advocate use of this method to improve upon or supplement approaches currently being used. As we demonstrate, the method also can be applied to individual species of concern if enough data across countries are available."

Blood samples were collected from affected and unaffected members of the enrolled families. Mutational analysis was carried out by DNA sequencing using both Sanger and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). Probands of each pedigree from the 7 families were used for WES. Results were analyzed with the help of different bioinformatics tools.The sequencing results demonstrated three known homozygous mutations in gene SLC4A11 in probands of 7 families. These mutations p.Glu675Ala, p.Val824Met, and p.Arg158fs include 2 missense and 1 frameshift mutation. The mutations result in amino acids that were highly conserved in SLC4A11 across different species. The mutations were segregated with the disease phenotype in the families.This study reports 3 mutations in 7 families. One of the pathogenic mutations (p.R158fs) was identified for the first time in the Pakistani population. However, two mutations (p.Glu675Ala, p.Val824Met) were previously reported in two and one Pakistani family respectively. As these mutations segregate with the disease phenotype and bioinformatics tool also liable them as pathogenic, they are deemed as probable cause of underlying disease."
https://openalex.org/W4293493136,"Objective To explore the perceptions and experiences of schizophrenia from patients, their care givers, health care providers, spiritual and traditional healers to develop a community-based intervention for improving treatment adherence for people with schizophrenia in Pakistan. Methods This qualitative study involved four focus group discussions (FGD) with a total of 26 participants: patients and carers (n = 5), primary care staff (n = 7), medical technicians (n = 8) and traditional and spiritual healers (n = 6). The participants were selected using purposive sampling method. FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed. A thematic analysis was applied to the data set. Results The themes identified were (i) Schizophrenia is not merely a biomedical problem: participants believed that poverty and an inferiority complex resulting from social disparity caused schizophrenia and contributed to non-adherence to medications; (ii) Spiritual healing goes hand in hand with the medical treatment: participants regarded spiritual and traditional treatment methods as an inherent part of schizophrenia patients’ well-being and rehabilitation; (iii) Services for mental illness: mental health is not covered under primary health in a basic health unit: participants believed that the lack of services, training and necessary medication in primary care are major issues for treating schizophrenia in community; (iv) Barriers to community-based interventions: primary care staff believed that multiple pressures on staff, lack of incentives, non-availability of medication and lack of formal referral pathways resulted in disintegration of dealing with schizophrenia patients in primary care facilities. Conclusion The study has identified a number of barriers and facilitators to developing and delivering a psychosocial intervention to support people living with schizophrenia in Pakistan. In particular, the importance of involving spiritual and traditional healers was highlighted by our diverse group of stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W4293491988,"The burrow morphology of endobenthic organisms reflects their subsurface ecology. In this study, we observed the three-dimensional development of burrows produced by the tiger pistol shrimp Alpheus bellulus in a tank using an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. CT scanning was performed at 10-30 min intervals immediately after the start of burrow construction. The three-dimensional morphology (surface area, volume, depth, length, and diameter) of burrows at each observation time was imaged and measured. In addition, the rate of increase of each parameter was calculated. Surface area, volume, length, and depth rapidly increased immediately after the start of the experiment in all burrows. Subsequently, there was a reduction in the rate of increase at 40 min after the start of excavation for burrow depth, at 75 min for length, and at 90 min for surface area and volume. Although there were large differences in burrow diameter among the burrows immediately after the start of the experiment, all burrows reached nearly identical diameters after 90 min. Changes in burrow morphology were not observed in most of the burrows more than 210 min after the start of the experiment, meaning that A. bellulus can create burrows that are sufficient for survival within this time period. The use of CT scans in this study clarified the developmental process of the three-dimensional structure of A. bellulus burrows and is applicable to various burrow-producing organisms. Our results provide new insights into the development of burrow structures."
https://openalex.org/W4293492337,"Software-defined networks offer a new approach that attracts the attention of most academic and industrial circles due to the features it contains. However, some loopholes make such modern networks vulnerable to many types of attacks. Among the most important types of these attacks is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which in turn affects the network's performance and delays many real user requests. As one of the main features of SDN is the centralization of all the control plane in the SDN controller, it becomes a central point of attack that may compromise the whole network. Hence, in our proposed approach, we aim to mitigate the DDoS attack that maybe launched to compromise the SDN controller, flood the control plane and cripple the entire network. Many DDoS mitigation scheme have been proposed, however, determining the threshold between legitimate requests and malicious requests is still a challenging task. Our proposed approach relies on a two-phases algorithm that assigns a variable trust value for every user. This trust value is compared with schemes relying on a threshold value that changes dynamically and assists in detecting the DDoS attack. The first phase of our two-phases algorithm is Header fields extraction, and the second phase is calculating the trust value based on header fields information. Our proposed approach shows better performance than related detection schemes in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and false-positive rate. Where the accuracy of the system reaches up to 98.83% which is high compared to other traditional methods."
https://openalex.org/W4293492342,"Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels are related to high-turnover bone disease and reflect vascular calcification and inflammation. ALP has been reported to have a prognostic impact in various cohorts including chronic kidney disease. This study investigated whether preoperative serum ALP level could be used for predicting mortality in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed 1,718 patients who underwent kidney transplantation between November 2005 and June 2017. Finally, 1,533 patients who met the inclusion criteria were classified into tertiles based on preoperative serum ALP level (< 51, 51-72, > 72 IU/L). The incidence of mortality was compared among the three tertiles, and a stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the predictors for mortality. The incidence of 3-year mortality was the highest in the third tertile (1.0% vs. 2.5% vs. 4.4% in the first, second, and third tertile, respectively, p = 0.003). The third tertile of ALP level (odds ratio [OR] 1.855, 95% CI 1.192-2.886, p = 0.006), age (OR 1.052, 95% CI 1.022-1.082, p = 0.011), and history of hypertension (OR 0.401, 95% CI 0.210-0.765, p = 0.006) remained as independent predictors of mortality. Preoperative serum ALP level was significantly higher in the non-survivor group than in the survivor group (58.00 [44.00-76.00] vs. 75.00 [56.25-113.00], p = 0.003). The optimal cut-off value of serum ALP to predict 3-year mortality was 71 IU/L (area under the curve 0.636, 95% CI 0.554-0.719, p = 0.003). Therefore, preoperative serum ALP level was an independent predictor of 3-year mortality in patients undergoing kidney transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W4293492464,"Identifying whether and how merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) goodwill influences corporate technology innovation is a critical topic in the context of growing M&amp;A activities. Based on the panel data of 2,634 Chinese non-financial listed companies from 2007 to 2019, this paper adopts multiple linear regression and the Bootstrap method to investigate the impact of M&amp;A goodwill on corporate technological innovation and the mechanism through which M&amp;A goodwill affects technological innovation. The results show that: (1) There is a significant negative correlation between M&amp;A goodwill and technological innovation input, with financial constraints acting as the main channels. (2) Non-private corporations enjoy a higher level of financing capacity in terms of debt and equity compared with private corporations, resulting in the absence of the disincentive effect of M&amp;A goodwill on corporate technological innovation inputs, despite the fact that M&amp;A activities also cause massive resource consumption. (3) Stock pledges by controlling shareholders are effective in alleviating the negative impact of M&amp;A goodwill on technological innovation inputs. Furthermore, our results highlight that simple stock pledge measures capture a significant influence of alleviating financing constraints, thereby decreasing the adverse impact of M&amp;A, and hence need to be adequately considered in future M&amp;A and innovation studies. While enriching the literature on the economic consequences of M&amp;A and the research on stock pledge, this paper also provides micro-evidence for an in-depth understanding of the effect of M&amp;A goodwill on technological innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4293492467,"The provision of resilience and adaptation to climate change to smallholder irrigation communities is a critical component in implementing common pool resource management. Institutions in many smallholder irrigation schemes in developing countries are diverse and have potential to contribute to building climate resilience and improving livelihoods of smallholder irrigator. Human behaviour, institutional capacity and culture play important roles in shaping adaptive capacity of communities to climate change. Although much is known about how these contribute to this adaptive capacity, research focusing on their interaction is limited. In order to close this the gap, this study seeks to explore how socio-demographic, governance and institutional factors influence adaptive capacity in Exchange, Insukamini and Ruchanyu irrigation schemes. Questionnaire-based interviews, group discussions and key informant interviews were used for data collection. Adaptive capacity calculated using the livelihood vulnerability model was used as the dependent variable for this study. Ordinary least square regression was used to assess socio-demographic, institutional and governance factors influencing adaptive capacity in the smallholder irrigation scheme. The study reveals that adaptive capacity is influenced by age, gender, education, land tenure security, irrigation committee satisfaction, cooperatives, and interaction of factors. The link between age and gender were negatively moderated by awareness of irrigation policies, access to credit and land tenure security. Assessing factors influencing adaptive capacity help to improve the livelihoods of scheme farmers in the face of climate change."

Amelioration of mTORC1 deficits by genetic modulation improves disease phenotypes in HD models, is not a viable therapeutic strategy. Here, we assessed a novel small molecule mTORC1 pathway activator, NV-5297, for its improvement of the disease phenotypes in the N171-82Q HD mouse model. Oral dosing of NV-5297 over 6 weeks activated mTORC1, increased striatal volume, improved motor learning and heart contractility. Further, the heart contractility, heart fibrosis, and survival were improved in response to the cardiac stressor isoprenaline when compared to vehicle-treated mice. Cummulatively, these data support mTORC1 activation as a therapeutic target in HD and consolidates NV-5297 as a promising drug candidate for treating central and peripheral HD phenotypes and, more generally, mTORC1-deficit related diseases."

The following four concerns were extracted from the interviews and qualitative analysis: “Difficulties in restarting/continuing farming,” which represent the difficulties in making a living from agriculture due to the absence of family members and neighbors, and the insufficient radiation decontamination; “Discriminatory treatment of products and residents from villagers,” which suggests the presence of discriminations that residents of Nagadoro district are eccentrics and its agricultural products should not be treated together with those of other districts in the Village due to the recognition that the district is severely polluted by radiation; “Shift of the responsibility of returning home from the country to residents by scapegoating,” which is characterized by the shift of responsibility from the government to the residents, including harsh social criticism of the residents of Nagadoro district for not returning even though the evacuation order has been lifted, when it should have been the government’s responsibility to recover the district to a habitable state; “Loss of options for continued evacuation,” which is the loss or weakening of the position of residents of the Nagadoro district who continue to evacuate, and of administrative compensation, resulting from the legal change that they are no longer “evacuees” after the evacuation order is lifted. The findings of this study will provide a foundation for the support of residents of the Nagadoro district after lifting the evacuation order scheduled for the spring of 2023. The findings may be transferable to the residents of other difficult-to-return zones expected to be lifted after the Nagadoro district and to also a radiation disaster-affected place in the future."

The extent to which such strains are circulating in the population is unknown.We used HIV surveillance data to describe primary and overall TDF/FTC resistance and concurrent viremia among people living with HIV (PLWH). HIV genotypes conducted for clinical purposes are reported as part of HIV surveillance. We examined the prevalence of HIV strains with mutations conferring intermediate to high level resistance to TDF/FTC, defining primary resistance (predominantly K65R and M184I/V mutations) among sequences reported within 3 months of HIV diagnosis and total resistance for sequences reported at any time. We examined trends in primary resistance during 2010-2019 and total resistance among all PLWH in 2019. We also monitored resistance with viremia (≥1,000 copies/mL) at the end of 2019 among PLWH.Between 2010 and 2019, 2,172 King County residents were diagnosed with HIV; 1,557 (72%) had a genotypic resistance test within three months; three (0.2%) had primary TDF/FTC resistance with both K65R and M184I/V mutations. Adding isolated resistance for each drug resulted in 0.3% with primary TDF resistance and 0.8% with primary FTC resistance. Of 7,056 PLWH in 2019, 4,032 (57%) had genotype results, 241 (6%) had TDF/FTC resistance and 15 (0.4% of those with a genotype result) had viremia and TDF/FTC resistance.Primary resistance and viremia combined with TDF/FTC resistance are uncommon in King County. Monitoring trends in TDF/FTC resistance coupled with interventions to help ensure PLWH achieve and maintain viral suppression may help ensure that PrEP failure remains rare."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess factors associated with neonatal near-miss.A case-control study was employed on a total of 252 cases and 756 controls using a systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected using pre-tested and interview administered questionnaires adapted from similar studies and medical records from December 2020 -March 2021. Pragmatic and management criteria definition of neonatal near miss were utilized. Epi-Data version 3.1 and SPSS version 23 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were done to identify factors associated with a neonatal near-miss by using COR and AOR with a 95% confidence interval. Finally, the statistical significance was declared at a p-value < 0.05.There were a response rate of 100% for both cases, and controls.

However, limited data exist about the extent of social interactions in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) providing long-term accommodation and care. We aimed to record the frequency and duration of interpersonal interactions among residents in RACFs and identify the association between residents’ interpersonal interactions and quality of life (QoL). Materials and methods A multi-methods study, including time and motion observations and a QoL survey, was conducted between September 2019 to January 2020. Thirty-nine residents from six Australian RACFs were observed between 09:30–17:30 on weekdays. Observations included residents’ actions, location of the action, and who the resident was with during the action. At the end of the observation period, residents completed a QoL survey. The proportion of time residents spent on different actions, in which location, and with whom were calculated, and correlations between these factors and QoL were analysed. Results A total of 312 hours of observations were conducted. Residents spent the greatest proportion of time in their own room (45.2%, 95%CI 40.7–49.8), alone (47.9%, 95%CI 43.0–52.7) and being inactive (25.6%, 95%CI 22.5–28.7). Residents were also largely engaged in interpersonal communication (20.2%, 95%CI 17.9–22.5) and self-initiated or scheduled events (20.5%, 95%CI 18.0–23.0). Residents’ interpersonal communication was most likely to occur in the common area (29.3%, 95%CI 22.9–35.7), residents’ own room (26.7%, 95%CI 21.0–32.4) or the dining room (24.6%, 95%CI 18.9–30.2), and was most likely with another resident (54.8%, 95%CI 45.7–64.2). Quality of life scores were low (median = 0.68, IQR = 0.54–0.76). Amount of time spent with other residents was positively correlated with QoL (r = 0.39, p = 0.02), whilst amount of time spent with facility staff was negatively correlated with QoL (r = -0.45, p = 0.008). Discussion and conclusions Our findings confirm an established association between social interactions and improved QoL. Opportunities and activities which encourage residents to engage throughout the day in common facility areas can support resident wellbeing."

Yet understanding and addressing such issues is necessary for communicating incidental findings with participants. We explored researchers’ perspectives and experiences regarding feedback of incidental genomics findings to participants. Methods This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interview schedules for In-depth interviews. Thirty respondents were purposively selected based on role as genetics and genomics researchers in Uganda. Data were analysed through content analysis to identify emerging themes using a comprehensive thematic matrix. QSR International NVivo software was used to support data analysis. Results a). On perceptions, sharing of incidental findings was acceptable and four themes emerged including role of professional judgement; role of ethics committees and ethical guidelines; optimal disclosure practices; limits to professional duty and uncertainty and; b). on practices, sharing had been carried out by some researchers and a theme on experience and practices emerged. Conclusion Feedback of incidental genomics research findings to participants is generally acceptable to researchers. Some researchers. Challenges include lack of ethical guidelines and uncertainty about the findings."
https://openalex.org/W4293492989,"Dickeya solani is a soft rot bacterium with high virulence. In potato, D. solani, like the other potato-infecting soft rot bacteria, causes rotting and wilting of the stems and rotting of tubers in the field and in storage. Latent, asymptomatic infections of potato tubers are common in harvested tubers, and if the storage conditions are not optimal, the latent infection turns into active rotting. We characterized potato gene expression in artificially inoculated tubers in nonsymptomatic, early infections 1 and 24 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and compared the results to the response in symptomatic tuber tissue 1 week (168 hpi) later with RNA-Seq. In the beginning of the infection, potato tubers expressed genes involved in the detection of the bacterium through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which induced genes involved in PAMPs-triggered immunity, resistance, production of pathogenesis-related proteins, ROS, secondary metabolites and salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling genes. In the symptomatic tuber tissue one week later, the PAMPs-triggered gene expression was downregulated, whereas primary metabolism was affected, most likely leading to free sugars fueling plant defense but possibly also aiding the growth of the pathogen. In the symptomatic tubers, pectic enzymes and cell wall-based defenses were activated. Measurement of hormone production revealed increased SA concentration and almost no JA in the asymptomatic tubers at the beginning of the infection and high level of JA and reduced SA in the symptomatic tubers one week later. These findings suggest that potato tubers rely on different defense strategies in the different phases of D. solani infection even when the infection takes place in fully susceptible plants incubated in conditions leading to rotting. These results support the idea that D. solani is a biotroph rather than a true necrotroph."

Push and pull factors i.e. poverty, family death, economic decline, child abuse, financial independence, and peer influence draw children into the street. The street lives by itself pushes them into sex work, and lack of shelter magnificent abuses, where both sexes have the same sleeping quarters. Materials and Methods A phenomenological study design was employed from January to March 2019 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Time-Space Sampling (TSS) was used to recruit participants into the study. Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and individual in-depth interview were used to collect data. Data analyzed by using framework analysis software. Results About 103 participants took part in the study. Finding shows street children are encountering widespread challenges like social network fragmentation, child trafficking, harassments, and shortage of basic needs. Furthermore, poor design of comprehensive, contextualized strategies and less political value worsening the problems. They are considered as a felon, outlaws, and having a mentality of committing a crime by both law-keeping bodies and society. This situation resulted in fewer acceptances of street children by the community, and less legal protection by law that made them more at risk for denial of social protection. Street children positively perceived strategies like Income Generating Activities (IGAs), shelter, community support, child protection, and access to education, health services, life coaching, and less extent re-integration strategies to address their problems. Conclusion The study shows street children are defenseless to harassments and denial of social protection services. Poorly designed policies, strategies targeting them, less political values, and traditional response by government has been subjugated, which made them prone to health and social problems. Therefore, finding might be beneficial to health data scientists, and policymakers; to design and implement policies, and strategic plans in addressing, and preventing their plights."
https://openalex.org/W4293493027,"Data on awareness of HIV status among people living with HIV (PLHIV) are critical to estimating progress toward epidemic control. To ascertain the accuracy of self-reported HIV status and antiretroviral drug (ARV) use in the Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS), we compared self-reported HIV status with HIV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results and self-reported ARV use with detectable blood ARV levels.On the basis of responses and test results, participants were categorized by HIV status and ARV use. Self-reported HIV status and ARV use performance characteristics were determined by estimating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Proportions and other analyses were weighted to account for complex survey design.During NAIIS, 186,405 participants consented for interview out of which 58,646 reported knowing their HIV status. Of the 959 (weighted, 1.5%) who self-reported being HIV-positive, 849 (92.1%) tested HIV positive and 64 (7.9%) tested HIV negative via RDT and polymerase chain reaction test for discordant positive results. Of the 849 who tested HIV positive, 743 (89.8%) reported using ARV and 72 (10.2%) reported not using ARV. Of 57,687 who self-reported being HIV negative, 686 (1.2%) tested HIV positive via RDT, with ARV biomarkers detected among 195 (25.1%). ARV was detected among 94.5% of those who self-reported using ARV and among 42.0% of those who self-reported not using ARV. Overall, self-reported HIV status had sensitivity of 52.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49.4%-56.0%) with specificity of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.8%-99.9%). Self-reported ARV use had sensitivity of 95.2% (95% CI: 93.6%-96.7%) and specificity of 54.5% (95% CI: 48.8%-70.7%).Self-reported HIV status and ARV use screening tests were found to be low-validity measures during NAIIS. Laboratory tests to confirm self-reported information may be necessary to determine accurate HIV and clinical status for HIV studies in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4293493121,"Tsetse flies use antennal expressed genes to navigate their environment. While most canonical genes associated with chemoreception are annotated, potential gaps with important antennal genes are uncharacterized in Glossina morsitans morsitans . We generated antennae-specific transcriptomes from adult male G . m . morsitans flies fed/unfed on bloodmeal and/or exposed to an attractant (ε-nonalactone), a repellant (δ-nonalactone) or paraffin diluent. Using bioinformatics approach, we mapped raw reads onto G . m . morsitans gene-set from VectorBase and collected un-mapped reads (constituting the gaps in annotation). We de novo assembled these reads (un-mapped) into transcript and identified corresponding genes of the transcripts in G . m . morsitans gene-set and protein homologs in UniProt protein database to further annotate the gaps. We predicted potential protein-coding gene regions associated with these transcripts in G . m . morsitans genome, annotated/curated these genes and identified their putative annotated orthologs/homologs in Drosophila melanogaster , Musca domestica or Anopheles gambiae genomes. We finally evaluated differential expression of the novel genes in relation to odor exposures relative to no-odor control (unfed flies). About 45.21% of the sequenced reads had no corresponding transcripts within G . m . morsitans gene-set, corresponding to the gap in existing annotation of the tsetse fly genome. The total reads assembled into 72,428 unique transcripts, most (74.43%) of which had no corresponding genes in the UniProt database. We annotated/curated 592 genes from these transcripts, among which 202 were novel while 390 were improvements of existing genes in the G . m . morsitans genome. Among the novel genes, 94 had orthologs in D . melanogaster , M . domestica or An . gambiae while 88 had homologs in UniProt. These orthologs were putatively associated with oxidative regulation, protein synthesis, transcriptional and/or translational regulation, detoxification and metal ion binding, thus providing insight into their specific roles in antennal physiological processes in male G . m . morsitans . A novel gene (GMOY014237.R1396) was differentially expressed in response to the attractant. We thus established significant gaps in G . m . morsitans genome annotation and identified novel male antennae-expressed genes in the genome, among which &gt; 53% (108) are potentially G . m . morsitans specific."
https://openalex.org/W4293493364,"Background Available evidence showed that metabolic syndrome in the adult population is persistently elevated due to nutrition transition, genetic predisposition, individual-related lifestyle factors, and other environmental risks. However, in developing nations, the burden and scientific evidence on the pattern, and risk exposures for the development of the metabolic syndrome were not adequately investigated. Thus, the study aimed to measure the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and to identify specific risk factors among adult populations who visited Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 419 adults attending Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from January 25 to February 29, 2020. We used the WHO STEP-wise approach for non-communicable disease surveillance to assess participants’ disease condition. Metabolic syndrome was measured using the harmonized criteria recommended by the International Diabetes Federation Task Force in 2009. Data were explored for missing values, outliers and multicollinearity before presenting the summary statistics and regression results. Multivariable logistic regression was used to disentangle statistically significant predictors of metabolic syndrome expressed using an odds ratio with a 95% of uncertainty interval. All statistical tests were managed using SPSS version 26. A non-linear dose-response analysis was performed to show the relationships between metabolic syndromes with potential risk factors. Results The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome among adults was 35.0% (95% CI, (30.5, 39.8)). Women were more affected than men (i.e. 40.3% vs 29.4%). After adjusting for other variables, being female [OR = 1.85; 95% CI (1.01, 3.38)], urban residence [OR = 1.94; 95% CI (1.08, 3.24)], increased age [OR = 18.23; 95% CI (6.66, 49.84)], shorter sleeping durations [OR = 4.62; 95% CI (1.02, 20.98)], sedentary behaviour [OR = 4.05; 95% CI (1.80, 9.11)], obesity [OR = 3.14; 95% CI (1.20, 8.18)] and alcohol drinking [OR = 2.85; 95% CI (1.27,6.39)] were positively associated with the adult metabolic syndrome. Whilst have no formal education [OR = 0.30; 95% CI (0.12, 0.74)] was negatively associated with metabolic syndrome. Conclusions The prevalence of adult metabolic syndrome is found to be high. Metabolic syndrome has linear relationships with BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, and level of education. The demographic and behavioural factors are strongly related with the risk of metabolic syndrome. Since most of the factors are modifiable, there should be urgent large-scale community intervention programs focusing on increased physical activity, healthy sleep, weight management, minimize behavioural risk factors, and healthier food interventions targeting a lifecycle approach. The existing policy should be evaluated whether due attention has given to prevention strategies of NCDs."
