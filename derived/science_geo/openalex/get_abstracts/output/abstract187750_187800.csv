High-power femtosecond laser pulses have been found to propagate in the atmosphere as dynamically self-guided filaments that emit in a continuum from the ultraviolet to the infrared. This white light exhibits a directional behavior with enhanced backward scattering and was detected from an altitude of more than 20 kilometers. This light source opens the way to white-light and nonlinear light detection and ranging applications for atmospheric trace-gas remote sensing or remote identification of aerosols. Air ionization inside the filaments also opens promising perspectives for laser-induced condensation and lightning control. The mobile femtosecond-terawatt laser system, Teramobile, has been constructed to study these applications."

Because of the homology of TSC2 with GTPase-activating proteins for Rap1, we examined whether a Ras/Rap-related GTPase might be involved in this process. TSC2 was found to bind to Rheb-GTP in vitro and to reduce Rheb GTP levels in vivo. Over-expression of Rheb but not Rap1 promoted the activation of S6 kinase in a rapamycin-dependent manner, suggesting that Rheb acts upstream of mTOR. The ability of Rheb to induce S6 phosphorylation was also inhibited by a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, suggesting that Rheb may be responsible for the Ras-independent anti-neoplastic properties of this drug.

The Ras subfamily of small GTPases regulates a vast array of biological events that include cell growth, differentiation, and transformation (1Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The prototypic Ras proteins, Ha-, K-, and N-Ras, are known to transduce mitogenic and differentiation signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus (1Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, despite their conservation throughout eukaryotic evolution, the function of Ras-related GTPases such as Rap1, R-Ras, Ral, Rheb, and Rit remains, at best, poorly understood. Ras activity is regulated by a GDP/GTP cycle whereby guanine nucleotide exchange factors promote the release of GDP from inactive Ras, facilitating its loading with the more abundant GTP (2Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to GTP induces a conformational change enabling interaction with and activation of downstream effector proteins (1Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The termination of this signal is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; FTI, farnesyl transferase inhibitor; LAM, lymphangioleiomyomatosis; S6K, ribosomal S6 kinase; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; dTOR, Drosophila target of rapamycin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GppNHp, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. which greatly accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras, returning it to its inactive state (2Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of Ras GAP, as occurs in the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, results in increased Ras GTP levels, which contribute to tumor development (3Gutmann D.H. Semin. Pediatr. Neurol. 1998; 5: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4Dasgupta B. Gutmann D.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) are additional diseases that could be linked to the loss of GTPase regulation. TSC is a genetic disorder that results in the formation of benign tumors known as hamartomas, most typically found in kidney, brain, heart, and lung (3Gutmann D.H. Semin. Pediatr. Neurol. 1998; 5: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Cheadle J.P. Reeve M.P. Sampson J.R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). LAM is a devastating lung disease that affects mainly women and is characterized by proliferation of atypical smooth muscle cells within the lung parenchyma (6Sullivan E.J. Chest. 1998; 114: 1689-1703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The inactivation of two tumor suppressor genes has been associated with TSC and LAM: TSC1 encodes the protein hamartin (TSC1), and TSC2 that encodes tuberin (TSC2) (7van Slegtenhorst M. de Hoogt R.

Although TSC1 contains coiled-coil domains that are important for the formation of a functional complex with TSC2, TSC2 shares sequence homology with a family of GAPs that regulate the Ras-related GTPase, Rap1 (5Cheadle J.P. Reeve M.P. Sampson J.R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Accordingly, TSC2 has been reported to increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rap1 and also Rab5 in vitro (10Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol.

However, it is not known whether this activity occurs in vivo or if it contributes to the physiological function of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. Several recent studies in Drosophila and mammalian cells have indicated that the TSC1-TSC2 complex represses cell growth downstream of insulin through the inhibition of S6K, a key component in the regulation of protein translation (12Goncharova E.A.

Over-expression of the C terminus of TSC2, which lacks interaction with TSC1, was sufficient to suppress tumorigenesis in cancer cell lines and in a transgenic rat system, suggesting that it is the active component of the TSC complex (22Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G.H. Maize Jr., J.C. DeClue J.E. Yeung R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9154-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Momose S. Kobayashi T. Mitani H.

Intriguingly, this region of TSC2 encompasses the Rap GAP-related domain and is the most highly conserved region of TSC2 in eukaryotic species ranging from yeast to man (5Cheadle J.P. Reeve M.P. Sampson J.R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In this study, in an effort to understand its mechanism of action, we investigated whether TSC2 could regulate Rap1 or related GTPases in vivo. Our results suggest that TSC2 suppresses mTOR-dependent activation of S6K via the Ras-related GTPase, Rheb. Plasmid Constructs—Full-length human TSC2 and TSC1 were kindly provided by E. Henske and A. Astrinidis (Fox Chase Cancer Center). TSC1 was subcloned into the NotI site of a modified pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma) in which the FLAG tag had been frame-shifted by cutting, blunting, and religating the HindIII site. pBluescript SK-II(+)-TSC2 was digested with KpnI and BamHI and inserted into the modified pFLAG-CMV2 vector. To clone the C terminus of TSC2 (residues 965–1807), an EcoRI/BamHI fragment from full-length TSC2 was ligated in-frame with the FLAG epitope of the modified pFLAG-pCMV2. Rheb wild type (24Clark G.J.

GST-Ras constructs were as previously described (25Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis for S6 and S6K Phosphorylation—293T human embryonic kidney cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and transfected the following day using calcium phosphate precipitation. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved overnight and lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 19 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance) for Ras GTPases, M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for TSC gene products, anti-ribosomal protein S6, anti-phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (Ser-235 and Ser-236), anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-389), and anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-421 and Ser-424) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA). Equal loading of lanes was confirmed by blotting with glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody (Biodesign Int., Saco, ME). Rapamycin, FTI 277, and U0126 were from Calbiochem. Miscellaneous—Ras protein binding assays were performed as described previously (25Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), except the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GppNHp (Sigma), and ∼5 μg of GST-Ras fusion proteins were used. For TSC2 expression, 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. In vivo GAP activity was determined essentially as described (25Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), except that cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, and only 150 ng of HA-tagged Rheb plasmid was used for the in vivo Rheb GAP assay. Several recent studies have demonstrated that the tumor suppressor complex TSC1-TSC2 is an antagonist of mTOR-dependent activation of S6K (13Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35364-35370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), the mechanism of action of TSC1-TSC2 is poorly understood. Studies in tumor cell lines and a transgenic rat system have demonstrated that the tumor suppressor activity of TSC2 is located within a C-terminal region that encompasses a sequence homologous to that of the catalytic domain of Rap GAPs (22Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G.H. Maize Jr., J.C. DeClue J.E. Yeung R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9154-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Momose S. Kobayashi T. Mitani H. Hirabayashi M. Ito K. Ueda M. Nabeshima Y. Hino O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As an initial step to address the functional importance of the GAP-related domain of TSC2, we metabolically labeled the guanine nucleotide pool of 293T cells expressing HA-tagged Rap1A using 32Pi and examined the Rap1 GTP/(GTP + GDP) ratio in the presence or absence of over-expressed TSC2 or RapGAP1 (26Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), a known Rap GAP. The basal level of 7–10% Rap1A-GTP was reduced to almost undetectable levels upon expression of RapGAP1 (Fig. 1). However, over-expression of TSC2 did not affect the amount of GTP-bound Rap1A. Because TSC2 complexes with TSC1, it was possible that the latter is necessary for the correct localization and interaction of TSC2 with Rap1A in vivo. Thus, we tested the levels of GTP-bound Rap1A when TSC1 and TSC2 are over-expressed together. Although TSC1 stabilized TSC2 expression, we still could not detect any TSC2 GAP activity toward Rap1A (Fig. 1). These results suggest that TSC2 does not act as a Rap1 GAP in vivo but do not exclude a functional activity for the Rap1 GAP homologous domain of TSC2. To determine whether TSC2 might alternatively regulate other Ras family members, we expressed a FLAG-tagged C-terminal fragment of TSC2 and attempted to precipitate it from 293T cell lysates using a panel of GST-fused Ras proteins that had been loaded with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GppNHp. As shown in Fig. 2, the truncated TSC2 was efficiently precipitated by GST-Rheb but only weakly or not at all by Rap1A, Ral, Ha-Ras, or R-Ras. To examine whether the binding of TSC2 to Rheb promotes GTP hydrolysis in vivo, we performed experiments similar to those described in Fig. 1 to measure the levels of GTP-bound Rheb following TSC2 over-expression. As reported previously (27Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the basal level of GTP-bound Rheb was higher than that of Rap1A (Fig. 3). Over-expression of TSC2 significantly decreased the levels of GTP-bound Rheb (Fig. 3), consistent with TSC2 binding to Rheb and acting as a Rheb GAP in vivo. However, because the GTP-bound state of Rheb is influenced by its expression level (27Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the reduced binding of Rheb to GTP in the presence of TSC2 may just be a reflection of its reduced expression (Fig. 3, compare intensities of spots in lanes 1 and 2 with those in lanes 3 and 4). The cellular function of Rheb in mammals is unknown (24Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B.

However, genetic studies in fission yeast have implicated it in amino acid uptake and metabolism. Loss of Rhb1, a Rheb-related GTPase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, causes growth arrest and a cellular morphology similar to that generated by nitrogen starvation (29Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rheb was shown to regulate the uptake of basic amino acids (30Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11198-11206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mutation of the S. pombe TSC1-TSC2 complex also disrupts nutrient uptake, supportive of a functional link between Rheb and TSC2 (31Matsumoto S. Bandyopadhyay A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Maitra U. Matsumoto T. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1053-1063PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian TSC1-TSC2 complex seems to regulate cell growth by inhibiting the mTOR-dependent activation of S6K1. Indeed, over-expression of TSC2 (12Goncharova E.A. Goncharov D.A. Eszterhas A. Hunter D.S. Glassberg M.K. Yeung R.S. Walker C.L. Noonan D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Chou M.M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Krymskaya V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30958-30967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) or the TSC1-TSC2 complex (Fig. 4A (13Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar, 16Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar)) significantly reduced basal- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Because TSC2 decreases the level of active, GTP-bound Rheb in vivo, it seemed likely that Rheb is the cellular target of TSC1-TSC2 in the mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, we explored whether over-expression of wild type Rheb or a GTPase-defective Rheb(64L) mutant affects endogenous S6 phosphorylation. Both proteins induced strong phosphorylation of S6 at serines 235 and 236, whereas constitutively activated Rap1A(63E) or Rap1A(64A) mutants were ineffective (Fig 4B). The strong activity of the wild type Rheb was consistent with the high levels of active GTP-bound Rheb detected under basal conditions (see Fig. 3), whereas the weaker activity of Rheb(64L) was likely because of its lower expression. Phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 occurs upon S6K activation. Because S6K is activated by phosphorylation on several residues (32Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), we analyzed S6K activity using phospho-specific antibodies. Over-expression of wild type Rheb induced strong phosphorylation of endogenous S6K at residues Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424, which correlated with an increase in S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Although it has been shown that TSC1-TSC2 appears to regulate S6K phosphorylation primarily at residue 389 (12Goncharova E.A. Goncharov D.A. Eszterhas A. Hunter D.S. Glassberg M.K. Yeung R.S.

Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), cells derived from LAM lesions and TSC2–/– cells exhibit constitutive phosphorylation of S6K at residues Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424 (12Goncharova E.A. Goncharov D.A. Eszterhas A. Hunter D.S. Glassberg M.K. Yeung R.S. Walker C.L. Noonan D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Chou M.M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Krymskaya V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30958-30967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Because the effect of TSC1-TSC2 on S6K activity is mTOR-dependent, we next determined whether Rheb affects S6 phosphorylation in an mTOR-dependent manner. Treatment with rapamycin, which inhibits mTOR activity, completely blocked the increase in S6 phosphorylation induced by wild type Rheb, whereas the MEK inhibitor U0126 was ineffective (Fig. 5). Overall, these results are consistent with TSC1-TSC2-mediated inhibition of the mTOR pathway occurring at the level of Rheb. Although these data do not conclusively establish whether Rheb acts directly on mTOR or via a parallel pathway to coordinate S6 phosphorylation, in favor of TSC1-TSC2 and Rheb acting upstream of mTOR, it has been shown that dTSC1-TSC2 interact with dTOR in Drosophila melanogaster cells (18Gao X.

Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). On the basis of current knowledge, we propose that Rheb-GTP is an upstream activator of mTOR. In this model, TSC2 acting as a Rheb GAP would prevent Rheb from activating mTOR. After mitogen stimulation, Akt phosphorylates TSC2, reducing its Rheb GAP activity, thus increasing the amount of Rheb-GTP and consequently mTOR kinase activity. However, this model is not consistent with some studies that failed to detect significant changes in mTOR activity upon mitogenic stimulation (33Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 34Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that Rheb might alleviate the activity of a negative regulator of mTOR-dependent S6K activation. In this regard, it has been shown that protein phosphatase 2A-mediated regulation of S6K is controlled by mTOR (36Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A model in which Rheb regulates accessibility of mTOR to such a phosphatase would be consistent with our findings. During the review process, additional studies confirmed that Rheb is a component of the insulin/TOR pathway and that TSC2 possesses Rheb GAP activity (37Zhang Y. Gao X. Saucedo L.J. Ru B. Edgar B.A. Pan D. Nat Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 38Stocker H. Radimerski T. Schindelholz B. Wittwer F. Belawat P. Daram P. Breuer S. Thomas G. Hafen E.

Aberrant up-regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway resulting from the loss of either TSC2 or TSC1 function in TSC and LAM patients points to rapamycin as a potential treatment. The present work also suggests that Rheb is a critical component of the mTOR pathway. Like Ras, Rheb is post-translationally modified by the farnesyl lipid, enabling attachment to membranes for normal cellular function (24Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Indeed, farnesylation of Rheb is essential for cell cycle progression in yeast and cannot be substituted by the related geranylgeranyl moiety (41Yang W. Tabancay Jr., A.P. Urano J. Tamanoi F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). FTIs have been designed as anti-tumor agents to block the lipid modification of oncogenic Ras. However, the anti-neoplastic activities of these inhibitors appear to be because of their ability to alter the prenylation and function of proteins other than Ras (42Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 43Prendergast G.C. Rane N. Expert Opin. Investig.

Suppl. 2001; 37: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FTIs block S6K activation (45Law B.K. Norgaard P. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10796-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rheb may be the elusive farnesyl transferase substrate responsible for tumor cell growth arrest. To evaluate whether farnesylation is important for the mTOR-dependent S6 phosphorylation induced by Rheb, we treated cells with FTI 277. As anticipated, FTI 277 dramatically inhibited basal and Rheb-stimulated S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 6). These observations imply that Rheb farnesylation is critical for upstream regulation of S6K activity and may be the cellular target of FTIs, and that these drugs may be useful in the clinical treatment of TSC and/or LAM. In summary, our present results have demonstrated that TSC2 binds to and decreases the levels of active GTP-bound Rheb in vivo, suggesting a functional role for Rheb in opposing the TSC1-TSC2 signaling pathway. Consistent with this notion, we have demonstrated that Rheb induces mTOR-dependent S6K1 activation and S6 phosphorylation. Importantly, this Rheb activity can be blocked by FTI treatment, suggesting that Rheb may be the missing target of FTIs in cancer treatment. We are grateful to Xiumei Yang for excellent technical assistance and to Aris Astrinidis and Lisa Henske for the TSC1 and TSC2 constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2053761680,"The activation of NF-κB has been shown to be regulated by multiple phosphorylations of IκBs and the NF-κB p65 subunit. Here, we characterized the intracellular signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of p65 on Ser-536 using a novel anti-phospho-p65 (Ser-536) antibody. The Ser-536 of endogenous p65 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of NF-κB stimulants including TNF-α in the cytoplasm and rapidly dephosphorylated in the nucleus. The TNF-α-but not IL-1β-induced Ser-536 phosphorylation was severely impaired in murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from traf2<sup>-/-</sup>traf5<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IκB phosphorylation, inhibited the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, overexpression of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), IKKα and IKKβ stimulated the phosphorylation, and their dominant negative mutants blocked the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation. Moreover, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against TAK1, IKKα and IKKβ blocked the phosphorylation of endogenous p65. On the other hand, calyculin-A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, blocked the dephosphorylation in the nucleus <i>in vivo</i>. These results indicate that similar signaling pathways were utilized for the phosphorylations of IκBα and p65, which further support the idea that both IκB and NF-κB are substrates for the IKK complex in the activation of NF-κB."

Nrf2-/- neurons in this mixed culture system were more sensitive to mitochondrial toxin (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine or rotenone)-induced apoptosis compared with Nrf2+/+ neurons.

As predicted from the microarray data, Nrf2-/- neurons were indeed more vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of ionomycin- and 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone-induced increases in intracellular calcium. Finally, adenoviral vector-mediated overexpression of Nrf2 recovered ARE-driven gene expression in Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures and rescued Nrf2-/- neurons from rotenone- or ionomycin-induced cell death.

Recently, Nrf2 target genes were identified by oligonucleotide microarray analysis, and the gene lists suggest that Nrf2 is important in combating electrophiles and reactive oxygen species (11Lee J.-M.

Chan et al. reported that Nrf2 protects liver from acetaminophen-induced injury (15Chan K. Han X.D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, our laboratory reported that Nrf2-/- primary astrocytes are more susceptible to oxidative stress and inflammation compared with Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (11Lee J.-M. Calkins M.J. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12029-12038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of these Nrf2+/+ (but not Nrf2-/-) astrocytes with t-butylhydroquinone, which induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation resulting in coordinate up-regulation of ARE-driven genes, attenuates H2O2- and platelet-activating factor-induced cell death (11Lee J.-M.

Similarly, t-butylhydroquinone-mediated protective effects have been shown in rodent and human neuroblastoma cells (18Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the coordinate up-regulation of antioxidant genes is the key to protecting cells from oxidative stress and that Nrf2 is a master regulator of ARE-driven antioxidant gene expression, a process we refer to as programmed cell life (19Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Although the underlying mechanism by which dopaminergic neurons degenerate is not clear, oxidative stress has been implicated to play a role in the neuronal cell death associated with PD (20Adams Jr., J.D. Chang M.L. Klaidman L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In support of this, many studies have shown decreased antioxidant levels in PD patients as well as a protective effect of antioxidants in animal models of PD. For example, GSH and coenzyme Q10 have been reported to play an important role in protecting dopaminergic neurons not only in human PD patients, but also in animal PD models (21Nakamura K. Wang W. Kang U.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1850-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Beal M.F. Matthews R.T. Tieleman A. Shults C.W.

In addition, iron metabolism and ferritin levels are involved in dopaminergic neuronal cell death in PD patients (25Dexter D.T. Carayon A. Vidailhet M. Ruberg M. Agid F. Agid Y. Lees A.J. Wells F.R.

A recent publication demonstrated that selective overexpression of human ferritin in dopaminergic neurons or administration of an iron chelator prevents 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrapyridine-induced death of dopaminergic neurons in vivo (27Kaur D. Yantiri F. Rajagopalan S. Kumar J. Mo J.Q. Boonplueang R. Viswanath V. Jacobs R. Yang L. Beal M.F. DiMonte D. Volitaskis I. Ellerby L. Cherny R.A. Bush A.I. Andersen J.K.

Furthermore, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase have been reported to play a protective role in animal models of PD (28Przedborski S. Kostic V. Jackson-Lewis V. Naini A.B. Simonetti S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, our recent oligonucleotide microarray study with mouse primary astrocytes showed that the expression of many of these protective antioxidant genes such as glutamate-cysteine ligase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and ferritin is dependent on Nrf2. Together, these observations suggest that coordinate upregulation of these programmed cell life genes through an Nrf2-ARE pathway may protect neurons from reactive oxygen species-induced neuronal cell death. In this study, we raised and tested the hypothesis that decreased levels of detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins in Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures result in increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. To investigate this hypothesis, we used Nrf2-/- and Nrf2+/+ neuronal cultures treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPP+) or rotenone. Both of these compounds inhibit mitochondrial respiration (complex I) and are widely used in animal and/or cell culture models of PD (31Offen D. Beart P.M. Cheung N.S. Pascoe C.J. Hochman A.

Furthermore, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to identify genes associated with this Nrf2-dependent differential sensitivity to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Primary Neuronal Culture—Nrf2+/- mice were bred with Nrf2+/- mice, and primary neuronal cultures were prepared individually. Cerebral cortices from littermate embryos (gestation day 16) were removed, placed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (3 ml/embryo; Invitrogen), centrifuged (300 × g, 2 min), and digested individually (0.5 mg/ml trypsin (Invitrogen) in Hanks' balanced salt solution, 37 °C, 10 min). Tissues were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended in minimal essential medium with Earle's salt (Invitrogen) containing heat-inactivated (55 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum (10%; Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.) and horse serum (10%; Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.). Cell suspensions were sieved through cell strainers (70 μm; Falcon) and plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After 45 min of initial plating, the medium was changed to neurobasal medium ([Ca2+] = 1.8 mm) supplemented with B27 Minus AO (antioxidant) (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified tri-gas incubator (5% O2, 90% N2, and 5% CO2; Forma Scientific, Inc.). The Nrf2 genotype of each culture was determined by a PCR-based method as described previously (11Lee J.-M. Calkins M.J. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12029-12038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Cultures were used for experiments between 2 and 7 days in vitro (DIV). Over 90% of the cells in the cultures (both Nrf2-/- and Nrf2+/+) were neurons as determined by immunostaining of the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako Corp.) and the neuron-specific markers microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2; Chemicon International, Inc.) and βIII-tubulin (Promega) (data not shown). In addition, there was no difference in the ratio of cell type (neurons versus astrocytes) between Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- cultures (data not shown). NQO1 Activity—NQO1 enzymatic activity was determined by a colorimetric method for whole cell extracts (34Prochaska H.J. Santamaria A.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and by histochemistry for fixed cultures as described previously (35Johnson D.A. Andrews G.K. Xu W. Johnson J.A. J.

Cytotoxicity Assay—3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS; Promega) cytotoxicity assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL; Roche Applied Science) staining were performed according to the manufacturers' protocols. Immunohistochemistry—Cells on chamber slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline; fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min; and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-MAP2 (1:200), mouse anti-βIII-tubulin (1:200), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500), and rabbit anticleaved caspase-3 (1:200) (Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-Nrf2 (1:2000) and rabbit anti-GST Mu1 (1:1000) (Biotrin); and rabbit anti-GCLC (1:1000)) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with Texas Red- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Hoechst 33258 was used for nuclear counterstaining. Fluorescence microscope pictures were taken under the same conditions. Western Blot Analysis and Total GSH Measurement—Western blot analysis for GST Mu1, GCLM, and GCLC were performed, and total GSH levels were measured as described previously (11Lee J.-M. Calkins M.J.

Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription system (Promega) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Aliquots of cDNA were used for PCR amplification with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). PCR primers specific to each gene are as follows: Nrf2 exons 1–3, 5′-AGTTCTCGCTGCTCGGACTA-3′ and 5′-AGGCATCTTGTTTGGGAATG-3′; Nrf2 exon 5, 5′-TCTCCTCGCTGGAAAAAGAA-3′ and 5′-AATGTGCTGGCTGTGCTTTA-3′; NQO1, 5′-CATTCTGAAAGGCTGGTTTGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGCTTTGATCTGGTTGTCAG-3′; GST Alpha4, 5′-GCCAAGTACCCTTGGTTGAA-3′ and 5′-CAATCCTGACCACCTCAACA-3′; GST Mu1, 5′-CTCCCGACTTTGACAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGGAAGTCCCTCAGGTTTG-3′; GST Mu3, 5′-AATCTTGGCCTGGATTTTCC-3′ and 5′-GAGGAAGCGGCTACTCTTCA-3′; GCLM, 5′-ACCTGGCCTCCTGCTGTGTG-3′ and 5′-GGTCGGTGAGCTGTGGGTGT-3′; GCLC, 5′-ACAAGCACCCCCGCTTCGGT-3′ and 5′-CTCCAGGCCTCTCTCCTCCC-3′; visinin-like 1, 5′-AAGTCATGGAGGACCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-CAGGCCATCCTCATTCATTT-3′; calbindin-28K, 5′-TGTGGCACATTCTTTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTACCTTCCCTTACCAA-3′; synaptotagmin, 5′-GACAAAAGTCCACCGGAAAA-3′ and 5′-CTCGAACGGAACTTCAAAGC-3′; hippocalcin, 5′-AGGAAGGGGCTAAGCAAGAC-3′ and 5′-CGTGAGTGCACGAGAGAGAG-3′; and β-actin, 5′-AGAGCATAGCCCTCGTAGAT-3′ and 5′-CCCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATC-3′. Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was obtained from Nrf2-/- and Nrf2+/+ primary neuronal cultures. Biotinylated cRNA was prepared, and fragmented cRNA was hybridized to MG U74Av2 arrays (11Lee J.-M. Calkins M.J. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Johnson J.A. J. Biol.

Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version 5.0 was used to scan and analyze the relative abundance of each gene (analysis parameters: scaling target signal, 2500; Alpha1, 0.04; Alpha2, 0.06; Tau, 0.015; Gamma1L and Gamma1H, 0.025; Gamma2L and Gamma2H, 0.05; and pertubation, 1.1). Data were analyzed by rank analysis as previously described (11Lee J.-M. Calkins M.J. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Johnson J.A. J. Biol.

The reproducibility of comparisons was based on the coefficient of variation (cv; S.D./mean) for the -fold change of ranked genes. A distribution curve of the cv was used to determine a cv cutoff value. The cutoff values were cv < 1.0- and ≥1.3-fold for increased genes and cv > -1.0- and ≤ -1.3-fold for decreased genes. Gene categorization was based on the NetAffex Database. 2Available at www.affymetrix.com. Adenoviral Infection—Recombinant adenoviral vectors (Ad-GFP, expressing GFP alone; and Ad-Nrf2, expressing GFP and Nrf2) were constructed using the Cre-lox system (Canadian Stroke Network Core Facility, University of Ottawa) (36Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nrf2 cDNA was excised from pEF/Nrf2 (4Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) by NotI and HindIII restriction. Titers of all viruses were determined on HEK293 cells. Nrf2-/- primary neuronal cultures were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Nrf2 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 at 2 DIV for 48 h. Typically, 10–20% of the neurons and virtually 100% of the astrocytes were infected with viral vectors as determined by GFP fluorescence and MAP2 and GFAP staining. Nrf2-dependent NQO1 Gene Expression in Primary Neuronal Cultures—Initially, we compared the level of expression and enzymatic activity of a known Nrf2-dependent ARE-driven gene, NQO1, in Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- primary neuronal cultures. The expression level of NQO1 was dramatically greater in Nrf2+/+ neuronal cultures (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the NQO1 activity of Nrf2+/+ neuronal cultures was significantly higher than that of Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures (Fig. 1B). This correlated with a complete lack of NQO1 histochemical staining in the Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures (Fig. 1C) and implies that the lack of Nrf2 significantly reduced the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway in primary neuronal cultures. It was also noted, as published previously by our laboratory (35Johnson D.A. Andrews G.K. Xu W. Johnson J.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), that NQO1 staining was isolated to the astrocytes in this mixed culture system. Differential Sensitivity to Mitochondrial Toxins—To investigate whether this loss of Nrf2-dependent gene expression confers increased sensitivity of neurons to oxidative stress, we treated primary neuronal cultures with the well known mitochondrial toxins MPP+ (31Offen D. Beart P.M. Cheung N.S. Pascoe C.J. Hochman A. Gorodin S. Melamed E. Bernard R. Bernard O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and rotenone (32Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar, 33Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Stout A.K. Lund S. Baptista M. Panov A.V. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. J.

These compounds induce neuronal cell death by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, resulting in decreased ATP levels, loss of membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species generation, and increased [Ca2+]i. As shown in Fig. 2A, Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures were much more sensitive to MPP+- or rotenone-induced cytotoxicity. Rotenone (0.1 μm) and MPP+ (50 μm) induced 85% cell death (equivalent to 100% neuronal cell death) in Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures (Fig. 2A). The remaining MTS activity is presumably due to the surviving astrocytes. Strikingly, the same concentrations of MPP+ and rotenone induced little or no cell death in Nrf2+/+ neuronal cultures, respectively (Fig. 2A). This is reflected in the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in MPP+- or rotenone-treated Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures (Fig. 2B). There were far greater numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in the Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures than in the Nrf2+/+ neuronal cultures (Fig. 2B). Double labeling with selective astrocyte or neuronal markers indicated that these apoptotic cells were neurons, not astrocytes (data not shown). MPP+ and rotenone also preferentially activated the caspase-3 pathway in Nrf2-/- cultured neurons as shown by immunostaining for the cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Preferential activation of caspase-3 in Nrf2-/- neuronal cultures by mitochondrial toxins. Primary neuronal cultures were treated with vehicle (0.01% Me2SO), MPP+ (50 μm), or rotenone (0.1 μm). After 24 h, cells were stained for cleaved caspase-3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Nrf2 Target Genes—To identify the Nrf2 target genes conferring this observed neuroprotection, we performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis on Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- primary neuronal cultures. A total of 142 increased and 175 decreased genes were identified using rank analysis (R ≥ 4, R ≤ -4), followed by cutoff values for cv (cv < 1.0, cv > -1.0) and -fold change (-fold ≥ 1.3, -fold ≤ -1.3). The major functional categories of Nrf2 target genes in primary neuronal cultures are 1) detoxification/antioxidant/reducing potential, 2) calcium homeostasis, 3) growth factors, 4) signaling, 5) receptor/channel/carrier protein, 6) neuron-specific proteins, and 7) defense/immune/inflammation (Table I). 3A complete list of all increased and decreased genes, including genes of unknown function and expressed sequence tags, is available upon request. Although many of the classical Nrf2-dependent ARE-driven genes such as NQO1, GSTs, and GCLC were increased by Nrf2 in primary neuronal cultures, the final list of Nrf2 target genes in these neuronal cultures was quite distinct from those of other cell types (11Lee J.-M.

https://openalex.org/W2109121146,"To determine how patterned visual activity regulates the development of axonal projections, we collected in vivo time-lapse images of retinal axons from albino Xenopus tadpoles in which binocular innervation of the optic tectum was induced. Axons added branch tips with nearly equal probability in all territories, but eliminated them preferentially from territory dominated by the opposite eye. This selective branch elimination was abolished by blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. These results describe a correlation-based mechanism by which visual experience directly governs axon branch dynamics that contribute to the development of topographic maps."

To achieve maximal effectiveness, an ACC inhibitor should inhibit both the lipogenic tissue isozyme (ACC1) and the oxidative tissue isozyme (ACC2). Herein, we describe the biochemical and acute physiological properties of CP-610431, an isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor identified through high throughput inhibition screening, and CP-640186, an analog with improved metabolic stability. CP-610431 inhibited ACC1 and ACC2 with IC50s of ∼50 nm. Inhibition was reversible, uncompetitive with respect to ATP, and non-competitive with respect to bicarbonate, acetyl-CoA, and citrate, indicating interaction with the enzymatic carboxyl transfer reaction. CP-610431 also inhibited fatty acid synthesis, triglyceride (TG) synthesis, TG secretion, and apolipoprotein B secretion in HepG2 cells (ACC1) with EC50s of 1.6, 1.8, 3.0, and 5.7 μm, without affecting either cholesterol synthesis or apolipoprotein CIII secretion. CP-640186, also inhibited both isozymes with IC50sof ∼55 nm but was 2–3 times more potent than CP-610431 in inhibiting HepG2 cell fatty acid and TG synthesis. CP-640186 also stimulated fatty acid oxidation in C2C12 cells (ACC2) and in rat epitrochlearis muscle strips with EC50s of 57 nm and 1.3 μm. In rats, CP-640186 lowered hepatic, soleus muscle, quadriceps muscle, and cardiac muscle malonyl-CoA with ED50s of 55, 6, 15, and 8 mg/kg. Consequently, CP-640186 inhibited fatty acid synthesis in rats, CD1 mice, and ob/ob mice with ED50s of 13, 11, and 4 mg/kg, and stimulated rat whole body fatty acid oxidation with an ED50 of ∼30 mg/kg.

Metabolic syndrome (also known as insulin resistance syndrome, syndrome X) is a common clinical disorder that is defined as the presence of increased insulin concentrations in association with other disorders including visceral obesity, hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and sometimes hyperuricemia and renal dysfunction (1Reaven G.M.

Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, reduction in malonyl-CoA levels through ACC inhibition may provide a mechanism for increasing fatty acid utilization that may reduce TG-rich lipoprotein secretion (very low density lipoprotein) by the liver, alter insulin secretion by the pancreas, and improve insulin sensitivity in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Additionally, by increasing fatty acid utilization and by preventing increases in de novo fatty acid synthesis, chronic administration of an ACC inhibitor may also deplete liver and adipose tissue TG stores in obese subjects consuming a low fat diet, leading to selective loss of body fat. Therefore, a well tolerated ACC inhibitor could effectively and simultaneously treat the multiple risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome and could have a significant impact on the prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The first reported evidence that inhibition of ACC could favorably affect the etiology of the metabolic syndrome came from studies with the long-chain fatty acid analog, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA; Refs. 23Parker R.A.

However, the similarity of TOFA to various long-chain fatty acids called into question the specificity of the compound for ACC inhibition relative to inhibition of other long-chain fatty acyl-CoA-utilizing enzymes and therefore complicated interpretation of the findings with respect to the benefits of ACC inhibition per se.

More recently, a report by Wakil and co-workers (34Abu-Elheiga L. Matzuk M.M. Abo-Hashema K.A.H. Wakil S.J. Science. 2001; 291: 2613-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) demonstrated that knock-out mice lacking ACC2 activity but maintaining a fully functional ACC1 gene locus, presented with a phenotype demonstrating a reduction in skeletal muscle malonyl-CoA concentrations, an increase in rates of muscle fatty acid oxidation, a reduced hepatic fat content, a reduction in total body fat in the face of a somewhat greater food consumption, and a reduction in plasma glucose and free fatty acid concentration relative to wild-type litter-mates, while maintaining a normal growth rate, life expectancy, and breeding capacity. These observations add further support to the concept of the utility of ACC inhibition to the treatment of metabolic syndrome. However, in these studies, it was clear that the liver and possibly also adipose tissues were compensating to some degree for the lack of ACC2-mediated control of fatty acid oxidation by increasing ACC1-mediated fatty acid synthesis (34Abu-Elheiga L. Matzuk M.M. Abo-Hashema K.A.H. Wakil S.J. Science. 2001; 291: 2613-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Indeed, in previous reports in which the efficacy of TOFA analogs was evaluated (25Triscari J. Sullivan A.C. Int. J. Obesity. 1984; 8: 227-239PubMed Google Scholar), investigators demonstrated the need to inhibit fatty acid production in the adipose tissue as well as in the liver, because compounds that were hepatoselective, and not peripherally available, were less effective or not effective (35Whittington M. Esner M. Pratt J. Riddell D. Ashton M.J. Int. J. Obesity. 1987; 11: 619-629PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that an isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor that would inhibit ACC2 activity in oxidative tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle, and at the same time inhibit the activity of ACC1 in lipogenic tissues such as the liver and adipose and prevent any compensatory increases in fatty acid synthesis from attenuating the ACC2 inhibition-mediated increases in fatty acid oxidation, would have the optimal therapeutic potential for treating the multiple sequelae of metabolic syndrome. In mid-1996, we set out to identify an ACC-specific, isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor for use in increasing confidence in the hypothesis that ACC inhibition-mediated reductions in fatty acid synthesis and increases in fatty acid oxidation represent a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of the combined dyslipidemia, visceral obesity, and insulin resistance that are the hallmarks of the metabolic syndrome. In this report we describe the biochemical an physiological properties of CP-610431(Table I, inset), an isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor identified using a 96-well multiplexed, high throughput screening paradigm and its more metabolically stable analog CP-640186, which equally inhibit mammalian ACC1 and ACC2, reduce malonyl-CoA concentration in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle tissue, reduce fatty acid synthesis in cultured liver cells and in the liver and adipose tissue of experimental animals, increase fatty acid oxidation in cultured skeletal muscle cells and tissue slices, and reduce respiratory quotient in experimental animals.

Perry, manuscript in preparation. we will describe the utility of CP-640186 for reducing liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle fat content, reducing whole body fat mass, and improving insulin sensitivity in chronic (up to 8-week) studies in dietarily induced rat models of the metabolic syndrome.Table IInhibition of ACC activity by CP-497485 and its enantiomers CP-610431 and CP-610432 Materials—Sodium [2-14C]acetate (56 mCi/mmol), [acetyl-3H]acetyl-CoA (3.3 Ci/mmol), [1-14C]palmitic acid (51 mCi/mmol), and Aquasol-2 were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 24-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of ACC1 from Liver and Adipose Tissue and ACC2 from Skeletal and Cardiac Muscle—ACC1 was prepared from rat liver or rat adipose tissue, and ACC2 was prepared from rat skeletal or cardiac muscle tissue essentially as previously described (38Thampy K.G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–200 g were fasted for 2 days and then fed a high sucrose diet (AIN76A) for 3 days (induces ACC1 activity ∼10-fold), at which time they were killed by CO2 asphyxiation. The livers (for ACC1 preparation), epididymal adipose tissue (for ACC1 preparation), skeletal muscle tissue (for ACC2 preparation), and cardiac muscle tissue (for ACC2 preparation) were removed, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, and homogenized in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 mg/liter each leupeptin, aprotinin, and antitrypsin) in a Waring blender for 1 min at 4 °C. Adipose tissue was frozen in liquid N2 and then pulverized in liquid N2 prior to homogenization as described above. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C. The homogenate was made 3% with respect to polyethylene glycol (PEG) by the addition of 50% PEG solution and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to 5% PEG with the addition of 50% PEG solution and stirred for 5 min. The pellet (contains ACC activity) was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, rinsed with 4 °C double-distilled H2O to remove excess PEG, and resuspended in one-fourth the original homogenate volume with homogenization buffer. Ammonium sulfate (200 g/liter) was slowly added with stirring. After 45 min the enzyme was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g, resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.1 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and desalted on a G-25 column (2.5 cm × 50 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The desalted enzyme preparation was stored in aliquots at –70 °C. When isolated under these conditions, partially purified rat adipose tissue ACC was exclusively ACC1, partially purified rat heart ACC was exclusively ACC2, partially purified rat skeletal muscle ACC was exclusively ACC2, and partially purified rat liver ACC was a mixture of both ACC1 and ACC2 in a 85:15 ratio, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with specific polyclonal antibodies after PAGE. Immediately prior to use, frozen aliquots of the above fractions were thawed, diluted to 500 μg/ml in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2,10mm tripotassium citrate, 2.0 mm DTT, and 0.75 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and the ACC was citrate-activated by preincubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Measurement of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Inhibitory Activity—The procedure for measuring ACC1 and ACC2 activity utilizes a radiochemical method (38Thampy K.G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that measures incorporation of [14C]bicarbonate into [14C]malonyl-CoA and separates product from unused substrate at the end of the reaction through acidification, which serves to both quench the reaction and remove residual radiolabeled substrate as 14CO2. For measurement of ACC activity and assessment of ACC inhibition, test compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and 1.0 μl was placed in 0.5-ml polypropylene tubes. Control tubes contained 1.0 μlofMe2SO alone. All assay tubes received 139 μl of substrate buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm tripotassium citrate, 2 mm DTT, 0.75 mg/ml BSA, 25 μm acetyl-CoA, 4.0 mm ATP, and 12.5 mm KH[14C]O3 (2 × 106 cpm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of citrate-activated ACC solution. After 7 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 6 n HCl and 150 μl of the quenched reaction mixture was transferred to glass scintillation vials and evaporated to dryness at 90 °C for 1 h. The dried vials were cooled, 0.5 ml of water and 5.5 ml of Beckman Readisafe liquid scintillation fluid were added, and the radioactivity was determined in a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. Tubes that received HCl before citrate-activated ACC solution served as blanks. ACC activity is expressed as nanomoles of KH[14C]O3 incorporated into malonyl-CoA per min of incubation at 37 °C per mg of protein. ACC Inhibition High Throughput Screening Format—The method for measuring ACC activity and inhibition was adapted to high throughput (80 plate-per-assay scale) inhibitor screening format as follows: compounds dissolved in Me2SO in 96-well multiplexed format were added to wells of a 96-well plate containing 90 μl of assay buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm tripotassium citrate, 2 mm DTT, 0.75 mg/ml BSA, 25 μm acetyl-CoA, and 4.0 mm ATP (final compound concentration 5.0 μm). Plates were then transferred to a fume hood and were supplied with 10 μl of a solution containing 12.5 mm NaH[14C]O3 (2 × 106 cpm). Reactions were then initiated by addition of 10 μl of partially purified, citrate-activated rat liver ACC solution (5 μg of protein) isolated from fasted, high sucrose diet-refed rats (85% ACC1, 15% ACC2) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After incubation, reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μlof6 m HCl and plates were permitted to stand in the hood for2hto allow 14CO2 liberation. Plates were then transferred to a 65 °C vacuum oven fitted with an elaborate system of NaOH traps and charcoal filters between the vacuum oven and house vacuum system to prevent both contamination by residual 14CO2 and corrosion by the evaporated HCl. Monitoring the entrapment of 14CO2 and HCl between the vacuum oven and house line revealed that all 14CO2 was trapped in the first of the NaOH traps and little or none reached the charcoal filter for final entrapment. The HCl was likewise trapped by the first several NaOH traps, and they were replaced routinely as their pH was reduced. Plates remained in the vacuum oven overnight. The next morning, residue in the dried wells (contains [14C]malonyl-CoA) was resuspended in 30 μl of water, dissolved in 145 μl of OptiPhase “Hi-Safe” 3 liquid scintillation fluid with vigorous shaking, sealed, and transferred to pre-programmed robotics for radioactivity assessment. By selecting for inhibitors that inhibited hepatic ACC activity by 75%, we selected for compounds that inhibited ACC1 activity. We then selected for those that also equally inhibited ACC2 in secondary specificity assays. Measurement of HepG2 Cell Cholesterol and Fatty Acid Synthesis— Cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis were evaluated in HepG2 cells by measuring incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into cellular lipids as previously described (36Harwood Jr., H.J.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 24-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications to allow simultaneous assessment of both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. After collection and assessment of the hexane fraction containing cholesterol and nonsaponifiable lipids as previously described (36Harwood Jr., H.J. Barbacci-Tobin E.G. Petras S.F. Lindsey S. Pellarin L.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 839-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Petras S.F. Lindsey S. Harwood Jr., H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 24-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the remaining aqueous phase (containing fatty acid sodium salts) was acidified to pH < 2 by addition of 0.5 ml of 12 m HCl. The resulting mixtures were then transferred to glass conical tubes and extracted three times with 4.5 ml of hexane. The pooled organic fractions were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v), and applied to 1 × 20-cm channels of Silica Gel 60C TLC plates. Channels containing non-radioactive fatty acids were included on selected TLC plates as separation markers. TLC plates were developed in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:2) and air-dried, and the region of chromatograms corresponding to fatty acid mobility were removed and assessed for radioactivity in Aquasol-2 using a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. Cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis are expressed as dpm [2-14C]acetate/mg of cellular protein incorporated into either cholesterol or saponifiable lipids during the 6-h incubation at 37 °C.

These drugs, referred to as topo II poisons, stabilize cleavable complexes, thereby generating DNA double-strand breaks. Bis-2,6-dioxopiperazines such as ICRF-193 also inhibit topo II by inducing a distinct type of DNA damage, termed topo II clamps, which has been believed to be devoid of double-strand breaks. Despite the biological and clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms for the repair of topo II-mediated DNA damage remain largely unknown. Here, we perform genetic analyses using the chicken DT40 cell line to investigate how DNA lesions caused by topo II inhibitors are repaired. Notably, we show that LIG4 -/- and KU70 -/- cells, which are defective in nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ), are extremely sensitive to both VP-16 and ICRF-193. In contrast, RAD54 -/- cells (defective in homologous recombination) are much less hypersensitive to VP-16 than the NHEJ mutants and, more importantly, are not hypersensitive to ICRF-193. Our results provide the first evidence that NHEJ is the predominant pathway for the repair of topo II-mediated DNA damage; that is, cleavable complexes and topo II clamps. The outstandingly increased cytotoxicity of topo II inhibitors in the absence of NHEJ suggests that simultaneous inhibition of topo II and NHEJ would provide a powerful protocol in cancer chemotherapy involving topo II inhibitors.

In contrast to accurate repair by HR, NHEJ can lead to imprecise joining of DSB ends. It has been well established that NHEJ is responsible for V(D)J recombination in lymphocytes (3Critchlow S.E.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The NHEJ reaction relies on Ku (a heterodimer of Ku70 and Ku86), DNA-PKcs, Artemis, Xrcc4, and DNA ligase IV (the LIG4 gene product) (3Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem.

This complex would then trim the ends to make the ends ligatable. Additional nucleases and/or polymerases may also be involved in this process. Finally, the DNA ligase IV-Xrcc4 complex is recruited for ligation. The requirement for DNA ligase IV in this pathway is exclusive, as other DNA ligases (I and III) are unable to substitute for the ligase IV function (16Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K.

Consistent with the proposed functions of HR and NHEJ in DSB repair, cells deficient in HR or NHEJ proteins have been shown to be highly sensitive to DSB-generating DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation (16Grawunder U.

In a chicken B-lymphocyte DT40 cell line, where HR activity is extraordinarily high as compared with other vertebrate cell lines (24Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), several knockout mutants deficient in HR and/or NHEJ have been constructed by gene targeting. RAD54 -/- cells are shown to be hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (18Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Similarly, DNA-PKcs -/-/- and LIG4 -/- cells exhibit hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y.

Importantly, the extent of radiosensitivity of the RAD54 -/- cells is very similar to that of the DNA-PKcs -/-/- or LIG4 -/- cells (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Fukushima T. Takata M. Morrison C. Araki R. Fujimori A. Abe M. Tatsumi K. Jasin M. Dhar P.K. Sonoda E. Chiba T.

Takata M. Morrison C. Araki R. Fujimori A. Abe M. Tatsumi K. Jasin M. Dhar P.K. Sonoda E. Chiba T. Takeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44413-44418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that in DT40 cells, HR, and NHEJ contribute equally to the repair of DSBs. KU70 -/- DT40 cells also exhibit hypersensitivity to low doses of ionizing radiation, and RAD54 -/-/KU70 -/- cells are more radiosensitive than each single mutant (18Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerase (topo) II is a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme that alters the topological structure of DNA and chromosomes through a transient DSB and subsequent religation of the DSB (25Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). The enzyme has been implicated in many aspects of DNA metabolisms, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, and chromosome condensation/segregation (25Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Vertebrate cells possess two genetically distinct topo II isoforms; topo IIα is essential for cell proliferation (26Akimitsu N. Adachi N. Hirai H. Hossain M.S. Hamamoto H. Kobayashi M. Aratani Y. Koyama H. Sekimizu K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas topo IIβ is non-essential (27Yang X. Li W. Prescott E.D. Burden S.J. Wang J.C. Science. 2000; 287: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It has been established that topo IIα is more abundantly expressed in growing cells and its expression is cell cycle-regulated, peaking in G2/M, whereas the expression level of topo IIβ is low and roughly constant during the cell cycle (28Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar, 29Adachi N. Nomoto M. Kohno K. Koyama H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some exogenous agents cause DSBs via inhibition of topo II. These agents include etoposide (VP-16), teniposide (VM-26), and 4′-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-aniside, which are clinically useful in cancer chemotherapy (30Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 31Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A unique feature of these topo II inhibitors is the formation of “cleavable complex” (also called “cleavage complex”), in which a topo II-linked DNA strand-passing intermediate is stabilized, allowing the generation of a DSB (30Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 31Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Such topo II inhibitors are referred to as “topo II poisons” because they convert the essential enzyme into a cytotoxic DNA-damaging agent. It is also known that some topo II inhibitors do not belong to topo II poisons and, thus, act as catalytic inhibitors without cleavable complex formation (31Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Among these, bis-2,6-dioxopiperazines, such as meso-2,3-bis(2,6-dioxopiperazin-4-yl)butane (ICRF-193), have been most extensively analyzed thus far. Earlier biochemical studies have suggested that ICRF-193 inhibits topo II by trapping the enzyme in the form of a closed protein clamp (topo II clamp) (32Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 33Ando T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies suggest that ICRF-193 is not a pure catalytic inhibitor; rather, it may act as a topo II poison (34Hasinoff B.B. Kuschak T.I. Creighton A.M. Fattman C.L. Allan W.P. Thampatty P. Yalowich J.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1843-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35van Hille B. Hill B.T. Cancer Chemother.

Cancer Lett. 2001; 166: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies raise the possibility that topo II clamp is a novel type of cytotoxic DNA damage. Despite the importance of topo II-mediated DNA damage, the molecular mechanisms for the repair of topo II-mediated DNA damage are poorly understood. Topo II poison-induced cleavable complexes are known to trigger DNA damage responses, such as p53 stabilization, which can lead to apoptotic cell death or genomic instability (39Smith P.J. Soues S. Gottlieb T. Falk S.J. Watson J.V. Osborne R.J. Bleehen N.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 70: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Pommier Y. Kerrigan D. Covey J.M. Kao-Shan C.S. Whang-Peng J. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 512-516PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, topo II poison-induced cleavable complexes have been shown to be proteolytically degraded by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway, and a model is suggested in which the repair of cleavable complexes may involve transcription-dependent topo II proteolysis to reveal the protein-concealed DSBs (41Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is also suggested that the collision of DNA replication machinery with cleavable complexes leads to generation of overt DSBs (42Hong G. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5046-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such protein-free DSBs would then be repaired by the DSB repair pathway(s). Indeed, the S. cerevisiae rad52 mutant is extremely sensitive to topo II poisons (43Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, several NHEJ mutants are shown to exhibit hypersensitivity to topo II poisons (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 44Jeggo P.A. Caldecott K. Pidsley S. Banks G.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 7057-7063PubMed Google Scholar, 45Jin S. Inoue S. Weaver D.T. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the mechanisms for the repair of ICRF-193-induced topo II clamps, assuming that these intermediates are actually cytotoxic DNA damage. Importantly, however, recent work has revealed that ICRF-193-induced topo II clamps also undergo 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation (46Xiao H. Mao Y Desai S.D. Zhou N. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3239-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), raising an intriguing possibility that the repair machinery responsible for cleavable complexes are, at least in part, involved in the repair of topo II clamps as well. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Ku86-deficient Chinese hamster cells display hypersensitivity to ICRF-193 (47Muñoz P. Zdzienicka M.Z. Blanchard J.M. Piette J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5797-5808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of other NHEJ factors in the repair of ICRF-193-induced DNA damage is yet to be examined, however. In this paper, we perform genetic analyses using the chicken DT40 cell line to investigate how topo II-mediated DNA damage caused by topo II inhibitors is repaired. With the use of TOP2α+/- mutants we demonstrate that ICRF-193 actually acts as a topo II poison in vertebrate cells. In addition, we confirm this notion by using DSB repair-deficient DT40 cell mutants; namely, RAD54 -/- cells (an HR mutant), LIG4 -/- and KU70 -/- cells (NHEJ mutants), and RAD54 -/-/KU70 -/- cells. Strikingly, the NHEJ mutants are extremely sensitive to VP-16 and ICRF-193 as compared with the wild-type or RAD54 -/- cells. Our results indicate that topo II-mediated DNA damage, including both topo II poison-induced cleavable complexes and ICRF-193-induced topo II clamps, is predominantly repaired by the NHEJ pathway of DSB repair. Vector Construction—A 4.6-kilobase genomic fragment containing exons 6–15 of the chicken TOP2α gene was isolated by PCR using DT40 genomic DNA as template. The primers used were pTop2a-E5 (5′-CAGTGTGTGGAACAATGGGAAAGGCATTCC-3′) and pTop2a-E16 (5′-GGGTGATGGCAGCATCATCTTCAGGACCAG-3′), designed based on the reported chicken TOP2α cDNA (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number AB007445). The genomic fragment was found to contain a unique SnaBI site, which was located in exon 9 of the TOP2α gene. To construct a targeting vector, we inserted a hygromycin resistance gene cassette into the SnaBI site. Cell Culture and Transfection—DT40 cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 39 °C in ES medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% chicken serum. For colony formation, cells were grown for 7–14 days in ES medium containing 0.15% agarose, 20% fetal bovine serum, and 2% chicken serum (soft agarose medium). DNA transfection was performed essentially as described (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 48Matsuzaki Y. Adachi N. Koyama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were electroporated with 4 μg of DNA construct, and drug-resistant colonies were selected by incubation in soft agarose medium containing 1.5 mg/ml hygromycin B (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Genomic DNA was isolated from the drug-resistant clones and subjected to Southern blot analysis as described previously (49Aratani Y. Andoh T. Koyama H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Clonogenic Assays—VP-16 (Sigma) and ICRF-193 (Zenyaku Kogyo, Tokyo) were dissolved in Me2SO and stored frozen in aliquots at -20 °C. Clonogenic assays were performed essentially as described (48Matsuzaki Y. Adachi N. Koyama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 102–105 cells/dish into 60-mm bacterial dishes containing 5 ml of soft agarose medium with various concentrations of each drug. After incubation for 7–14 days, the number of resulting colonies was counted, and the percent survival was determined by comparing the number of surviving colonies to untreated controls. Generation of TOP2α+/- DT40 Cells—We have previously shown that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells heterozygous for the TOP2α gene exhibit an increased resistance to ICRF-193 as well as VP-16 (38Kobayashi M. Adachi N. Aratani Y. Kikuchi A. Koyama H. Cancer Lett. 2001; 166: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further confirm these observations, we wished to establish TOP2α+/- DT40 cell lines by gene targeting. To perform this, we isolated a genomic clone containing the chicken TOP2α locus and constructed a targeting vector by inserting a hygromycin-resistance gene cassette into the TOP2α coding region (Fig. 1A). Electroporation of the targeting vector into wild-type cells gave rise to hygromycin-resistant clones. Heterozygous disruption of the TOP2α gene was examined by Southern blot analysis of BglII- or EcoRV-digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1, B and C), and two clonal lines, H5 and H7, exhibited band patterns indicative of the precise targeting event. The results indicate that these cell lines are heterozygous mutants for the TOP2α gene. It should be noted that the conservation of the SnaBI site located in exon 9 of the chicken and mouse TOP2α genes enabled us to introduce the same mutation as we did in the TOP2α gene of mouse ES cells (26Akimitsu N. Adachi N. Hirai H. Hossain M.S. Hamamoto H. Kobayashi M. Aratani Y. Koyama H. Sekimizu K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Kobayashi M. Adachi N. Aratani Y. Kikuchi A. Koyama H. Cancer Lett. 2001; 166: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that the amount of topo IIα protein in TOP2α+/- cells (the H7 cell line) was reduced to ∼50% that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1D). We then compared the growth rate of TOP2α+/- cells with that of wild-type cells and observed no difference between the two (Fig. 1E), indicating that a one-half reduction in the topo IIα expression level does not affect DT40 cell growth. TOP2α+/- Cells Exhibit an Increased Resistance to VP-16 and ICRF-193—We examined the sensitivity of TOP2α+/- cells to the topo II poison VP-16. As shown in Fig. 2A, the TOP2α+/- cells were more resistant to VP-16 than wild-type cells. We next examined the sensitivity to ICRF-193. Consistently, the mutant cells did exhibit an increased resistance to ICRF-193 as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). These results are quite similar to that obtained with mouse ES cells (38Kobayashi M. Adachi N. Aratani Y. Kikuchi A. Koyama H. Cancer Lett. 2001; 166: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Together, our data demonstrate that ICRF-193, like VP-16, does act as a topo II poison in vertebrate cells. We note that TOP2α+/- cells are not hypersensitive to an alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (Fig. 2C) or UV light (data not shown). NHEJ Mutants Are Hypersensitive to VP-16 —In the DT40 cell line, several mutants defective in DNA repair/recombination have been created thus far. KU70 -/- and LIG4 -/- cells are NHEJ mutants that exhibit hypersensitivity to DSB-generating DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). RAD54 -/- cells are defective in HR and also display increased radiosensitivity, and RAD54 -/-/KU70 -/- cells, defective in both HR and NHEJ, are much more radiosensitive than each single mutant (18Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the extent of radiosensitivity of RAD54 -/- cells is very similar to that of LIG4 -/- cells (and also DNA-PKcs -/-/- cells) (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 23Fukushima T. Takata M. Morrison C. Araki R. Fujimori A. Abe M. Tatsumi K. Jasin M. Dhar P.K. Sonoda E. Chiba T. Takeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44413-44418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), indicating that the two repair pathways, HR and NHEJ, contribute equally to the repair of DSBs in the DT40 cell line. We previously showed that LIG4 -/- cells were more VP-16-sensitive than wild-type cells (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This result was simply interpreted as a DSB repair defect of the LIG4 -/- cells, based on the fact that VP-16 is a topo II poison that generates DSBs. However, other possibilities have not been fully excluded. For example, there might be an additional repair pathway(s) that relies on DNA ligase IV and contributes to the repair of VP-16-induced DNA damage. Alternatively, because VP-16 induces, at least primarily, protein-concealed DSBs, the repair of such lesions might require DNA ligase IV but not the NHEJ pathway. We therefore used other DT40 cell mutants to examine the sensitivity to VP-16. By clonogenic assays, we found that KU70 -/- cells, like LIG4 -/- cells, were hypersensitive to VP-16 (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the KU70 -/-/LIG4 -/- cells (17Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2035982659,"LmrA is an ATP binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporter in Lactococcus lactis that is a structural and functional homologue of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 (ABCB1). LmrA is also homologous to MsbA, an essential ABC transporter in Escherichia coli involved in the trafficking of lipids, including Lipid A. We have compared the substrate specificities of LmrA and MsbA in detail. Surprisingly, LmrA was able to functionally substitute for a temperature-sensitive mutant MsbA in E. coli WD2 at non-permissive temperatures, suggesting that LmrA could transport Lipid A. LmrA also exhibited a Lipid A-stimulated, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. Reciprocally, the expression of MsbA conferred multidrug resistance on E. coli. Similar to LmrA, MsbA interacted with photoactivatable substrate [3H]azidopine, displayed a daunomycin, vinblastine, and Hoechst 33342-stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity, and mediated the transport of ethidium from cells and Hoechst 33342 in proteoliposomes containing purified and functionally reconstituted protein. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MsbA and LmrA have overlapping substrate specificities. Our observations imply the presence of structural elements in the recently published crystal structures of MsbA in E. coli and Vibrio cholera (Chang, G., and Roth, C. B. (2001) Science 293, 1793–1800; Chang, G. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 330, 419–430) that support drug-protein interactions and suggest a possible role for LmrA in lipid trafficking in L. lactis.

Multidrug transporters interfere with the drug-based control of cancer and infectious diseases by mediating the extrusion of cytotoxic drugs from the cell (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev.

Whereas ion-coupled transporters have a dominant role in efflux-based multidrug resistance in prokaryotic organisms, ATP binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP binding cassette; IC50, drug concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of the cellular growth rate; MDR, multidrug resistance; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; SC50, drug concentration required for half-maximal stimulation. transporters have such a role in eukaryotic organisms (3van Veen H.W. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Certain human ABC transporters are well conserved in bacteria. For example, LmrA in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis is homologous to the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 (ABCB1) (4van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J.

LmrA and P-glycoprotein MDR1 have very similar specificities for chemotherapeutic drugs and modulators, and surprisingly, LmrA can functionally substitute for P-glycoprotein MDR1 in human lung fibroblast cells (7van Veen H.W. Callaghan R. Soceneantu L. Sardini A. Konings W.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). One of the controversial issues regarding multidrug transporters is their role in cell physiology. Multidrug transporters may have a purely protective function, but they may also be involved in the transport of substrates (e.g. lipids and lipid soluble metabolites) that share physico-chemical properties with drugs (8Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 9Blackmore C.G. McNaughton P.A. van Veen H.W. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2001; 18: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LmrA and P-glycoprotein MDR1 share a significant sequence similarity with MsbA, an essential ABC transporter in Gram-negative Escherichia coli that is involved in the biogenesis of the outer membrane (10Zhou Z.

The outer membrane is an asymmetric bilayer composed of glycerophospholipids on its inner leaflet and Lipid A, the hydrophobic anchor of lipopolysaccharides, on the outer leaflet. The Lipid A moiety is a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine and is a potent activator of innate immunity in mammals via the Toll-like receptor 4 (11Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y.

The enzymes that synthesize phospholipids and Lipid A are well characterized and are present in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic membrane (13Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms by which phospholipids and Lipid A are targeted to the outer membrane are unknown, recent observations demonstrate that MsbA is required for the export of all newly made lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids to this compartment of the cell envelope (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 14Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). MsbA was the first ABC transporter to be crystallized and analyzed by x-ray crystallography, allowing the determination of its structure at 4.5-Å resolution for MsbA in E. coli (15Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and at 3.8-Å resolution for MsbA in Vibrio cholera (16Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The implications of the MsbA structure for the structure and function of LmrA and P-glycoprotein MDR1 make a comparison of the substrate specificities of these transporters highly relevant. Here, we report that the lmrA gene can complement the msbA gene in E. coli and that MsbA and LmrA have overlapping specificities for Lipid A and chemotherapeutic and cytotoxic drugs.

L. lactis NZ9000 containing pNZ8048 (vector) or pNHLmrA (pNZ8048 containing lmrA with a coding region for an amino-terminal hexa-histidine tag) was grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (Difco) supplemented with 20 mm glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (18Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Preparation of Inside-out Membrane Vesicles—For protein expression in L. lactis, cells were grown to an A 660 of 0.3 and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of 40 pg/ml nisin. Protein expression in the E. coli DE3 cells was induced at an A 660 of 0.5 through the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Melford Laboratories Ltd., Suffolk, UK) followed by incubation for 2 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet was washed at 4 °C in 50 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.4), resuspended to an A 660 of 40 in HEPES buffer containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (VWR International, Dorset, UK), 2 mg/ml lysosyme (Sigma), 10 μg/ml DNase (Sigma), 10 mm MgSO4, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were broken by passage twice through a Basic Z 0.75-kilowatt Benchtop Cell Disruptor (Constant Systems, Northants, UK) at 20,000 p.s.i. Potassium EDTA (pH 7.4) was then added to a final concentration of 15 mm. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Inside-out membrane vesicles were harvested by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane vesicles were resuspended to a protein concentration of 30 mg of membrane protein/ml in 20 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and stored in 150-μl aliquots in liquid N2. Liposomes—Lipids were extracted from 10 liters of L. lactis culture as described (18Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), with modifications. L. lactis NZ9000 cells harboring pNZ8048 (vector) were grown to an A 660 of about 1 and harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Cells (50 g wet weight) were resuspended in 1 ml of potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and frozen and thawed. Subsequently, 4 mg/ml lysosyme, 10 μg/ml DNase, and 10 mm MgSO4 were added, and the cell suspension was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. All subsequent steps took place in glass containers in an N2 atmosphere in the dark. Cells were stirred overnight in 200 ml of chloroform and 400 ml of methanol at 4 °C. Undissolved particles were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Water (100 ml) and chloroform (100 ml) were then added, and the mixture was stirred for 3 h at 20 °C. Phases were separated overnight in a separation funnel, and the bottom layer containing the lipids was collected. Lipids were dried in a rotory evaporator and dissolved in chloroform to a final lipid concentration of 0.1 g/ml. One ml of the mixture was dripped into 10 ml of ice-cold acetone containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, stirred overnight at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 × g at 20 °C to remove insoluble particles. The lipid solution was dried under N2 gas and dissolved in 15 ml of diethyl ether containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Subsequently, the lipid mixture was stirred for 1 h at 20 °C and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 20 °C. The lipid solution was dried in a rotory evaporator, rehydrated in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol by vortexing for 30 min, and resuspended by sonication in the same buffer to 20 mg lipid/ml. Liposomes were stored in liquid N2. Reconstitution of Purified MsbA in Proteoliposomes—The purification of amino-terminal His6-tagged MsbA was performed according to previously described methods (17Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with modifications. Inside-out membrane vesicles were solubilized on ice for 1 h in Buffer A (50 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4) containing 2% (v/v) lauryl dimethylamine N-oxide (Fluka Biochemika, Buchs, Switzerland). The mixture was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min, after which the solubilized protein in the supernatant was mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin suspension (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) (10 mg of protein/ml suspension), preequilibrated with Buffer B (Buffer A supplemented with 10 mm imidazole and 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Sigma)). After washing with 20 volumes of Buffer B and 40 volumes of Buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole and 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, the protein was eluted with 5 volumes of Buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole and 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. For reconstitution of purified MsbA, liposomes were thawed slowly at 20 °C and extruded by 11 passages through a 400-nm polycarbonate filter to form unilamellar liposomes. The unilamellar liposomes were diluted to 4 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and destabilized by the stepwise addition of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside to a maximum of 3.0 mm, as described for the functional reconstitution of LmrA (18Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Purified protein was added to the detergent-destabilized liposomes at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:100 (w/w) and incubated at 20 °C with mild stirring for 30 min. The mixture was added to methanol/ethanol/H2O washed Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) at 80 mg of beads/ml and incubated twice for2hat20 °C changing Bio-Beads at each incubation. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to fresh Bio-Beads and incubated for another 16 h at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Proteoliposomes were used immediately for functional assays. Growth Curves—Growth of E. coli WD2 cells in the absence or presence of ethidium bromide at concentrations up to 1 mm was monitored by measuring the A 660 at 30 and 42 °C in accordance with published methods (19Janvilisri T. Venter H. Shahi S. Reuter G. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20645-20651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Ethidium Transport—E. coli WD2 cells were harvested in mid-exponential phase, washed 3 times in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4, and deenergized in the presence of 0.5 mm 2,4-dinitrophenol for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed 3 times and resuspended in phosphate buffer to an A 660 of 0.5. The uptake of 2 μm ethidium in cells was measured at 42 °C in a 96-well plate using a Spectramax Gemini XS microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 500 and 580 nm, respectively. Hoechst 33342 Transport—Proteoliposomes containing purified and functionally reconstituted MsbA (5 μg of membrane protein) were resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm phospho-creatine, and 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase. Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm. After a steady state level of Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was obtained, 2 mm Mg-ATP or AMP-PNP was added. Measurements were performed in an LS 55B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 457 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 3 nm each. ATPase Assay—The ATPase activity was based on a colorimetric ascorbic acid/ammonium molybdate assay to measure the liberation of Pi from ATP, as described (19Janvilisri T. Venter H. Shahi S. Reuter G. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20645-20651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles were used at a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgSO4 and 5 mm Na-ATP. The solution was incubated on ice for 15 min with varying concentrations of drugs or Lipid A (Avanti, AL) as indicated in Figs. 5A and 6 and then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 mm ascorbic acid, and the concentration of Pi was determined. ATPase activity measurements in the presence of 1 mm ortho-vanadate were obtained in parallel and subtracted from the readings.Fig. 6Lipid A stimulates the LmrA-associated ATPase activity. The vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity was measured in inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from L. lactis harboring plasmid pNZ8048 (vector) (▪) or pNZHLmrA (His6 lmrA) (□) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Lipid A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Photoaffinity Labeling—Photoaffinity labeling of MsbA and LmrA with [3H]azidopine (Amersham Biosciences) was performed with 90 μg of total protein using inside-out membrane vesicles from E. coli DE3 expressing MsbA or L. lactis NZ9000 expressing LmrA in 20 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.0). The final concentration of [3H]azidopine (51 Ci/mmol) was 0.5 μm in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. After incubation of inside-out vesicles and [3H]azidopine at 30 °C for 10 min, the samples were irradiated on ice at 312 nm for 2.5 min in a Bio-Link BLX photo-reactor (BDH) with 5 UV lamps of 8 watts each. Subsequently, total membrane protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Complementation Experiments—E. coli WD2 expresses a genome-encoded temperature-sensitive MsbA protein containing an alanine to threonine substitution at position 270 in transmembrane segment 5 (14Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This MsbA variant is rapidly inactivated at 42 °C. As a result, at the non-permissive temperature the biogenesis of the outer membrane is impaired in the mutant organism due to a deficiency in the MsbA-mediated transport of phospholipids and Lipid A to the outer membrane. In contrast, E. coli WD2 exhibits normal growth at 30 °C. To test if LmrA expression could rescue the mutant cells at 42 °C, E. coli WD2 was transformed with the empty vector pGK13 or plasmid pGKLmrA, a derivative of pGK13 that contains the lmrA gene downstream of its endogenous lactococcal promotor to enable the expression of LmrA in E. coli (4van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As a positive control for complementation E. coli WD2 was also transformed with pACYC (vector) or plasmid pZZ34, a derivative of pACYC carrying wild type msbA (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 14Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At 30 °C, the growth rates of E. coli WD2 cells expressing MsbA or LmrA were similar to those of control cells (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, at 42 °C the growth rates of MsbA-expressing cells and LmrA-expressing cells were significantly higher than those of non-expressing cells. These results suggested that LmrA could functionally replace the temperature-sensitive A270T mutant MsbA protein in E. coli WD2 at the non-permissive temperature. Resistance to Ethidium Bromide—LmrA is known to confer ethidium resistance on E. coli by mediating the active extrusion of ethidium from the cells (4van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In view of the functional complementation of E. coli msbA by lactococcal lmrA, it was interesting to determine whether MsbA expression conferred ethidium resistance on E. coli WD2 cells. The growth rate of E. coli WD2 cells harboring pZZ34 (msbA) or pACYC184 (vector) was measured in liquid cultures containing increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide. At 30 °C, no significant differences were observed between the concentrations of ethidium necessary to reduce the growth rates of MsbA-expressing cells and non-expressing control cells by 50% (IC50) (Fig. 2). However, at 42 °C MsbA-expressing cells showed a significantly higher IC50 value compared with control cells. Hence, the expression of MsbA in E. coli conferred ethidium resistance on the cells under these conditions. To test whether ethidium efflux from the cell was the underlying mechanism of drug resistance in E. coli WD2 expressing MsbA at 42 °C, fluorimetric ethidium transport assays were performed (Fig. 3). Suspensions of deenergized E. coli WD2 cells containing pZZ34 (msbA) or pACYC184 (vector) were first allowed to accumulate ethidium. When metabolic energy was then generated in the cells through the addition of glucose, ethidium extrusion was observed in cells expressing MsbA but not in control cells (Fig. 3A). Upon the addition of glucose, a significant ethidium efflux was also observed for E. coli WD2 cells expressing LmrA compared with control cells (Fig 3B). MsbA Interacts with Multiple Drugs—To further investigate drug-protein interactions in MsbA, the photoaffinity compound [3H]azidopine was used. In previous work, this 1,4-dihydro-pyridine derivative was shown to be photo-incorporated into LmrA 2L. Balakrishnan and H. W. van Veen, unpublished data. and the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 (20Greenberger L.M. Yang C.-P.H. Gindin E. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4394-4401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli DE3 cells harboring pET28b (vector) or plasmid pWTD1, which allowed the expression of His6-tagged MsbA under control of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter (17Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). After photo-cross-linking of the membrane vesicles in the presence of [3H]azidopine, a ∼65-kDa band was detected on the autoradiogram in E. coli membrane vesicles containing MsbA and in lactococcal membrane vesicles containing LmrA but not in E. coli control membrane vesicles (Fig. 4). The 65-kDa bands were also detected on an immunoblot probed by using an anti-His6-tag antibody (data not shown). These data provide evidence for a direct interaction between azidopine and MsbA and point to overlapping substrate specificities of MsbA and LmrA. The specificity of His6-tagged MsbA for drugs was also assessed through measurements of the MsbA-associated ATPase activity in inside-out membrane vesicles. In contrast to control membrane vesicles, MsbA-containing membrane vesicles displayed a significant amount of vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity that was stimulated up to 3-fold in the presence of daunomycin (Fig. 5A), a chemotherapeutic drug transported by LmrA and human P-glycoprotein MDR1. The concentration of daunomycin required for half-maximal stimulation (SC50) of the MsbA-associated ATPase activity was about 25 μm. Vinblastine and Hoechst 33342, which are substrates for LmrA and P-glycoprotein MDR1, stimulated the MsbA ATPase activity 4- and 6-fold, respectively, with SC50 values of 28 and 49 μm, respectively. Interestingly, these drugs stimulated the LmrA ATPase activity to a similar extent as observed for the MsbA ATPase activity but at significantly lower SC50 values of 5 μm for daunomycin, 6 μm for vinblastine, and 1.7 μm for Hoechst 33342. In addition to the observation that the MsbA ATPase activity is stimulated by Hoechst 33342, evidence for the interaction between MsbA and Hoechst 33342 was obtained in Hoechst 33342 transport measurements in proteoliposomes prepared from lactococcal lipids containing Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity-purified and functionally reconstituted His6-tagged MsbA. The protein was greater than 97% pure as judged by silver-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Hoechst 33342 is only fluorescent when it is present in the phospholipid environment of the membrane and essentially non-fluorescent in the aqueous phase (18Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Qu Q. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The addition of Hoechst 33342 to the proteoliposomes resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence up to a steady state level due to the partitioning of the dye in the membrane. The subsequent addition of Mg-ATP resulted in a rapid quenching of the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence in proteoliposomes containing MsbA (Fig. 5B). The quenching of Hoechst 33342 was not observed in MsbA-containing proteoliposomes in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP or in empty liposomes in the presence of Mg-ATP or AMP-PNP. These observations point to the MsbA-dependent transport of Hoechst 33342 from the phospholipid bilayer into the aqueous lumen of the membrane vesicles, similar to previous observations for LmrA and P-glycoprotein MDR1 (5van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J.

Taken together these data demonstrate the interaction between MsbA and cytotoxic drugs. LmrA Interacts with Lipid A—In view of the genetic evidence that LmrA can substitute for MsbA in E. coli WD2 and, hence, appears able to transport Lipid A in E. coli, it was of interest to study the interaction between Lipid A and LmrA through measurements of the LmrA-associated ATPase activity in inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from L. lactis. As shown in Fig. 6, Lipid A stimulated the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in LmrA-containing inside-out membrane vesicles 2.1-fold with a SC50 of 3 μm. No effect of Lipid A was observed on the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in control inside-out membrane vesicles without LmrA. Similar to the experiments on LmrA, Lipid A also stimulated the MsbA-associated ATPase activity in E. coli DE3 membrane vesicles 2-fold with an SC50 of about 7 μm. An increasing number of transporters are appreciated for their ability to transport a variety of lipids in addition to their ability to transport multiple drugs. ABC transporters such as the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1 and multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP1 (ABCC1) are able to transport a broad range of short-chain lipid analogues including 2–6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) aminocaproyl (C6-NBD) phosphatidylcholine, C6-NBD glucosylceramide, and C6-NBD sphingomyelin (23Ruetz S.

Evidence has also been obtained that P-glycoprotein MDR1 mediates the translocation of the native glycosphingolipid precursor glucosylceramide (26van Helvoort A. Giudici M.L. Thielemans M. van Meer G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 75-83PubMed Google Scholar). Although human P-glycoprotein MDR3 (ABCB4) is known to transport phosphatidylcholine across the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte, the protein has also been shown to mediate the transport of multiple P-glycoprotein MDR1 substrates, such as vinblastine, paclitaxel, and digoxin (27Smith A.J. van Helvoort A. van Meer G.

In recent work we have demonstrated that the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, also termed ABCG2) is able to transport sterols and steroids in addition to its ability to interact with multiple cationic substrates for LmrA and P-glycoprotein MDR1 (19Janvilisri T. Venter H. Shahi S. Reuter G. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20645-20651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this work, we have compared the substrate specificities of LmrA and MsbA, which are two bacterial homologues of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein MDR1. LmrA has previously been characterized as a multidrug transporter in Gram-positive L. lactis (4van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 5van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas MsbA is known as a transporter for Lipid A in Gram-negative E. coli (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 14Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Our observations that (i) LmrA was able to substitute for the temperature-sensitive A270T mutant MsbA protein in E. coli WD2 at non-permissive temperatures and (ii) the LmrA ATPase activity was significantly stimulated by Lipid A suggested that LmrA can transport Lipid A. Evidence was also obtained for the interaction between MsbA and substrates for LmrA and P-glycoprotein MDR1. First, MsbA could be photoaffinity-labeled with azidopine. Second, the MsbA ATPase activity was significantly stimulated by Hoechst 33342, daunomycin, and vinblastine. Third, MsbA mediated the transport of Hoechst 33342 in proteoliposomes containing purified and functionally reconstituted protein. Finally, the expression of MsbA in E. coli WD2 at 42 °C was associated with an enhanced ethidium resistance and ethidium efflux. However, this latter observation may also be explained by the MsbA-associated transport of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids to the outer membrane. These lipids may increase the integrity and stability of this compartment at elevated temperatures (20Greenberger L.M. Yang C.-P.H. Gindin E. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4394-4401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and act as molecular chaperones for the assembly of endogenous drug transporters such as AcrAB-TolC (13Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 28Nikaido H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 29Lomovskaya O. Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1210-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we were unable to detect MsbA-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport in inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli in standard assays, including 2 μm Hoechst 33342, developed for the detection of the LmrA-associated transport activity in lactococcal membrane vesicles. Moreover, it was observed that (i) the SC50 value for the stimulation of the LmrA ATPase activity by Hoechst 33342 in lactococcal membrane vesicles was almost 30-fold lower than that for the MsbA ATPase activity in E. coli membrane vesicles, (ii) the SC50 values for the stimulation of the LmrA ATPase activity by vinblastine or daunomycin were almost 4.7- and 5-fold lower, respectively, than the corresponding SC50 values for stimulation of the MsbA ATPase activity, and (iii) purified and functionally reconstituted MsbA mediated the ATP-dependent transport of Hoechst 33342 in proteoliposomes prepared from lactococcal lipids rather than E. coli lipids. Taken together, these observations imply that MsbA exhibits a reduced affinity for drugs compared with LmrA, which may reflect a true difference in the Km for drug transport between these transporters and/or may relate to a competition between drugs and endogenous lipid (such as Lipid A) for transport by MsbA in E. coli membrane vesicles. The MsbA activity in E. coli has been reported to be associated with the transport of Lipid A and glycerophospholipids from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane (the location of biosynthesis) to the outer membrane (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13Dowhan W. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism is not known, MsbA may function as a lipid flippase, catalyzing the transbilayer movement of lipids in the cytoplasmic membrane. Alternatively, MsbA may be involved in the transperiplasmic movement of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids from the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane. In the latter model, MsbA may operate in a similar fashion as LolCDE, an E. coli ABC transporter that mediates the transport of lipoproteins from the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane in conjunction with the periplasmic chaperone LolA (30Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S.-I. Matsuyama S.-I. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Previous work on LmrA and P-glyco-protein demonstrated that these proteins mediate the extrusion of lipophilic compounds from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane rather than the outer leaflet (21Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Qu Q. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The functional substitution of MsbA by LmrA in E. coli WD2 at non-permissive temperatures implies that this mode of transport is also relevant for MsbA and, hence, that MsbA catalyzes the transbilayer movement of Lipid A in the cytoplasmic membrane. However, pumping from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane does not explain how MsbA would mediate the translocation of its lipid substrates to the outer membrane. In this context, the hemolysin A secretion system HlyBD-TolC in E. coli (32Andersen C Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) represents an interesting example of how membrane proteins, including the MsbA homologue HlyB, and a periplasmic accessory protein act together in an export reaction across the cell envelope. Although MsbA and LmrA are homologous proteins, the subtle differences between their primary structures make precise compulsory protein-protein interactions between the MsbA or LmrA and additional components of the Lipid A translocation machinery in E. coli less likely. Instead, the transport of Lipid A in E. coli could involve lipid transfer proteins, as observed in eukaryotic cells (34Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 35Schouten A. Agianian B. Westerman J. Kroon J. Wirtz K.W.A. Gros P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2117-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which would shuttle Lipid A from the outer leaflet of the inner membrane to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane by diffusion or in a transporter-dependent fashion (e.g. analogous to LolCDE/LolA (30Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S.-I. Matsuyama S.-I. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)). The transport of Lipid A from the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane in E. coli could also involve endogenous multidrug transporters, such as AcrAB-TolC (28Nikaido H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 29Lomovskaya O. Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1210-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which can transport lipophilic substrates from the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. Alternatively, MsbA-mediated Lipid A transport from the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane may occur at contact sites between these membranes, known as Bayer junctions (36Bayer M.H. Costello G.P. Bayer M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 758-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our insight into the detailed mechanisms by which phospholipids are transported across and between membranes in microorganisms and mammalian cells is limited (37Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This aspect of the biogenesis of biological membranes has lagged far behind the tremendous advances in other areas, such as understanding solute transport and membrane protein traffic and sorting, made over the last two decades. We conclude that LmrA and MsbA have overlapping substrate specificities, providing another example of the close link that exists between lipid transporters and multidrug transporters. Our conclusion implies the presence of structural elements in MsbA supporting drug-protein interactions and may also point to a physiological role of LmrA in lipid transport in L. lactis.

https://openalex.org/W2127524168,"The alkylphosphocholine class of drugs, including edelfosine and miltefosine, has recently shown promise in the treatment of protozoal and fungal diseases, most notably, leishmaniasis. One of the major barriers to successful treatment of these infections is the development of drug resistance. To understand better the mechanisms underlying the development of drug resistance, we performed a combined mutant selection and screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, designed to identify genes that confer resistance to the alkylphosphocholine drugs by inhibiting their transport across the plasma membrane. Mutagenized cells were first selected for resistance to edelfosine, and the initial collection of mutants was screened a second time for defects in internalization of a short chain, fluorescent (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD))-labeled phosphatidylcholine reporter. This approach identified mutations in a single gene, YNL323W/LEM3, that conferred resistance to alkylphosphocholine drugs and inhibited internalization of NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine. Loss of YNL323W/LEM3 does not confer resistance to N-nitroquinilone N-oxide or ketoconazole and actually increases sensitivity to cycloheximide. The defect in internalization is specific to NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Labeled phosphatidylserine is internalized at normal levels in lem3 strains. LEM3 is a member of an evolutionarily conserved family and has two homologues in S. cerevisiae. Single point mutations that produce resistance to alkylphosphocholine drugs and inhibition of NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine internalization were identified in several highly conserved domains. These data demonstrate a requirement for Lem3p expression for normal phosphatidylcholine and alkylphosphocholine drug transport across the plasma membrane of yeast.

The alkylphosphocholine class of drugs, originally developed for their anti-cancer activities, has shown great promise in the treatment of parasitic infections including those caused by Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei (1Croft S.L.

In particular, in vitro and in vivo studies in animals have shown miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine) and edelfosine, also known as rac-1-octadecyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine, to be effective killers of Leishmania in both promastigote and amastigote morphological stages (3Croft S.L.

Miltefosine was recently approved as the first orally administered drug for the treatment of leishmaniasis based on several highly successful clinical trials (5Sundar S. Rosenkaimer F. Makharia M.K.

Although no consensus has emerged regarding the mode of action of these drugs in cancer cells or in parasites, several likely intracellular targets related to signal transduction and lipid biosynthesis have been identified. In cancer cells, edelfosine is a potent inducer of apoptosis (10Diomede L. Colotta F. Piovani B. Re F. Modest E.J. Salmona M. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar). Although the alkyl-specific acyl-CoA acyltransferase enzyme required for remodeling of acyl- and akylglycerophospholipids has been identified as a potential target for edelfosine and miltefosine in Leishmania (12Lux H. Heise N. Klenner T. Hart D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a consensus for the primary mode of action has not emerged. Regardless of whether one or numerous targets are responsible for the efficacy of this class of drugs, all of the known targets appear to require its internalization. Thus, differences in the net drug accumulation resulting from regulation of the influx and/or efflux pathways may account for the differential sensitivity observed among cancer cells as well as strains of Leishmania (13Escobar P. Matu S. Marques C. Croft S.L. Acta Trop. 2002; 81: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of a P-glycoprotein-like transporter in Leishmania tropica confers resistance to miltefosine and edelfosine as well as other drugs (14Perez-Victoria J.M. Perez-Victoria F.J. Parodi-Talice A. Jimenez I.A. Ravelo A.G. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased or decreased drug influx may determine the sensitivity of a particular cell type or strain to the alkylphosphocholine drugs and may provide a mechanism for the development of resistance. Apart from the evidence presented herein, the influx mechanism for either edelfosine or miltefosine is not known for any organism. Although it is well established that the aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine are transported from the outer to inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in a wide range of cells (15Daleke D.L. Lyles J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 108-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Raggers R.J. Pomorski T. Holthuis J.C.M. Kalin N. van Meer G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), similar transport of phosphocholine lipid analogues is limited to a few cell types. Initial studies of the internalization of short chain reporter phosphatidylcholine analogues led to the understanding that the inward-directed transport of phosphatidylcholine across the plasma membrane was insignificant relative to its internalization by endocytosis. However, more recent data imply that inward-directed, transbilayer transport of short chain reporter phosphatidylcholine analogues is a feature of particular cell types. For example, transformation of human lung fibroblasts (WI-38 cells) with the SV40 virus (VA-2 cells) was shown to substantially increase the fraction of fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylcholine (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD)-PC) 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl; PC, phosphatidylcholine; M-C6-NBD-PC, 1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylcholine; M-C6-NBD-PE, 1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine; P-C6-NBD-PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-(6-NBD aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylserine; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDR, pleiotropic drug resistance; 4-NQO, N-nitroquinoline N-oxide.1The abbreviations used are: NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl; PC, phosphatidylcholine; M-C6-NBD-PC, 1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylcholine; M-C6-NBD-PE, 1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine; P-C6-NBD-PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-(6-NBD aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylserine; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDR, pleiotropic drug resistance; 4-NQO, N-nitroquinoline N-oxide. transbilayer transport relative to endocytosis (17Sleight R.G. Abanto M.N. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, inward-directed phosphatidylcholine transbilayer transport, monitored with a spin-labeled analogue, was observed in both the apical and basolateral membranes of the dog kidney epithelial cell line, MDCK II (18Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Muller P. van Meer G. Burger K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, this is not characteristic of all epithelial cell lines since in the same study, phosphatidylcholine transbilayer transport was not observed in the human colon epithelial cell line, Caco-2. Inward-directed transbilayer transport of fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylcholine has also been demonstrated in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W.

In this case, phosphatidylcholine transport is dependent on the proton electrochemical gradient and is down-regulated by nutrient starvation (21Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol.

Gain-of-function mutations in the pleiotropic drug resistance transcription factors, PDR1 and PDR3, decrease the steady-state level of NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine internalization by decreasing its inward-directed as well as increasing its outward-directed transport across the plasma membrane (21Hanson P.K.

These studies suggest that the transbilayer transport of phosphatidylcholine and its analogues is associated with the regulation of cell growth and drug resistance. In this manuscript we present the results of a combined mutant selection and screen designed to identify genes that, when mutated, confer resistance to alkylphosphocholine drugs by inhibiting their transport across the plasma membrane. Mutagenized cells were first selected for resistance to edelfosine, and the initial collection of mutants was screened a second time for defects in internalization of the short chain, fluorescent labeled phosphatidylcholine reporter (1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylcholine (M-C6-NBD-PC). This approach identified mutations in a single gene, YNL323W/LEM3/BRE3/ROS3, that conferred resistance to both ether lipid drugs and inhibited internalization of NBD-PC. This gene was initially identified as a ligand-effect modulator (LEM3) in a screen for mutants that increased the dexamethasone-dependent activation of a glucocorticoid response element fused to a reporter gene (22Sitcheran R. Emter R. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Genetics. 2000; 156: 963-972PubMed Google Scholar). The alias BRE3 was identified in a screen of deletion strains that have increased sensitivity to brefeldin A, a blocker of intracellular transport and membrane biogenesis (23Muren E. Oyen M. Barmark G. Ronne H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). More recently, this gene was identified in a screen for mutations that confer resistance to the drug Ro09-0198. Ro09-0198 is a tricyclic peptide antibiotic that causes cell lysis upon binding to phosphatidylethanolamine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Deletion and truncation mutants of LEM3 produced increased sensitivity to Ro09-0198 presumably by increasing the amount of phosphatidylethanolamine exposed to the exoplasmic surface. This conclusion was based in part on the observation that lem3 strains were significantly impaired in their ability to internalize NBD-PE by flip. These data combined infer a significant role for Lem3p in the transbilayer translocation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as well as the alkylphosphocholine drugs across the plasma membrane. Materials—Yeast media was obtained from Difco. All other reagents, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Sigma. NBD-labeled phospholipids M-C6-NBD-PC, 1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (M-C6-NBD-PE); 1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)-phosphatidic acid, 1-palmitoyl-2-(6-NBD aminocaproyl)-phosphatidylserine (P-C6-NBD-PS), and edelfosine (also known as 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphorylcholine) and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phospholipids were stored at -20 °C and periodically monitored for purity by thin-layer chromatography. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by the lipid phosphorous assay or by absorbance at 466 nm (for NBD phospholipids only). Yeast Strains and Cultures—All yeast strains used in the selection and screen were derived from AGY75 (Table I), a yeast strain disrupted in the PDR1 and PDR3 loci. Homozygous diploid deletion strains were from the Yeast Genome Deletion Project and were the kind gift of Scott Devine. Strains carrying the three combinations of double deletions of LEM3, CDC50, and YNR048W were created by tetrad analysis of mating of haploid genes from the appropriate homozygous diploid deletion strains. The endocytic mutants were donated by the Reizman laboratory. The temperature sensitivity and endocytosis defects of these strains were confirmed before use in this study. For all experiments, early log-phase cultures (A 600 = 0.2–0.4) were grown in SDC (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and Complete amino acid supplement as described in Sherman et al. (24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1986: 181-190Google Scholar)) from overnight cultures. SCNaN3 is SDC media lacking glucose but containing 2% sorbitol and 20 mm sodium azide. Temperature-sensitive strains were grown at a permissive temperature of 23 °C, and edelfosine killing assays were performed at both 23 and 37 °C.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceAGY75MAT a pdr3::HIS3 pdr1::TRP1 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1Laboratory collection (21Hanson P.K.

(25Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1997: 15-22Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with distilled water and then suspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Ethyl methanesulfonate was added to a final concentration of 3% and dispersed by vigorous vortex mixing. Cells were incubated for 1 h with shaking at 30 °C. The cells were then pelleted, and the ethyl methanesulfonate-containing buffer was removed. Cells were washed twice with 5% sodium thiosulfate to neutralize any remaining ethyl methanesulfonate. This treatment resulted in 61% killing when compared with the unmutagenized control. Mutagenized cells were diluted into YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.004% adenine, 2% glucose) and distributed throughout the wells of microtiter plates, achieving ∼5 viable cells per well. After allowing 3–4 days for growth, a prong inoculator was used to transfer mutants to SDC containing 10 μg/ml edelfosine. Cells were harvested from 72 wells where significant growth in the presence of the drug was apparent. After single colony purification, the drug-resistant strains were screened for lack of M-C6-NBD-PC uptake by flow cytometry. Identification and Generation of Mutant Alleles—The original mutations leading to loss of function in the lem3 strains were identified by sequencing the mutant allele rescued by gap repair as described by Rothstein (26Rothstein R. Methods in Enzymology. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Additional missense mutations were identified by in vitro mutagenesis of a GFP-LEM3 fusion in the GFP-N-FUS vector described in Niedenthal et al. (27Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers specific for GFP and the CYC1 terminator were designed and used to amplify GFP-LEM3 via PCR. MnCl2 was added to this reaction at a final concentration of 100 μm to increase the frequency of errors. This PCR product and linearized GFP-N-FUS were transformed into a lem3Δ strain. Transformants were screened for resistance to edelfosine. Resistant strains were further characterized by Western blot using anti-GFP primary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Plasmids were harvested from the edelfosine-resistant strains that expressed full-length GFP-Lem3p. Sequencing identified the mutations causing loss of LEM3 function (L179P, I234N, and Q60R/Q141R). Lipid Preparation—Phospholipids dissolved in chloroform were dried under a stream of nitrogen and desiccated under vacuum for 1 h or overnight. Desiccated lipids were resuspended in the appropriate amount of Me2SO or ethanol to obtain a 100× stock concentration of NBD-phospholipids or edelfosine, respectively. Internalization of Phospholipids into Yeast Cells—Cultures were grown to early log phase in SDC at 30 °C. For flow cytometry experiments, cells were chilled on ice for ∼10 min before the addition of Me2SO-solubilized lipid to a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were labeled for 30 min and then washed 3 times with ice-cold SCNaN3 and maintained at 2 °C until analysis. A similar protocol was used for microscopy experiments, except cells were labeled at 30 °C. Growth Inhibition Assays—Drug containing media was serially diluted across the wells of a microtiter plate. Yeast strains were grown in SDC or YPAD and diluted to A 600 = 0.1 in the respective growth medium. These cultures were further diluted 1:20, and 50 μl of the cell suspension was added to wells containing 50 μl of medium and varying concentrations of drug. Plates were incubated at 30 °C, and the resulting growth was documented by reading the A 595 in a microtiter plate reader. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. The fluorescent images were captured with a SIT66 image-intensifying camera (DAGE-MTI, Michigan City, IN), digitized, and stored using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Sensitivity of S. cerevisiae to Edelfosine Is Reversed by Mutations in PDR1 and PDR3—Anti-tumor ether lipid drugs have been reported to exhibit cytostatic effects on a wide variety of cell types including yeasts (28Ruetz S. Brault M. Dalton W. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8180-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that our wild-type strain is sensitive to the ether lipid drug edelfosine at levels similar to those reported previously (28Ruetz S. Brault M. Dalton W. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8180-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because gain-of-function mutations in the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) network have been shown to affect intracellular accumulation of a wide range of drugs (29Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) as well as phospholipid analogs (30Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of gain-of-function mutations in PDR1 and PDR3 on edelfosine resistance. As seen in Fig. 1, these mutations resulted in a dramatically resistant strain, which could be due to down-regulated influx (21Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), up-regulated efflux (29Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), altered membrane permeability (31van den Hazel H.B. Pichler H. do Valle Matta M.A. Leitner E. Goffeau A. Daum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1934-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), or a combination of these PDR-mediated effects. Edelfosine Is Not Internalized by Endocytosis—In studies of mammalian cells, endocytosis appears to play a role in the internalization of ether lipid drugs in some of the cell lines tested (32Brachwitz H. Vollgraf C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 39-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether endocytosis is a significant pathway for the internalization of edelfosine in S. cerevisiae, we evaluated the sensitivity of strains defective in the internalization step of endocytosis. An end4 null strain, which is blocked in both fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis from the plasma membrane (33Wesp A. Hicke L. Palecek J. Lombardi R. Aust T. Munn A.L. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2291-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), was not resistant to edelfosine when compared with its wild-type parent (Fig. 2). Furthermore, at 37 °C, temperature-sensitive lesions in neither end3 nor end4 improved the survival of edelfosine-treated cells as assessed by methylene blue staining (data not shown). If endocytosis were the primary mechanism of edelfosine uptake, then endocytic mutants would be expected to exhibit increased resistance to edelfosine. Because this was not the case, we concluded that edelfosine was internalized by a non-endocytic mechanism. This result is consistent with previous work demonstrating that the fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylcholine, M-C6-NBD-PC, which differs from edelfosine only in the linkage and structure of the hydrophobic chain, is not significantly internalized by endocytosis (20Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34Hanson P.K. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2725-2733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M-C6-NBD-PC internalization is not inhibited in the end4Δ strain, whereas endocytosis of the fluid phase endocytosis marker, FM4–64, is almost completely blocked (see Fig. 4B in Hanson et al. (34Hanson P.K. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2725-2733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). This result and the observation that low temperature block of endocytosis (2 °C) inhibited, but did not block M-C6-NBD-PC internalization led to the conclusion that M-C6-NBD-PC is internalized by inward-directed transbilayer transport, or flip, across the plasma membrane (34Hanson P.K. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2725-2733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration that edelfosine toxicity is not reduced in cells in which endocytosis is inhibited suggests it, like M-C6-NBD-PC, is internalized by flip across the plasma membrane.Fig. 4Deletion of LEM3 increases resistance to miltefosine but decreases resistance to cycloheximide.

Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and edelfosine (Fig. 2) appear to be internalized by flip across the plasma membrane, we hypothesized that transport of the two compounds was mediated by the same transporter. To identify this transporter or novel regulators of its activity, we chemically mutagenized a strain carrying disruptions in both PDR1 and PDR3 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This strain background was chosen to eliminate the possibility of isolating mutants in these well characterized transcription factors. Of the nearly 10,000 mutants screened, 72 were initially identified as being resistant to edelfosine at a concentration of 10 μg/ml while remaining sensitive to a battery of other drugs including cycloheximide and 4-NQO. To focus our screen on cells defective for drug internalization rather than an intracellular target of edelfosine, we tested the resistant strains for their ability to internalize M-C6-NBD-PC. These experiments were performed at low temperature (∼2 °C) to block both endocytosis and NBD-phospholipid efflux (21Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Twenty-four of the edelfosine-resistant mutants were also dramatically defective for M-C6-NBD-PC uptake. Ten of the strains that met both criteria were analyzed and found to carry recessive mutations that fell into one complementation group, indicating that a single gene was likely responsible for the observed phenotype. These mutants were back-crossed at least three times to remove spurious background mutations and tested for the presence of additional phenotypes such as temperature sensitivity of growth, respiration defects, and sensitivity to high salt concentration. No other defects were found. Identification of YNL323W/LEM3, a Regulator of Edelfosine and M-C 6 -NBD-PC Flip—To identify the defective gene, we transformed a represent"

Subsequent investigations demonstrated that the biochemical link between PNP and T-cell deficiency was the failure to degrade deoxyguanosine and its conversion to dGTP in activated T-cells (2Chan T.-S.

Stimulated T-cells require DNA synthesis for cell division, and excess dGTP acts to allosterically inhibit ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase, causing unbalanced deoxynucleotide pools and the induction of apoptosis (4Ullman B.

Dividing T-cells induce deoxycytidine kinase activity relative to resting T-cells, and this enzyme also accepts deoxyguanosine when blood levels are elevated (6Mansson E. Flordal E. Lilemark J.

Under normal conditions the blood level of deoxyguanosine is less than 0.1 μm because of high levels of PNP in human erythrocytes and in liver, spleen, and intestine (7Osborne W.R. J. Biol.

In PNP-deficient patients the deoxyguanosine level in blood can reach 10 μm, causing its accumulation as dGTP in stimulated T-cells. Structure-based inhibitor design using early x-ray crystal structures of human PNP led to a family of inhibitors with dissociation constants to 15 nm, but these were insufficient to cause the sustained elevation of blood deoxyguanosine needed to suppress division of activated T-cell populations (8Montgomery J.A.

In a mouse model of host versus graft disease, immucillin-H is as effective as cyclosporin in prolonging host survival (13Banti S. Miller P.J. Parker C.D. Ananth S.L. Horn L.L. Babu Y.S. Sadhu J.S.

These favorable features of PNP inhibition have recently gained immucillin-H approval to enter phase I/II clinical trials against T-cell leukemia (14Kilpatrick J.M. Morris P.E. Serota Jr., D.G.

Lewandowicz and V. L. Schramm, unpublished observations. because it and the bovine PNP are known to have different binding affinities with the immucillin transition state analogues (11Miles R.W.

When a transition state analogue binds with different strengths to isozymes such as the human and bovine PNPs, a difference in their transition state structures is likely to be the cause. Despite an 87% amino acid identity between human and bovine PNPs, differences at the homotrimeric subunit interfaces cause differences in catalytic site cooperativity and, apparently, differences in transition state properties (11Miles R.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Kinetic isotope effect analysis 2A. Lewandowicz and V. L. Schramm, unpublished observations. established that the transition state is more dissociated for the human enzyme, with greater separation between the ribosyl group and the departing purine ring. Although immucillin-H is well suited to the transition state of bovine PNP, DADMe-immucillin-H is better matched to the more dissociated transition state (Fig. 1). Here we demonstrate that the DADMe-immucillins are more powerful inhibitors of human PNP than the first generation immucillins designed to match the transition state of bovine PNP. The oral availability of DADMe-immucillin-H is established in a mouse model, and its biological efficiency is compared with immucillin-H. DADMe-immucillin-H is a sufficiently powerful inhibitor of PNP in circulating mouse erythrocytes that the recovery of blood PNP activity occurs primarily by synthesis of new erythrocytes.

Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction, with primers purchased from Invitrogen, was performed to amplify PNP DNA, which was cloned into a T7/NT TOPO vector and transformed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain. Inhibitor Synthesis—Immucillin-H was synthesized from d-gulonolactone to introduce appropriate stereochemistry in the iminoribitol ring as described earlier (Fig. 1; Refs. 17Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Gainsford G.J. Schramm V.L. Tyler P.C. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 3053-3062Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Lewandowicz A. Schramm V.L. Tyler P.C. J. Med.

DADMe-immucillins were synthesized via the reductive amination of 5-N-benzyloxymethyl-4-methoxy-3H,5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine-7-carbaldehyde, derived from the lithiation and subsequent formylation of 5-N-benzyloxymethyl-7-bromo-4-methoxy-3H,5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine with (3R,4R)-3-hydroxy-4-hydroxymethylpyrrolidine. Acid deprotection and chromatography provided DADMe-ImmH as the HCl-salt, which was characterized by NMR, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis as outlined earlier (Fig. 1; Ref. 20Lewandowicz A. Shi W. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Basso L.A. Santos D.S. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6057-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

Inhibition Studies—Inhibitor dissociation constants for phosphorolysis of inosine by PNP were based on reaction rate measurements with different inhibitor concentrations. Reactions were started with the addition of 0.05 μg of human PNP (final concentration 1.4 nm) to 1 mm inosine in 50 mm KPO4 (pH 7.5) buffer with xanthine oxidase added to a final concentration of 60 milliunits/ml at 25 °C. In the coupled assay, hypoxanthine formed by phosphorolysis of inosine was oxidized to uric acid and followed spectrophotometrically at 293 nm (extinction coefficient for uric acid, ϵ293 = 12.9 mm–1) (21Kim B.K. Cha S. Parks Jr., R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1771-1776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for slow-onset, tightly binding inhibitors was determined from reaction rates after slow-onset inhibition had occurred according to the equation ν = (k cat × S)/(K m(1 + I/K d) + S), where ν is the steady state reaction rate after the slow-onset inhibition period has reached equilibrium, k cat is the rate at substrate saturation, S is substrate concentration, K m is the Michaelis constant for inosine (38 μm under these conditions), I is inhibitor concentration, and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the tightly inhibited PNP-inhibitor complex (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). For inhibitors without slow-onset properties, fits were made to the same equation but using initial reaction rates. Rate Constants for Dissociation of PNP·Immucillin·PO 4 —Inhibition of PNP by the immucillins is a two-step process to form the tightly bound complex of PNP (11Miles R.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The rate of inhibitor release was estimated by the recovery of enzyme activity following dilution of stoichiometric complexes formed by prolonged incubation similar to experiments described earlier for immucillin-H and immucillin-G with bovine PNP (11Miles R.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, human PNP (96 μm), inhibitors (105–108 μm), and PO4 (50 mm, pH 7.5) were incubated at 25 °C for 5.5 h to assure equilibrium. Mixtures were diluted 1:500,000 by a 1:500 dilution into 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) followed immediately by a 1:1000 dilution into assay mixtures containing 1 mm inosine. The rate constant for dissociation of inhibitors was calculated from fits to the initial regaining of catalytic activity as described previously (11Miles R.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These experiments also demonstrate the reversible inhibition caused by immucillins. Oral Availability of ImmH and DADMe-ImmH—A solution containing 10–7 mol (27 μg) of DADMe-ImmH and 3 mg of glucose was pipetted into the mouth of a 32-g Balb-c mouse that had been fasted overnight. The oral uptake of ImmH was measured by pipetting 27 μg in 10 μl of solution onto solid food and fed to mice under observation. Small samples (5 μl) of blood were collected from the tail and added to 6 μl of PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm KHPO4 (pH 7.4)) containing 1 unit of heparin and 0.3% Triton X-100. Control blood samples were collected before administration of immucillins to the mice. The mixture was kept on ice for 25 min and frozen in dry ice/ethanol for storage at –70 °C. For catalytic activity of whole blood samples, 10 μl of the lysate was added to 735 μl of complete reaction mixture containing 1 mm inosine, 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.4), and 60 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase. After mixing, the reaction progress was followed spectrophotometrically at 293 nm. In separate experiments, samples of tail blood (5 μl) were pipetted into 50 μl of ice-cold PBS, centrifuged in the cold, and resuspended in two additional samples of fresh PBS, and the pellet of washed erythrocytes was finally lysed in 5 μl of PBS containing Triton X-100 and assayed as described above. Inhibition of PNP by Immucillins—Human PNP was inhibited by ImmG, ImmH, and 8-aza-ImmH to give equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) of 42, 56, and 180 pm, respectively (see Fig. 1). The kinetic properties exhibited slow-onset, tight-binding inhibition typical of inhibition by compounds that resemble transition state analogues (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). The immucillins were designed to match the transition state for bovine PNP, which has a C-1′—N-9 ribosidic bond of 1.77 Å at the transition state (Fig. 2; 10). The immucillin transition state analogues are found to be better inhibitors of the bovine enzyme than the human PNP (Fig. 2; Ref. 11Miles R.W. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Bagdassarian C.K. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8615-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), establishing that the transition states of the two enzymes differ, despite 87% amino acid sequence identity and the observation that every amino acid at the catalytic site is conserved (23Mao C. Cook W.J. Zhou M. Federov A.A. Almo S.C. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7135-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Tight binding of the immucillins to bovine PNP depends on two essential features (24Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Shi W. Fedorov A. Lewandowicz A. Cahill S.M. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14489-14498Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 9-deazahypoxanthine structure increases the pK a at N-7 to above 10, and the N-7 of substrate at the transition state is known to be a proton acceptor. The 4′-N in the iminoribitol has a pK a of 6.9 in ImmH and is protonated at the catalytic site to resemble the cationic feature of substrates at the transition state (25Sauve A.A. Cahill S.M. Zech S.G. Basso L.A. Lewandowicz A. Santos D.S. Grubmeyer C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Tyler P.C. McDermott A. Girvin M.E. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5694-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Loss of either of these features destroys the tight binding to PNP (24Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Shi W. Fedorov A. Lewandowicz A. Cahill S.M. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14489-14498Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Design Principles of the DADMe-Immucillins—Recent kinetic isotope effect studies with human PNP have established that the transition state structure differs from that of the bovine enzyme, to give a C-1′—N-9 ribosidic bond length of greater than 2.5 Å and weak participation of the anionic nucleophile (>3.0 Å for arsenate). These features cause increased cation character at C-1′ compared with the transition state for bovine PNP (Fig. 2).2 The immucillins have a covalent C–C bond between the iminoribitol and the 9-deazapurine group, and this bond length is near 1.5 Å, making it at least 1.0 Å shorter than the corresponding atoms at the transition state. In more dissociated transition states like that of the human PNP, the cationic charge on the ribooxacarbenium ion becomes more highly developed and centered at the C-1′ carbocation rather than being distributed over O-4′, C-1′, and N-9 when the transition state has significant residual bond order remaining between C-1′ and N-9 (26Berti P.J. Tanaka K.S.E. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 2002; 37: 239-314Google Scholar). We proposed that spacing the iminoribitol and the 9-deazapurine rings closer to the actual transition state, and placing the carbocation charge in the inhibitor closer to its location in the transition state, may increase the affinity specifically for the human PNP. The DADMe-immucillins (Fig. 1) were synthesized as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The methylene bridge between the deazapurine and ribosyl analogue groups of DADMe-immucillins adds ∼1 Å linear distance between these groups but does not alter the favorable pK a of the 9-deazahypoxanthine. Moving the nitrogen to the position corresponding to C-1′ retains the cationic nature to more closely mimic the ribooxacarbenium ion transition state because N-substituted hydroxymethylpyrrolidines have pK a values near 10 and will be fully protonated at physiological pH values near 7.5 (27Jiang Y.L. Ichikawa Y. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7116-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Human PNP by DADMe-Immucillins—Human PNP binds immucillin-G more tightly than other members of the immucillin family to give a K d of 42 pm (Fig. 1). Likewise, DADMe-ImmG is the most tightly bound member of the DADMe family with a K d of 7 pm, improving the affinity by a factor of 6. In parallel with the ImmG and DADMe-ImmG affinities, DADMe-ImmH binds a factor of 4 more tightly than ImmH and, like DADMe-ImmG, gives slow-onset, tight-binding inhibition (Fig. 3). This pattern does not continue with the 8-aza-DADMe-ImmH. Thus, 8-aza-ImmH binds with a K d of 0.18 nm, whereas 8-aza-DADMe-ImmH binds with a dissociation constant of 2.0 nm and does not exhibit slow-onset inhibition. The affinity of 8-substituted ImmH analogues with the bovine PNP have shown that the pK a at N-7 is an important parameter for immucillin binding (24Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Shi W. Fedorov A. Lewandowicz A. Cahill S.M. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14489-14498Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The carbonyl oxygen of Asn-243 forms a short H-bond to the N-7 proton of ImmH (28Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Loss of binding energy in 8-aza-DADMe-ImmH relative to 8-aza-ImmH reveals that either the pK a or the contact geometry between N-7 and Asn-243 is not as favorable as it is in 8-aza-DADMe-ImmH. The kinetics of DADMe-ImmH inhibition of human PNP demonstrate two distinct inhibitory phases (Fig. 3). In the first few minutes, the initial rate slopes change rapidly to reach a second steady state plateau of increased inhibition. This is characteristic of transition state analogue inhibitors and reflects a slow enzymatic conformational change to form the tightly bound complex: E + I ↔ EI ↔ E*I, where E is free enzyme, I is inhibitor, EIisthe rapidly reversible complex of enzyme and inhibitor, and E*I is the tightly bound, slowly releasing form of the inhibited complex. The K d values reported here are calculated from the slopes of the curves at 40–50 min, where the slow-onset phase of inhibition has been completed. This part of the curve provides the overall dissociation constant for E*I (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). In Vivo Inhibition of PNP by the DADMe-Immucillins—The goal of the PNP inhibitor design program is to use transition state design principles to develop more effective inhibitors against mammalian PNPs in vivo. In vitro measurements suggest that the DADMe-immucillins should be the more effective inhibitors in vivo, provided that both inhibitor families have similar bioavailability. We elected to compare ImmH and DADMe-ImmH for bioavailability in mice, because the in vivo behavior of ImmH is becoming well characterized from studies in mice and primates (13Banti S. Miller P.J. Parker C.D. Ananth S.L. Horn L.L. Babu Y.S. Sadhu J.S. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Kilpatrick J.M. Morris P.E. Serota Jr., D.G. Phillips D.

Morris P.E. Hutchison T.L. Montgomery J.A. Sandhu J.S. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Oral administration of 0.1 μmol (27 μg, 0.8 mg/kg) of ImmH or DADMe-ImmH caused a rapid loss of the PNP activity in mouse blood with a loss of 50% of total catalytic activity in blood occurring in 10 and 14 min for DADMe-ImmH and ImmH, respectively (Fig. 4). The catalytic activity protocol of whole blood lysis does not establish whether the immucillins penetrate the erythrocyte compartment, because serum ImmH could inhibit erythrocyte PNP following lysis. In parallel experiments, blood samples were washed in cold buffer to remove extracellular immucillins followed by lysis and assay. The inhibition of erythrocyte PNP was complete for both immucillins in this assay, demonstrating the cellular permeability of these inhibitors. Thus, both ImmH and DADMe-ImmH are readily available from the gastrointestinal system and equilibrate with whole blood PNP more rapidly than they can be removed by hepatic or renal systems. Continued monitoring for the recovery of enzymatic activity demonstrated that 50% of PNP in the blood regained activity at 100 h (4.2 days) with ImmH (Fig. 4). In contrast, blood PNP regained activity more slowly with DADMe-ImmH, with 50% activity regained at 275 h (11.5 days). In long recovery times for erythrocyte PNP activity, factors other than inhibitor release and metabolism must be considered. The average life span for mouse erythrocytes is 25 days (30Gad S.C. Chengelis C.P. Animal Models of Toxicology. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 168Google Scholar). Therefore, after 12.5 days, half of the erythrocytes present at the start of the experiment will have been replaced by new erythrocytes. When the red cell replacement rate is considered, ∼90% of the PNP activity recovery that occurs over 11.5 days is due to synthesis of new erythrocytes. The in vivo inhibition of mouse blood PNP by a single dose of DADMe-ImmH therefore approximates the life span of mouse erythrocytes. The enhanced inhibition seen for DADMe-ImmH in enzyme inhibition experiments with human PNP is confirmed in the whole animal mouse model. The DADMe-immucillins represent the culmination of transition state inhibitor design in efficient inhibition of the target enzyme following a single oral dose. Comparison of Off-rates and Biological Dissociation Rates— The biological half-life of DADMe-ImmH in the mouse results from the competition between binding to erythrocyte PNP and elimination from the animal. In the simplest case, the biological half-life would be directly related to the t½ for the E*I complex. That is not the case for the immucillins, with binding half-lives of 8–120 min for ImmH, DADMe-ImmH, and DADMe-ImmG (Table I). These are similar to the rates reported for other tightly binding inhibitors of enzymes (Table I). The concentration of PNP inside mouse erythrocytes is ∼10–6m, and the K d for DADMe-ImmH is approximately 10–11m. Release of DADMe-ImmH from an intracellular catalytic site in the presence of the 105 molar excess of PNP makes recapture more likely than release by diffusion. Therefore, with a t½ of 20 min for DADMe-ImmH release at near infinite dilution, we propose that once trapped inside mouse erythrocytes, each molecule of DADMe-ImmH binds sequentially to hundreds of PNP molecules before it is lost to the plasma. Rebinding of DADMe-ImmH is sufficient to cause nearly full inhibition of target PNP for the 25-day lifetime of mouse erythrocytes. As indicated above, ∼90% of PNP activity recovery corresponds to synthesis of new erythrocytes. We hypothesize that rebinding traps the inhibitor into individual cells and at the death of these cells, the inhibitor is excreted or metabolized more efficiently than being taken up by developing cells.Table IEnzyme-inhibitor release rates and dissociation constants compared with human PNP and immucillinsEnzymeInhibitort ½aThe value of t ½ is the time required to regain 50% of uninhibited enzyme activity.Kd bThe Kd value for slow-onset inhibitors is governed by the expression Kd = (Kik 6)/(k 5 + k 6), where Ki is the initial dissociation constant ([E][I]/[EI]) and k 5 and k 6 are the rates of formation and relaxation of the tightly bound complex (E**I) from (EI).

Open table in a new tab Conclusions—Transition state theory teaches that the most powerful noncovalent enzyme inhibitors can be obtained with chemically stable mimics of the transition state structures of the cognate enzymes. Perfect analogues of enzymatic transition states can never be obtained, because of the non-equilibrium bond lengths and charges that exist at the transition state. However only a fraction of the 1012-fold increased binding potential theoretically available for PNP analogues is required for biological efficiency. In the case of mammalian PNP inhibitors, we have achieved 5 × 106-fold tighter binding, sufficient to reach the ultimate goal in transition state analogue design. DADMe-ImmH binds sufficiently tightly to the target enzyme in an in vivo mouse model to be released only on the time scale of cellular replacement. We acknowledge Drs. Robert W. Miles and Gregory A.

Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12802) Google Scholar). A major drawback of these first generation monoclonal antibodies, especially for clinical application, was their murine origin, which often caused immune response in human and led to the generation of human anti-mouse antibodies (human anti-mouse antibody reaction), limiting efficacy in long term and repeated administration (3Jaffers G.

The affinities of the antibodies derived from these libraries are assumed to be dependent on the size of the library (19Perelson A.S. Immunol. Rev. 1989; 110: 5-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, many attempts have been undertaken to make the library size as big as possible, and site-specific recombination systems have been created to overcome the library size limitations given by the conventional cloning strategies (20Griffiths A.D. Willimands S.C. Hartley O. Tomlinson I.M. Waterhouse P. Crosby W.L. Kontermann R.E. Jones P.T. Low N.M. Allison T.J. Prospero T.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Nissim A. Cox J.P.L. Harrison J.L. Zaccolo M.

Nature Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Besides library generation, also the panning process itself limits the library size that can be handled conveniently. Therefore, it is important to generate libraries with a high quality of the displayed antibodies, thus emphasizing the functional library size and not only the apparent library size. With the recently described human combinatorial antibody library (HuCAL®) concept, a synthetic library in the scFv format was created, focusing on a high number of correct antibody fragments (1Knappik A. Ge L. Honegger A. Pack P. Fischer M. Wellnhofer G. Hoess A. Wölle J. Plückthun A. Virnekäs B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 57-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 22Krebs B. Rauchenberger R. Reiffert S. Rothe C. Tesar M. Thomassen E. Cao M. Dreier T. Fischer D. Höss A. Inge L. Knappik A. Marget M. Pack P. Meng X.-Q. Schier R. Söhlemann P. Winter J. Wölle J. Kretzschmar T. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 254: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HuCAL® is a fully human antibody library wherein each VH and VL subfamily frequently used in human is represented by a consensus framework, resulting in seven VH and seven VL master genes giving 49 different combinations. The master genes were optimized for expression and folding; furthermore, a high functional quality of the library is guaranteed by diversifying both CDR3 regions with trinucleotide mixtures (23Virnekaes B. Ge L. Plückthun A. Schneider K.C. Wellnhofer G. Moroney S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), reflecting the natural amino acid composition of CDR3. The modular design of the library with unique restriction sites flanking the CDR and framework regions as well as compatible vector modules facilitate (i) conversion into different antibody formats, (ii) the addition of effector functions, and (iii) further antibody optimization by exchanging the CDR regions of selected binders by prebuilt CDR libraries (24Nagy Z.A. Hubner B. Loehning C. Rauchenberger R. Reiffert S. Thomassen-Wolf E. Zahn S. Leyer S. Schier E.-M. Zahradnik A. Brunner C. Lobenwein K. Rattel B. Stanglmaier M. Hallek M. Wing M. Anderson S. Dunn M. Kretzschmar T. Tesar M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the generation of a second version of the HuCAL® library (HuCAL®-Fab 1), wherein we combined all of the characteristics of the HuCAL® concept with the Fab format. Whereas scFv fragments have a high tendency to form multimers (25Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10281-10288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Holliger P. Prospero T. Winter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), Fab fragments tend to stay completely monomeric, allowing selection for affinity in contrast to selection for avidity. The monomeric behavior even in crude periplasmic extracts allows a rapid off-rate screening for affinity ranking of the antibody fragments without time-consuming purifications. Furthermore, the Fab format ensures conversion into complete immunoglobulins without loss of function, thus being optimally suited for therapeutic applications. HuCAL®-Fab 1 was challenged against FGFR3, so far resistant to generation of function-blocking antibodies. FGFR3 belongs to a family of highly homologous cell surface-expressed receptor tyrosine kinases, currently including five members (FGFR1 to 5) (reviewed in Ref. 28Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D165-D177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Ref. 29Sleeman M. Fraser J. McDonald M. Yuan S. White D. Grandison P. Watson J.D. Murison J.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 271: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar for FGFR5). The FGFRs are glycoproteins comprising two or three Ig-like extracellular domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region that contains the tyrosine kinase domain (30Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 31Givol D. Yayon A.

Binding of a complex of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand and heparin to FGFR3 leads to its dimerization, resulting in autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain and a downstream activation of intracellular signaling cascades (33Kanai M. Goke M. Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6621-6628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). So far, more than 20 ligands (34Wang Q. McEven D.G. Ornitz D.M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have been identified, varying in their specificity for individual FGFRs (e.g. FGF2 shows a very promiscuous binding pattern, whereas FGF9 shows a high preference for FGFR2 and FGFR3) (35Hecht D. Zimmerman N. Bedford M. Avivi A. Yayon A. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). FGFs and their receptors regulate a multitude of cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, migration, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 36Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar and 37Naski M.C. Ornitz D.M. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D781-D794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGFR3 is mainly expressed during embryogenesis and development of bones, brain, lungs, and spinal cord (38Avivi A. Zimmer J. Yayon A. Yarden Y. Givol D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1089-1092PubMed Google Scholar, 39Peters K. Ornitz D.M. Werner S. Williams L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Different pathological disorders such as dwarfism or tumor genesis were linked to increased FGFR3 activity (reviewed in Refs. 40Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 41Burke D. Wilkes D. Blundell T.L. Malcolm S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 59-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The transforming potential of FGFR3 harboring an activating mutation was especially shown for tumor progression of ectopically expressed FGFR3 in NIH3T3 or mouse bone marrow cells (42Chesi M. Brents L.A. Ely S.A. Bais C. Robbiani D.F. Mesri E.A. Kuehl W.M. Bergsagel P.L. Blood. 2001; 97: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 43Li Z. Zhu Y.X. Plowright E.E. Bergsagel P.L.

Correlation of FGFR3 expression and tumor genesis was demonstrated for multiple myeloma patients with the t(4;14) translocation (42Chesi M. Brents L.A. Ely S.A. Bais C. Robbiani D.F. Mesri E.A.

The increased receptor activity caused by this amino acid change manifests itself in retarded bone growth, causing the most common form of achondroplasia and dwarfism (48Shiang R. Thompson L.M.

Genet. 1996; 13: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Accordingly, high affinity human antibodies that block FGFR3 activity could be of great therapeutic benefit in treating FGFR3-mediated skeletal disorders and tumor genesis. Here, we report the generation of the high quality, large size (2.1 × 1010) HuCAL®-Fab 1 library based on the already described HuCAL®-scFv library. HuCAL®-Fab 1 display and screening vectors were optimized for protein expression to overcome the problem that Fab fragments are often less optimally produced than scFv proteins (11Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R. Earnshaw J.C. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). We show the generation of high affinity HuCAL®-Fab fragments with specificity for FGFR3, using a differential whole cell panning approach. Several selected antibodies completely inhibit FGFR3-mediated cell proliferation, some of which possess subnanomolar affinities without any maturation step. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first monoclonal antibodies to FGFRs that have function-blocking activity, which makes them promising candidates for therapeutic application. Enzymes, Antibodies, and Growth Factors—DNA restriction and modification enzymes as well as polymerases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Roche Applied Science. Goat anti-human IgG (Fcγ-specific) (109-005-098), R-phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-human IgG (109-116-088), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (111-095-144), and POD-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (F(ab′)2 fragment-specific) (109-035-097) were supplied by Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). POD-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fcγ fragment-specific) (A-0170), POD-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (A-0545), POD-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) (A-6782), and mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F-3165) were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant IL-3 was supplied by PeproTech (London, UK). Recombinant FGF2 was expressed in E. coli. Cells were sonicated in PBS supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Complete; purchased from Roche Applied Science), and cleared lysate was batch-incubated with heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The resin was washed with PBS, and bound protein was eluted with PBS, 2 m NaCl. The partially purified material was diluted 10 times with PBS and subjected to a second purification step by fast protein liquid chromatography using a prepacked heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). NaCl gradient was employed to elute the FGF2, typically released from the heparin at 1 m NaCl. Recombinant FGF9 was a kind gift from Herbert Weich (GBF Braunschweig, Germany). Construction and Production of Recombinant FGFR Proteins—For cloning of an FGFR1-Fc fusion protein (FGFR11–371hFc), the primers 5′-CGGGGATCCGAGGTCATCACTGCCGGC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCGGGATGTGGAGCTGGAAGTG-3′ were used to amplify the FGFR1 sequence from amino acid 1 to 371 from human cDNA by PCR. Fragments were cloned via the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites into the pCXFc vector, which is a pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) vector with the sequence of human Fc between BamHI and XbaI sites. The FGFR3-Fc fusion protein (FGFR31–369hFc) was cloned by amplifying FGFR3 from human cDNA by PCR with the primers 5′-CGGGGATCCCCCGCCTCGTCAGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCGCGCGCTGCCTGAGG-3′ and cloning into pCXFc via the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites. cDNAs of both FGFR-Fc fusions were used to transfect 293T cells, and conditioned medium was harvested after 2 and 4 days. A soluble His-tagged FGFR3 (FGFR323–374TDhis) was constructed by amplifying FGFR3 by PCR with the primers 5′-ACGTGCTAGCTGAGTCCTTGGGGACGGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-ACGTCTCGAGTTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGTGCATACACACAGCCCGCCTCGTC-3′ from human cDNA. The fragment was cut with XhoI and cloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) digested with XhoI and EcoRV to obtain the plasmid (pBsFR323–374TDhis). Digesting this plasmid with NheI and XhoI resulted in a fragment encoding the extracellular domain of FGFR3, which was placed at the same sites in pCEP-Pu (50Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), generating pCEP-FR323–374TDhis. FGFR323–374TDhis was expressed transiently in 293E cells by transfection with pCEP-FR323–374TDhis and purified from supernatants with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by elution with a step gradient ranging from 20 mm to 0.5 m imidazole. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses demonstrated peak amounts of purified FGFR323–374TDhis at 50 mm imidazole. Cell Lines and Medium—293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Nontransformed rat chondrocytes (RCJ3.1C5.18) were transfected with full-length FGFR1 (RCJ-FGFR1), FGFR3 (RCJ-FGFR3), and FGFR3G380R (RCJ-FGFR3G380R) as described elsewhere (51Monsonego-Ornan E. Adar R. Feferman T. Segev O. Yayon A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Expression of FGFRs was regulated by a tetracycline suppression system (Invitrogen) expressing the receptor in the absence of tetracycline (–tet) and lacking the receptor if tetracycline was added to the culture medium (+tet). The mouse myeloid progenitor cell line FDCP-1 was cultured in Iscove's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and 0.1 ng/ml IL-3. FDCP-1 cells transfected with full-length human FGFR1 (FGFR1 was a generous gift from Josef Schlessinger (New York University School of Medicine)) or human FGFR3 were grown in the same medium, but IL-3 was substituted by 10 ng/ml FGF2 or FGF9, respectively. Cloning of Fab Expression Vectors Containing Cysteines for Covalent Linkage of Heavy and Light Chains—Genes encoding the human CH1 (subtype IgG1; GenBank™ accession number A49444), Cκ, and Cλ domains (GenBank™ accession numbers P01834 and P01842, respectively) had been previously constructed by gene synthesis (1Knappik A. Ge L. Honegger A. Pack P. Fischer M. Wellnhofer G. Hoess A. Wölle J. Plückthun A. Virnekäs B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 57-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) without the region responsible for formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond. Gene fragments containing the cysteine codon at the 3′-end of CH1, Cκ, or Cλ, respectively, were constructed by adding additional nucleotides to a κ- and λ-Fab in the expression vector pMORPH®X7_Fab_FS (22Krebs B. Rauchenberger R. Reiffert S. Rothe C. Tesar M. Thomassen E. Cao M. Dreier T. Fischer D. Höss A. Inge L. Knappik A. Marget M. Pack P. Meng X.-Q. Schier R. Söhlemann P. Winter J. Wölle J.

BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar) and a Strep tag (53Schmidt T.G.M. Koepke J. Frank R. Skerra A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) by PCR using Pwo polymerase. 5′-GTGACGGTTAGCTCAGCGTC-3′ and 5′-GATATCTGCAGAATTCGCAGCTTTTCGGTTCCAC-3′ were used as primers for CH1, 5′-GAAATTAAACGTACGGTGGCTGC-3′ and 5′-TCCTCTAGATGCATGCTTATCAGCACTCGCCAC-3′ for Cκ, and 5′-GCGGCACGAAGTTAACCGTTC-3′ and 5′-TCCTCTAGATGCATGCTTATCAGCTGCACTCAGTCGG-3′ for Cλ. PCR products were gel-purified and digested with BlpI/EcoRI (CH1), BsiWI/SphI (Cκ), and HpaI/SphI (Cλ). Digests were separated on agarose gels and bands corresponding to the final products purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). FabCys vectors containing the cysteine codon at the 3′-end of CH1, Cκ, or Cλ, respectively, were constructed as follows. In the case of κ-Fabs, the BsiWI/EcoRI-digested vector fragment and in the case of λ-Fabs the HpaI/EcoRI vector fragment of pMORPH®X7_FS was ligated with the fragments encoding either Cκ (BsiWI/SphI) or Cλ (HpaI/SphI), CH1 (BlpI/EcoRI), and a fragment corresponding to the intergenic region, the PhoA signal sequence, and VH (SphI/BlpI) in a four-fragment ligation. E. coli JM83 (54Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) was subsequently transformed with the ligation products. The final expression vectors were designated pMORPH®X7_FabCys_FS. Cloning and Expression of Disulfide-linked and Noncovalently Linked Fab Fragments—Control κ-scFv and λ-scFvs were converted into the Fab format by cloning the VL and VH fragments into the expression vectors for disulfide-linked Fabs pMORPH®X7_FabCys_FS and the vectors for noncovalently linked Fabs pMORPH®X7_Fab_FS. The cloning procedure and expression in JM83 (54Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) were performed as described (22Krebs B. Rauchenberger R. Reiffert S. Rothe C. Tesar M. Thomassen E. Cao M. Dreier T.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thermal Stability of Disulfide-linked and Noncovalently Linked Fab Fragments—To analyze the heat stability of disulfide-linked and unlinked Fab-fragments, 1 μm solutions of purified proteins in PBS were incubated at temperatures of 4, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 °C for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were tested for binding activity using the Biacore instrument. Biacore analysis was performed at 22 °C as described (22Krebs B. Rauchenberger R. Reiffert S. Rothe C. Tesar M. Thomassen E. Cao M. Dreier T. Fischer D. Höss A. Inge L. Knappik A. Marget M. Pack P. Meng X.-Q. Schier R. Söhlemann P. Winter J. Wölle J. Kretzschmar T. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 254: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) under mass transport-limited conditions. The binding signal at the end of the injection was measured. The binding signal of the sample incubated at 4 °C was set to 100%, and the binding signals of the samples incubated at the other temperatures were normalized to that value. Comparison of the OmpA and StII Signal Sequence for Light Chain Expression—The StII signal sequence for light chain expression in pMORPH®X7_Fab_FS (22Krebs B. Rauchenberger R. Reiffert S. Rothe C. Tesar M. Thomassen E. Cao M. Dreier T. Fischer D. Höss A. Inge L. Knappik A. Marget M. Pack P. Meng X.-Q. Schier R. Söhlemann P. Winter J. Wölle J. Kretzschmar T. J. Immunol.

Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995: 229-266Google Scholar) via XbaI/EcoRV. The new expression vector was designated pMORPH®X9_Fab_FS. Heavy and light chains of the control κ-Fab and λ-Fab were excised from pMORPH®X7_Fab_FS and cloned into pMORPH®X9_Fab_FS by EcoRV/EcoRI. Expression yields of these Fabs containing either the StII or the OmpA signal sequence were measured as follows. After expression in JM83 (54Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J.

https://openalex.org/W2152254940,"The 90 kDa heat shock protein, Hsp90, is an abundant molecular chaperone participating in the cytoprotection of eukaryotic cells. Here we analyzed the involvement of Hsp90 in the maintenance of cellular integrity using partial cell lysis as a measure. Inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin, radicicol, cisplatin, and novobiocin induced a significant acceleration of detergent- and hypotonic shock-induced cell lysis. The concentration and time dependence of cell lysis acceleration was in agreement with the Hsp90 inhibition characteristics of the N-terminal inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol. Glutathione and other reducing agents partially blocked geldanamycin-induced acceleration of cell lysis but were largely ineffective with other inhibitors. Indeed, geldanamycin treatment led to superoxide production and a change in membrane fluidity. When Hsp90 content was diminished using anti-Hsp90 hammerhead ribozymes, an accelerated cell lysis was also observed. Hsp90 inhibition-induced cell lysis was more pronounced in eukaryotic (yeast, mouse red blood, and human T-lymphoma) cells than in bacteria. Our results indicate that besides the geldanamycin-induced superoxide production, and a consequent increase in cell lysis, inhibition or lack of Hsp90 alone can also compromise cellular integrity. Moreover, cell lysis after hypoxia and complement attack was also enhanced by any type of Hsp90 inhibition used, which shows that the maintenance of cellular integrity by Hsp90 is important in physiologically relevant lytic conditions of tumor cells.

The 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp90, 90 kDa heat shock protein; Brij, Brij-58: C16E20, polyethylene glycol hexadecyl ether; CDDP, cisplatin; DPH, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium chloride; GA, geldanamycin; GP, the inactive geldanamycin analogue, geldampicin; GSH, reduced glutathione; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NB, novobiocin; RA, radicicol; Tiron, 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid disodium salt. is a central part of a chaperone meshwork chaperoning a large number of substrate proteins (1Csermely P.

Besides being a partner of a large number of co-chaperones and substrates, Hsp90 binds to filamentous actin and tubulin (6Koyashu S. Nishida E. Kadowaki T. Matsuzaki F. Iida K. Harada F. Kasuga M.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Together with other chaperones, like Hsp27 and Hsp70, Hsp90 is involved in cytoprotection (10Yahara I. Iida H. Koyasu S.

Landes Co., Austin1997Crossref Google Scholar). Cell lysis is one of the most commonly used methods to test cellular integrity. Moreover, lysis rate anomalies (13Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 335-344PubMed Google Scholar, 14Miseta A. Kellermayer M. Ludany A. Cameron I.L. Hazlewood C.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) together with diffusional anomalies (15Luby-Phelps K. Weisinger R.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 115B: 295-306Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Verkman A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) were used as important arguments for the organization of the cytoplasm. Since cellular integrity is preserved after a partial cell lysis to a large extent (13Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 335-344PubMed Google Scholar, 14Miseta A. Kellermayer M. Ludany A. Cameron I.L. Hazlewood C.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), partial lysis provides a highly sensitized, but still somewhat organized cellular system, where the contribution of various components to both the cytoplasmic organization and cellular stability can be studied. The original aim of the present study was to examine whether Hsp90 inhibition induces any change in the rate of cell lysis induced by mild detergent treatment or hypotonic shock. The rationale behind these experiments was to test, whether Hsp90, a cytoprotective chaperone, binding to “thousand-and-one” substrates and other proteins is involved in the maintenance of cellular integrity (17Csermely P. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 15: 123-126Google Scholar), and whether its inhibition renders cells more “lysis-prone.” The first experiments were very promising: geldanamycin, a well-established Hsp90 inhibitor (18Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.D. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 19Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) induced a significant increase in lysis rate of various cells. However, later experiments demonstrated that the extent of geldanamycin-induced enhancement of cell lysis was dependent on the experimental conditions, namely, if cells were shaken during the experiment or not. At this time the first results of geldanamycin-induced superoxide generation appeared (20Billecke S.S. Bender A.T. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Lowe E.R. Kamada Y. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol.

These results turned our attention to examine the contribution of superoxide-related versus Hsp-related events to diminished cellular integrity after Hsp90 inhibition.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as anti-Hsp90 hammerhead ribozymes we demonstrated that besides a putative increase in membrane fragility by geldanamycin-induced superoxides, inhibition or lack of Hsp90 alone also results in a compromised cellular integrity. Moreover, cell lysis after hypoxia and complement attack was also enhanced by any type of Hsp90 inhibition used, which shows that the maintenance of cellular integrity by Hsp90 is important in physiologically relevant lytic conditions of tumor cells. Our results show the first successful use of an anti-Hsp90 ribozyme in manipulating Hsp90 levels, and demonstrate a novel element of Hsp90-related cytoprotection: its role in the maintenance of cellular integrity. Materials—Cell culture media were from Invitrogen. The pcDNA3 vector for hammerhead ribozyme cloning and LipofectAMINE were obtained from Invitrogen, restriction enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were from Promega (Madison, WI). The anti-Hsp90 antibody, anti-Raf-1, anti-Lck rabbit polyclonal antibodies, goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The Bradford reagent for protein concentration measurements was a Bio-Rad (Richmond CA) product. Geldanamycin and geldampicin (18Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.D. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc.

DPH (1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals used were from Sigma Chemical Co. Culture of Jurkat Cells and Drug Treatments—The human T-lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat, J32) was provided by M. Kamoun (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Philadelphia, PA) and was cultured as described earlier (26Schnaider T. Somogyi J. Csermely P. Szamel M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For all experiments 2 × 105 cells (at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/ml) were used unless otherwise indicated. Drug treatments were always carried out in complete medium unless otherwise mentioned, for2hat37 °C with 5% constant CO2 supply. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion all the time before starting the experiment. Concentrations of the N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin (18Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.D.

Under “no-shaking” conditions cells were maintained at 25 °C in an Eppendorf incubator for 10 min after drug preincubation. Shaking of cells was performed for 10 min in an Eppendorf Thermomixer at a speed of 1000 rpm. Lysis conditions were standardized to have 20–25% lysis. This has been achieved using 0.005% Brij-58 for 10 min at room temperature. 100% cell lysis was obtained by sonicating cells for 30 s with a sonicator (Sonic 300, Artek Systems, Farmingdale, NY) on ice. After detergent treatment or sonication cells were centrifuged at room temperature for 10 min at 800 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge (Model 5402). Supernatants were processed for protein determination, lactate dehydrogenase analysis, or immunoblot measurements. Protein Content—Protein concentration of cell lysates was measured by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Lactate Dehydrogenase Measurements—The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured using the direct spectrophotometric assay of Wroblewski and LaDue (28Wroblewski F. La Due J.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1955; 90: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar) in the presence of pyruvate and NADH. In 2 ml of a 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 30 μm pyruvate and 30 μm NADH 10 μl of Jurkat cell supernatant were added after the indicated treatments with drugs and detergents, and changes in optical density were measured at 340 nm for 5 min. Special care was taken to avoid the absorbtion of LDH to the cuvette wall during the activity measurement. The percentage of LDH release was calculated by dividing the activity of LDH in the supernatant by the LDH activity measured after complete cell lysis achieved by sonication. None of the detergents and drugs affected LDH activity, when added directly to the reaction mixture at the concentrations used in whole cell experiments. Superoxide Production—Superoxide production in geldanamycin-treated Jurkat cells was assayed by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method (29Xie Y.W. Wolin M.S. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2580-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 Jurkat cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) after a treatment with various drugs were washed free of the used inhibitors, resuspended in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and added to the scintillation vial containing 5 μm lucigenin in the same Hepes buffer. Lucigenin chemiluminescence with and without cells was recorded as cpm (counts per minute) for about 10 min in 0.1-min intervals in a Beckman LS7800 liquid scintillation counter using a single photon mode. Chemiluminescence values were corrected to background chemiluminescence without added cells. Membrane Fluidity Measurements—The procedure was adapted from Revathi et al. (30Revathi C.J. Chattopadhay A. Srinivas U.K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 32: 1392-1407Google Scholar). Jurkat cells after a treatment with the drug indicated were incubated with 1 μm 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) for 15 min in the dark in triplicates. Cells were washed free of DPH, resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the fluorescence was immediately measured using a steady-state spectrofluorimeter (M300-Edinburgh Instruments) in 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes with an excitation and emission wavelength of 357 and 430 nm, respectively. Fluorescence polarization was measured after adapting cells in dark with constant stirring. Construction of Anti-Hsp90 Hammerhead Ribozymes—The design of anti-Hsp90 hammerhead ribozyme was adapted from the studies of Little and Lee (31Little E. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9526-9534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ribozyme was designed to cleave in a highly conserved segment of the coding region of Hsp90 at its N or C terminus, respectively. Partially overlapping nucleotides for both Hsp90α and Hsp90β N-terminal and C-terminal regions were synthesized. These sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed at room temperature for 15 min in a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) buffer. Prior to cloning, these oligonucleotides were further extended with 5 units of Klenow polymerase in a standard PCR buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 μm dNTP mix) for 60 min at 37 °C. The end-filled products were precipitated using ethanol, resuspended in sterile double distilled water, and double digested with HindIII and NotI. For cloning the cloning vector, pcDNA3 with an hCMV promoter and a polylinker containing the bovine growth hormone poly(A) sequence was selected. In the vector the upstream ATG (at nucleotide position 995) after the XbaI and ApaI sites was disrupted by introducing a stop codon followed by XhoI, NheI, NotI, and SacII restriction sites. The vector was digested with HindIII and NotI restriction enzymes, the digested vector was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase at 37 °C for 15 min and the enzyme was inactivated by phenol/chloroform extraction. The anti-Hsp90 hammerhead ribozyme oligonucleotides were then inserted as described in Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at the HindIII and NotI sites within the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3. Ligation reactions were carried out in a total volume of a 10 μl buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% polyethylene glycol-8000, the double-digested insert and the vector in a molar ratio of 3:1 as well as 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C for 12 h. XLN-blue competent cells were transformed with the ligation mix, and plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin. The colonies were selected from the plate, and were subjected to plasmid miniprep. The positive clones were selected by Southern blot analysis using the respective end-labeled, annealed antisense oligonucleotide. Transfection and Screening of Jurkat Cells—Jurkat cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 (as a control), or the respective anti-Hsp90 hammerhead ribozyme using the polycationic reagent, LipofectAMINE. The entire transfection protocol was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions in a 96-well plate (NUNC™, Nalgene Nunc International, NY) in multiples. Control and ribozyme-transfected cells were screened for cell viability using trypan blue dye exclusion. Neomycin selection was not feasible, since the rate of cell death with ribozyme transfections was constantly increasing showing the importance of high Hsp90 levels for the survival of eukaryotic cells. Hsp90 content was checked by an immunoblot with anti-Hsp90 antibody. Cells on the second day of transfection, where cell death was not yet much prevalent were used for further experiments. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) containing 100 μm dithiothreitol, boiled for 5 min, and the samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry protein gel transfer apparatus. Transfer of proteins was confirmed by Ponceau-S staining, and the blot was processed for Western blot analysis using a primary antibody followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Bacterial Culture and Bacterial Protoplasts—DH5-α (34Schulz A. Schwab S. Homuth G. Versteeg S. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3130-3139Crossref Google Scholar) Escherichia coli strain (a gift from Dr. András Váradi, Institute of Enzymology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary) was grown in liquid LB. Bacteria from the mid-log phase of growth (at 37 °C) were collected and were subjected to mild lysozyme treatment to digest the cell wall. Protoplasts were collected by spinning cells at 2000 rpm for 2 min. Protoplasts were stored in 0.9% NaCl isotonic solution, and the osmotic lysis conditions were standardized as to get 20–25% of lysis. This has been achieved using 0.4% NaCl. Incubation with various concentrations of geldanamycin (from 0.001 to 5 μm) was performed at 25 °C for 60 min to see the effect of the drug on cell lysis. Distilled water was used to achieve 100% lysis of protoplasts. Yeast Cultures, Yeast Spheroplasts, and Protoplasts—Wild-type strains of bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S-288) and fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (L-972) were obtained from Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, St. István University, Budapest, Hungary and were grown in liquid YEPD medium. Yeast cells from the mid-log phase of growth (at 30 °C) were used for making yeast spheroplasts and protoplasts. First, yeast cells were treated with 0.1 mg/ml of lyticase in case of S. cerevisiae (35Jazwinski S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 154-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and 1 mg/ml lysing enzyme in case of S. pombe (36De Sampaio G. Bourdineaud J.P. Laququin G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 30 or 45 min to make spheroplasts or protoplasts, respectively. Spheroplasts and protoplasts were collected in isotonic 1 m sorbitol, and were incubated with geldanamycin. Lysis conditions were standardized to have 20–25% lysis. This has been achieved using 0.65 m sorbitol. 100% cell lysis was achieved by treating cells with distilled water. Hypoxia-induced Cell Lysis Measurements—The method to induce chemical hypoxia was adapted from Wang et al. (37Wang G. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Lee H.M. Englander W.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A stock solution of cobalt chloride was made in sterile double distilled water and various concentrations (25 μm to 2 mm) were used for a 2-h treatment to induce hypoxia in Jurkat cells. 0.2 mm CoCl2 concentration for 2 × 106 cells/ml was chosen as the optimum to have 15 to 20% cell lysis, without any cellular damage (cell integrity was measured by trypan blue exclusion). The treatment was carried out both in presence and absence of 2 mm glutathione along with various Hsp90 inhibitors. Complement-induced Cell Lysis Measurements—2 × 106 Jurkat cells/ml were subjected to immune-mediated cell lysis using mouse and human serum in separate experiments. Serum from mouse showed very high cytolysis even at very low serial dilution (data not shown), hence, human serum was chosen for the experiments shown. The human serum concentration was optimized to have ∼20% cell lysis (judged by both protein estimation and microscopic examination). Exponentially growing Jurkat cells were treated with various anti-Hsp90 drugs for 2 h both in presence and absence of 2 mm glutathione followed by addition of 5 μl of 1:5 diluted human serum in 0.5 ml RPMI 1640-complete medium (serum enhanced the complement-mediated cell lysis hence, all the lysis experiments were performed in complete medium). Cells were then further incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Cells were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.6) and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and their supernatant was collected for measuring the cell lysis as the percent of total cytoplasmic protein released. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. of minimum three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated, and analyzed with unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was accepted as indicating a statistically significant difference compared with controls. In figure legends: *, p < 0.05;**, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Geldanamycin Induces an Accelerated Lysis of Jurkat Cells—In order to test, whether Hsp90, a cytoprotective chaperone forming a complex with a lot of cytoplasmic proteins is involved in the maintenance of cellular integrity (17Csermely P. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 15: 123-126Google Scholar) Jurkat cells were subjected to mild detergent lysis with Brij-58. Lysis conditions were optimized to achieve an ∼20% lysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a 10-min detergent treatment (Fig. 1A, open bars). Preincubation of Jurkat cells with geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 (18Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.D. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 19Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) induced a significant increase in the extent of released LDH (Fig. 1A, filled bars). In agreement with previous data (18Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.D. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 19Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) geldanamycin treatment alone, without additional Brij-58 lysis did not induce a significant lysis of Jurkat cells (data not shown). Geldanamycin-induced lysis was not specific to Brij-58, but could be observed if primary cell lysis was induced by other detergents, like the plasma membrane specific digitonin or by hypotonic shock (data not shown). The effect was concentration dependent, showing a saturation above 2 μm geldanamycin (Fig. 1B and data not shown). The geldanamycin-induced enhancement of the release of lactate dehydrogenase, a well-known cytoplasmic marker protein might be the consequence of a heretofore unknown interaction between LDH and Hsp90, where geldanamycin would dissociate LDH from Hsp90, and cause its accelerated release. However, the geldanamycin-induced enhancement of cell lysis was a general feature of all cytoplasmic proteins, including Hsp90 itself, Hsp90 substrates, like the Raf and Lck kinases and total cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1C and data not shown). The extent of maximal release was similar for LDH and total proteins showing that the inhibition of Hsp90 induced a fairly general destabilization of cellular structures. Geldanamycin-induced enhancement of cell lysis was not instant but required at least a 1-h preincubation with the drug to be effective (Fig. 1D). Our data are in good agreement with the concentration and time dependence of geldanamycin-induced changes in Hsp90 substrate proteins (18Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.D. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M.

The geldanamycin-induced additional cell lysis was similar to the increase in cell lysis after disruption of cytoskeletal elements with colchicine or cytochalasin (data not shown). However, the effect of geldanamycin was not changed (data not shown) if lysis was performed in the presence of actin or tubulin stabilizing buffers (38Carraway K.L. Cerra R.F. Jung G.

https://openalex.org/W2080128182,"The virally encoded oncoprotein Tax has been implicated in HTLV-1-mediated cellular transformation. The exact mechanism by which this protein contributes to the oncogenic process is not known. However, it has been hypothesized that Tax induces genomic instability via repression of cellular DNA repair. We examined the effect of <i>de novo</i> Tax expression upon the cell cycle, because appropriate activation of cell cycle checkpoints is essential to a robust damage-repair response. Upon induction of <i>tax</i> expression, Jurkat T-cells displayed a pronounced accumulation in G<sub>2</sub>/M that was reversible by caffeine. We examined the G<sub>2</sub>-specific checkpoint signaling response in these cells and found activation of the ATM/chk2-mediated pathway, whereas the ATR/chk1-mediated response was unaffected. Immunoprecipitation with anti-chk2 antibody results in co-precipitation of Tax demonstrating a direct interaction of Tax with a chk2-containing complex. We also show that Tax targets a discrete nuclear site and co-localizes with chk2 and not chk1. This nuclear site, previously identified as Tax Speckled Structures (TSS), also contains the early damage response factor 53BP1. The recruitment of 53BP1 to TSS is dependent upon ATM signaling and requires expression of Tax. Specifically, Tax expression induces redistribution of diffuse nuclear 53BP1 to the TSS foci. Taken together these data suggest that the TSS describe a unique nuclear site involved in DNA damage recognition, repair response, and cell cycle checkpoint activation. We suggest that association of Tax with this multifunctional subnuclear site results in disruption of a subset of the site-specific activities and contributes to cellular genomic instability."

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5474) Google Scholar). The EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor EGFR, ErbB2/Neu, ErbB3, and ErbB4 and binds a large family of EGF-like ligands (3Riese 2nd, D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extracellular domain consists of 622 amino acids and has two cysteine-rich regions that form the ligand binding domain. The cytoplasmic domain contains a kinase region and a C-terminal tail that has several tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Upon binding of ligand to the extracellular domain, the receptors homo- or heterodimerize, bringing their kinase domains into close contact. This leads to autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues (Tyr-992, Tyr-1068, Tyr-1086, Tyr-1148, and Tyr-1173) in the cytoplasmic tail (4Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N.

Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). A major signaling route of the EGFR family is the Ras/Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (9Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGF can also activate the transcription factor Stat3 (10Grandis J.R. Drenning S.D. Chakraborty A. Zhou M.Y. Zeng Q. Pitt A.S. Tweardy D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After EGF stimulation the cytoplasmic kinase c-Src is recruited to the receptor, where it phosphorylates the kinase domain at Tyr-845 and thereby hyperactivates the EGFR (11Sato K. Sato A. Aoto M.

Activation of these pathways results in proliferation, differentiation, and/or oncogenesis of epithelial cells, neuronal cells, and fibroblasts (17Hynes N.E. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The expression of EGFR in tumor cells can be correlated with a poor response to treatment, disease progression, and shortened survival periods (18Baselga J. Oncologist. 2002; 7: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Conventional tumor therapy often results in severe side effects due to the high toxicity of the drugs toward normal cells. New, selectively acting anticancer agents that differentiate between malignant and non-malignant cells constitute a major advance circumventing unwanted side effects. Although the EGFR is also expressed in non-malignant cells, the high expression levels in a certain subset of tumors and the absence of a physiological role in the adult body make the receptor a promising target for a more specific and selective tumor therapy. The inhibition of the EGFR can interfere with the growth of tumors and has led to the design of new drugs (18Baselga J. Oncologist. 2002; 7: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Diverse strategies and reagents have been pursued for targeting the EGFR for cancer therapy, including monoclonal antibodies, ligand-linked immunotoxins, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antisense molecules (19Ciardiello F. Tortora G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2958-2970PubMed Google Scholar, 20Normanno N. Maiello M.R. De Luca A. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 194: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). With the selection of EGFR-specific peptide aptamers we have added a new approach to the inhibition of EGFR-mediated signaling and cellular transformation. Peptide aptamers are peptides of random sequence integrated into and displayed by the bacterial thioredoxin (Trx) protein as a platform. Specifically binding peptide aptamers can be selected from combinatorial libraries in which the variable peptide sequence is conformationally constrained. Selections of specific binders are carried out in vivo by an adaptation of the yeast two-hybrid system (21Colas P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The interaction between a specific peptide sequence inserted into the active loop of the scaffold protein thioredoxin A and the target protein domain of interest restores the activity of a Gal4 transcription factor and allows the growth of yeast cells under selection. Several examples have been described in which aptamers were used to interfere with specific protein interactions in vivo and thus elicit distinct cellular phenotypes (22Cohen B.A. Colas P. Brent R.

To evaluate the effects of the EGFR binding peptide aptamers on cellular growth parameters we used two experimental strategies. The first one is based on the introduction of a gene construct, encoding the peptide aptamer, into the cells of interest and observing the consequences of endogenous gene expression. The second strategy relies on the bacterial expression of the aptamer fusion protein and introduction into target cells via a linked protein transduction domain (PTD). We made use of a transduction domain consisting of nine l-arginine residues (9R), which allows a fast and efficient cellular uptake of linked proteins (29Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T.

Other protein transduction domains have been identified in the Antennapedia protein from Drosophila and in the herpes simplex virus VP22 protein (34Elliott G. O'Hare P.

The exact mechanism of protein transduction across membranes remains unknown; however, the mechanism does not seem to be receptor-mediated and is energy-independent (35Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). We isolated peptide aptamers from a high complexity random peptide library that specifically bind to the intracellular kinase domain of the EGF receptor (EGFR). Expression upon gene transfer of the aptamer encoding construct, KDI1, into EGFR-expressing cells or KDI1 protein transfer mediated by a PTD yielded consistent results with respect to the capability to interfere with EFGR action. The aptamer inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation at tyrosine residues 845, 1068, and 1148 of the EGFR, interfered with the activation of p46 Shc, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, and thereby suppressed proliferation and transformation. A short synthetic peptide comprising the aptamer sequence and a PTD also interfered with EGF-dependent Stat3 activation. Antibodies and Growth Factors—Recombinant human EGF was from R&D Systems. Antibodies used were: thioredoxin (Sigma), EGFR sc-03 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), EGFR sc-120 (Santa Cruz), ErbB2 C-18 (Santa Cruz), Stat3 C-20 (Santa Cruz), phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were from New England BioLabs/Cell Signaling. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Herc cells (NIH 3T3/EGFR), the SKBR3 breast carcinoma cell line, and the A431 vulval carcinoma cell line were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Herc Trx, KDI1, KDI3, and KDI4 cell lines were generated by stable introduction of pRc/CMV VP22-Trx-based vectors (25Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) encoding for the peptide aptamer or the thioredoxin protein without a peptide insert using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% FCS/1 mg/ml G418. Prior to growth factor stimulation the cells were kept for 18 h in serum-free medium. Renca EGFR and Renca-ErB2 cells (36Schmidt M. Maurer-Gebhard M. Groner B. Kohler G. Brochmann-Santos G. Wels W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were kept in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.25 mg/ml Zeocin, and 0.48 mg/ml G418. Peptide Aptamer Screening—The aptamer screening was done in the yeast strain KF1 (MATα trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 his 3–200 gal4D gal80D LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ SPAL10-URA3) (25Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which contains three selectable marker genes under the transcriptional control of Gal4 binding sites. As bait, the first part of the kinase domain of the EGFR, containing amino acids 688–821, was fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain into the vector pPC97 (pPC97 EGFR KDI). A randomized 20-mer peptide aptamer library was used as published in a previous study (25Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, a randomized 60-mer oligonucleotide was inserted into the bacterial thioredoxin A open reading frame, resulting in an aptamer expression library of ∼2 × 108 different clones. KF1 transformants expressing the bait constructs and the library were selected for growth in the absence of adenine, uracil, and histidine. The interaction was verified by retransformation and mating. GST Pull-down Assay—The peptide aptamer coding sequence was subcloned in a GST expression vector (pGEX 4T3, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). The peptide aptamer fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene) lysed in a GST lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors) and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). 500 μg of cell lysate of EGFR- or ErbB2-expressing cell lines and binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 mm DTT, protease inhibitors) was added. Complex formation was performed overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with binding buffer, and the bound complex was eluted by boiling in SDS loading buffer. Two-thirds of the eluate was loaded on a low percentage gel with subsequent Western blotting. As input control one-third of the eluate was loaded on a high percentage gel, which was stained with Coomassie Blue. Bacterial Expression and Purification of PTD Peptide Aptamers—A PTD of nine arginine residues was fused to the C terminus of the peptide aptamers, which were inserted into the pET30+ vector (Novagen). Expression of the aptamer was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4.5 h at room temperature. Purification of the aptamer under denaturing conditions was done as published before (36Schmidt M. Maurer-Gebhard M. Groner B. Kohler G. Brochmann-Santos G. Wels W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly the bacteria were lysed in 8 m urea, purified via a Ni2+-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia), and eluted with 250 mm Imidazole in 4 m urea. Purified proteins were renatured by dialysis against PBS containing 400 mm l-arginine and subsequently against PBS. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 95% methanol, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Cells were washed, blocked (0.5% fish gelatin, 0.1% oval albumin in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After extensive washing, incubation with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) was performed. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were solubilized in Triton extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein were incubated with a specific antibody for 2 h on ice. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with extraction buffer and once with TNE-T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling them in sample buffer. Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking in 5% milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), membranes were probed with specific antibodies and proteins were visualized with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments the filters were stripped in SDS buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 60 °C, washed with TBS-T, blocked, and reprobed with specific antibodies. Proliferation and Soft Agar Assay—Cell numbers were quantified using the XTT-based proliferation kit II (Roche Applied Science). For proliferation assays 5 × 103 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, and cell numbers were quantified over a certain time period. For soft agar assays 2.5 × 103 Herc cells were seeded in 0.3% soft agar in a 96-well plate, over a bottom layer of 0.5% agar. The agar was covered with a medium layer containing three times the final EGF concentration. Luciferase Reporter Assays—2 × 105 cells were plated into 12-well dishes. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of α-macroglobulin promoter reporter plasmid, 20 ng of β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and 0.5 or 1 μg of pRc/CMV VP22-Trx-based vectors encoding for the peptide aptamer or the thioredoxin protein without a peptide insert. The transfection was done with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h the cells were starved in serum-free medium and induced for 15h with 50 ng/ml EGF. Cells were harvested by adding 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) for 10 min on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. 20 μl of lysate was measured using a luminometer (Berthold) by injecting luciferin reagent (25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.8, 330 mm beetle luciferin). The triplicate samples were normalized for the β-galactosidase activity, which was measured by incubating 3 μl of lysate with 33 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm N2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1× Galacton (Tropix)) for 30 min on ice. The galactosidase activity was measured in a luminometer by injection of amplifier (10% Emerald (Tropix), 0.2 m NaOH). Peptide Synthesis—KDI1 peptide was synthesized by Coring System Diagnostix, Gernsheim, Germany using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry. Isolation of Peptide Aptamers Specifically Interacting with the Kinase Domain of the EGFR—In a yeast two-hybrid assay, we isolated peptide aptamers that specifically interact with the intracellular kinase domain of the EGFR from a random peptide library of high complexity. The peptide aptamer interaction screen was performed with the yeast strain KF1, which contains three selectable growth markers: GAL2-Ade2, GAL1-HIS3, and SPO13-URA3 (25Butz K. Denk C. Ullmann A. Scheffner M. Hoppe-Seyler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6693-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the EGFR kinase domain (amino acid positions 688–821), comprising the lysine residue known to be responsible for binding of ATP, served as bait. As prey constructs we used a library in which 20-mer peptides of randomized sequence had been integrated into the bacterial thioredoxin (trxA) protein. This protein serves as a scaffold to present the peptide sequence in a constrained conformation. The screening of 107 transfected yeast clones led to the isolation of three different transformants exhibiting growth of the yeast cells in the absence of adenine. These clones also grew in the absence of histidine and uracil. The aptamer-encoding plasmids were cloned, and the sequences of the peptide inserts were determined (Table I).

The peptide aptamers were again able to support yeast cell growth in the selection medium, i.e. they interacted with the KDI bait construct (Fig. 1, A and B). No interaction was observed when the Gal4 DNA binding domain without EGFR sequences was used as a bait construct (Fig. 1A). In addition, mating of peptide aptamer (KDI1, -3, or -4)- or thioredoxin-expressing clones with yeast cells transformed with different unrelated bait constructs such as the kinase domains of the ErbB2 (ErbB2 KDI and II) or IGF1 receptor (IGFIR KD) were performed (Fig. 1B). With the exception of aptamer KDI3, which showed binding to the homologue part of the kinase domain of the ErbB2 receptor (ErbB2 KDI), the aptamers did not show any interaction with the C-terminal 130 amino acids of the EGFR kinase domain KDII or with the kinase domain of the IGFR. The thioredoxin protein did not exert background binding to any of the tested bait proteins (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the binding specificity of the isolated peptide aptamers was verified in GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 2). GST-aptamer fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified, and equal amounts of GST-aptamer proteins were immobilized on glutathione beads. Lysates from different cell lines that express the EGFR or the ErbB2 receptor were prepared and incubated with the GST-aptamers bound to the beads. After washing the beads, retained receptors were eluted and visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The thioredoxin protein without peptide insert served as a negative control and did not interact with the EGFR or the ErbB2 receptor. Using cell lysates from two different EGFR-expressing cell lines in these pull-down assays revealed that aptamers KDI1 and KDI3 interacted strongly with the EGFR. Aptamer KDI4 bound with a lower affinity to the receptor (Fig. 2A). Aptamer KDI3 displayed some cross reactivity with the related ErbB2 receptor (Fig. 2B). This cross reactivity was not entirely unexpected, because the two receptors exhibit about 80% sequence homology within their kinase domains. Therefore, this clone was not used for subsequent experiments to assess specific inhibition on the EGF receptor. The highest specificity was observed for KDI1 and therefore was the best candidate for inhibitory interference with the EGF receptor. We assume that the three isolated peptide aptamers recognize different epitopes within the 130-amino acid sequence used as bait construct. Because the same results were obtained with different cell lines, it has to be assumed that these pull-down assays truly represent the binding affinity and specificity of the three aptamers. The specificity of the interaction also could be observed in co-immunoprecipitation studies. Herc cells, NIH3T3 cells expressing the human EGFR, were transiently transfected with expression constructs of the peptide aptamers. Cell lysates were prepared and the EGFR was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody. The presence of the aptamer in the immune complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 3). Aptamer KDI1 and KDI4, transiently expressed in Herc cells (Fig. 3B) were found in the immunoprecipitates, indicating interaction between the aptamer and the receptor (Fig. 3A). No expression of aptamer KDI3 was detected in transiently transfected Herc cells. Intracellular Detection of Peptide Aptamers upon Expression of Transfected Gene Constructs and Delivery of Recombinant Proteins via Protein Transduction—To assess the biological activities of the EGFR binding peptide aptamers, we used two experimental strategies. First, we transfected peptide aptamer-encoding gene constructs into Herc cells and derived stably expressing lines. The second strategy is based on the expression of the peptide aptamer fusion proteins in bacteria, purification of the proteins, and introduction of the proteins into target cells via a protein transduction domain (PTD). For this purpose the peptide aptamers were fused to a PTD consisting of nine l-arginine residues. This sequence allows a fast and efficient uptake of linked proteins into mammalian cells (31Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified under denaturing conditions via their histidine tags, and refolded in vitro. After addition of the recombinant aptamers to the growth medium, the peptide aptamers were taken up rapidly and efficiently into the cells (Fig. 4). The thioredoxin protein without an integrated aptamer sequence served as a control and was found to be located mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B); aptamer KDI1 was found preferentially associated with the plasma membrane, indicating interaction with the EGFR (Fig. 4C). Similar observations were made with transduced aptamers KDI3 and KDI4 (data not shown). Additionally, the uptake and the stability were detected by Western blotting. The intracellular presence of the aptamer was detectable after several minutes (data not shown) and lasted for at least8has detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4D) and for up to 24 h in immunofluorescence experiments (data not shown).

A transmembrane cargo protein, an Arf GTPase, and a coat protein (e.g. COPs, APs, or GGAs) are minimal components required for budding of vesicles. Munc18 interacting proteins (MINTs) are a family of three proteins implicated in the localization of receptors to the plasma membrane. We show that MINTs bind Arfs directly, co-localize with Arf and the Alzheimer's precursor protein (β-APP) to regions of the Golgi/trans-Golgi network, and can co-immunoprecipitate clathrin. We demonstrate that MINTs bind Arfs through a region of the PTB domain and the PDZ2 domain, and Arf-MINT interaction is necessary for the increased cellular levels of β-APP produced by MINT overexpression. Knockdown (small interference RNA) experiments implicate β-APP as a transmembrane cargo protein that works together with MINTs.

Eukaryotes require specialized, membrane-bounded compartments for many essential functions; e.g. aspects of protein secretion, post-translational protein processing, lipid metabolism, protein degradation, energy metabolism, and the regulation of cell surface protein expression. To achieve the specificity required to establish and maintain these different compartments a system exists in which transmembrane and luminal cargo is recruited into specialized vesicles that can be targeted to specific destinations. These vesicles move in both anterograde and retrograde directions and together comprise membrane traffic. Membrane traffic is orchestrated through the specific recruitment of cargo into budding vesicles at a donor compartment. Delivery to the appropriate destination requires specific proteins to coat the vesicle and provide targeting information and sites of nucleation for the binding of other factors required for maturation of the vesicle. Activation of the ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) 1The abbreviations used are: Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; β-APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, short-interfering RNA; TGN, trans-Golgi network; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicles; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. GTPase is the critical step in the process of vesicle budding that leads to the recruitment of specific coat proteins, whether monomeric (e.g. GGAs) or protein complex (e.g. heptameric COPI or tetrameric APs). Coat proteins also bind transmembrane cargo proteins (1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 2Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The more recent conclusions that GGA1–3, AP-3, and AP-4 join AP-1 and COPI as Arf-dependent coat proteins has revealed a greater complexity in the number and composition of vesicles than was previously appreciated (4Boman A.L.

As the numbers of types of vesicles has increased, models have had to change from a bulk flow mechanism to ones that include specificity in selection of cargo and coats. With the increased number of coat proteins, and the possibility of them acting combinatorially, there are increasing opportunities for specificity in selection of cargo transported from the Golgi/TGN. There are four characteristics that all Arf-dependent coats share: direct binding to Arf·GTP, recruitment to the Golgi membrane in a brefeldin A-sensitive manner (which further indicates Arf involvement), binding of cargo proteins, and interactions with accessory proteins, e.g. clathrin (4Boman A.L.

To test whether additional coat proteins exist that act at the Golgi, we focused on the direct binding to Arfs as the common feature of such proteins. We report here the identification of the three MINT family proteins as functional homologs to GGAs and AP complexes as coat proteins that regulate aspects of vesicle traffic. MINTs are a family of three proteins. MINT1 and MINT2 are expressed only in neuronal tissues (16Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), whereas MINT3 is ubiquitously expressed (17Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All MINTs share a conserved central PTB domain and two C-terminal PDZ domains (16Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Although MINT1 was originally described and named for its ability to bind Munc18, a neuronal protein acting at the synapse, it also binds a number of other proteins, most notably the β-Alzheimer's protein (β-APP), neurexins, and a number of transmembrane receptors (16Okamoto M.

Mammalian MINT1 and its ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans, LIN-10, are also found in a stable complex with Cask/LIN-2 and Velis/LIN-7 (20Borg J.P. Lopez-Figueroa M.O. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E.

MINT2 lacks the N-terminal Cask binding domain but binds XB51 and NFκB and can also influence β-APP processing (23Lee D.-S. Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23134-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Tomita S. Fujita T. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

Except for Munc18 and Cask, binding to other proteins occurs through the PTB and/or PDZ domains of MINTs. The best-studied activities of MINT proteins include roles in traffic and/or processing of β-APP and the EGF receptor. MINT family proteins coordinately increase cellular β-APP levels and half-life and alter its processing (31Sastre M. Turner R.S. Levy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22351-22357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 32Biederer T. Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Liu X. J.

Benard C. Barnes T. Hekimi S. Kim S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2087-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The functional importance of monomeric MINTs, heterodimeric MINT-Munc18, or the heterotrimeric MINT·Cask·Velis complex (and the possibility of interplay between these three states of MINTs) to neuronal or more general eukaryotic cells is not known. Using a two-hybrid strategy, we identified MINTs as binding partners of activated Arf3. Additional data confirmed that MINTs bind directly and preferentially to activated Arfs and that this interaction occurs through their PTB and PDZ2 domains. Treatment with brefeldin A, a specific inhibitor of Arf exchange factors, rapidly reversed MINT localization to Golgi membranes. Knockdown in the expression of either MINT3 or β-APP results in commensurate changes in the distribution of the other protein, extending the functional linkage of Arf to MINT to β-APP. Thus, these data reveal that MINTs share all the characteristics of Arf-dependent coat proteins and β-APP is implicated as a transmembrane cargo for MINT vesicles. The implications of novel cellular roles for MINTs and β-APP in vesicle traffic to pathological conditions leading to Alzheimer's disease are discussed. Antibodies—The β-APP antibodies used in this study were mouse monoclonals 26D6 (Sibia) and 22C11 (Chemicon), raised against sequences in the Aβ and N-terminal portions, respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against MINT1 (#M75920, BD Transduction Laboratories), MINT2 (#M76120, BD Transduction), MINT3 (#M93620, BD Transduction), and HA epitope (12CA5, BAbCO), or rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against giantin (BAbCO), γ-adaptin (M-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), clathrin heavy chain (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), or rabbit IgG (1–5006, Sigma Chemical Co.) were each obtained from commercial sources. The β-COP rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against “EAGE peptide” as previously described (36Scheel J. Pepperkok R. Lowe M. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were collected and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) that also contained a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Nuclei and insoluble material were removed from the cell lysate by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were collected and incubated in fresh tubes with antibody for 4 h at 4 °C, before the addition of protein-G-Sepharose beads and a further 1-h incubation. The beads were then collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. SDS sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) was added to the beads, and the samples were boiled for 5 min before loading onto polyacrylamide gels. Indirect Immunofluorescent Cell Staining—Cells were grown on coverslips and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temp before being permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% saponin in PBS containing 10% goat serum. After permeabilization, the cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.2% saponin, 10% goat serum, and primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS containing 10% goat serum before a second incubation with Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and Alexa 594 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) in PBS/0.2% saponin/10% goat serum for 1 h. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS/10% goat serum, washed twice with PBS, and mounted in PBS/0.1 m N-propyl gallate/50% glycerol. Arf-effector Binding Assay—Direct binding of an effector to Arf often results in a change in the steady-state binding of GTP to Arf (38Zhu X. Boman A.L. Kuai J. Cieplak W. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13465-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and therefore radioligand binding can be used as an assay for effector binding (39Zhu X. Kahn R.A. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22826-22837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Binding of [γ-35S]GTPγS to Arf was determined as previously described (38Zhu X. Boman A.L. Kuai J.

Arf3 (1 μm) was incubated with GTPγS (10 μm,[γ-35S]GTPγS, 2500 cpm/pmol) and GST-MINT2 or POR1 (5 μm) at 30 °C in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm l-α-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, 0.1% sodium cholate, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Aliquots (10 μl) were diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were rapidly filtered onto 25-mm BA85 nitrocellulose filters, and retained radionucleotide was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Small Interference RNA—Knockdown in the expression of either human β-APP or MINT3 was achieved by transfection of cells with pSUPER-based plasmids containing inserts that generate snap-back RNAs 19 nucleotides long with a loop of 9 nucleotides, as described in Brummelkamp et al. (43Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3966) Google Scholar). Sequences targeted were in the middle of the open reading frames in β-APP (5′-GAAGGCAGTTATCCAGCAT-3′) or MINT3 (5′-GATGCTCTGCCACGTATTC-3′). Each sequence is 100% identical to regions of the open reading frame of the targeted messages, and BLAST searches did not find those sequences in any other message. HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a series of time course experiments, 4 days was chosen as the optimal time for knockdown in protein expressions. Cells were then trypsinized, washed in PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations of whole cell lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Parallel coverslips were fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence studies, as described above. Brefeldin A Treatment—Cells were treated with 10 μm brefeldin A for 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 min before fixing with 3.7% formaldehyde. The cells were stained as indicated. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A human, fetal brain cDNA library was screened with an activating mutant of human Arf3 (Arf3-Q71L, I74S) as bait using a two-hybrid screening protocol as previously described (4Boman A.L. Zhang C.J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase and histidine auxotrophy assays were performed. Reverse two-hybrid screening was performed to identify point mutations in MINT2 that result in the loss of binding to Arf3-Q71L, I74S. Random mutations were generated in the MINT2-(500–749) insert by polymerase chain reactions performed under conditions of reduced stringency and gap repair of yeast vectors with PCR products. Yeast two-hybrid assays and selection of colonies made deficient in β-galactosidase activity were performed as previously described (39Zhu X. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25014-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 44Kuai J. Kahn R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mutated inserts were sequenced and moved into mammalian expression vectors for further analysis. Sixteen mutants were identified that expressed the MINT2 fragment to comparable levels as starting material. Three different mutations in PDZ2 were identified in this way, and those mutations were then moved into the full-length MINT2 open reading frame in the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector. These point mutant full-length MINT2 inserts were also sub-cloned into pACT2, to confirm their loss of binding to activated Arfs. Membrane/Vesicle Preparations—Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) were prepared from fresh rat liver as described previously (45Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 46Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, a microsome fraction was prepared from fresh rat liver by differential centrifugation. Crude CCVs were isolated from this fraction by centrifugation in 12.5% Ficoll 400/12.5% sucrose and further purified using discontinuous sucrose gradients. TGN membranes were also prepared from fresh rat liver, using a protocol modified from Seaman et al. (47Seaman M.N.J. Sowerby P.J. Robinson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25446-25451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, a post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was purified from rat liver homogenate by centrifugation (1500 × g for 10 min) and loaded onto a step gradient consisting of 15 ml of 6% Ficoll layered over 10 ml of 18% Ficoll layered over 4 ml of 45% Nycodenz, all dissolved in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2. The gradient was spun at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. TGN membrane fractions were collected at the 6–18% interface. MINT2 Truncations—Primers were designed to amplify a series of MINT2 truncations using the polymerase chain reaction. After sequencing, these truncated MINT2 mutants were sub-cloned into pACT2 for use in yeast two-hybrid assays. Image Acquisition—Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 Axiovert 100M confocal scanning laser fluorescence microscope with ×63 optics. The graphics in the figures were assembled using Adobe Photoshop. Replication of Experiments—Every experiment described herein was repeated at least twice with essentially the same results. Most were repeated more than twice. MINTs Bind Directly to Activated Arf—Previous screens of mammalian cDNA libraries with activating mutants of Arf3 (Arf3-Q71L) have yielded novel effectors, including the GGAs, MKLP1, and Arfaptins (4Boman A.L. Zhang C.J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 48Kanoh H. Williger B.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reverse two-hybrid screens have identified a number of residues that are critical to the binding of different Arf effectors (39Zhu X. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25014-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50Kuai J. Boman A. Arnold R. Zhu X. Kahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4022-4032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One such residue is isoleucine 74 as mutation to serine resulted in the loss of binding of Arf3-Q71L, I74S to all previously established Arf effectors yet this protein retained the ability to alter Golgi morphology when expressed in mammalian cells (50Kuai J. Boman A. Arnold R. Zhu X. Kahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4022-4032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This suggested the presence of additional Arf binding partners that are capable of altering Golgi when stimulated. A human, fetal brain cDNA library was screened with human Arf3-Q71L, I74S as bait, using the same yeast Gal4 two-hybrid screening protocol that earlier identified the GGAs (4Boman A.L. Zhang C.J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Three library plasmids were cloned that had the ability to support growth in the absence of histidine and presence of 25 mm 5-aminotriazole and were positive in yeast colony β-galactosidase assays but each only in the presence of the Arf3-Q71L, I74S, and not with an unrelated bait. The inserts from the three positives were sequenced and found to encode different lengths of a single open reading frame, encoding human MINT2 (residues 252–749, 475–749, and 500–749). There are three human MINT proteins (MINT1–3, also known as X11α, -β, and -γ or X11, X11-like, and X11-like2; accession numbers Q02410, Q99767, and O96018, respectively) that all share a conserved central PTB domain and two C-terminal PDZ domains (16Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 17Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The shortest insert identified from the library screen (MINT2-(500–749)) encoded both PDZ domains plus an additional 30 residues at the C terminus of the (∼200 residues) PTB domain. The domain organization of the MINT proteins and some of the N-terminal truncation mutants are depicted in Table I. Although MINT1 and -2 are the most highly related family members and each is expressed only in neurons, MINT3 is ubiquitously expressed and shorter (575 residues), lacking both the Munc18 and Cask binding domains from the N terminus (17Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test whether MINT1 and MINT3 also bind to activated Arfs, constructs homologous to the shortest MINT2 insert were made and, like MINT2, bound activated Arf3 and Arf4 but not the unactivated Arfs, activated Arl1 (see Table I), or unrelated bait proteins (data not shown). Activated Arfs also bound full-length MINT2 (see Fig. 2) and binding does not require the second mutation, Arf3-I74S. Thus, the interactions between Arfs and MINTs are promoted by GTP binding and are different from those previously described in that mutation of isoleucine 74 does not interfere with binding. Representatives of both class I (Arf1–3) and class II (Arf4 and -5) Arfs bind MINTs, suggesting that it is likely a feature of all the soluble Arf (Arf1–5).Table IActivated Arfs bind to MINTs in yeast two-hybrid assays Yeast strains carrying plasmids directing the expression of the indicated Arf protein, fused at their C-termini to the Gal4 binding domain, and full-length MINT2 or N-terminally truncated MINT1–3, fused at their N termini to the Gal4 activation domain, were assayed for β-galactosidase activity, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Reactivity (+) was detected within 60 min of exposure of lysed yeast cells to X-gal, and lack of reactivity (-) indicates no blue color detection within 4 h. The domain organization of each MINT and residues involved in each defined domain are depicted above. Mint2-(500–749) was the shortest MINT2 clone identified from library screening, and N-terminal truncation mutants of MINT1 and MINT3 were designed after alignment of the three proteins. MKLP1 was included as a positive control for activated Arfs and Arl1 and negative control for Arf3-Q71L, I74S. Abbreviations include MID, Munc18-interacting domain; CID, Cask-interacting domain; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding domain; PDZ, domain found in PSD-95, DLG, and ZO-1 proteins; MKLP1, mitotic kinesin-like protein 1.Fig. 2MINTs bind Arfs through PDZ2 and PTB domains. MINT2 truncation mutants were assayed in yeast two-hybrid assays with Arf3-Q71L as bait. The different truncation mutants are showed pictorially, with terminating residues in comparison to full-length proteins and protein interaction domains. The three clones pulled from library screening are shown, with MINT2-(500–749) the shortest fragment that yielded maximal activities in both β-galactosidase and histidine auxotrophy assays. Truncations at either end resulted in decreased activity in two-hybrid assays, shown on the right and performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” -, no activity; +++, strong blue color developed in X-gal assays within 30 min; ++, strong blue developed within 2 h; +, blue color developed within 4 h.

We now demonstrate that Cbl-b also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane translocation in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Ectopic expression of APS facilitated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosines 665 and 709 in Cbl-b. The phosphorylation of APS produced by insulin drove the translocation of both c-Cbl and Cbl-b to the plasma membrane. Like c-Cbl, Cbl-b associates constitutively with CAP and interacts with Crk upon insulin stimulation. Cbl proteins formed homo- and heterodimers in vivo, which required the participation of a conserved leucine zipper domain. A Cbl mutant incapable of dimerization failed to interact with APS and to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin, indicating an essential role of Cbl dimerization in these processes. Thus, both c-Cbl and Cbl-b can initiate a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B-independent signaling pathway critical to insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.

Thus, both c-Cbl and Cbl-b can initiate a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B-independent signaling pathway critical to insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Molecular protein adapters have emerged as essential components of signal transduction pathways. The Cbl family of adapters, which comprises c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c/Cbl-3, has been implicated in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. These related gene products all have a tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) 1The abbreviations used are: TKB, tyrosine kinase-binding; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SH, Src homology; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; PKB, protein kinase B; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. domain, a RING finger domain, and a proline-rich region (1Thien C.F.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6382-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The TKB domain, also called the Cbl-N domain, is an integrated phosphopeptide-binding platform composed of a four-helical bundle, a Ca2+-binding EF hand, and an SH2 domain (3Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The Cbl family proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of stimuli, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, various antigens, integrins, and cytokines (1Thien C.F. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2Tsygankov A.Y. Teckchandani A.M. Feshchenko E.A. Swaminathan G.

Moreover, Cbl and Cbl-b interact with critical signaling molecules in both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent fashions. Their binding partners include Src family tyrosine kinases, Zap-70/Syk family tyrosine kinases, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, Vav, Crk, and the Slp-76/BLNK family of linker proteins (5Andoniou C.E.

Recent studies have also shown that Cbl family proteins negatively regulate protein-tyrosine kinase signaling. This effect may be dependent, at least in part, on the activity of Cbl as an E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase (10Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, evidence has also emerged for positive roles of Cbl proteins in cellular signaling processes. For example, c-Cbl facilitates Met-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and ERK in HeLa cells via two separate mechanisms. Although binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl to c-Crk is crucial for c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, the activation of ERK in response to Met is Crk-independent (15Garcia-Guzman M. Larsen E. Vuori K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4058-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A recent study has also shown that Cbl-b positively regulates the activation of phospholipase C-γ2 by Btk in B cells (16Yasuda T. Tezuka T. Maeda A. Inazu T. Yamanashi Y. Gu H. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that c-Cbl plays an important role in insulin action. This function is regulated by two additional adapter proteins, APS (for adapter containing PH and SH2 domains) and CAP (for Cbl-associated protein). Insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, inducing its association with Crk (9Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of c-Cbl by the insulin receptor kinase is facilitated by APS. Upon stimulation, the insulin receptor catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of APS on tyrosine 618. Once phosphorylated, APS recruits c-Cbl to the insulin receptor for subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosines 700 and 774 (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CAP contains three SH3 domains in its C terminus and a region of homology to the gut peptide sorbin (SoHo domain) in its N terminus. CAP constitutively interacts with Cbl via its C-terminal SH3 domain (18Ribon V. Herrera R. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4073-4080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Upon Cbl phosphorylation, the CAP/Cbl complex migrates to caveolin-enriched lipid rafts, as a result of the interaction of the SoHo domain on CAP with the lipid raft-associated protein flotillin (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 20Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This leads to the recruitment of the Crk/C3G complex to this microdomain of the plasma membrane, where C3G, a guanyl nucleotide exchange factor, activates the small G protein TC10. The activation of TC10 has been shown to occur independently of the PI 3-kinase pathway and, more importantly, to be crucial to insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (21Chiang S.-H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). c-Cbl and Cbl-b are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of mammalian cells. They share an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal region, and both possess multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites at the C-terminal region (1Thien C.F. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2Tsygankov A.Y. Teckchandani A.M. Feshchenko E.A. Swaminathan G.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, overexpression of the Y618F APS mutant inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent Crk binding of c-Cbl, as well as the membrane translocation of GLUT4 (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In separate studies, overexpression of a CAP mutant in which either the SH3 domains or the SoHo domain were deleted blocked the recruitment of Cbl to lipid rafts and GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 20Kimura A. Baumann C.A.

Although these results strongly suggest an essential signaling role of c-Cbl in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, it remains to be elucidated whether Cbl-b becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and functions as an adapter protein in this pathway, and how these proteins interact with the insulin receptor. We report here that both c-Cbl and Cbl-b undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane translocation in response to insulin and, further, that these events require Cbl dimerization. Antibodies—The HA (F-7), Myc (9E10), c-Cbl (C-15), Cbl-b (G-1 and C-20), and phospho-ERK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Inc. The FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Stratagene. The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The Crk monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were from Pierce. The Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The Myc-APS (pRK5-Myc-APS) and HA-Cbl-b (pCEFL-Cbl-b-HA) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. David Ginty and Dr. Stanley Lipkowitz, respectively. c-Cbl full-length cDNA was derived from pSX-HA-Cbl by PCR. HA-tagged c-Cbl was made as described previously (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Cbl was constructed by placing c-Cbl cDNA with FLAG tag fused at the C terminus in frame in the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pRK7 vector. CAP full-length cDNA was derived from FLAG-tagged CAP constructs made as described previously (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E.

All mutated forms of Cbl and CAP were generated by using the Stratagene Quick Change mutagenesis kit, according to the protocol from the manufacturer. The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-IR cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Differentiation to adipocytes was induced as previously described (23Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Before insulin treatment, CHO-IR cells were serum-deprived for 3 h in F-12 Ham's medium. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were routinely serum-starved for 3 h in low glucose DMEM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Both CHO-IR cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected by electroporation as described (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R.

COS-1 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected by using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (25Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells in 60-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (1 tablet/7 ml of buffer) (Roche Diagnostics). The clarified lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C and were washed extensively with lysis buffer before solubilization in SDS sample buffer. For anti-Cbl immunoprecipitation, Cbl antibodies conjugated on agarose beads were incubated with 3 mg of lysate protein for 2 h to overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Individual proteins were detected with the specific antibodies and visualized by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions including cytosol, plasma membrane, high density membranes, and low density membranes were isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes cell homogenates using a combination of differential and equilibrium centrifugation as described by Fisher and Frost (26Hwang J.B. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on 150-mm plates were incubated in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 3 h before treating cells with or without 100 nm insulin for various times. Cells were washed three times on ice with ice-cold PBS before collecting the cells in 10 ml of TES buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 100 μm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride. Cells were homogenized in a 10-ml Potter-Elvehjem homogenizing flask using 20 strokes. The cell homogenates were fractionated into various fractions, and the final pellets were resuspended in TES. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Fifty micrograms of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblot analysis performed using appropriate antibodies. Fluorescence Microscopy—Electroporated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown on glass cover slips in 6-well dishes. After insulin treatment, cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% ovalbumin for 1 h. Primary and Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were used at 2 μg/μl in blocking solution, and samples were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were imaged using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.) for processing. Insulin Stimulates the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cbl-b in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To address a possible role of Cbl-b in insulin action, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lysates were prepared from cells treated with or without insulin, and incubated with anti-Cbl-b antibodies. The resultant immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, Cbl-b was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in unstimulated cells. The addition of insulin caused a marked tyrosine phosphorylation of a 120-kDa protein, representing Cbl-b. Intense phosphorylation of Cbl-b was detected within 2 min of insulin stimulation, reached a maximum by 5 min, and declined thereafter. Anti-Cbl-b immunoblotting confirmed that equal amounts of Cbl-b protein were immunoprecipitated at each time point. A similar time course of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin was observed. Thus, insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes induces a prominent, rapid, and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of both Cbl-b and c-Cbl. To further characterize insulin-induced Cbl-b tyrosine phosphorylation, we pretreated cells with inhibitors of different kinase pathways downstream of the insulin receptor (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cells with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor PD098059 to block the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin to block the PKB pathway did not change the stimulation of Cbl-b tyrosine phosphorylation observed in response to insulin. The effects of PD098059 and wortmannin on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and PKB were demonstrated by immunoblotting of cell lysates with respective phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 1B). In adipocytes, c-Cbl phosphorylation seems to be catalyzed by the insulin receptor rather than Src family tyrosine kinases such as Fyn (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this regard, pretreatment of cells with the selective Src kinase inhibitor PP2 did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl-b in response to insulin. These results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl-b and c-Cbl is directly catalyzed by the insulin receptor. Cbl-b and c-Cbl Move to the Plasma Membrane in Response to Insulin—In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, c-Cbl is translocated to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Hence, we wanted to test whether the Cbl-b protein also changes its intracellular localization in response to insulin. To this end, serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with insulin, and membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation. Equal amounts of total protein from low density microsome and plasma membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-c-Cbl and anti-Cbl-b antibodies (Fig. 2). Under basal conditions both c-Cbl and Cbl-b were found only at low levels in the plasma membrane fraction. However, both proteins were significantly increased in the plasma membrane fraction upon treatment of cells with insulin for 5 min. Flotillin, a lipid raft protein, did not change its membrane localization in response to insulin. The results indicate an insulin-triggered movement of Cbl-b to the plasma membrane similar to that observed for c-Cbl. In Vivo Interactions of Cbl-b with Crk and CAP—Because tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl binds to the SH2 domain of Crk (9Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl-b might result in a similar association. Lysates derived from unstimulated or insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk antibodies. As shown by anti-Cbl-b immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates, insulin rapidly stimulated the association of Cbl-b with endogenous Crk (Fig. 3A). Anti-Crk immunoblotting revealed that equal amounts of Crk were immunoprecipitated from unstimulated and insulin-stimulated samples. We next examined the ability of Cbl-b to form complexes with CAP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Previous studies have shown that the third SH3 domain of CAP (SH3C) is responsible for its interaction with c-Cbl (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Ribon V. Herrera R. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4073-4080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We overexpressed Myc-tagged CAP or CAPΔSH3C along with FLAG-tagged Cbl-b in cells, and evaluated the co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Cbl-b with Myc-CAP (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting of the cell lysates indicated that FLAG-Cbl-b and the two different Myc-CAP proteins were expressed at comparable levels. FLAG-Cbl-b was found to interact specifically with wild type CAP. However, deletion of the third SH3 domain in CAP completely abolished the coprecipitation of FLAG-Cbl-b. Similar results were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Cbl-b with Myc-CAP. These data indicate that Cbl-b and CAP are capable of forming complexes via an interaction between the third SH3 domain of CAP and the proline-rich region(s) of Cbl-b. APS Mediates the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cbl-b by the Insulin Receptor—APS is a Lnk family adaptor protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the insulin receptor (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Moodie S.A. Alleman-Sposeto J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11186-11193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosine 618 in APS is necessary for its association with c-Cbl and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl by the insulin receptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine whether APS also couples Cbl-b to the insulin receptor for phosphorylation, we expressed HA-tagged Cbl-b alone or with Myc-tagged APS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4). Following treatment of cells with or without insulin, comparable amounts of HA-Cbl-b were isolated by anti-HA immunoprecipitation. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting revealed no insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of HA-Cbl-b when expressed alone. Co-expression with Myc-APS dramatically increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of HA-Cbl-b in response to insulin. These results indicate that APS is capable of mediating Cbl-b tyrosine phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Previous studies have shown that tyrosines 700 and 774 are the two major residues in c-Cbl phosphorylated in response to insulin. Phosphorylation of these two sites in c-Cbl mediates its interaction with Crk. Cbl-b has tyrosines at 709 and 665 in its C-terminal region with flanking sequences that are homologous to Tyr700 and Tyr774 in c-Cbl, respectively (29Elly C. Witte S. Zhang Z. Rosnet O. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. Liu Y.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether the insulin receptor phosphorylates these two sites in Cbl-b, we generated a Cbl-b construct with both Tyr665 and Tyr709 mutated to phenylalanine. Compared with the wild type Cbl-b protein, the phosphorylation of the Y665F/Y709F mutant was profoundly decreased in response to insulin when Myc-APS was co-expressed (Fig. 4). Thus, tyrosines 665 and 709 are the major sites phosphorylated by the insulin receptor in the presence of APS. APS Promotes the Movement of Cbl Proteins to the Plasma Membrane in Response to Insulin—APS is constitutively localized at the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To assess the role of APS in the translocation of Cbl proteins to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation, FLAG-c-Cbl or HA-Cbl-b was expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the presence or absence of Myc-APS, followed by double immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5). Cells were treated with or without insulin, fixed, and incubated with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies that were later labeled with complementary fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. Consistent with our previous report, Myc-APS was localized at the plasma membrane independent of insulin treatment. Under basal conditions, FLAG-c-Cbl and HA-Cbl-b were both present throughout the cytoplasm regardless of co-expression of Myc-APS. Insulin stimulation did not significantly change this diffusive distribution of FLAG-c-Cbl and HA-Cbl-b when Myc-APS was not coexpressed. However, the co-expression of APS was found to cause a robust recruitment of c-Cbl and Cbl-b to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. A single Gly to Glu mutation in the TKB domain of Cbl-b prevented this membrane translocation induced by APS co-expression, whereas Y665F/Y709F double mutations had no effect. These results indicate that the interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated APS and the TKB domain of Cbl is crucial for the membrane translocation of Cbl and, further, that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl requires its translocation to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Homo- and Hetero-dimerization of Cbl-b and c-Cbl—It has been reported previously that c-Cbl forms homodimers through its C-terminal leucine zipper domain, and deletion of this domain decreases Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with the epidermal growth factor receptor (30Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because the leucine zipper domain is highly conserved between Cbl-b and c-Cbl, we tested whether Cbl-b would form heterodimers with c-Cbl in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cells were transfected with vector alone or HA-tagged c-Cbl. HA-c-Cbl was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the immune complexes were immunoblotted for the presence of endogenous Cbl-b. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, a protein of ∼120 kDa, which corresponds to the correct size of Cbl-b, was detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates from cells expressing HA-c-Cbl, whereas no Cbl-b could be detected in immunoprecipitates from vector-transfected cells. HA-c-Cbl was isolated only from cells expressing HA-c-Cbl. To examine whether endogenous Cbl proteins also heterodimerize, we immunoprecipitated c-Cbl and Cbl-b from lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the appropriate antibodies (Fig. 6B). As negative controls, immunoprecipitations were performed by using nonspecific immunoglobulins. Cbl-b was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with c-Cbl. Stimulation of cells with insulin did not influence this interaction. Reciprocally, c-Cbl was found to co-precipitate with Cbl-b when an antibody recognizing the N-terminal region of Cbl-b was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6C). However, no c-Cbl was detected in the Cbl-b immunoprecipitates when an antibody against the C-terminal region of Cbl-b was used. Immunoblotting showed that similar amounts of Cbl-b were isolated with both antibodies. Collectively, these results indicate that Cbl-b constitutively heterodimerizes with c-Cbl in vivo and, further, that this dimerization may involve the C-terminal region of Cbl-b. To examine the role of the leucine zipper domain in the heterodimerization of Cbl proteins, we generated a mutant of c-Cbl in which the leucine zipper domain was deleted from the full-length FLAG-tagged c-Cbl (FLAG-c-CblΔLZ). COS-1 cells were transfected with vector alone, FLAG-c-Cbl/wild type, FLAG-c-CblΔLZ, or FLAG-c-Cbl/1–700 in the presence of either HA-c-Cbl or HA-Cbl-b. As shown in Fig. 7A, all FLAG-c-Cbl proteins were expressed at comparable levels. Although FLAG-c-Cbl/wild type dimerized with both HA-tagged Cbl proteins, neither c-CblΔLZ nor c-Cbl/1–700 associated w"

Our results show that morphine inhibited anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated IFN-γ promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Chronic morphine treatment of T cells increased intracellular cAMP. To evaluate the role of cAMP in morphine's modulatory function, the effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin were investigated. Both dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin treatment inhibited IFN-γ promoter activity. Treatment with pertussis toxin, but not with a protein kinase A inhibitor, antagonized morphine's inhibitory effects. Morphine inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK; in addition, morphine treatment in the presence of either ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK inhibitor (PD98059 or SB203580) resulted in an additive inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity. The transcription factor activator protein-1, NF-κB, and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were negatively regulated by morphine. Overexpression of NF-κB p65 rescued the inhibitory effect of morphine on IFN-γ promoter activity. However, only when NFATc1 was co-overexpressed with c-fos was the inhibitory effect of morphine on IFN-γ promoter counteracted. The inhibitory effects of morphine were not observed in T cells obtained from μ-opioid receptor knockout mice, suggesting that morphine modulation of IFN-γ promoter activity is mediated through the μ-opioid receptor. In summary, our data indicate that morphine modulation of IFN-γ promoter activity is mediated through two distinct cAMP-dependent pathways, the NF-κB signaling pathway and the ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, AP-1/NFAT pathway.

Chronic opioid abusers have been known to experience higher incidence of infectious diseases. It is now well established that opioid use and abuse promotes human immunodeficiency virus infection and disease progression (1Risdahl J.M. Khanna K.V. Peterson P.K. Molitor T.W. J.

It is produced predominantly in activated T cells and large granular lymphocytes as well as natural killer cells (3Young H.A. Hardy K.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IFN-γ plays a central role in host resistance to infection, notably viral infection (4Reuben J.M. Lee B.N. Paul M. Kline M.W.

Previous studies, including our own, have shown that morphine use and abuse results in the inhibition of IFN-γ production and may explain why a higher incidence of human immunodeficiency virus and other viral infections is observed in the drug abuse population (5Wang J.

Although morphine's inhibitory effects on IFN-γ production are well known, the mechanisms by which morphine causes this suppressive effect have not been fully elucidated. In neuronal cells, morphine binds to a G protein-coupled μ-opioid receptor to induce analgesia (9Loh H.H. Smith A.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 123-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 10Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 607-624PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the μ-opioid receptor leads to regulation of several intracellular effectors, such as modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (11Yu V.C. Eiger S. Duan D.S. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1390-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a negative regulator of T cell activation. Increased intracellular cAMP concentration is known to inhibit T cell mitogenesis induced by various agonists, including alloantigen, interleukin-2, and anti-CD4 antibody (12Tamir A. Granot Y. Isakov N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1514-1522PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in cAMP result in inhibition of T cell receptor/CD3 plus CD28-mediated T cell activation and cytokine production and blockade of cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. Increased cAMP has also been shown to inhibit Ras activation and phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase downstream target, ERK1/2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase downstream target, protein kinase B (c-Akt). The signals that regulate cAMP levels after T cells encounter an antigen determine the functional fate toward clonal expansion or repression of primary T cell responses (13Grader-Beck T. Van Puijenbroek A.A. Nadler L.M. Boussiotis V.A. Blood. 2003; 101: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether morphine treatment of murine T cells results in increased adenylyl cyclase activity and a concomitant increase in cAMP levels. In addition, we investigated the role of cAMP and the MAPK pathways in morphine-induced inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity. Transcription factors AP-1, NFAT, and NF-κB are thought to play a major role in coordinating transcription of the IFN-γ gene (14Sweetser M.T. Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Weaver W.M. Price G.A. Wilson C.B. J.

DNA footprinting studies show that the AP-1 site at positions –196 to –183 contributes to IFN-γ expression induced by mitogens or treatment with interleukin-18 (17Barbulescu K.

Neurath M.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3642-3647PubMed Google Scholar), whereas NFAT and NF-κB proteins bind to positions –278 to –268 (19Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In addition, a composite NFAT/AP-1 site at position –160 serves as a CD28 response element for the IFN-γ gene (20Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4357-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The focus of this study was to investigate the signal transduction mechanisms involved in morphine-induced inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity. We first investigated whether morphine induced inhibition of IFN-γ synthesis is transcriptionally regulated. We next analyzed distinct elements within the IFN-γ promoter that are modulated by morphine treatment and whether overexpression of NF-κB p65, AP-1, NFATc1, and NFATc2 rescued the inhibitory effect of morphine on IFN-γ promoter activity. Our results suggest that morphine modulates ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation through a cAMP-dependent pathway and regulates the transcription of the IFN-γ gene via the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1/NFAT. Experimental Animals—μ-Opioid receptor knockout mice (Balb/c × C57BL/6 genetic background) were produced as previously described by Loh and co-workers (21Roy S. Barke R.A. Loh H.H. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, a XhoI/XbaI fragment, which spans the entire exons 2 and 3, was replaced with a Neor cassette followed by the ligation of a thymidine kinase expression cassette to the 3′-end of this segment. Wild type mice (CB6F1/J, Balb/c female × C57BL/6 male) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. A maximum of four mice were housed per cage. Food and tap water were available ad libitum. The animal housing facilities were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with constant temperature (72 ± 1 °F) and 50% humidity. Preparation of Spleen Leukocytes, Enrichment of T Lymphocytes, and Treatment with Various Concentrations of Morphine—Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. Spleens were removed aseptically, and single-cell suspensions were made by forcing the tissue through a cell strainer with a sterile syringe plunger. Erythrocytes were removed using a red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma), and the resulting spleen cell preparation was depleted of most B cells and macrophages by a single passage through a sterile nylon wool column (22Gunzer M. Weishaupt C. Planelles L. Grabbe S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 258: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nylon wool-nonadherent spleen cells, T-enriched cells, were used for all experiments described in this study. Splenic T lymphocytes were treated for 2 h in medium (RPMI plus 10% NCS) containing either vehicle (control) or various concentrations of morphine (1 nm to 10 μm; National Institute on Drug Abuse, Rockville, MD). Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (5 μg/ml; PharMingen) for varying periods, depending on the experiment. Three sets of experiments were performed, each in triplicate. Transfection and Detection of Luciferase Reporter Activity—In the transfection experiments involving primary lymphoid cells, murine splenic T lymphocytes were harvested and treated with concanavalin A (3 μg/ml) for 18 h prior to transfection to allow uptake of DNA. Splenic T cells (2 × 107) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of IFN-γ promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pIFN-538; generous gift from Dr. W. M. Weaver, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and 1 μg of control plasmid containing the pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) driving Renilla luciferase as an internal standard, in 0.8 ml of complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin) by electroporation (BTX, 300 V, 50 ms, and 1 pulse). In the co-transfection experiments, 5 μg of plasmid (NF-κB p65, c-fos, NFATc1, or NFATc2) was used. After electroporation, the cells were rested for 2 h and then stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml) or medium alone. In certain experiments, some cells were treated with morphine (10 nm to 10 μm) for 2 h prior to stimulation. Lysates were harvested at 6 h and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) with a luminometer (Turner TD20/20; Promega). Values are reported as relative light units after correction for transfection efficiency by normalization with Renilla luciferase, and the mean was calculated from the parallels. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Untreated or morphine-treated mouse splenic T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 60 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared from these cells using a nuclear extraction kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Extracts were frozen in dry ice and stored at –80 °C. Determination of protein concentration was performed using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Oligonucleotides were labeled, and the binding reactions were performed as described previously (23Roy S. Charboneau R. Cain K. DeTurris S. Melnyk D. Barke R.A. Surgery. 1999; 126: 239-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extract from control or morphine-treated lymphocytes was incubated with 32P-labeled probe in binding buffer at room temperature for 20 min. Bound complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer, dried, and autoradiographed overnight. Oligonucleotide sequences used are as follows: AP-1, 5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′; NF-κB, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG-3′; NFAT, 5′-CGC CCA AAG AGG AAA ATT TGT TTC ATA-3′. Western Blot Analysis of MAPK—Splenic T cells were serum-starved for 48 h and treated with morphine for 2 h before stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 lasted for 30 min. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture). After one freeze/thaw cycle, lysates were centrifuged. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. A quantity amounting to 5 μg of protein sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to an ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting. Incubating the membrane in Superblock (Pierce) for 1 h blocked nonspecific binding. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary Ab, total or active ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), or p38 MAPK (Bio-Source). The blots were washed three times with TBST buffer and then incubated for1hat room temperature with anti-rabbit secondary Ab conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Western blot analysis was conducted according to standard procedures using Supersignal Chemiluminescence Detection Substrate (Pierce). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis of c-fos and c-jun mRNA— Splenic T cells were treated with morphine or vehicle 2 h before stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Total RNA was extracted from treated cells by cell lysis in guanidinium isothiocyanate followed by phenol acid extraction. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed for 90 min at 42 °C with 200 units of superscript Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), using random hexamers. 5 μl of cDNA was used for each PCR, and amplification was performed with oligonucleotide primers specific for mouse c-fos, c-jun (Clontech), or β2-microglobulin (Oligos Etc.) as described previously (6Wang J. Charboneau R. Balasubramanian S. Barke R.A. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 527-536PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ and cAMP Immunoassay—Spleen T cells from each mouse were adjusted to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates and activated by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti CD28 (5 μg/ml). The microtiter plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Culture supernatant was analyzed using cytokine-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. They were analyzed statistically by the unpaired t test between two groups and analysis of variance (ANOVA) among multiple groups. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Direct Modulation of the IFN-γ Promoter Is Involved in the Repressive Effect of Morphine on IFN-γ Gene Expression and Protein Production—Our previous studies with murine splenic and lymph node lymphocytes have shown that morphine inhibited concanavalin A-induced IFN-γ production in vivo and in vitro (5Wang J. Charboneau R. Balasubramanian S. Barke R.A. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 782-790PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wang J. Charboneau R. Balasubramanian S. Barke R.A. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 527-536PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that morphine down-regulates anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-stimulated IFN-γ mRNA and protein expression. Splenic T cells were treated with morphine (100 nm and 10 μm) and then stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml). Our results show that morphine treatment resulted in a 35% (100 nm morphine treatment) and 75% (10 μm morphine treatment) reduction in IFN-γ message levels when compared with vehicle control in T cells derived from WT mice. This morphine effect was completely abolished in MORKO mice. These results suggest that morphine modulation of IFN-γ synthesis is trancriptionally regulated and is mediated through the μ-opioid receptor. (Fig. 1A). Experiments were also carried out to investigate the effect of morphine treatment on IFN-γ protein synthesis. Splenic T cells were treated with morphine for 2 h and then simulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Culture supernatant was assayed for IFN-γ protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results show that morphine inhibited IFN-γ protein production in a dose-dependent manner in splenic T cells derived from WT mice. This effect was absent in T cells harvested from MORKO mice (Fig. 1B). In order to determine whether one of the mechanisms of morphine's inhibition is a direct interference with the transcriptional activity of the IFN-γ promoter, we initially treated T cells with concanavalin A (3 μg/ml) for 18 h to facilitate DNA uptake and then transiently cotransfected splenic T cells with both pIFN-538 (full-length pIFN-538 promoter) and pRL-TK vector. After electroporation, the cells were rested for 2 h and then were treated with vehicle or various doses of morphine for 2 h. Cells were then stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml). Lysates were harvested at 6 h, assayed for firefly luciferase activity, and corrected for transfection efficiency by normalization with Renilla luciferase. Results show that anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-induced activation of the full-length IFN-γ promoter construct was significantly inhibited by morphine in a dose-dependent manner in T cells harvested from WT animals compared with vehicle control. Low dose morphine (10–100 nm) inhibited 30–50% of the IFN-γ promoter activity. High dose morphine (1 μm) inhibited up to 83% of the IFN-γ promoter activity. In contrast, this inhibitory effect of morphine was not observed in T cells harvested from MORKO mice (Fig. 2). Cyclic AMP, but Not PKA Is Involved in the Inhibitory Effect of Morphine on IFN-γ Promoter Activity—Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is the typical effector of the μ-opioid receptor. Acute stimulation of opioid receptors leads to inhibition of AC activity. Chronic stimulation of the μ-opioid receptor leads to AC supersensitization, which is completely abolished by pertussis toxin (PTX) pretreatment. Downstream of AC, cAMP also plays an important role in the physiology of opioid use and abuse. Although the role of AC supersensitization in the pathophysiology of drug dependence is well recognized, the intracellular signal transduction pathway responsible for the onset of immunosuppression is still unknown. In the present study, T-cells were treated with low and high doses of morphine for greater than 5 h and then stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Intracellular cAMP was then determined by immunoassay. Both low and high dose chronic morphine treatment resulted in a significant increase in intracellular cAMP in WT splenic T cells. This effect was abolished by PTX (Fig. 3A). To determine the potential involvement of an increase in cAMP in regard to the inhibition of IFN-γ, we used forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, to increase intracellular cAMP. As shown in Fig. 3B, forskolin treatment significantly inhibited IFN-γ production in WT splenic T cells, implicating cAMP in these effects. PTX completely abolished the inhibition of IFN-γ production by morphine but not that of forskolin. To investigate the involvement of the cAMP-PKA pathway in the inhibitory effect of morphine on IFN-γ promoter activity, we tested the effect of dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP), a cell-permeable cAMP analogue, on IFN-γ promoter activity and the ability of myristoylated protein kinase inhibitor amide (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), a selective cell-permeable PKA inhibitor, to overcome the inhibitory effect of morphine. Bt2cAMP (0.1–10 μm) added to the cultures strongly inhibited IFN-γ promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). However, the addition of the PKA inhibitor (1 μg/ml) did not alter morphine-induced inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity (Fig. 3D). Mentioned previously, cAMP is a negative regulator of T cell activation, as made evident by previous studies demonstrating that cAMP inhibits T lymphocyte activation, and is associated with down-regulation of two parallel MAPK pathways (12Tamir A. Granot Y. Isakov N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1514-1522PubMed Google Scholar). Our current studies expand these findings by suggesting that morphine inhibits IFN-γ promoter activity through a cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent pathway. ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK Pathways Are Involved in the Modulation of the IFN-γ Promoter by Morphine—To determine whether ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways are involved in the signal transduction mechanisms by which the μ-opioid receptor modulates the IFN-γ promoter, the effects of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK inhibitors (PD98059 and SB20358) on IFN-γ promoter activity were investigated. Low dose SB20358 (1 μm) or PD98059 (2 μm) was sufficient to inhibit ∼50% of the IFN-γ promoter activity stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. The addition of 100 nm morphine to SB20358-treated splenic T cells inhibited the IFN-γ promoter activity by 75%, and PD98059-treated splenic T cells inhibited the IFN-γ promoter activity by 74.6%. Morphine in the presence of either PD98059 or SB203580 resulted in an additive inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity (Fig. 4A). Likewise, low dose SB20358 (1 μm) or PD98059 (2 μm) treatment also inhibited IFN-γ protein production stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. The addition of 100 nm morphine to SB20358- or PD98059-treated T cells resulted in an additive inhibition of IFN-γ protein production (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK may represent potential intracellular pathways by which morphine negatively regulates IFN-γ promoter activity. To further determine the potential involvement of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK cascades in the negative regulation of IFN-γ promoter activity by morphine, the effects of morphine on p38 and ERK1/2 activity were analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, p38 phosphorylation levels were significantly decreased in morphine-treated splenic T cells derived from WT mice. This effect was not observed in T cells derived from MORKO mice. Chronic treatment with morphine also resulted in significant inhibition of ERK1/2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 phosphorylation in T cells derived from WT mice (Fig. 5B). Morphine Decreases Nuclear Expression of c-fos and c-jun— The downstream targets of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in the nucleus are ELK-1 and ATF, which activate c-fos and c-jun. To address the question of whether c-fos and c-jun act as the nuclear mediators, mediating the inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity induced by morphine, the relative levels of c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression were measured by reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, morphine induced a dose-dependent decrease in c-fos and c-jun mRNA. These results suggest that c-fos and c-jun may act as the transcriptional factors that link the intermediary signals from ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK to the IFN-γ promoter. Morphine Down-regulates AP-1, NF-κB, NFAT, and Overexpression of NF-κB p65, and Co-overexpression of NFATc1 with c-fos Rescues the Inhibitory Effect of Morphine on IFN-γ Promoter Activity—To investigate whether the effect of morphine on IFN-γ transcription is the result of a decrease in DNA-protein binding to cognate DNA elements, we next evaluated the effect of morphine on nuclear protein binding to several regulatory elements in the IFN-γ promoter, including AP-1, NF-κB, and NFAT. DNA binding and transcriptional activities were determined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The current study showed that the binding activities of AP-1, NF-κB, and NFAT were down-regulated by morphine (Fig. 7A). To further determine whether these transcriptional factors were directly involved in the inhibitory effect of morphine on the IFN-γ promoter, we co-transfected NFATc1, NFATc2, NF-κB p65, and c-fos expression plasmids with IFN-γ promoter ligated to firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 7B, overexpression of NF-κB p65, NFATc1, NFATc2, or c-fos significantly increased anti-CD3/anti-CD28-induced IFN-γ promoter activity. Overexpression of NF-κB p65 significantly rescued morphine-induced inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity. Overexpression of NFATc1, NFATc2, or c-fos alone did not rescue morphine's effect. However, it was interesting to observe that co-overexpression of c-fos with NFATc1 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of morphine on IFN-γ promoter activity (Fig. 7, B and C). Overexpression of NF-κB p65 Reverses the Inhibitory Effect of Bt2cAMP on IFN-γ Promoter Activity—To address the question of whether a cAMP-dependent NF-κB pathway was involved in the inhibitory effect of morphine on IFN-γ promoter activity, we investigated the effect of NF-κB overexpression on Bt2cAMP-induced IFN-γ promoter activity. As illustrated in Fig. 8, NF-κB p65 overexpression rescued the inhibition of IFN-γ promoter activity induced by Bt2cAMP. In this study, we report that morphine inhibits the transcriptional activity of the IFN-γ promoter, mapped some of the responsive elements, and examined molecular events and signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of IFN-γ production by morphine following anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 activation. Our results indicate that morphine can directly modulate the IFN-γ promoter and alter IFN-γ gene expression and protein synthesis. AC is the typical effector of the μ-opioid receptor. Acute stimulation of opioid receptors leads to inhibition of AC activity. Chronic stimulation of the μ-opioid receptor leads to AC supersensitization, and PTX pretreatment completely abolishes AC supersensitization. Downstream from AC, cAMP has been shown to play an important role in the physiology of opioid use and abuse. Although the role of AC supersensitization in the pathophysiology of drug dependence is well recognized, the intracellular signal transduction pathway responsible for the onset of immunosuppression is still unknown (24Nestler E.J. Aghajanian G.K. Science. 1997; 278: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway in response to chronic opiate administration was first demonstrated in neuroblastoma × glioma cells in culture (25Sharma S.K. Klee W.A. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and later shown to occur in specific brain regions in vivo (26Nestler E.J. Tallman J.F. Mol.

Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that can modulate the activity of several transcription factors.

SHP is rapidly induced within 2 h following treatment of mice with ethynylestradiol (EE) or the estrogen receptor α (ERα)-selective compound propyl pyrazole triol (PPT). SHP induction by these estrogens is completely absent in ERαKO mice.

This ERα binding site overlaps the known farnesoid X receptor (FXR) binding site in the SHP promoter, and the combination of EE plus FXR agonists did not produce an additive induction of SHP expression in mice.

Estrogens exert biological effects in numerous organs throughout the body. The role of estrogens in reproductive biology, the prevention of postmenopausal hot flushes, and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis are well established (1Belchetz P.E. N. Engl. J.

Estrogens may also inhibit the development of colon cancer (5Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative, IJAMA. 2002; 288: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14155) Google Scholar), inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease (6Kawas C.

Treat. 2000; 60: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The multitude of estrogen responses matches the widespread distribution of estrogen receptors (ERs) throughout numerous organs, with ERα expression the highest in uterus, pituitary, kidney, and adrenal gland and ERβ expression highest in ovary, uterus, bladder, and lung (9Kuiper G.G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). Although many of these actions of estrogens are due to the classic signaling pathway in which an ER binds to an estrogen response element in the promoter of a gene (10Gruber C.J. Tschugguel W. Schneeberger C. Huber J.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 340-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), it is now clear that many actions of estrogens are mediated by interaction of ER with other signaling pathways. For example, estrogens inhibit chronic and acute liver inflammation in the mouse by a mechanism that does not require ER activation of gene expression (11Evans M.J. Lai K. Shaw L.J. Harnish D.C. Chadwick C.C. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Evans M.J. Eckert A. Lai K. Adelman S.J. Harnish D.C. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This in vivo activity of ER correlates with the in vitro ability of ER to inhibit NFκB signaling (13Pottratz S.T. Bellido T. Mocharla H. Crabb D. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), likely through a coactivator competition mechanism (15Harnish D.C. Scicchitano M.S. Adelman S.J. Lyttle C.R. Karathanasis S.K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, ER can regulate gene expression via interaction with AP-1 response elements (16Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). An additional mechanism by which ER could influence diverse signaling pathways is by altering expression levels of other transcription factors. For example, estrogen treatment induces expression of STAT5A in both the kidney (17Jelinsky S.A. Harris H.A. Brown E.L. Flanagan K. Zhang X. Tunkey C. Lai K. Lane M.V. Simcoe D.K. Evans M.J.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, recent microarray studies have demonstrated that chronic treatment with estrogens induces expression of the orphan short heterodimer partner (SHP) receptor in the mouse liver (11Evans M.J.

Nevertheless, regulation of SHP expression has the potential to influence a wide array of physiological processes. Estrogen regulation of SHP expression might thus contribute to many facets of estrogen biology. However, previous studies have not differentiated between a direct induction of SHP expression by estrogens and an indirect induction of SHP as a secondary consequence of prolonged treatment with estrogens. To discern between these two possibilities, both in vivo kinetic studies and in vitro transfection studies were used here to characterize estrogen regulation of SHP expression. The results indicate that ERα directly stimulates expression of the SHP gene.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), and ERαCHERβ knockout mice (developed at Wyeth (36Shughrue P.J. Askew G.R. Dellovade T.L. Merchenthaler I. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), all on a 129 background, were bred and ovariectomized at Wyeth. All animals were fed a casein-based diet (#8117, Test Diet, Richmond, IN) unless otherwise specified. All compounds tested were synthesized at Wyeth. Compounds given as daily subcutaneous injections were administered in 0.1 ml of 1:1 dimethyl sulfoxide/phosphate-buffered saline or 0.1 ml of 90% corn oil/10% ethanol. Compounds given orally by gavage were administered in 0.1 ml of 0.5% methylcellulose, 2% Tween 80. Compounds given orally in feed were added to the casein diet ground to a powder by mixing. For 5-day treatment studies, cholic acid (CA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the ground casein diet. For 5-week cholic acid feeding studies, mice were fed a commercial high fat diet containing 0.5% CA (#21539, Purina, Richmond, IN). Animals were euthanized 2 h after the final treatment, generally 4 h after commencement of the light cycle. For kinetic studies, animals were treated at ∼7:30 a.m. and euthanized at various times throughout the day. For cycling studies, CD-1 strain young adult female mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were assessed daily by vaginal smear for two complete cycles before use. All animals were euthanized at midday between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. during the third cycle, with livers removed for RNA analysis. All treatments were in accord with accepted standards of care as specified by the Wyeth animal care committee. RNA Analysis—RNA was prepared from frozen organs or from cultured cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and was treated with DNase to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Following repurification by RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 100 ng of total RNA was assayed for gene expression by real time reverse transcription-PCR as previously described (12Evans M.J. Eckert A. Lai K. Adelman S.J. Harnish D.C. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using the primers and 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled probes listed in Table I. GAPDH expression was monitored using standard rodent and human assay kits (#4308313 and #402869, respectively, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance on log-transformed data using Huber weighting.Table IPrimers used for real-time PCR quantification of mRNA levelsSpeciesGeneForward primerReverse primerProbeHumanICAM-1GCAGACAGTGACCATCTACAGCTTCTTCTGAGACCTCTGCCTTCGTCCGGCGCCCAACGTGATTCTHumanSHPAACTGCCAGACAGACCCCAGAAGGACTCCAGACAGCATTGAAGCCTCCCTGGCTGCGGTGCAMouseCYP3A11AGGATGAGATCGATGAGGCTCTTCCAGGTATTCCATCTCCATCACCCAACAAGGCACCTCCCACGTATGATMouseCYP7A1AGACCTCCGGGCCTTCCTATCACTCGGTAGCAGAAGGCATAATCAAAGAGCGCTGTCTGGGTCACGMouseCYP8B1TTCGACTTCAAGCTGGTCGACAAAGCCCCAGCGCCTCGACATACCTGTGCCCCCCATTGAMouseInositol Phosphate SynthaseCCCACGAACCACATGCTATTAGCCACCTCTCCTGGCTTGATGTGGGCCTGGACGCTCCATCTTGTMouseIntestinal Trefoil FactorTCTGTCACATCGGAGCAGTGTAAAAGCACCAGGGCACATTTGCCGTGGCTGCTGCTTTGACTCCAMouseProstaglandin D SynthaseGGTCTCTTGGGATTCCCACAGCCCCAGGAACTTGTCTTGTTCCAGGGCCATGACACAGTGCAGCMouseSHPCAGGCACCCTTCTGGTAGATCTTGTCTTCAAGGAGTTCAGTGATGTCTCTTCCGCCCTATCATGGGAGACGTMouseSTATSAGCTCAGCGCCCACTTCAGACTCTGCACCACGCCTGTTGTCACTGAAAAGAATCAAGCGCGCCMouseTFACCTGGGCCTATGAAGCAAAGTTGGTCTCCGTCTCCATGAATCCTCTCTGTCCCACGGAGGAACTCARatSHPCCTGGAGGAGCCCTCGTAACACTGTATGCAAACCGAGGATCAGCCCCACCCCCAGCTTG Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) or Hep89 cells (37Harnish D.C.

For cycloheximide studies, Hep89 cells plated in deficient growth media (maintenance media without phenol red and supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum) were grown to 80% confluence. The cells were treated overnight with deficient growth medium containing 1 nm ICI182780 to minimize residual estrogenic activity in the medium. The following day, the medium was supplemented with Me2SO vehicle or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the medium was further supplemented with Me2SO vehicle or 30 nm 17β-estradiol (E2). After incubation for a final 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested for RNA preparation using TRIzol reagent. Plasmids—A 1.4-kb region of the human SHP promoter spanning –1383 to +19 was obtained through PCR amplification using 5′-TGAGAAAGATGCCCGGGACAGA-3′ forward and 5′-GGGCTCGAGCCCCTGGTTGGCTGGTGCTCA-3′ reverse oligonucleotides with the human BAC clone RP11-285H13 (#MB11201, Invitrogen) as a template. This fragment was then digested with NheI and XhoI and cloned into the luciferase reporter gene pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Each of the human SHP promoter mutations used in this study were created by PCR amplifications using the –1383 SHP promoter as template followed by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligation into pGL3-Basic. Transfections—HepG2 cells were seeded into 24-well plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a density of 150,000 cells/well in deficient growth media. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 250 ng of SHP reporter construct, 30 ng of ER expression plasmid, and 100 ng of M19 β-galactosidase control expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Six hours later, the cells were treated with Me2SO vehicle or 10 nm E2. Cell lysates in 1× lysis buffer (Promega) were prepared 16 h later and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase (Tropix, Bedford, MD) assay systems. The normalized luciferase expression level of the pGL3-Basic plasmid lacking any promoter was defined as 1.0. All values reported are the mean of multiple independent assays. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by incubation of baculovirus-expressed human ERα (Panvera, Madison, WI) with 32P-labeled DNA probe containing the SHP –309/ –267 region followed by electrophoresis in low ionic strength polyacrylamide gels as described previously (37Harnish D.C. Evans M.J. Scicchitano M.S. Bhat R.A. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9270-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently we have demonstrated that treatment of ovariectomized mice with estrogens for 5 days induces expression of SHP in the liver (11Evans M.J. Lai K. Shaw L.J. Harnish D.C. Chadwick C.C. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This induction by chronic estrogen treatment could be mediated either through a direct induction of SHP expression by ER, or through a secondary response subsequent to some other action of estrogen treatment. To delineate between these possibilities, expression of SHP and several other estrogen-regulated genes was determined at various times following treatment of ovariectomized mice with ethynylestradiol (EE) or the ERα-selective agonist 4-propyl-1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazole (PPT). Of the known estrogen-responsive genes in the liver, SHP induction was the most rapid, with peak increases in SHP mRNA levels occurring 2 h after estrogen treatment (Fig. 1A). The STAT5A gene also responded rapidly, with a peak induction at 4 h. Three other known estrogen-responsive genes, prostaglandin D synthase (PgD syn), inositol-1-phosphate synthase (IPS), and intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) all showed significantly slower induction kinetics than either SHP or STAT5A. The induction kinetics of SHP and STAT5A in the liver was equivalent to those seen for several genes, including STAT5A and tissue factor in the kidney (Fig. 1B), suggesting these genes are directly responsive to circulating estrogen levels. Finally, identical rapid kinetics for SHP induction occurred following the oral administration of either EE or GW4064 (Fig. 1C), an FXR agonist that directly activates the SHP promoter. These results together suggest that induction of SHP expression is a primary effect of treatment with estrogens. Synthetic estrogens have been reported to act as human pregnane X receptor agonists (38Desai P.B. Nallani S.C. Sane R.S. Moore L.B. Goodwin B.J. Buckley D.J. Buckley A.R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, neither EE nor PPT induced expression of CYP3A11, a sensitive marker for pregnane X receptor activation (39Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), at any time point (Fig. 1A). To verify that SHP induction was mediated through ERα, ovariectomized wild type mice or ERαKOCH mice were treated with EE, EE plus the antagonist ICI182780, or PPT (Fig. 2). Induction of SHP expression by EE was inhibited by ICI182780, and neither EE nor PPT treatment induced SHP expression in the ERαKOCH mouse. Similar results were obtained for the STAT5A, PgD syn, and IPS genes. However, the ITF gene remained responsive to EE and PPT induction in the ERαKOCH mouse. This induction of ITF in the ERαKOCH mouse could be blocked by ICI182780 (not shown) and is likely mediated by the aberrantly spliced ERα transcripts that are found in the ERaKOCH mouse, as has been described for genes in several other tissues (40Pendaries C. Darblade B. Rochaix P. Krust A. Chambon P. Korach K.S. Bayard F. Arnal J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2205-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Couse J.F. Curtis S.W. Washburn T.F. Lindzey J. Golding T.S. Lubahn D.B. Smithies O. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1441-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic treatment of mice with 17β-estradiol (E2) induced SHP expression in WT and ERβKO mice but not in either ERαKOCH or ERαERβKO mice (Fig. 2B). Together, the induction of SHP expression by the ERα-selective agonist PPT and the lack of induction of SHP by estrogens in the ERαKOCH mouse suggest that ERα is responsible for the direct induction of SHP expression. Finally, the ability of ERα to induce expression of SHP was not limited to the mouse, because both EE and PPT induced expression of SHP in the rat (Fig. 3).Fig. 3ERα regulates SHP expression in the rat. Ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were treated by daily subcutaneous injection of vehicle, 10 μg/kg E2, or 5 mg/kg PPT for 6 weeks. Livers were removed 2 h following the last treatment and expression of SHP was quantified by real-time PCR with GAPDH expression used for normalization. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E., with the mean expression value in wild type animals treated with vehicle defined as 1.0. *, p < 0.01 for comparison to vehicle-treated wild type animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In these studies, the magnitude of gene induction by PPT was consistently greater than the magnitude of induction by EE. To determine whether this represented a fundamental difference between PPT, which activates only ERα, and EE, which activates both ERα and ERβ, ovariectomized mice were treated with increasing amounts of either EE or PPT. Both EE and PPT produced very similar dose response curves for induction of SHP (Fig. 4A). The previous differences in the magnitude of SHP induction by PPT as compared with EE reflect simply the dose of compound administered. Approximately 10-fold higher concentrations of PPT than of EE are required to produce the same degree of activation of a synthetic reporter construct in vitro (42Kraichely D.M. Sun J. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the dose-response curves of EE and PPT induction of genes such as STAT5A, PgD syn, and IPS show the expected 10-fold shift. In contrast, the ED50 of PPT for SHP induction was ∼100-fold higher than the ED50 of EE for SHP induction. This may suggest that the mechanism of ERα induction of SHP expression is different from the mechanism of ERα induction of these other genes. The high sensitivity of SHP to induction by EE suggested that SHP expression could be regulated by natural fluctuations in estrogen levels. In the mouse, plasma E2 levels are typically about 3-fold higher at proestrus than at estrus (43Walmer D.K. Wrona M.A. Hughes C.L. Nelson K.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 44Bergman M.D. Schachter B.S. Karelus K. Combatsiaris E.P. Garcia T. Nelson J.F. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In concordance with these levels, mice at proestrus had 4-fold higher levels of liver SHP mRNA than did mice at estrus (Fig. 4B). Thus SHP expression is not only regulated by exogenous administration of estrogens but is also regulated by natural fluctuations of estrogen levels. To determine whether E2 regulation of SHP gene expression also occurs in human hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, which have lost the ability to express ERα, or Hep89, a derivative of HepG2 cells engineered to constitutively express ERα (37Harnish D.C. Evans M.J. Scicchitano M.S. Bhat R.A. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9270-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), were treated with E2. No regulation of SHP mRNA levels occurred in the HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A). SHP mRNA was constitutively elevated in the Hep89 cells relative to the HepG2 cells. Treatment of Hep89 cells with E2 stimulated SHP expression, whereas treatment with ICI182780 reduced SHP expression to the level found in HepG2 cells and also blocked E2 stimulation of SHP expression. To verify that the stimulation seen in Hep89 cells was due to ERα, HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with a plasmid containing 1383 bp of the human SHP promoter (45Lee H.K. Lee Y.K. Park S.H. Kim Y.S. Lee J.W. Kwon H.B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14398-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) driving expression of a luciferase reporter gene along with either an empty expression vector or an ERα expression vector. Treatment with E2 or PPT induced SHP promoter activity only in the cells cotransfected with ERα (Fig. 5B). Although the rapid induction of SHP by ERα in vivo suggested a direct activation of the SHP promoter, this was directly confirmed by monitoring the ability of E2 to induce SHP expression in cells treated with cycloheximide. Cycloheximide treatment of Hep89 cells itself increased SHP expression levels, as has been seen in HepG2 cells for at least one other estrogen-regulated gene, the proteinase inhibitor 9 gene (46Kanamori H. Krieg S. Mao C. Di Pippo V.A. Wang S. Zajchowski D.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5867-5873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the presence of cycloheximide, E2 treatment still resulted in a further augmentation of SHP expression (Fig. 5C). As a control for inhibition of protein synthesis, treatment of Hep89 cells with cycloheximide induced expression of ICAM-1, a known effect of cycloheximide inhibition of translation of the short-lived IκB protein (47Ghersa P. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Whelan J. DeLamarter J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19226-19232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, ERα induction of SHP promoter activity required an intact DNA binding domain. Cotransfection of an expression plasmid encoding an ERα protein with the DNA binding specificity altered to that of the glucocorticoid receptor failed to activate the SHP promoter following E2 treatment (Fig. 5D), although this chimeric receptor did activate a glucocorticoid resp"

We have shown previously that Itk is regulated by an activating transphosphorylation event in which Tyr-511 in the kinase domain is phosphorylated by Lck (Heyeck, S. D., Wilcox, H. M., Bunnell, S. C., and Berg, L. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 25401–25408). In this study, we present evidence for another mode of regulation for Itk, the autophosphorylation of Tyr-180 in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. To investigate the role of Itk trans- and autophosphorylation in T cell signaling, a retroviral transduction system was used to introduce different versions of Itk into Itk-deficient primary T cells. We report that Itk mutated at either the trans- or the autophosphorylation site is unable to fully restore cytokine production and ERK activation in the Itk-deficient cells; Itk-Y511F is severely defective, whereas Itk-Y180F has partial activity. Because phosphorylation at Tyr-180 is predicted to interfere with ligand binding by the SH3 domain, an SH3 point mutant that cannot bind ligand was also examined and found to be unable to restore function to the Itk–/– cells. These data provide new insights into the complex regulation of Itk in primary T cells.

Genetic and biochemical studies over the last decade have provided a great deal of information about the roles of these kinases in T cell activation, including their mechanisms of regulation and activation and their downstream targets (1Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Studies in wild type and mutant Jurkat T cell lines have indicated that the Tec family tyrosine kinase, Itk, is downstream of both Lck and ZAP-70 and is dependent on both; cell lines that lack either Lck or ZAP-70 fail to phosphorylate Itk in response to TCR ligation (2Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar, 3Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29323-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Itk is not a substrate of ZAP-70 but is instead dependent on ZAP-70-mediated LAT phosphorylation for its recruitment to the signaling complex (4Shan X. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29323-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). There, Itk serves as a direct substrate of Lck, which activates Itk through phosphorylation of the conserved activation loop tyrosine Tyr-511 (3Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A mutant version of Itk that lacks this tyrosine is incapable of either auto- or transphosphorylation when expressed in an insect cell expression system, suggesting that phosphorylation of this site is critical to the catalytic activity of Itk. One of the most important substrates of tyrosine kinases in lymphocytes is phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1). PLC-γ1 plays a critical role in transmitting signals generated at the cell surface through its hydrolysis of phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the cell surface into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). These second messengers mediate the elevation in intracellular calcium and the activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway that ultimately result in cytokine production and proliferation of the activated T cell. There is now a great deal of evidence that Tec family kinases play a key role in the activation of phospholipase C-γ in lymphocytes. In T cells from Itk-deficient mice, stimulation through the TCR results in only low level PLC-γ1 phosphorylation and commensurately lower calcium mobilization and ERK activation (6Liu K.Q.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similar signaling defects have been described in Btk-deficient human, chicken, and mouse B cells (8Takata M. Kurosaki T. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and mice deficient in PLC-γ2 have a phenotype nearly identical to mice deficient in Btk (11Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C.

Although the functional consequences of an Itk deficiency in T cells has been extensively studied, the mechanisms by which Itk acts in the cell are less well understood. Regulation of the kinase is complex, involving changes in subcellular localization, interactions with other signaling molecules including those of the LAT signaling complex, and an activating transphosphorylation event (reviewed in Ref. 12Schaeffer E.M. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally, structural studies have revealed that the protein binding domains of Itk can interact with one another both intra- and intermolecularly (13Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14Brazin K.N. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that conformational changes may also modulate the activity of Itk, perhaps by regulating the availability of the protein binding domains of Itk for external interactions. Another potential mode of regulation for Itk is autophosphorylation. In B cells, transphosphorylation of the Tec kinase Btk by a Src family kinase is followed by Btk autophosphorylation of Tyr-223 in the SH3 domain (15Nisitani S. Satterthwaite A.B. Akashi K.

Rawlings D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11526-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The position of this tyrosine is intriguing as it lies within the substrate binding groove of the SH3 domain, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site might affect protein-protein interactions. A number of groups have assessed the functionality of Btk mutated at Tyr-223, but the role of phosphorylation at this site remains unclear. In one study, mutation of Tyr-223 to phenylalanine (Btk-Y223F) potentiated the ability of a Btk variant to transform fibroblasts, suggesting that the mutation had an activating effect on Btk (16Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In other systems, though, Btk-Y223F has been found to be partially to severely functionally defective (18Kurosaki T. Kurosaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15595-15598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Tyr-223 in Btk is a conserved residue in many SH3 domains, including that of Itk, although it has not been identified as a site of phosphorylation in other families. Based on structural studies, phosphorylation at this site is predicted to be incompatible with SH3 ligand binding in either Itk or Btk (13Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Hansson H. Mattsson P.T. Allard P. Haapaniemi P. Vihinen M. Smith C.I. Hard T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2912-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For this reason, the effect of phosphorylation on protein function is likely dependent on the role played by the SH3 domain. In the case of Btk and Itk, important differences have been described in both the structures and modes of regulation of the two kinases in this region. The SH3 domains of Itk and Btk have only 51% sequence identity, and it has been reported that the Btk SH3 backbone conformation is more similar to that of Fyn or c-Src than to that of Itk (20Hansson H. Mattsson P.T. Allard P. Haapaniemi P. Vihinen M. Smith C.I. Hard T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2912-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, structural analyses of the adjacent Tec homology (TH) and SH3 regions of Btk and Itk indicate that the two proteins self-associate in distinct intramolecular and intermolecular conformations, suggesting unique modes of regulation (13Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Hansson H. Mattsson P.T. Allard P. Haapaniemi P. Vihinen M. Smith C.I. Hard T.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, we use an insect cell expression system to demonstrate that Lck-activated Itk autophosphorylates at Tyr-180 in the SH3 domain, homologous to Btk Tyr-223. Mutation of this site results in a catalytically active protein when expressed in insect cells; Itk-Y180F is capable of both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cellular proteins. By coexpressing PLC-γ1 with different versions of Itk in insect cells, we show that mutation of the transphosphorylation site in Itk, but not the autophosphorylation site, results in a protein incapable of phosphorylating PLC-γ1 in this system. To evaluate the effects of Itk trans- and autophosphorylation events in T cell signaling, we developed a system in which variants of Itk are introduced into Itk-deficient primary CD4+ T cells using a retroviral vector, and the functional consequences assessed. We show that the transphosphorylation site in Itk, Tyr-511, is essential for the activity of the protein in primary T cells, as expression of Itk-Y511F in Itk–/– T cells does not restore functionality to the cells. Expression of Itk mutated at the autophosphorylation site, Tyr-180, results in a partial restoration of the signaling pathways defective in the mutant cells, indicating that this site plays a non-essential but positive role in Itk signaling. Finally, to assess the role of the SH3 domain in Itk signaling, we examined a second SH3 domain point mutant, Itk-W208K, that is unable to bind proline motif-containing ligands in vitro (23Bunnell S.C.

In this study we show that Itk-W208K is catalytically active and capable of both auto- and transphosphorylation when expressed in insect cells. However, this mutant is severely defective when expressed in vivo and is unable to functionally reconstitute Itk–/– T cells. Sf9 Insect Cell Baculovirus Expression System—Sf9 insect cells were obtained from Pharmingen and grown in TNM medium (Pharmingen) as adherent cultures. Baculoviruses encoding Itk, Lck, Itk-K390R, and Itk-Y511F have been described previously (3Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Itk-Y180F and Itk-W208K were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into the Fastbac1 vector (Invitrogen). cDNA encoding rat PLC-γ1 in a pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) vector was a gift of Dr. Sue Goo Rhee (National Institutes of Health). The gene was excised as a BamHI fragment and cloned into Fastbac1. Cells were infected, harvested, and lysed as described previously (3Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Immune Complex Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24Bunnell S.C. Henry P.A. Kolluri R. Kirchhausen T. Rickles R.J. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25646-25656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Anti-Itk mAbs 2F12 and 10B2 were generated as described previously (3Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25401-25408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A combination of five anti-PLC-γ1 mAbs was purchased from Upstate Biotech, Inc. Anti-pY783 PLC-γ1 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Biosource. The anti-Btk phosphospecific antibodies 4F10 and 8D11 were a kind gift of Dr. Matthew Wahl and Dr. Owen Witte of UCLA. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was a kind gift of Dr. Brian Druker of Oregon Health & Science University. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. For in vitro immune complex kinase assays, Itk samples were immunoprecipitated and washed several times in lysis buffer, followed by a rinse in wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). Immunoprecipitates were then incubated at 37 °C for 25 min in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2,10mm MgCl2,20 μm cold rATP, and 12.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS loading dye, and the samples were boiled and loaded onto an SDS gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and either exposed to film overnight for 32P detection or subjected to immunoblot analysis. Mice—Itk-deficient mice were made by targeted gene disruption (6Liu K.Q. Bunnell S.C. Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The mice were backcrossed (nine generations) onto a C57/BL6 background. A subset of experiments was performed on incompletely backcrossed mice whose genetic background was a mix of 129 and C57/BL6, and the results of these experiments were indistinguishable from those performed on more completely backcrossed mice. Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities and sacrificed for cell harvesting between six and eight weeks of age. Cell Fractionation and Expansion—Lymph nodes were isolated from 6–8 week-old mice. Lymphocytes were separated from stroma by filtration and washed multiple times in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with HEPES and 3% fetal calf serum. CD8+ T cells were removed by complement-mediated lysis (anti-CD8 IgM mAb ascites, clone 3.155, and rabbit complement; Cedarlane) followed by removal of dead cells and red blood cells using a Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane) density gradient. Cells were then washed multiple times and stimulated in complete RPMI-10 medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, HEPES, pen-strep, glutamine, and β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 2.5 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 0.375 mm ionomycin at 5 × 105 cells/ml. After 24–48 h, cells were spun down and resuspended in complete RPMI-10 supplemented with 5 ng/ml recombinant IL-2 (Pharmingen). Cells were then cultured an additional 8–12 days, and cell density was maintained between 5 × 105 and 2 × 106 cells/ml. Experiments were performed between days 10 and 14 following stimulation. For some experiments, cells were restimulated between days 12 and 14 with PMA and ionomycin (as before) and expanded for an additional 8–12 days prior to their use. Retrovirus Production—The retroviral mouse stem cell virus vector, MSCV2.2-IRES-GFP, was a gift from Bill Sha (University of California at Berkeley) and has been described previously (25Ouyang W. Ranganath S.H. Weindel K. Bhattacharya D. Murphy T.L. Sha W.C. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 26Hawley R.G. Fong A.Z. Burns B.F. Hawley T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Itk and Itk variants were cloned into the vector as NotI or ClaI fragments and screened for correct orientation. The Phoenix-E retroviral packaging cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and the cells were grown in complete RPMI-10 medium. For transfections, 2 × 106 cells were plated per each 100-mm culture dish 8–14 h prior to transfection (∼50% confluence). Transfections were performed using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The manufacturer's protocol was used but was scaled for use in 100-mm plates as follows. 10 μg of DNA and 15 μl of FuGENE were used per plate, and the mixture was added to the plates in 500 μl of Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). After 6–14 h in transfection medium, the supernatant was aspirated and replaced with complete RPMI-10 (6 ml/plate). ∼24 h after initiation of transfection, the plates were moved from a 37 °C incubator to a 32 °C incubator to minimize the breakdown of the produced virus. Viral supernatants were collected every 48 h and replaced with fresh medium. Supernatants were harvested repeatedly until the cells died (typically four to five harvests). After collection, supernatants from duplicate plates were pooled, spun down to remove cell debris, quick frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Transfection rates of the Phoenix-E cells were typically 65–90%. Retroviral Infection and Expansion of T Cell Lines—CD4+ T cell lines were generated as described above. 48 h after initial stimulation, the cells were collected, counted, and aliquoted for infection with different viruses. Generally, 106 cells were infected with each virus. In each experiment, samples of Itk+/+ and Itk–/– cells were left uninfected or infected with virus containing vector alone (GFP, but no Itk gene). A sample of Itk–/– cells infected with wild type Itk virus was always included as a control. Viral supernatants were thawed immediately before use. To infect 106 cells, the following viral mixture was made: 2 ml of viral supernatant, 60 μl of fetal calf serum, 40 μl of IL-2 supernatant, and 16 μg of Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). The mixture was mixed thoroughly and allowed to sit at room temperature for 60 min before it was added to cells. Cells were resuspended in the mixture, plated out in 6-well dishes (35 mm), spun at 2000 rpm for 45 min at 25 °C, and incubated for 6 h to overnight at 37 °C. After this period, the cells were collected, spun down, and the infection repeated with fresh viral mixture. After an additional 6 h to overnight, the cells were collected, spun down, and resuspended at 5 × 105/ml in normal IL-2-containing medium. Cell Sorting for CD4 + GFP + Cells—3–4 days after retroviral infection, cultured cells were collected, stained with anti-CD4-PE (Pharmingen), and sorted for GFP and CD4 on a FACSVantage (Flow Cytometry Facility, University of Massachusetts Medical School). Typically, cells were 85–95% CD4+ and 10–50% GFP+ prior to sorting. CD4+GFP+ cells were grown in IL-2 medium as done previously, and functional assays were performed on days 10–12 post-harvest. IL-2 Production and ERK Activation Assays—For IL-2 assays, round-bottom, 96-well plates were coated with 5 μg/ml goat anti-hamster antibody (Roche Applied Science) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) followed by a mix of anti-CD3 (clone 2C11) and anti-trinitrophenyl (isotype-matched control) antibodies (Pharmingen). The total concentration of hamster antibody added to each well was constant (3 μg/ml, unless otherwise noted) with the concentration of anti-CD3 antibody as noted in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6. Cultured CD4+ cells were stimulated and analyzed for IL-2 production as described (27Thomis D.C. Berg L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with the exception that monensin was not included in the stimulation medium and that 5 μg/ml brefeldin A was substituted for monensin in the staining buffer. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry immediately after staining. Samples from each population were checked for CD4 and GFP expression and were consistently >95% positive for each marker. IL-2 dot plots are presented using an arbitrary linear channel as the x-axis. For ERK activation assays, cultured CD4+ T cells were stimulated and analyzed as described (7Miller A.T. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lysis buffer used was the same as that described above for Sf9 cells, except for the addition of 0.3% deoxycholate (DOC). Cells were lysed at a density of 108 cell equivalents/ml, and protein content of the cleared lysates was determined by Bradford analysis.Fig. 4Cells lacking Itk are most impaired under conditions of limiting TCR stimulation. Itk–/– CD4+ T cells were retrovirally infected with either vector alone or wild type Itk, and the infected cells were isolated by cell sorting. After 12 days in culture, the cells were stimulated using plate-bound anti-CD3 at the concentrations indicated in the presence of brefeldin. After 5 h, cells were permeabilized and stained for IL-2. A, representative data comparing IL-2 production in Itk–/– cells expressing either vector alone or wild type (wt) Itk. For each anti-CD3 concentration, triplicate assays were performed on each cell population. B, graphical presentation of the data. The results of triplicate stimulations at each antibody concentration were averaged for each cell population. The percentage of responding cells in the vector-alone samples was then divided by the percentage of responding cells in the Itk-reconstituted samples. The response of cells expressing vector alone is thereby expressed as a fraction of the response of the Itk-expressing cell population. Data shown are representative of eight separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Itk mutants do not fully restore IL-2 production in Itk–/– cells.

The solid line represents GFP–(uninfected) cells. Cells expressing wild type Itk or the mutants K390R, Y511F, Y180F, and W208K have indistinguishable GFP profiles (individual lines for each mutant are shown), whereas cells expressing vector alone display higher GFP expression (dotted line). B, lysates (106 cell equivalents) of Itk+/+ cells or retrovirally reconstituted Itk–/– cells were probed with an Itk-specific antibody (top panel). Reprobing the membrane with anti-ERK antibody indicates that total protein levels between samples are similar. Data shown are representative of four experiments. wt, wild type. C, sorted, expanded cells were stimulated using plate-bound anti-CD3 at the concentrations indicated in the presence of brefeldin. After 5 h, cells were permeabilized and stained for IL-2. As in Fig. 4, the percentage of responding cells in each population is normalized to the response of cells reconstituted with wild type (wt) Itk. The data shown is compiled from multiple independent experiments with each mutant (vector, six experiments, n = 14; K390R, three experiments, n = 4; Y180F, four experiments, n = 8; Y511F, two experiments, n = 5; W208K, three experiments, n = 7). Error bars represent S.E. values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Itk mutants do not fully restore ERK phosphorylation in Itk–/–cells. Itk+/+ and Itk–/– CD4+ T cells were left uninfected or were infected with the retroviruses indicated. Infected cells were isolated by cell sorting, and the populations were expanded for 12 days, restimulated with PMA and ionomycin, and reexpanded for an additional 10 days. Cells were then pre-bound with 10 μg/ml biotinylated anti-CD3 and crosslinked with 10 μg/ml streptavidin at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. 12.5 μg of each lysate was separated by electrophoresis and analyzed with an antibody specific for phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (p-ERK). The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with an anti-ERK antibody to ensure equal protein loading. Data shown are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Biochemical Analysis of Itk Phosphorylation Sites—To investigate the roles of tyrosine phosphorylation in Itk, we used a baculovirus system to express recombinant proteins in Sf9 insect cells. Baculoviruses encoding wild type Itk, kinase-inactive Itk-K390R, and Itk with tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions at either the site of transphosphorylation, Tyr-511, or the candidate site of autophosphorylation, Tyr-180, were generated (Fig. 1A). In addition, Itk-W208K, a point mutant in which SH3 ligand binding is abolished, was also included. To investigate the phosphorylation states of these mutant versions of Itk, the proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells, either with or without coexpression of Lck. Itk was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and blotted for phosphotyrosine content. Three different anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs were used to probe the membrane, i.e. 4G10, an antibody that recognizes total phosphotyrosine, and two anti-Btk phosphospecific antibodies, namely 8D11, raised against Btk phosphorylated at Tyr-551 (homologous to Tyr-511 in Itk), and 4F10, raised against Btk phosphorylated at Tyr-223 (homologous to Tyr-180 in Itk) (28Nisitani S.

For clarity, the antibodies 8D11 and 4F10 will hereafter be referred to as anti-pY511 and anti-pY180, respectively. As we have reported previously, Lck transphosphorylates Itk at Tyr-511, and the presence of this tyrosine is critical for the catalytic activity of Itk (3Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2001683998,"Fossils demonstrate that deciduous forests covered the polar regions for much of the past 250 million years1 when the climate was warm and atmospheric CO2 high2. But the evolutionary significance of their deciduous character has remained a matter of conjecture for almost a century3. The leading hypothesis1,4,4,5,6,7 argues that it was an adaptation to photoperiod, allowing the avoidance of carbon losses by respiration from a canopy of leaves unable to photosynthesize in the darkness of warm polar winters8,9,10,11. Here we test this proposal with experiments using ‘living fossil’ tree species grown in a simulated polar climate with and without CO2 enrichment. We show that the quantity of carbon lost annually by shedding a deciduous canopy is significantly greater than that lost by evergreen trees through wintertime respiration and leaf litter production, irrespective of growth CO2 concentration. Scaling up our experimental observations indicates that the greater expense of being deciduous persists in mature forests, even up to latitudes of 83 °N, where the duration of the polar winter exceeds five months. We therefore reject the carbon-loss hypothesis as an explanation for the deciduous nature of polar forests."
https://openalex.org/W2093732282,"Protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) is involved in growth, differentiation, tumor suppression, and regulation of other cellular processes. PKC-δ activation causes translocation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and serine-threonine kinase activity. However, little is known about the ability of G protein-coupled receptors to activate these processes or the mediators involved. In the present study, we explored the ability of the neurotransmitter/hormone, CCK, to stimulate these changes in PKC-δ and explored the mechanisms. In rat pancreatic acini under basal conditions, PKC-δ is almost exclusively located in cytosol. CCK and TPA stimulated a rapid PKC-δ translocation to membrane and nuclear fractions, which was transient with CCK. CCK stimulated rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC-δ and increased kinase activity. Using tyrosine kinase (B44) and a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (orthovanadate), changes in both CCK- and TPA-stimulated PKC-δ tyrosine phosphorylation were shown to correlate with changes in its kinase activity but not translocation. Both PKC-δ tyrosine phosphorylation and activation occur exclusively in particulate fractions. The Src kinase inhibitors, SU6656 and PP2, but not the inactive related compound, PP3, inhibited CCK- and TPA-stimulated PKC-δ tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. In contrast, PP2 also had a lesser effect on CCK- but not TPA-stimulated PKC-δ translocation. CCK stimulated the association of Src kinases with PKC-δ, demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation.

Similar to other PKCs, activation of PKC-δ both stimulates its translocation to cellular membranes and increases its serine threonine kinase activity. However, in contrast to the other PKCs, PKC-δ is also tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation (1Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Tapia J.A. Bragado M.J. Garcia-Marin L.J. Jensen R.T. Biochim. Biophys.

With the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and to a varying degree with the other stimuli, the relationship between these three processes (translocation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and serine-threonine kinase activation) upon PKC-δ stimulation as well as the cellular mechanisms mediating these changes, remains unclear. Studies have concluded that with various stimuli, stimulation of PKC-δ tyrosine phosphorylation can increase kinase activity (1Gschwendt M. Eur. J.

Recent studies demonstrate that activation of the CCKA receptor, a heptahelical GPCR that mediates the action of neuropeptide/hormone, CCK, causes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC-δ in pancreatic acinar cells (19Tapia J.A. Bragado M.J. Garcia-Marin L.J. Jensen R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1593: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of important intracellular proteins that function as adaptors and effectors in mediating cellular responses (p125FAK, PYK2, p130Cas, mitogen-activated protein kinase, paxillin) (33Garcia L.J.

CCK functions both as a peptide neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, as well as a hormone in the gastrointestinal tract (36Liddle R.A. Walsh J.H. Dockray G.J. Gut Peptides. Raven Press, New York1994: 175-216Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, CCK is one of the most abundant neuropeptides and has such diverse effects as functioning as a modulator of dopamine release, stimulating panic attacks, stimulating vagal transmission, and functioning as a regulator of satiety and morphine-induced analgesia (36Liddle R.A. Walsh J.H. Dockray G.J. Gut Peptides. Raven Press, New York1994: 175-216Google Scholar, 37Moran T.H. Schwartz G.J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 9: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). In the gastrointestinal tract, CCK is a physiological mediator of pancreatic secretion, gallbladder contraction, and gastric and colonic motility and plays an important role in pancreatic acinar cell growth (36Liddle R.A.

The cellular basis of action of CCKA receptor stimulation has been extensively studied in pancreatic acinar cells, with studies demonstrating that CCKA receptor activation causes stimulation of phospholipase A2 as well as stimulation of phospholipase C and D activation, resulting in mobilization of cellular calcium and activation of PKCs (38Williams J.A.

This well studied cell system is therefore an excellent model system to examine relationships between the ability of a G protein-coupled receptor to stimulate the various PKC-δ responses (translocation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and kinase activity) as well as the role of Src kinases in mediating each process.

Unless otherwise stated, the standard incubation solution contained 25.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 98 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 2.5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm sodium fumarate, 5 mm sodium glutamate, 11.5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm glutamine, 1% (w/v) albumin, 1% (w/v) trypsin inhibitor, 1% (v/v) vitamin mixture, and 1% (w/v) amino acid mixture. The incubation solution was equilibrated with 100% O2, and all incubations were performed with 100% O2 as the gas phase. Immunoprecipitation and Co-immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of PKC-δ or tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was performed as described previously (35Ferris H.A. Tapia J.A. Garcia L.J. Jensen R.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 46Garcia L.J. Rosado J.A. Gonzalez A. Jensen R.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, dispersed acini from one rat were preincubated for up to 3 h at 37 °C in standard incubation solution. After preincubation, cellular aliquots of 1 ml were incubated at 37 °C with different agonists at the concentrations and times indicated and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Lysates were obtained from these aliquots using lysis buffer. When immunoprecipitation was made prior to a kinase assay, lysates were obtained without sonication using lysis buffer specific for the kinase assay (see composition below). For assessment of tyrosine phosphorylation and in the co-immunoprecipitation studies, lysates were obtained by sonication in Triton X-100- and deoxycholate-containing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4) as described previously (46Garcia L.J. Rosado J.A. Gonzalez A. Jensen R.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For tyrosine phosphorylation studies, lysates (1 ml; 500 μg) were incubated with 4 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (PY20) or 4 μg of anti-PKC-δ polyclonal Ab and 25 μl of protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, lysates (1 ml; 800 μg) were preincubated with 6 μg of anti-PKC-δ polyclonal Ab or 6 μg of anti-PKC-δ mAb for 120 min at 4 °C. Then the samples were incubated with 30 μl of protein G-agarose for a further 60 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Subcellular Fractionation—Acinar cell were fractionated into cytosolic, membrane, and nuclear fractions, according to the procedures published previously (35Ferris H.A. Tapia J.A. Garcia L.J. Jensen R.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 46Garcia L.J. Rosado J.A. Gonzalez A. Jensen R.T. Biochem.

Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3534) Google Scholar). Briefly, acinar cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer without detergents and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) for 30 s. Homogenates were first centrifuged at low speed (500 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C to precipitate nuclei, debris, and fat. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 60,000 × g at 4 °C to separate the membrane fraction (pellet) and cytosol fraction (supernatant). The nuclear fraction was purified using ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradient (47Hockenbery D. Nuñez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3534) Google Scholar) from pellets obtained after the initial centrifugation (500 × g). Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold KCl-containing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4), deposited on top of tubes with 10 ml of KCl-containing lysis buffer and high sucrose concentration (2 m), and centrifuged for 60 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C. After their isolation, both nuclear and plasma membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in regular lysis buffer, sonicated for 5 s at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and an equal amount of proteins per sample of each subcellular fraction was further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with or without previous immunoprecipitation. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (34Tapia J.A. Ferris H.A. Jensen R.T. Marin L.J. J. Biol.

Anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-PKC-δ immunoprecipitates, whole cell lysates (10 μg of proteins/well), or subcellular fraction lysates (10 μg of proteins/well) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins with molecular masses higher than 60 kDa (20 kDa in co-immunoprecipitation studies) were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C using blotto (5% nonfat dried milk in a solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated for 90 min at 25 °C with 0.9 μg/ml of anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) or 0.2 μg/ml of anti-PKC-δ polyclonal Ab. After incubation with the primary antibody, membranes were washed twice for 4 min with blotto and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Membranes were washed with washing solution (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2,80 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), incubated for 5 min with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (SuperSignal West Dura; Pierce), and, finally, exposed to Biomax AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) or directly measured in a Kodak Image Station 440CF (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intensity and molecular weight of bands on films or membranes were quantified using the software Kodak 1D Image Analysis (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PKC-δ Kinase Activity Assay—Pancreatic acinar cells were preincubated with or without inhibitors, stimulated with different agents, and then lysed to obtain whole cell lysates or subcellular fraction lysates, using a lysis buffer for the kinase assay (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 4.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 47.6 mm NaF, 9.26 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). Lysates (1 ml, 900–1000 μg) were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min), and PKC-δ was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-PKC-δ mAb. Kinase assays were performed in the immunoprecipitates using the PKC assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology following the directions provided by the company with minor modifications. Immune complexes bound to the protein G-agarose were washed two times with 1 ml of lysis buffer for the kinase assay and two times with assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EGTA). Following the last wash, the pelleted beads were resuspended in 30 μl of assay dilution buffer containing 5 μg of phosphatidylserine and 0.5 μg of diacylglycerol. The kinase reaction was initiated with the addition of a magnesium/ATP mixture (75 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and the substrate, either histone H1 (10 μg) or the PKC substrate peptide (QKRPSQRSKYL) (80 μm). The reaction mixtures (final volume 60 μl) were briefly vortexed and then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with occasional mixing. After incubation, when histone H1 was used as the substrate, the kinase reaction was terminated by adding 15 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved using 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels. Finally, gels were dried and analyzed in a phosphor imager (InstantImager; Packard Instrument Co.). When PKC substrate peptide was used as substrate in the PKC kinase assay, 10 μl of each sample were spotted in duplicate onto p81 phosphocellulose papers. The p81 papers were washed in 0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone and then were allowed to dry. Finally, the amount of 32P incorporated to the substrate was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

https://openalex.org/W2168055563,"Penaeidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides of 47-63 residues isolated from several species of shrimp. These peptides display a proline-rich domain (N-terminal part) and a cysteine-rich domain (C-terminal part) stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds whose arrangement has not yet been characterized. The recombinant penaeidin-3a of Litopenaeus vannamei (63 residues) and its [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue were produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed similar antimicrobial activity. The solution structure of the [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue was determined by using two-dimensional 1H NMR and simulated annealing calculations. The proline-rich domain, spanning residues 1-28 was found to be unconstrained. In contrast, the cysteine-rich domain, spanning residues 29-58, displays a well defined structure, which consists of an amphipathic helix (41-50) linked to the upstream and the downstream coils by two disulfide bonds (Cys32-Cys47 and Cys48-Cys55). These two coils are in turn linked together by the third disulfide bond (Cys36-Cys54). Such a disulfide bond packing, which is in agreement with the analysis of trypsin digests by ESI-MS, contributes to the highly hydrophobic core. Side chains of Arg45 and Arg50, which belong to the helix, and side chains of Arg37 and Arg53, which belong to the upstream and the downstream coils, are located in two opposite parts of this globular and compact structure. The environment of these positively charged residues, either by hydrophobic clusters at the surface of the cysteine-rich domain or by sequential hydrophobic residues in the unconstrained proline-rich domain, gives rise to the amphipathic character required for antimicrobial peptides. We hypothesize that the antimicrobial activity of penaeidins can be explained by a cooperative effect between the proline-rich and cysteine-rich features simultaneously present in their sequences. Penaeidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides of 47-63 residues isolated from several species of shrimp. These peptides display a proline-rich domain (N-terminal part) and a cysteine-rich domain (C-terminal part) stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds whose arrangement has not yet been characterized. The recombinant penaeidin-3a of Litopenaeus vannamei (63 residues) and its [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue were produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed similar antimicrobial activity. The solution structure of the [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue was determined by using two-dimensional 1H NMR and simulated annealing calculations. The proline-rich domain, spanning residues 1-28 was found to be unconstrained. In contrast, the cysteine-rich domain, spanning residues 29-58, displays a well defined structure, which consists of an amphipathic helix (41-50) linked to the upstream and the downstream coils by two disulfide bonds (Cys32-Cys47 and Cys48-Cys55). These two coils are in turn linked together by the third disulfide bond (Cys36-Cys54). Such a disulfide bond packing, which is in agreement with the analysis of trypsin digests by ESI-MS, contributes to the highly hydrophobic core. Side chains of Arg45 and Arg50, which belong to the helix, and side chains of Arg37 and Arg53, which belong to the upstream and the downstream coils, are located in two opposite parts of this globular and compact structure. The environment of these positively charged residues, either by hydrophobic clusters at the surface of the cysteine-rich domain or by sequential hydrophobic residues in the unconstrained proline-rich domain, gives rise to the amphipathic character required for antimicrobial peptides. We hypothesize that the antimicrobial activity of penaeidins can be explained by a cooperative effect between the proline-rich and cysteine-rich features simultaneously present in their sequences. Antimicrobial peptides are major elements of host-defense systems represented in all species from plants to vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Among these antimicrobial molecules, cysteine-rich peptides are the most widespread. They are structurally classified into (i) peptides with a β-sheet structure such as the mammalian defensins (1Ganz T. Science. 1999; 286: 420-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), (ii) peptides with a β-hairpin-like fold such as tachyplesins from horseshoe crabs (2Kawano K. Yoneya T. Miyata T.

Only recently, such effectors of innate immunity were isolated from crustaceans, whereas numerous peptides have been characterized from other arthropods, both insects and chelicerates. Three peptides, named penaeidins (Pen), 1The abbreviations used are: Pen, penaeidins; CSI, chemical shift index; DG, distance geometry; DQF-COSY, two-dimensional double-quantum filter correlation spectroscopy; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; Pen-3a, penaeidin-3a isoform of L. vannamei; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; rmsd, root mean square deviation; SA, simulated annealing; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; TPPI, time proportional phase incrementation; PDB, protein data bank.1The abbreviations used are: Pen, penaeidins; CSI, chemical shift index; DG, distance geometry; DQF-COSY, two-dimensional double-quantum filter correlation spectroscopy; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; Pen-3a, penaeidin-3a isoform of L. vannamei; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; rmsd, root mean square deviation; SA, simulated annealing; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; TPPI, time proportional phase incrementation; PDB, protein data bank. were initially purified in their active form (5.48-6.62 kDa) from the hemocytes of the shrimp Litopenaeus (Penaeus) vannamei, and they were fully characterized at the amino acid level (Pen-1, Pen-2, Pen-3a) and by cDNA cloning from a hemocyte library (pen-2, -3a, -3b, and-3c) (11Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Penaeidins are an original peptide family composed of an N-terminal proline-rich sequence and a C-terminal region containing six cysteines engaged in three intramolecular disulfide bridges. Recently, using the molecular EST approach (Expression Sequence Tag) and sequence homology search, members of the penaeidin family have been identified in several shrimp species, including Litopenaeus setiferus (12Gross P.S.

Fenneropenaeus chinensis, 3J. Xiang, personal communication.3J. Xiang, personal communication. Litopenaeus stylirostris, 4M. Muñoz, personal communication.4M. Muñoz, personal communication. and Penaeus japonicus (14Rojtinnakorn J. Hirono I. Itami T. Takahashi Y. Aoki T. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2002; 13: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These data confirm that the penaeidin family is characterized by the presence of two distinct domains and by the conserved position of the six cysteines in the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, these studies have also revealed a new class of penaeidins, Pen-4 (Fig. 1), and as evidenced for the Pen-3 class, an abundance and diversity of isoforms can be produced in a single species (13Cuthbertson B.J. Shepard E.F. Chapman R.W. Gross P.S. Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Penaeidins are synthesized as precursor molecules consisting of a peptide signal (19-21 residues) preceding the mature bioactive peptide. Pen-1, -2, and Pen-4 have between 48 and 50 amino acids, whereas Pen-3 class peptides are the longest peptides (63 amino acids), characterized by the insertion of a medial sequence (3-5 amino acids), linking together the proline-rich and the cysteine-rich domains, and by additional residues at the C-terminal sequence. Pen-2 and Pen-3a were produced in the recombinant system Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study their biological properties and their spectra of antimicrobial activities (15Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These peptides exhibit broad activity at rather low concentration (below 10 μm) against mainly Gram-positive bacteria and filamentous fungi, and comparatively weak activity against the Gram-negative bacteria (ranging from 10 to 50 μm). In addition, for Pen-3a, a chitin-binding property has been evidenced, which appeared to be displayed by the C-terminal region (16Destoumieux D. Muñoz M. Cosseau C. Rodriguez J. Bulet P. Comps M. Bachère E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 461-469PubMed Google Scholar). Penaeidins are original peptides, which possess six cysteine residues organized in two doublets in their C-terminal domain. This is unusual in antimicrobial peptides since only vertebrate defensins, namely β-defensins, and hepcidin are known to present one and three cysteine doublets, respectively. Hepcidin (initially called liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide, LEAP-1), which displays antimicrobial activity, is presently known as an iron-regulatory hormone (17Krause A. Neitz S. Magert H.J. Schulz A. Forssmann W.G. Schulz-Knappe P. Adermann K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 18Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Devaux I. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8780-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Neither the disulfide bond arrangement nor the three-dimensional structure of the penaeidins has yet been reported. For this reason, the Pen-3 family, which appears to be most abundantly produced in shrimp, was chosen for such a structural study. Given the fact that native peptides are difficult to purify from natural samples, the Pen-3a isoform was expressed in a heterologous expression system (15Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the solution structure of the recombinant Pen-3a, as determined by 1H NMR derived-constraints, and its disulfide arrangement. Finally, from the determined structure, the distribution of positively charged and hydrophobic side chains, both in the unconstrained proline-rich and in the highly constrained cysteine-rich domains is discussed in terms of the amphipathic character required for antimicrobial activity of peptides. Expression and Purification of Pen-3a and of Its [T8A] Analogue— Pen-3a used in this study was obtained as previously described (15Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) by recombinant expression in the S. cerevisiae strain TGY 48-1 (20Reichhart J.M. Petit I. Legrain M. Dimarcq J.L. Keppi E. Lecocq J.P. Hoffmann J.A. Achstetter T. Invert. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 21: 15-24Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the Pen-3a coding sequences fused to the yeast β-glucanase/MFα1 preprosequence, were subcloned into a shuttle vector pTG4812. This construct was used to transform the yeast. An analogue of Pen-3a having the Thr to Ala substitution at residue 8, and termed [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue, was also expressed in the same yeast strain. The substitution was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by changing only one nucleotide from the Pen-3a coding sequence. 5C. Zatylny, unpublished results. S. cerevisiae TGY-transformed cells, expressing respectively Pen-3a and its [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue, were inoculated into selective medium YNBG (yeast nitrogen base 0.67%, glucose 1%) supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids lacking uracil. After 72 h of incubation at 30 °C under vigorous shaking, the cultures were centrifuged (1000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and the supernatants acidified to pH 2.9 by addition of trifluoroacetic acid. Large scale purifications of recombinant penaeidins were essentially performed as previously described (15Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To increase peptide purity, the molecules were finally purified on a RP18 reversed-phase column (Symetry Shield TM RP18; 4.6 × 250; 5 mm; Waters) by a linear biphasic gradient of 2-18% acetonitrile in acidified water over 10 min, and of 18-23% over 40 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Finally, the fractions containing the penaeidins were pooled, lyophilized, and kept as dry powder. Mass Spectrometry—Compounds were recorded offline in a QSTAR-Pulsar-i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) fitted with a Protana nanospray inlet system (Protana, Odense, Denmark) and analyzed using the Analyst QS software (Applied Biosystems). Parameters were adjusted as follows: ion spray voltage (IS), 900 V; curtain gas (CUR), 25; declustering potential (DP), 45-75 V; focusing potential (FP), 265 V; declustering potential 2 (DP2), 15 V. Capillaries were loaded with ∼2 μl of sample and placed in the source tip holder. Prior to analysis by nanospray, each aliquot from trypsin cleavage was solubilized in 50 μl of deionized water. 2 μl were desalted on Poros 20 R2 packed in a gel-loader pipette tip and eluted with 50:50:1 methanol/water/formic acid following an already described procedure (21Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Analysis of fragments was carried out by using the Protein Prospector (V4.0.4) program (prospector.ucsf.edu/mshome4.0.htm). Antimicrobial Assays—Antimicrobial activity of the [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue was assayed against different micro-organisms already used in a previous study relative to the activity spectrum study of the recombinant Pen-3a (15Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The test microorganisms were the Gram-positive bacteria Aerococcus viridans, Micrococcus luteus, and Bacillus megaterium; the Gram-negative strains, Escherichia coli 363, Salmonella thyphimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and marine bacteria Vibrio harveyi pathogenic for shrimp. Finally, the filamentous fungus Fusarium oxysporum isolated from shrimp was also used. MICs were determined in triplicate by the liquid growth inhibition assay as described (11Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Poor broth nutrient medium (PB: 1% bactotryptone, 0.5% NaCl, w/v, pH 7.5) or saline peptone water (1.5% peptone, 1.5% NaCl w/v, pH 7.2) was used for the standard bacterial strains and the marine bacteria, respectively. Briefly, in a sterile microtitration plate, 10 μl of peptide, or deionized water as a control was added to 90 μl of a mid-logarithmic growth phase culture of bacteria diluted in culture medium to OD600 = 0.001. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C with vigorous shaking and monitored spectrophotometrically at 620 nm. An identical liquid growth inhibition assay as that used to measure anti-bacterial activity was used to measure anti-fungal activity on Potato Dextrose Broth (Difco) medium. After incubation for 48 h at 25 °C in the dark without shaking and in a moist chamber, growth inhibition of the fungus was measured at 600 nm. Trypsin Cleavage—Pen-3a and its [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue (100 μg) were subjected to bovine trypsin (Promega Corporation) treatment with a trypsin/substrate ratio of 1/20 (w/w) in 500 μl of a 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 37 °C. After 2, 5, 10, and 17 h of incubation, 100-μl aliquots of the solution were frozen to stop the reaction and freeze-dried. ESI-MS spectra were recorded and analyzed as described above. NMR Spectroscopy—D2O (99.95%) was purchased from the CEA (Saclay, France). The pH values were measured at room temperature with a 3-mm electrode and are given uncorrected for the deuterium isotopic effect. 1H chemical shifts were referenced with respect to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate (DSS) according to the IUPAC recommendations (22Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wuthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Two 300-μl samples containing either Pen-3a or the [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue (0.7 mm) were prepared in a Shigemi tube (Shigemi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in 95:5 H2O:D2O and in 99.98% D2O, respectively. The pH was adjusted to 3.9 by addition of DCl or NaOD. Proton NMR experiments were performed both on a Bruker Avance 600 and Avance 500 spectrometers equipped with a triple resonance probe and with a cryoprobe, respectively. In all experiments, the carrier frequency was set at the center of the spectrum at the water frequency. To identify several overlapping spin systems, three sets of spectra were recorded at 12, 20, and 27 °C. DQF-COSY (23Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar), z-TOCSY (24Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 74: 557-564Google Scholar), and NOESY (25Macura S. Huang Y. Sutter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-TPPI method (26Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). For spectra recorded in H2O, and except for the DQF-COSY spectra (where low-power irradiation was used), the water resonance was suppressed by the WATERGATE method (27Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3506) Google Scholar). z-TOCSY spectra were obtained with a mixing time of 50 and 70 ms and NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 100, 150, and 200 ms. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from successive TOCSY and NOESY spectra recorded at 27 °C following the solubilization of Pen-3a and of [T8A]-Pen-3a in D2O from 15 min to 24 h. Data were processed by using either the XWINNMR or the GIFA (28Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) software. The data were zero-filled before processing and shifted sine-bell functions were used for apodization. The processed data were baseline corrected using a five-order polynomial function. The full sequential assignment was achieved using the general strategy described by Wüthrich (29Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—The NOESY cross-peaks were measured from the NOESY spectrum acquired at 27 °C with a mixing time of 150 ms and were divided into five classes, according to their intensities. Very strong, strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs were then converted into 1.8-2.4, 1.8-2.8, 1.8-3.6, 1.8-4.4, and 1.8-5.0 Å distance constraints, respectively. For equivalent protons or non-stereospecific assigned protons, pseudo-atoms were introduced. The [phis] angle restraints were derived from the 3JHN-CαH coupling constants, and the χ1 angle restraints were derived from the combined analysis of the 3JHα-Hβ coupling constants and intra-residues NOEs, respectively. To calculate three-dimensional structures, these distance and dihedral angle restraints were used as input in the standard distance geometry (DG)/simulated annealing (SA) refinement and energy-minimization protocol using X-PLOR 3.8 (30Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In the first stage of the calculation, an initial ensemble of 60 structures was generated from a template structure with randomized [phis], φ dihedral angles and extended side chains, using a DG protocol followed by restrained SA and refinement (31Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). No hydrogen bond restraint was used. Since the arrangement of the disulfide bonds had to be determined, structures were generated without using any disulfide bond constraints. Analyzing the obtained structures and comparing them with the NMR data allowed us to identify more additional NOE restraints, which were introduced into the subsequent calculation. After a number of these processes, 552 NOE-derived distance restraints (73 medium range and 93 long range) and 28 dihedral angles (15 [phis] and 13 χ1) were used as final input data. Analysis of the average Sγ-Sγ distances in the lowest energy structures allowed us to unambiguously determine the arrangement of the three disulfide bonds. Finally, a calculation of 60 conformers including the disulfide bonds was carried out, and the resulting 20 structures with a minimum of restrained violations were submitted to 5000 cycles of restrained Powell energy minimization. Structure Analysis—The visual display and the calculation of rmsd were performed with INSIGHT 97 (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego). Hydrogen bonds were considered as present if the distance between heavy atoms was less than 3.5 Å and the donor hydrogen acceptor angle was greater than 120°. The Ramachandran analysis was performed with PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar), and the limits of the secondary structure elements and the van der Waals surfaces were determined with the STRIDE program (33Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The chemical shifts and coordinates of the energy-minimized conformers of [T8A]-Pen-3a are deposited in the BMRB (accession number 5806) and in the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry: 1ueo), respectively. Production of Pen-3a and of Its [T8A] Analogue—S. cerevisiae-expressed Pen-3a was purified by reversed-phase HPLC. As already shown in a previous study, in addition to molecules similar to the native one, several forms of the recombinant penaeidins were found to be glycosylated (15Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Despite additional successive purification steps performed to obtain highly pure Pen-3a suitable for the structural study, residual contaminating glycosylated molecules were observed (see below). Nevertheless, a small amount of the non-glycosylated peptide was isolated and characterized by ESI-MS (6686.62 Da). It displayed a glutamine residue in its N terminus and therefore corresponded to the non-post-translationally modified Pen-3a [the N terminus of native Pen-3a was shown to be a pyroglutamic amino acid (11Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Van Dorsselaer A. Rodriguez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar)]. To obtain enough non-glycosylated material to carry out the structural study, a [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue was further produced. Since in a previous study (15Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Strub J.M. Van Dorsselaer A. Bachère E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the threonine in position 8 was identified as a site of O-glycosylation, this residue was substituted for alanine by directed mutagenesis to avoid glycosylation events in the yeast. The [T8A]Pen-3a analogue was expressed in S. cerevisiae, purified by RP-HPLC, and characterized by ESI-MS and by NMR. Its monoisotopic mass (6656.30 Da) was in agreement with the theoretical one of 6656.26 Da (Table I). Its 1H NMR spectrum was similar to that of the parent peptide suggesting that they share the similar fold.Table IESI-MS data for the recombinant Pen-3a and its [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue and for their fragments resulting of the trypsin hydrolysisMonoisotopic experimental massMonoisotopic theoretical massDaDaPeptidePen-3a6686.62aMeans values obtained from deconvoluted charged species are shown in Footnotes b-g.b6+ to 9+.6686.26[T8A]-Pen-3a6656.30c5+ to 9+.6656.26Fragment5-595773.96c5+ to 9+.5773.8310-595269.72d5+ to 8+.5269.5820-594113.00e4+ to 6+.4112.8920-37/46-50/54-592976.33f3+ to 5+.2976.2710-37/46-50/54-594133.07g3+ to 6+.4132.99a Means values obtained from deconvoluted charged species are shown in Footnotes b-g.b 6+ to 9+.c 5+ to 9+.d 5+ to 8+.e 4+ to 6+.f 3+ to 5+.g 3+ to 6+. Open table in a new tab Antimicrobial Activity—The antimicrobial activity of the recombinant Pen-3a and of its [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue was measured using a panel of microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the filamentous fungus F. oxysporum. The MIC values obtained for the recombinant Pen-3a and the [T8A]-Pen-3a analogue were found to be almost identical and revealed similar ranges of activity (Table II). The antimicrobial activity appeared to be target-specific with great inhibition of some of the Gram-positive bacteria strains such as A. viridans (with MIC less than 1.6 μm). As for Pen-3a, an anti-Gram-negative activity was recorded for [T8A]-Pen-3a against E. coli, whereas no inhibition of the other bacterial strains tested could be observed for either peptides up to 50 μm. Thus, we concluded that the [T8A] mutation did not affect the antimicrobial activity against the selected microorganisms.Table IIAntimicrobial spectrum activity comparison of the recombinant Pen-3a and its [T8A]-Pen-3a analogueMicroorganismsPen-3a[T8A]-Pen-3aμ Mμ MGram (+) bacterialAerococcus viridans0.8-1.6aMIC are expressed as the interval a-b, where a is the highest concentration tested at which the growth of the microorganisms is not inhibited and b the lowest concentration that causes 100% growth inhibition.0.4-0.8Micrococcus luteus0.8-1.60.8-1.6Bacillus megaterium3.12-6.253.12-6.25Gram (−) bacteriaEscherichia coli 3636.25-12.53.12-6.25Vibrio harveyi>50>50Salmonella thyphimurium>50>50Klebsiella pneumoniae>50>50Filamentous fungiFusarium oxysporum3.12-6.253.12-6.25a MIC are expressed as the interval a-b, where a is the highest concentration tested at which the growth of the microorganisms is not inhibited and b the lowest concentration that causes 100% growth inhibition. Open table in a new tab Attempts to Identify the Disulfide Pattern by Trypsin Cleavage and ESI-MS—The Pen-3a sequence of L. vannamei is characterized by a high content in glycine (17.5%), proline (15.9%), arginine (11.1%), serine (9.5%), and cysteine (9.5%). Together, these five amino acids account for 63.5% of the sequence. In contrast, Pen-3a does not contain either aspartic acid, or tryptophan, nor methionine. Class 3 sequences, which appear to be highly conserved within the shrimp species, significantly differ between species (ex: L. vannamei and L. setiferus) (13Cuthbertson B.J. Shepard E.F. Chapman R.W. Gross P.S. Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Concerning the location of the six cysteines, it should be noted that for all classes four cysteines belong to 2 doublets (Cys47, Cys48, and Cys54, Cys55 for Pen-3a) and that the first two cysteines are separated by three residues (Pro33§NVal34-Ser35) in class 3, whereas they are separated by only one for class 1 (Ala26) or by two for class 2 (Asn27-Ala28) and class 4 (Asp24-Val25) (Fig. 1). The arrangement of the three disulfide bonds in penaeidins was as yet unknown. The ESI-MS analysis of trypsin digests allowed us to identify fragments essentially resulting from cleavages after Lys4, Arg9, Arg19, Arg37, Arg45, Arg50, Arg53, and Lys59 residues (Fig. 1 and Table 1B). The molecular mass of peptides observed suggested that there is not a disulfide bond b"
https://openalex.org/W1995183079,"Activation of G protein-coupled receptors by agonists involves significant movement of transmembrane domains (TM) following binding of agonist. The underlying structural mechanism by which receptor activation takes place is largely unknown but can be inferred by detecting variability within the environment of the ligand-binding pocket, which constitutes a water-accessible crevice surrounded by the seven TM helices. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we initially identified those residues within the seventh transmembrane domain (TM7) of wild type angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor that contribute to forming the binding site pocket. We have substituted successively TM7 residues ranging from Ile276 to Tyr302 to cysteine. Treatment of A277C, V280C, T282C, A283C, I286C, A291C, and F301C mutant receptors with the charged sulfhydryl-specific alkylating agent MTSEA significantly inhibited ligand binding, which suggests that these residues orient themselves within the water-accessible binding pocket of the AT1 receptor. Interestingly, this pattern of acquired MTSEA sensitivity was greatly reduced for TM7 reporter cysteines engineered in a constitutively active mutant of the AT1 receptor. Our data suggest that upon activation, TM7 of the AT1 receptor goes through a pattern of helical movements that results in its distancing from the binding pocket per se. These studies support accumulating evidence whereby elements of TM7 of class A GPCRs promote activation of the receptor through structural rearrangements.

As a common characteristic, they all possess seven membrane-spanning domains that constitute structural support for signal transduction. However, despite a low sequence identity, GPCRs are thought to mediate signal transduction by a mechanism involving common structural movements implicating transmembrane domains (TM) (1Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). This receptor conformational change is suspected to sustain GTP/GDP exchange on specific guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) leading to activation of intracellular signaling cascades. Indeed, rotation described by rigid body movement of TM helices as well as translation have been described for activation of rhodopsin and other GPCRs (2Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 3Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).Rhodopsin belongs to class A within the GPCR superfamily. The recent elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of rhodopsin has shed much light into how photoisomerization is coupled to conformational change, which leads to G protein signalization (5Altenbach C. Cai K. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15483-15492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Altenbach C. Klein-Seetharaman J. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15493-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Also belonging to class A, the AT1 receptor binds the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AngII) and activates the G protein Gq/11. This leads to the increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels following hydrolysis by phospholipase C of membranous phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate into diacyl-glycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Most of the physiological actions of AngII on cardiovascular, endocrine, and neuronal systems are mediated by the AT1 receptor (7de Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which the AT1 receptor activates those pathways remain elusive. It has been proposed that TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 might participate in this activation process by providing a network of interactions through the AngII-binding pocket (8Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Inagami T. J. Hypertens. 1997; 15: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The dynamics of this network is suspected to be modified following agonist binding, thereby forcing the receptor to form new interactions between TMs. Another way in which an alteration in interactions of TM residues can yield interesting phenotypes is the existence of constitutively active receptors. For instance, it is well documented that N111G mutants within TM3 of the AT1 receptor confer a high level of constitutive activity (9Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), higher than N111A mutants. This mutation may release receptor constraints between TMs, thereby breaking the existing network involving multiple intramolecular interactions. Indeed, a rigid body movement of TM2 has been described recently for the AT1 receptor following such mutations at Asn111 (10Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, because TM7 bears multiple activation determinants and motifs, such as the 298NPXXY302 motif (11Laporte S.A. Servant G. Richard D.E. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar), which has been implicated in receptor-mediated G protein activation, their role in the N111G receptor mutant is quite intriguing.Like in many GPCRs, the binding site of the AT1 receptor is formed among its seven, mostly hydrophobic transmembrane segments and is accessible to charged water-soluble agonists, like AngII. Thus, for this receptor, the binding site is contained within a water-accessible crevice, the binding pocket, extending from the extracellular surface of the receptor into the transmembrane domain (12Boucard A.A. Wilkes B.C. Laporte S.A. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9662-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The surface of this crevice is formed by residues that can contact specific determinants on ligands and by other residues that may play a structural role as well as affect binding indirectly. Here, using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM), we probed the AT1 receptor-binding pocket (13Javitch J.A. Shi L. Liapakis G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Bovine serum albumin, bacitracin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma. The sulfhydryl-specific alkylating reagent used was CH3SO2-SCH2CH2NH3+, MTSEA, which was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Canada). The cDNA clone of the human AT1 receptor subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Sylvain Meloche (Université de Montréal). LipofectAMINE and culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (specific radioactivity, ∼2000 Ci/mmol) was prepared with Iodo-GEN® (Pierce) according to the method of Fraker and Speck (14Fraker P.J. Speck Jr, J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar) and as previously reported (11Laporte S.A. Servant G. Richard D.E. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar).Numbering of Residues in Transmembrane Domains—Residues in the seventh transmembrane domain of the human AT1 receptor are given two numbering schemes. First, residues are numbered according to their positions in the human AT1 receptor sequence. Second, residues are also indexed relative to the most conserved residue in the TM in which it is located (N1,N2) (15Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). N1 refers to the TM number, and N2 refers to the position of the residue relative to the most conserved one with numbers decreasing toward the N terminus and increasing toward the C terminus. By definition, the most conserved residue is assigned the position index 50, e.g. Pro299(7.50) and therefore Asn298(7.49) and Leu300(7.51). This indexing simplifies the identification of aligned residues in different GPCRs.Oligodeoxynucleotide Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the wild type AT1 receptor with the overlap PCR method described elsewhere (16Boucard A.A. Sauve S.S. Guillemette G. Escher E. Leduc R. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutant receptors were subcloned into HindIII-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. Site-directed mutations were then confirmed by manual and automated DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2 mml-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish. When cells reached ∼70% confluency, they were washed with serum-free DMEM and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE in 8 ml of serum-free DMEM. The cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, and the media were replaced with a complete DMEM containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfected cells were trypsinized after 24 h, plated into 12-wells plates, and grown for an additional 24 h before MTS treatment. Transfected cells in 100-mm culture dishes were grown for 48 h before binding assays.Binding Experiments—Cell membrane preparation and binding assays were performed as described previously (12Boucard A.A. Wilkes B.C. Laporte S.A. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9662-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown for 48 h post-transfection in 100-mm culture dishes, washed once with PBS, and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle. Broken cells were then gently scraped in washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.01% (w/v) bacitracin). Broken cells (20–40 μg of protein) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.05 nm of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII (2000 Ci/mmol) and increasing concentrations of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII. Bound radioactivity was separated from free ligand by filtration through GF/C filters presoaked for at least 3 h in binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]AngII. Receptor-bound radioactivity was evaluated by γ counting.MTS Treatment—Experiments were performed using a procedure modified from Javitch et al. (17Javitch J.A. Li X. Kaback J. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 48 h hours after transfection, cells plated into 12-well plates were washed with PBS and incubated with freshly prepared MTSEA at the stated concentrations (typically from 0.5 to 6 mm) in a final volume of 0.2 ml at room temperature for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS. The intact cells were then incubated in binding medium (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was evaluated by γ counting. The percentage of fractional inhibition was calculated as [1 – (specific binding after the MTS reagent/specific binding without the reagent)] × 100%.Measurement of the Second Order Rate Constant for MTSEA Reaction—The second order rate constant (k) for the reaction of MTSEA with each susceptible receptor mutants was estimated by determining the extent of reaction after a fixed period of time (3 min) with five concentrations of MTSEA (typically from 0.003 to 6 mm) (all in excess over the reactive sulfhydryls). The fraction of initial binding Y was fit to (1 – plateau) e– kct + plateau, where plateau is the fraction of residual binding at saturating concentrations of MTSEA, k is the second order rate constant (in m–1 s–1), c is the concentration of MTSEA ([M]), and t is the time (180 s). Fitting was achieved using the EnzFitter software from BioSoft (Ferguson, MO).Protection against MTSEA Reaction by [Sar1,Ile8]AngII—Transfected cells plated into 12-well plates were washed once with PBS and incubated in the presence or the absence of 100 nm [Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 1 h at 16 °C to avoid internalization of membrane expressed receptors. The cells were washed to remove excess ligand and then treated with a concentration of MTSEA that was just sufficient to achieve maximal inhibition of binding to each receptor. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and were submitted to an acidic wash (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm acetic acid, pH 3.0) to remove bound ligand. The cells were then incubated in binding medium (DMEM, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 3 h at 16 °C. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was evaluated by γ counting. The percentage of protection was calculated as [(inhibition in the presence of [Sar1,Ile8]AngII)/(inhibition in the absence of ligand)] × 100%.Molecular Modeling—All of the calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane2 work station. Theoretical structure of the hAT1 receptor was generated by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of the bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1F88). A pair-wise sequence alignment between the two primary structures was performed using the program Homology of Insight II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). After identification of the structurally conserved regions (transmembrane domains), these coordinates were transferred to the sequence of the hAT1 receptor. The structures of the loops of hAT1 were modeled by using the loop generation program of Insight II. The potential energy of the model structure of hAT1 was minimized by using the molecular modeling package of Insight II/Discover with consistent valence forcefield (18Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Two disulfide bridges, Cys18–Cys275 and Cys101–Cys180, were used as distance restraints. A distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4 was used with simple harmonic potential for bond length energy. No cross-term energies were included, and the peptide bonds were forced to planarity.RESULTSAssessment of hAT1 Sensitivity to MTSEA Added Extracellularly—To verify the contribution of the 10 endogenous cysteines (Fig. 1) to ligand binding, we initially performed the SCAM approach on the wild type AT1 receptor. Whole cells transiently expressing the AT1 receptor were treated with varying amounts of the sulfhydryl-specific alkylating reagent MTSEA. Fig. 2 shows that treatment with various concentrations of MTSEA had very little effect on the binding properties of the AT1 receptor. No more than a 10% reduction in binding was observed, showing the relatively low contribution of the endogenous cysteines of the receptor to the binding pocket. Alkylation of the AT1 receptor with other charged MTS reagents (methanethiosulfonylethyl-trimethylammonium and methanethiosulfonylethyl-sulfonate) also did not significantly affect ligand binding (data not shown).Fig. 2MTSEA treatment of the wild type receptor and sensitive reporter cysteine-bearing mutant receptors. Intact COS-7 cells transiently expressing the AT1, the A283C, or the V280C receptor were incubated with freshly prepared MTSEA (0.5–6 mm) in a final volume of 0.2 ml at room temperature for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by dilution in ice-cold PBS. The intact cells were then incubated with 0.05 nm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 2 h at room temperature. The results are representative of at least three separate experiments. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Binding Properties of hAT1 Mutant Receptors Bearing Cysteines in TM7—To establish whether residues of TM7 of the AT1 receptor orient themselves into the binding pocket and hence could potentially affect ligand binding, we generated a series of mutants whereby residues Ile276(7.27) to Tyr302(7.53) were replaced by cysteines. Each mutant receptor was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. To assess the conservation of global conformation of these receptors after such substitutions, pharmacological parameters describing the equilibrium binding of the radiolabeled antagonist 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII such as Kd and B max were determined (Table I). All of the mutant receptors exhibited high affinity binding for 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII except for D278C(7.29), D281C(7.32), M284C(7.35), and P285C(7.36), which did not demonstrate any detectable binding, and N295C(7.46), which showed a moderate 13-fold increase in Kd (Table I). Those receptors where binding was undetected were not used for SCAM analysis. B max values for all detectable receptors ranged from 0.2- to 1.6-fold that of the wild type receptor (Table I).Table IBinding properties of [Sar1,Ile8] AngII to cysteine-substituted hAT1 mutant receptorsKdBmaxnnmpmol/mgWild type (Cys289, Cys296)0.5 ± 0.10.95 ± 0.1810I276C0.7 ± 0.10.64 ± 0.133A277C0.5 ± 0.10.52 ± 0.073D278Cno detectable binding3I279C0.3 ± 0.10.34 ± 0.073V280C0.7 ± 0.20.70 ± 0.133D281Cno detectable binding3T282C1.2 ± 0.20.50 ± 0.133A283C0.6 ± 0.10.60 ± 0.123M284Cno detectable binding3P285Cno detectable binding3I286C1.0 ± 0.20.70 ± 0.403T287C2.1 ± 0.30.70 ± 0.403I288C2.6 ± 0.20.20 ± 0.103I290C1.2 ± 0.20.70 ± 0.403A291C1.8 ± 0.20.40 ± 0.303Y292C1.5 ± 0.10.40 ± 0.303F293C0.9 ± 0.30.80 ± 0.503N294C1.1 ± 0.20.80 ± 0.403N295C6.3 ± 0.31.20 ± 0.303L297C0.6 ± 0.20.76 ± 0.103N298C0.6 ± 0.11.50 ± 0.123P299C0.5 ± 0.11.30 ± 0.253L300C0.5 ± 0.10.97 ± 0.163F301C0.8 ± 0.11.19 ± 0.163Y302C0.6 ± 0.11.25 ± 0.133 Open table in a new tab Effect of Extracellularly Added MTSEA on Binding Properties of Mutant Receptors—To verify the location of reporter cysteines introduced into TM7 of the receptor toward the binding pocket, all detectable receptor mutants were treated with varying concentrations of MTSEA. MTSEA at 0.5 mm significantly reduced ligand binding to 5 of the 20 cysteine substitution mutants tested (Fig. 3A). Increasing the MTSEA concentration to 2 mm significantly reduced binding to seven mutant receptors (Fig. 3B). Higher MTSEA concentrations (6 mm) did not significantly modify the binding properties of the unaffected cysteine mutant receptors (data not shown). Thus, Cys residues substituted for Ala277(7.28), Val280(7.31), Thr282(7.33), Ala283(7.34), Ile286(7.37), Ala291(7.42), and Phe301(7.52) conferred MTSEA sensitivity to the AT1 receptor.Fig. 3Effect of MTSEA on AT1 mutant receptors bearing reporter cysteines in TM7. Intact COS-7 cells transiently expressing the wild type or mutants AT1 receptors were incubated with freshly prepared 0.5 mm MTSEA (A) and 2 mm MTSEA (B) in a final volume of 0.2 ml at room temperature for 3 min. The reactions were stopped by dilution in ice-cold PBS. The intact cells were then incubated with 0.05 nm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 1.5 h at room temperature. The fractional inhibition was calculated as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The vertical line represents an arbitrary threshold that was set at 25% of binding inhibition to identify sensitive Cys mutant receptors. White bars indicate mutant receptors for which ligand binding was maintained up to 25% of the corresponding untreated receptor once reacted with MTSEA. Gray and black bars indicate mutants for which binding inhibition was higher than 25 and 50%, respectively, of the corresponding untreated receptor. The means and S.E. are shown. The results are representative of at least three separate experiments. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Second Order Rate Constant of MTSEA Reactivity and Protection Assays—To quantify the susceptibility of sensitive mutant receptors to MTSEA, we determined the second order rate constants (Table II). The most highly reactive cysteines were those substituted for Ala277(7.28) and Thr282(7.33) with constants of 2297 and 641 m–1 s–1 respectively. The moderately reactive cysteines were those substituted for Val280(7.31), Ile286(7.37), Ala291(7.42), and Phe301(7.52) with values ranging from 3.4 to 14.2 m–1 s–1. Cysteine substituted for Ala283(7.34) was the least reactive with a second order rate constant of 1.6 m–1 s–1. To gain more insight about the location in the binding pocket of the reporter cysteines accessible to MTSEA, receptor mutants were preincubated with the ligand prior to MTSEA treatment. The cells were then submitted to an acid wash to dissociate the bound ligand, and receptors were then assayed for binding with the radiolabeled antagonist. Fig. 4 shows how preincubating with the antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]AngII essentially protected the mutant receptors A277C(7.28), V280C(7.31), T282C(7.33), A283C(7.34), and I286C(7.37) from the effect of MTSEA with protection levels ranging from 65 to 90% (Fig. 4). More moderate protection from MTSEA was obtained for mutant receptors A291C(7.42) and F301C(7.52), which exhibited a 30% protection level.Table IIMTSEA second order reaction rates to cysteine-substituted hAT1 mutant receptorsknm-1s-1A277C2297 ± 5583V280C14.2 ± 1.73T282C641 ± 943A283C1.6 ± 0.93I286C4.3 ± 0.53A291C6.2 ± 1.83F301C3.4 ± 0.73 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4[Sar1,Ile8]AngII protection of accessible Cys residues from reaction with MTSEA.

The cells were washed to remove excess ligand and then treated with a concentration of MTSEA that was just sufficient to achieve maximal inhibition of binding to each receptor. Concentrations of MTSEA were as follows: 0.02 mm for A277C and T282C; 0.25 mm for N111G-A291C; 2 mm for V280C, I286C, A291C, and F301C; and 4 mm for A283C.

As can be seen in Fig. 5, sensitivity of this receptor to 2 mm MTSEA is similar to that of the wild type receptor with a reduction of only 7% of total binding. Higher concentrations of MTSEA decreased ligand binding up to 10% of the untreated receptors (Fig. 5).Fig. 5MTSEA treatment of the hAT1-N111G mutant receptor and sensitive reporter cysteine-bearing mutant receptors. Intact COS-7 cells transiently expressing the AT1-N111G, the N111G-T282C, or the N111G-A291C mutant receptor were incubated with freshly prepared MTSEA (0.5–6 mm) in a final volume of 0.2 ml at room temperature for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by dilution in ice-cold PBS. The intact cells were then incubated with 0.05 nm125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII for 2 h at room temperature. The fractional inhibition was calculated as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As a first step in evaluating the putative altered phenotype of TM7 engineered cysteine on ligand binding following MTSEA treatment, we determined the pharmacological properties of the 25 receptor mutants bearing cysteines. Within the hAT1-N111G receptor background, 19 mutants conserved high binding affinities for the ligand with expression levels varying from 0.4 to 1.4 times that of the hAT1-N111G receptor (Table III). We did not detect binding to the I276C(7.27), D278C(7.29), M284C(7.35), P285C(7.36), I288C(7.39), and I290C(7.41) receptors engineered in the hAT1-N111G receptor background. Surprisingly, the D281C(7.32) receptor mutant exhibited a regain of high affinity binding (0.6 nm) when engineered in the hAT1-N111G receptor background as compared with that of the wild type receptor background in which there was no detectable binding (see Table I versus Table III).Table IIIBinding properties of [Sar1, Ile8] AngII to cysteine-substituted hAT1 mutant receptors bearing the N111G mutation in the third transmembrane domainKdBmaxnnmpmol/mgN111G (Cys289, Cys296)0.7 ± 0.20.88 ± 0.255I276Cno detectable binding3A277C0.5 ± 0.20.42 ± 0.103D278Cno detectable binding3I279C0.4 ± 0.10.44 ± 0.103V280C0.5 ± 0.10.56 ± 0.163D281C0.6 ± 0.10.34 ± 0.103T282C0.5 ± 0.10.32 ± 0.103A283C0.5 ± 0.20.56 ± 0.123M284Cno detectable binding3P285Cno detectable binding3I286C0.7 ± 0.20.53 ± 0.123T287C1.1 ± 0.30.63 ± 0.103I288Cno detectable binding3I290Cno detectable binding3A291C1.3 ± 0.10.59 ± 0.103Y292C0.8 ± 0.20.51 ± 0.173F293C0.6 ± 0.10.55 ± 0.103N294C1.5 ± 0.60.55 ± 0.153N295C0.7 ± 0.20.94 ± 0.223L297C0.5 ± 0.10.84 ± 0.313N298C2.2 ± 0.81.25 ± 0.673P299C2.2 ± 0.40.83 ± 0.263L300C0.5 ± 0.10.65 ± 0.323F301C0.4 ± 0.10.50 ± 0.103Y302C0.8 ± 0.11.18 ± 0.103 Open table in a new tab Mutant receptors were then treated with increasing concentrations of MTSEA and assessed for binding with the radiolabeled antagonist 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]AngII. Interestingly, all of the mutant receptors were insensitive to MTSEA, except for the N111G-A291C(7.42) receptor mutant. Those mutants that were sensitive to MTSEA treatment in the WT background (A277C(7.28), V280C(7.31), T282C(7.33), A283C(7.34), I286C(7.37), and F301C(7.52)) conserved a constitutive activity in the hAT1-N111G background based on the production of inositol phosphates under basal conditions (data not shown). Thus, the Cys substitutions in the N111G background did not abrogate their intrinsic capacity of activating phospholipase C in an agonist-independent manner. The N111G-A291C(7.42) receptor exhibited 66% binding inhibition following treatment with 2 mm MTSEA (Figs. 5 and 6). This mutant also exhibited an elevated susceptibility to MTSEA when compared with wild type receptor as denoted by its second order reaction rate of 36 ± 11 m–1 s–1 (6 m–1 s–1 for wild type). We also observed that this particular receptor was very effectively protected from reaction with MTSEA with a protection level evaluated at 88% (Fig. 4). Two othe"

The present work provides evidence that the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (C-PKA) is packaged within HIV-1 virions as demonstrated using purified subtilisin-digested viral particles. Virus-associated C-PKA was shown to be enzymatically active and able to phosphorylate synthetic substrate in vitro. Suppression of virion-associated C-PKA activity by specific synthetic inhibitor had no apparent effect on viral precursor maturation and virus assembly. However, virus-associated C-PKA activity was demonstrated to regulate HIV-1 infectivity as assessed by single round infection assays performed by using viruses produced from cells expressing an inactive form of C-PKA. In addition, virus-associated C-PKA was found to co-precipitate with and to phosphorylate the CAp24 gag protein. Altogether our results indicate that virus-associated C-PKA regulates HIV-1 infectivity, possibly by catalyzing phosphorylation of the viral CAp24 gag protein.

Altogether our results indicate that virus-associated C-PKA regulates HIV-1 infectivity, possibly by catalyzing phosphorylation of the viral CAp24 gag protein. Protein phosphorylation is one of the primary processes by which external physiological stimuli influence intracellular events in eucaryotic cells. Protein kinase activity was also reported to contribute to a cascade of events controlling the definition of infectivity for a number of retroviruses and non-retroviruses. Many purified virions, including insect viruses, as granulosis virus (1Wilson M.F. Consigli R.A. Virology. 1985; 143: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and plant viruses, including cauliflower mosaic virus (2Geldreich A. Albrecht H. Lebeurier G. Virus Genes. 1989; 2: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), have been found to display protein kinase activity associated with their viral particles. For animal viruses, association of protein kinase activity with viral particles has been frequently reported, especially for enveloped virus particles (for review see Ref. 3Hui E.K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 920-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Among these, some virion-associated protein kinases have been identified as virally encoded products. As an example, herpes simplex viruses encode their own ribonucleotide reductases (ICP6 for HSV-1 and ICP10 for HSV-2), which have been assigned a serine-threonine protein kinase activity (4Paradis H. Gaudreau P. Massie B. Lamarche N. Guilbault C. Gravel S. Langelier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9647-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chung T.D. Wymer J.P. Smith C.C. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3389-3398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and similar observations have been performed for the human cytomegalovirus (6Wolf D.G. Honigman A. Lazarovits J. Tavor E. Panet A. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), pseudorabies virus (7Zhang G. Stevens R. Leader D.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and varicella-zoster virus (8Stevenson M. Gendelman H.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For some small genome viruses, encapsidation of cellular kinases was found to replace their lack of kinase gene. Indeed, Rhabdoviridae (9Gupta A.K. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Hepadnaviridae (10Kann M. Gerlich W.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7993-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Retroviridae including Rauscher murine leukemia virus (11Strand M. August J.T. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and RNA tumor viruses (12Hatanaka M. Twiddy E. Gilden R.V. Virology. 1972; 47: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were found to incorporate host cell protein kinases within their membrane or inside the viral core. Even though their precise contribution has not yet been identified, there is ample evidence to suggest that virus-associated protein kinases are crucial for viral infectivity, and their possible function includes both the regulation of the viral nucleic acid replication and transcription and the modification of virus structural proteins that leads to either uncoating or encapsidation of viral nucleic acids. For the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; C-PKA, catalytic subunit of PKA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide.1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; C-PKA, catalytic subunit of PKA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. the incorporation of signaling molecules including cellular protein kinases within viral particles was also questioned. HIV-1 virions were found to contain several phosphoproteins including MAp17 gag (13Gallay P. Swingler S. Song J. Bushman F. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 83: 569-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), CAp24 gag (14Cartier C. Sivard P. Tranchat C. Decimo D. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19434-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and recently p6 gag proteins (15Muller B. Patschinsky T. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The viral matrix MAp17 gag is phosphorylated by virus-associated kinase(s) at various steps of the HIV-1 replicative cycle (16Bukrinskaya A.G. Ghorpade A. Heinzinger N.K. Smithgall T.E. Lewis R.E. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). C-terminal phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue within MAp17 gag protein during and immediately after virus production was proposed to facilitate the dissociation of viral matrix protein from the membrane phospholipids of the nascent virus particle prior to and during virus assembly (17Gallay P. Swingler S. Aiken C. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 18Camaur D. Gallay P. Swingler S. Trono D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6834-6841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional phosphorylation on serine residues was next reported and was proposed to promote membrane dissociation of the reverse transcription complex from the cell membrane at the site of entry, allowing its nuclear translocation (16Bukrinskaya A.G. Ghorpade A. Heinzinger N.K. Smithgall T.E. Lewis R.E. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Jacqué J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Such modifications were found to occur in preintegration complexes isolated from target cells and in native virions, suggesting that host cell serine-threonine kinases might possibly be incorporated within HIV particles (16Bukrinskaya A.G. Ghorpade A. Heinzinger N.K. Smithgall T.E. Lewis R.E. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). CAp24 gag protein was also proposed to be phosphorylated by a virus-associated serine-threonine kinase. Such phosphorylations of CAp24 gag protein on serine residues were reported to be required for viral infectivity, because the reverse transcription process is unable to complete in CAp24 gag mutants with mutated phosphoacceptor sites (14Cartier C. Sivard P. Tranchat C. Decimo D. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19434-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the precise function of these modification remains unknown, by similarity to other viruses (i.e. poliovirus and herpes virus), it can be hypothesized that phosphorylation of HIV-1 capsid protein probably generates some repulsive forces among protein-protein interactions that participate in viral core destabilization and viral particle uncoating. During the past few years, we reported the presence of at least two cellular host cell serine-threonine kinases incorporated within HIV-1 particles. One of these proteins was identified as an active form of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK-2)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (20Cartier C. Deckert M. Grangeasse C. Trauger R. Jensen F. Bernard A. Cozzone A. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional integrity of virus-associated ERK-2 was found to be crucial for virus infectivity. As a confirmation, ERK-2 packaged within HIV-1 particles was found to be responsible for the phosphorylation of serine residues within MAp17 gag protein, indicating that this virus-associated kinase regulates viral infectivity by promoting membrane translocation of the reverse transcriptase complex in the host cell and thus participating in viral uncoating (19Jacqué J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Despite evidence obtained for the incorporation of other protein kinases within HIV particles, including a 53-kDa serine-threonine kinase that remains unidentified so far (20Cartier C. Deckert M. Grangeasse C. Trauger R. Jensen F. Bernard A. Cozzone A. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the precise nature of proteins responsible for CAp24 gag proteins phosphorylation remains to be defined. The present work was then designed to identify serine-threonine kinases incorporated within HIV particles. We demonstrate here by using subtilisin-digested viruses that the catalytic subunit of the cellular protein kinase A (C-PKA) is incorporated within HIV-1 virions. The virus-associated C-PKA was found to be enzymatically active. The implication of incorporated C-PKA in virus infectivity was analyzed. Virions produced from cells devoid of C-PKA kinase activity displayed reduced infectivity in single infection assays and in infection of lymphoblastoid T cell lines, despite normal assembly and fully mature morphology of virions. Analysis of viral protein phosphorylation revealed that virus-associated C-PKA interacts with and phosphorylates the CAp24 gag capsid protein. Altogether, our data support the hypothesis that the active catalytic subunit of PKA associated to HIV-1 particles regulates viral infectivity. A possible function could rely on its ability to interact with and to phosphorylate the CAp24 gag capsid protein. Generation of Infected Cells and Viral Stocks—Cos-7, 293T, and MAGI (21Chackerian B. Long E.M. Luciw P.A. Overbaugh J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3932-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) adherent cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) (Invitrogen). Cos-7 and 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3 (22Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by polyethylenimine transfection (6 units of ExGen 500 (Euromedex)/μg of DNA). For generation of viral stocks, 48 h after transfection, Cos-7 cells were co-cultured for an additional 48 h with CD4+ H9 T cells (107) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cos-7 cells were then removed, and HIV-1-infected H9 cells were maintained in culture and were diluted by the addition of uninfected H9 cells twice a week. Virus Purification—Supernatants from H9 cells and H9 cells infected with HIV-1NL4.3 strain were cleared from cellular debris by low speed centrifugation, filtered on a 0.45-μm-pore-size membrane (Millipore) and concentrated by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 40 min on Centricon Plus-80, Biomax-PB membrane with a cut-off of 100 kDa (Millipore). Concentrated supernatants were then digested in a solution of 1 mg/ml subtilisin (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA for 16 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped with 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration) for 30 min at room temperature. The digested supernatants were then centrifuged through 20% sucrose cushion at 25,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C in a 28.38 rotor (Kontron Instruments). The pellets were solubilized in kinase assay lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride). The concentration of proteins in viral lysates was normalized by quantification of CAp24 gag antigen concentration assessed with anti-CAp24 gag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Beckman Coulter). PKA in Vitro Kinase Assays—PKA activity in viral and cellular lysates was assayed using a PKA assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, the lysates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 100 μm Kemptide, a PKA-specific substrate, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer provided by the kit manufacturer, supplemented or not with PKA inhibitor peptide. The phosphorylated substrate is separated from the residual [γ-32P]ATP using P81 phosphocellulose paper and quantitated by using a liquid scintillation counter. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 150 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent. The proteins were electrophoresed on a 10%-ProSieve®50 polyacrylamide gel (Cambrex Biosciences Rockland, Inc.) and then transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore). The proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using either anti-CAp24 gag mouse monoclonal antibody (ICN), anti-RT rabbit polyclonal anti-serum (kindly provided by J. L. Darlix, ENS, Lyon, France), or rabbit polyclonal anti-sera raised to gp41 env (Fitzgerald), C-PKA (Upstate Biotechnology), R-PKA (Chemicon), or ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Super Signal; Pierce). Reverse Transcriptase Assay and CAp24gag Antigen Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Supernatants of transfected or infected cells were harvested and cleared of cells and cellular debris by centrifugation. For each sample, 1 ml of culture supernatant was tested for RT activity using a synthetic template primer that permitted the RT to neosynthesize radioactive DNA, as previously described (23Corbeau P. Benkirane M. Weil R. David C. Emiliani S. Olive D. Mawas C. Serre A. Devaux C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 290-301PubMed Google Scholar). The CAp24 gag antigen concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Electron Microscopy and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Thin layer electron microscopy was processed as follows. The cells were washed once with medium and fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m Sörensen buffer, pH 7.4 (24Dawson R. Elliott D. Elliott W. Jones K. Data for Biochemical Research. 2nd ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1969Google Scholar), for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were included in Lowicryl K4M at –20%, sectioned, and processed for conventional electron microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy. Mouse monoclonal anti-C-PKA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and M35/2F8 rat anti-p6 gag mAb (obtained from M. G. Sarngadharan) (25Veronese F.D. Rahman R. Copeland T.D. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were used for immunoelectron microscopy, with the corresponding colloidal gold-labeled complementary antibodies, 10-nm gold-tagged anti-mouse Ig antibody, and 5-nm gold-tagged anti-rat, respectively. For conventional electron microscopy, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, postfixed with osmium tetroxide (2% in H2O), and treated with tannic acid (0.5% in H2O). After dehydration, the specimen were embedded in Epon (Epok-812, Fullam), and sections were stained with 2.6% alkaline lead citrate and 0.5% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol. The specimens were observed under an Hitachi HU7100 electron microscope. Viral Infectivity Assays—MAGI Cells (21Chackerian B. Long E.M. Luciw P.A. Overbaugh J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3932-3939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that stably express the β-galactosidase reporter gene cloned downstream of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter were platted at 8 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates. The cells were exposed to HIV stock solutions normalized according to RT activity. 48 h post-infection, virus infectivity was monitored by measurement of β-galactosidase activity from the cell lysates as previously described (26Briant L. Robert-Hebmann V. Acquaviva C. Pelchen-Matthews A. Marsh M. Devaux C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of total cellular extracts were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1.5 ml of buffer containing 80 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 6 mm o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside. β-Galactosidase activity was evaluated by measuring absorbance at 410 nm and was normalized according to total protein content in the cell lysate. Viability of cells exposed to viruses produced in the presence of H89 was assessed as previously described (27Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45846) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml (final concentration) MTT. The cells were then lysed by addition of 100 μl of 0.1 n HCl in isopropanol, and absorbance was read at 570 nm with the solubilization buffer serving as a blank. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays and Immunoprecipitation of CAp24gag—CAp24 gag protein was immunoprecipitated by incubating cell lysates or viral lysates in the presence of 2 μg of anti-CAp24 gag mAbs (ICN) and 50 μl of protein G-conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech). After 2 h at 4 °C, immune complexes were separated on magnetic columns. For in vitro kinase experiments, immunoprecipitates were incubated in the presence of 2.5 μg of recombinant C-PKA, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the appropriate buffer containing 13.5 mm Mg2+, 90 μm ATP, and 2 μm cAMP for 30 min at room temperature. After several washes, phosphorylated products were eluted, loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane, and revealed by autoradiography. Phosphorylated CAp24 gag was identified by incubating the membrane with anti-CAp24 gag goat polyclonal serum (Biogenesis). cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase Catalytic Subunit Is Specifically Incorporated within Highly Purified HIV-1 Viral Particles—We and others have previously reported that several serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases are packaged within HIV-1 particles. In an attempt to identify virus-associated protein kinase(s) incorporated within HIV-1 particles, lysates of highly purified viruses were probed with antibodies specific for various cellular protein kinases in Western blotting experiments. HIV-1 virions prepared from the supernatant of H9 cells infected by NL4.3 virus strain were digested with subtilisin protease and isolated by sucrose density ultracentrifugation as previously described (28Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Kane B.P. Busch L.K. Johnson D.G. Sowder II, R.C. Chertova E.A. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7734-7743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral lysates were then probed with a number of antibodies directed to cellular kinases. Antibodies specific for PKR, ERK-1, GSK3, PI3K, CK2, CSK, and c-Src protein kinases failed to detect the corresponding kinase in preparation of purified viruses (data not shown). In contrast, we found that p56 lck tyrosine kinase is specifically associated with subtilisin-digested HIV-1 particles (data not shown) as previously observed by high pressure liquid chromatography and Western blotting analysis (29Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Johnson D.G. Kane B.P. Sowder II, R.C. Kim Y.D. Fisher R.J. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Henderson L.E. Virology. 2000; 266: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of a protein with a molecular weight of 40,000 was revealed by the mean of a serum specific for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (C-PKA) (Fig. 1A, lane 4), suggesting that C-PKA is incorporated within purified HIV-1 particles. As previously reported, the main difficulties for characterization of host cell proteins associated to viral particles lies in the co-sedimentation of cellular microvesicles with viral preparations. For this particular reason, the specificity of our observation was ascertained by analyzing the presence of C-PKA subunit in mock virus preparations (culture supernatants from H9 uninfected cells) that were prepared in the same manner as virion lysates (Fig. 1A, lane 3) without any detectable staining. Our results indicate that the presence of contaminant C-PKA proteins evidenced from undigested preparations of mock virus supernatants (visualized from Fig. 1A, lane 1), because of the co-sedimentation of microvesicles with HIV-1 viral particles, is completely removed by digestion of purified virions with protease. To ascertain the relevance of our results, the immunoblot was then reprobed with anti-ERK-2 antibody (Fig. 1B). As previously reported, the presence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK-2 was evidenced from purified virions (20Cartier C. Deckert M. Grangeasse C. Trauger R. Jensen F. Bernard A. Cozzone A. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not from subtilisin-digested preparations of H9 supernatants. The efficiency of subtilisin treatment was also ascertained by analyzing gp41 env envelope glycoprotein pattern in subtilisin-digested viral preparations. As shown from Fig. 1C, a reduction in the molecular masses of the proteins detected by anti-gp41 env serum was observed after subtilisin treatment, indicating that proteins outside the viral envelope have been efficiently digested. It is worthwhile to notice that the size of the C-PKA is not altered after digestion of viral preparations with subtilisin, indicating that in contrast to gp41 env , the size of which is lowered from 41 to 22 kDa after treatment, C-PKA is protected from enzymatic digestion. This result suggests that virus-associated C-PKA is located inside the virus particle. Finally, the amount of protein loaded in each lane was controlled by probing the membrane with anti-CAp24 gag mAbs (Fig. 1D). Similar experiments performed from supernatants of cells chronically infected with HIV-2ROD or SIV strains did not allow the detection of the PKA catalytic subunit in the HIV-2 and SIV particles (data not shown). These results indicate that the catalytic subunit of PKA is selectively incorporated within HIV-1 particles. The association of C-PKA to HIV-1 viral particles was then controlled by immunoelectron microscopy after double labeling of both chronically HIV-1-infected cells and free subtilisin-digested viral particles. Chronically HIV-1-infected 8E5 cells, that derive from a CEM parental cell line or CEM-uninfected cells used as a control were embedded in Lowicryl, and the sections were double labeled with anti-p6 gag mAbs allowing identification of viral structures and anti-C-PKA serum. Primary antibodies were revealed with anti-rat Ig or anti-rabbit Ig secondary reagents coupled with 5- or 10-nm gold particles, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, the sections obtained from HIV-1-infected cells with anti-C-PKA mAbs revealed specific structures labeled by anti-p6 gag mAbs, and low background was detected in the section of uninfected CEM cells (Fig. 2B). These data confirmed the presence of PKA catalytic subunit within HIV-1 virions. Similar observations were performed from inclusions of cell-free virions previously digested with subtilisin (data not shown). It is important to notice that labeling of the sections with anti-p6 gag and anti-C-PKA allowed us to monitor the efficiency of subtilisin digestion by comparing the presence of microvesicles in untreated and subtilisin-treated viral preparations. cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase Incorporated within HIV-1 Viral Particles Is Catalytically Active—In the cell context, the PKA activity is regulated by the association of C-PKA catalytic subunits with two regulatory domains termed R-PKA that inhibit the catalytic properties of C-PKA. To further investigate whether the C-PKA incorporated within highly purified HIV-1 particles is enzymatically active, the presence of R-PKA regulatory subunit was investigated by Western blotting experiments performed from lysate of subtilisin-digested HIV-1 particles. In our experimental conditions, the presence of R-PKA subunits could not be proved in preparations of viruses (data not shown). In the absence of detection of virus-associated regulatory R-PKA subunits, we next investigated for the presence of virus-associated PKA enzymatic activity. Virus particles or subtilisin-treated virions were lysed and incubated in appropriate buffer in the presence of Kemptide, a PKA synthetic substrate. PKA kinase activity was measured by counting the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP in Kemptide. As shown in Fig. 3A, phosphorylation of Kemptide was detected from lysate of concentrated HIV-1NL4-3 particles and was maintained in subtilisin-digested viruses. Basal phosphorylation level measured in the absence of Kemptide is indicated for each sample. Specificity of PKA activity was next assessed by analyzing phosphorylation of Kemptide substrate in the presence of highly specific inhibitors of either PKA activity or protein kinase C/calmodulin kinase activity as a control. Incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP within the substrate was abolished when PKA inhibitor peptide was added to the samples but not when protein kinase C/calmodulin kinase inhibitor mixture was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these data indicate that C-PKA kinase activity is associated with highly purified HIV-1 virions. C-PKA Activity Affects HIV-1 Particles Production but Is Not Required for Viral Maturation or Assembly—We next studied whether virion-associated C-PKA activity affects viral infectivity. Virus particles were produced from cells cultured in the presence of H89, a synthetic inhibitor specific for PKA. 40 h after transfection of Cos-7 cells with the pNL4-3 plasmid, culture medium was replaced for a 4-h time period, either by medium alone or medium containing 100 μm of H89, a concentration of inhibitor that does not affect cell viability as determined by MTT testing (data not shown). H89 was then removed, and the cells were maintained in culture for an additional 4 h to allow the release of viral particles before supernatants were collected. First, we analyzed the ability of H89 concentrations added to the culture medium to efficiently inhibit cellular PKA activity. Lysates of H89-treated cells prepared at various times following the removal of the inhibitor of the culture medium were assayed for PKA activity by in vitro phosphorylation assays of Kemptide. As shown in Fig. 4A, addition to the culture medium of 100 μm H89 for a 4-h period was sufficient to inhibit C-PKA cells for at least a 4-h period after the inhibitor was removed from the culture medium. Then virus production from transfected cells cultured in the presence or absence of H89 was assessed by measuring RT activity in culture supernatants. In these experimental conditions, we found that the addition of H89 to the cells significantly lowers RT activity measured in cell culture supernatants (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that host cell PKA activity might regulate HIV-1 particle production. The consequences of H89 treatment on viral product maturation were next investigated by Western blot experiments.

Here, we identify AN34 as an N-terminally truncated form of human AP endonuclease (Ape1) lacking residues 1–35 (Δ35-Ape1). Although Ape1 has hitherto been considered specific for damaged DNA (specific to AP site), recombinant AN34 (Δ35-Ape1) possesses significant endonuclease activity on undamaged (normal) DNA and in chromatin. AN34 also displays enhanced 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. Caspase-3 activates AN34 in a cell-free system, although caspase-3 cannot cleave Ape1 directly in vitro. We also found that Ape1 itself preferentially cleaves damaged chromatin DNA isolated from cells treated with apoptotic stimuli and that silencing of Ape1 expression decreases apoptotic DNA fragmentation in DFF40/CAD-deficient cells. Thus, we propose that AN34 and Ape1 participate in the process of chromatin fragmentation during apoptosis. We previously isolated a 34-kDa nuclease (AN34) from apoptotic human leukemia cells.

Thus, we propose that AN34 and Ape1 participate in the process of chromatin fragmentation during apoptosis. Apoptosis is an essential mechanism for maintaining cell number homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Both the morphological changes occurring in apoptotic cells and the molecular mechanism by which cells die are widely conserved (1Steller H.

Degradation of DNA is an important biochemical hallmark of apoptosis and results from the activation of cellular nucleases. A number of candidate apoptotic nucleases, including DNase I (4Rauch F.

Recently, caspase-activated DNase (CAD, 1The abbreviations used are: CAD, caspase-activated DNase; DFF, DNA fragmentation factor; ICAD, inhibitor of CAD; AN34, apoptotic nuclease of 34 kDa; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; Ape1, AP endonuclease; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; siRNA, short interfering RNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CAD, caspase-activated DNase; DFF, DNA fragmentation factor; ICAD, inhibitor of CAD; AN34, apoptotic nuclease of 34 kDa; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; Ape1, AP endonuclease; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; siRNA, short interfering RNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. also known as DNA fragmentation factor 40 kDa (DFF40)) has been shown to produce apoptotic DNA fragmentation. CAD forms a heterodimer with ICAD (inhibitor of CAD, also known as DFF45), and ICAD is cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis. Consequently, activated CAD can initiate DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation (9Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 10Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although DFF40/CAD plays an important role as a major apoptotic nuclease in various experimental systems, mice lacking DFF45/ICAD are viable and still show residual DNA fragmentation (13McIlroy D.

Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45427-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CAD is not expressed ubiquitously in human tissues (16Mukae N. Enari M. Sakahira H. Fukuda Y. Inazawa J. Toh H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9123-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that the CAD/DFF40 system is not the only nuclease that generates apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Recently, endonuclease-G has been reported as an apoptotic endonuclease. Endonuclease-G is released from mitochondria during apoptosis and induces caspase-independent DNA degradation (17Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). We previously purified an apoptotic nuclease 34 kDa (AN34) from human leukemia cells undergoing apoptosis (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). AN34 is a Mg2+-dependent nuclease, generating DNA breaks with 3′-hydroxyl termini. In addition, it induces predominantly DNA single strand breaks but also produces internucleosomal DNA cleavage in isolated nuclei (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have determined the origin of AN34 and found that it is an N-terminally truncated form of human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (Ape1) (19Demple B. Herman T.

Hickson I.D. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It cleaves the DNA phosphodiester backbone immediately 5′ to an AP site. In addition, Ape1 acts as a reducing factor that stimulates the DNA binding activity of ubiquitous transcription factors such as Fos, Jun, NF-κB, HIF-1, and p53 (24Evans A.R. Limp-Foster M. Kelley M.R. Mutat. Res. 2000; 461: 83-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that AN34 (Δ35-Ape1) possesses significant endonuclease activity and cleaves chromatin DNA, although Ape1 itself has no such an activity. Using a cell-free system, we also show that caspase-3 causes accumulation and activation of AN34. In addition, we report that Ape1 selectively cleaves chromatin DNA from cells treated with apoptotic stimulus and that silencing of Ape1 expression decreased apoptotic DNA fragmentation in DFF40/CAD-deficient cells. This report is the first demonstration for a role for Ape1 in degrading DNA during apoptosis. Materials— 3H-Escherichia coli DNA (2.2 Ci/mg), [α-32P]cordycepin 5′-triphosphate, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). HiTrap-Q, HiTrap-Heparin, Mono S HR 5/5, Superdex-200 pg, and Superose 12 HR 10/30 columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Hydroxyapatite columns were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Anti-Ape1 polyclonal antibody from rabbit was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-DFF40 monoclonal antibody from mouse was purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Recombinant caspase-3 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Oligonucleotides were purchased from The Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Measurement of Nuclease Activity by a 3H-DNA Fragmentation Assay—Nuclease assays were carried out using 3H-E. coli DNA as substrate. Nuclease activity was measured by the formation of acid-soluble DNA fragments as described previously (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 60 min in 60 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT, 50 ng of 3H-E. coli DNA (1 × 105 dpm) in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2. Incubations were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 1 m perchloric acid:1 m NaCl and rapid chilling on ice. Nuclease activity was determined from the percentage of acid-soluble 3H-E. coli DNA released in the supernatant (percent DNA fragmentation). One unit of endonuclease activity was defined as the activity inducing 20% DNA fragmentation. Purification of AN34 and Peptide Sequence Analysis—AN34 was purified as described previously (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A hydroxyapatite column chromatography was additionally used to purify protein thoroughly prior to peptide sequence analysis. All chromatographic separations were performed at 4 °C using fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Cell lysates were prepared from etoposide-treated apoptotic HL-60 cells as described previously (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates (3 × 109 cells, ∼3 liters of culture) were passed over a Q-Sepharose column (HiTrap-Q), equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF). The column was washed with buffer A, and flow-through fractions were collected. Active fractions were concentrated by Centriprep-10 and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (HiTrap-heparin) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.2 m KCl. The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.2 m KCl, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (0.2 to 0.6 m KCl in buffer A). The nuclease activity eluted around 0.3 m KCl. The active fractions were passed over PD10 columns equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm potassium phosphate) to exchange buffer. The nuclease fraction was then applied to a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with buffer B, and then bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (0.001 to 0.6 m potassium phosphate in buffer B). The nuclease eluted around 0.1 m potassium phosphate. The active fractions were concentrated by Centriprep-10 and Microcon-10 and applied to a Superose 12 HR10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. Active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a Mono S HR5/5 column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (0.1 to 0.5 m KCl in buffer A). Nuclease activity eluted around 0.2 m KCl. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Colloidal Coomassie (Novex, San Diego, CA) or silver. The major protein bands were excised from the gels and digested with trypsin. For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) protein analysis, peptides derived from trypsin digestions were run on a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Data using electrospray mass spectrometry analysis were also obtained from collision induced dissociation spectra with a Finnigan-MAT LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) after introduction via a polyamide-coated fused silica microcapillary high-performance liquid chromatography. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed using Procise 494HT automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Purification of AN34/Ape1 from Caspase-3-treated Cell Lysates—Cell lysates (cytoplasmic extracts) were prepared as described previously (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min with recombinant caspase-3 (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). Caspase-3-treated cell lysates were applied to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. Active nuclease fractions were further purified by Q-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, Mono S column as described above. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Ape1, AN34 (Δ35-Ape1), and a Site-directed Mutant Form of Ape1—Expression and purification of full-length Ape1 and of a site-directed mutant form of Ape1 in which Asp-210 was substituted by Asn (D210N), were performed as described previously (25Rothwell D.G. Hang B. Gorman M.A. Freemont P.S. Singer B. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2207-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AN34 (comprising residues 36–318 and hence lacking the N-terminal 35 amino acids (Δ35-Ape1)) was expressed and purified as described previously (26Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To create a mutant form of AN34 (Δ35-Ape1) containing an Asp-210 to Asn substitution (AN34 (D210N)), the cDNA encoding full-length Ape1-D210N protein was used as a template for PCR amplification. EcoRI and HindIII sites were incorporated into the primers for directional cloning of the AN34 (D210N) cDNA into pT7-7, as described previously (26Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The structure of the cloned fragment was verified by DNA sequencing. The AN34 (D210N) protein was expressed and purified as described previously (26Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). 3′-5′-Exonuclease Assays—A polyacrylamide gel assay was used to detect 3′-5′-exonuclease activity. Purified nuclease was incubated with a 20-mer oligodeoxynucleotide labeled with 32P at the 5′ or 3′ termini. 3′-end labeling was carried out with [α-32P]cordycepin using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Invitrogen). 5′-end labeling was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeling mixtures were subsequently centrifuged through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove unincorporated 32P. DNA substrates (∼50 fmol/10-μl reaction) were incubated with 1 μl of purified proteins for the indicated times at 37 °C in standard reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm DTT). Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. Samples were applied to 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea). Gels were dried, and imaging was performed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). AP Endonuclease Assays—The upper strand of a 37-mer oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single tetrahydrofuran residue as a model for an AP site (27Pourquier P. Ueng L.M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A.

Duplex annealing was carried out in the presence of the same concentration of unlabeled lower strand. DNA substrates (∼50 fmol/10-μl reaction) were incubated with 1 μl of purified AN34/Ape1 or recombinant Ape1 for 15 min at 37 °C in standard reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm DTT). Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. Samples were applied to 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea). Gels were dried, and imaging was performed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Chromatin Digestion Assays—Nuclei were isolated from HL-60 cells as described previously (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei (7 × 106) were resuspended in STKM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) and mixed with purified Ape1 (30 units) in the presence of 1 mm DTT. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. DNA was extracted by standard phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction procedures, and analyzed by 1.3% agarose gels electrophoresis. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in 0.25% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 3 μg of leupeptin, 3 μg of aprotinin, and 2 mm PMSF. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and electrophoresed at 125 V in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), membranes were blocked overnight in PBS-Tween containing 5% nonfat dried milk, probed for 1 h with primary antibody and for 1 h with secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). Visualization was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunodepletion Experiments—Purified Ape1 and AN34 were incubated with anti-Ape1 antibody (6 μg) or normal rabbit immunoglobulin (6 μg) in buffer A at 4 °C for 4 h. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and incubations were carried out at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was collected as immunoadsorbed supernatant. Nuclease and chromatin digestion assays were performed as described above using 3H-E. coli DNA or isolated nuclei, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HL-60 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 50 μm etoposide for 3 h, acetone-fixed, and stained with anti-Ape1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The coverslips were incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate). Propidium iodide was used for nuclear staining. Images were acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy (eclipse TE300, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Ape1 Silencing by RNA Interference—We prepared siRNA duplexes for Ape1 from synthetic 21-nucleotide RNAs (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). The human glioblastoma cell line, U87-MG, was used for Ape1 silencing experiments (16Mukae N. Enari M. Sakahira H. Fukuda Y. Inazawa J. Toh H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9123-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The sequences for siRNA for Ape1 were as follows: sense, 5′-GUCUGGUACGACUGGAGUACC-3′; antisense, 5′-UACUCCAGUCGUACCAGACCU-3′. Chemically synthesized control (non-silencing) siRNA was purchased from Qiagen (Tokyo, Japan). Transfection of siRNA were carried out with TransMessenger reagent (Qiagen) in 6-well plates. siRNA was condensed with Enhanser R and formulated with 4 μl of TransMessenger reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection complex was diluted in 900 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and was added directly to the cells. It was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum after 3 h. Cells were analyzed 48 h after transfections. Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Silver staining was performed using silver stain plus kit (Bio-Rad). Identification of AN34 as a N-terminal Truncated Form of Ape1—To clarify the origin of AN34, we purified the protein from etoposide-treated apoptotic HL-60 cells using five chromatographic steps as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of the last step of purification by Mono S column chromatography are shown in Fig. 1. The fractions 20–25 positive for DNA fragmentation were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the proteins were silver-stained. Two protein bands with molecular masses of 34 (AN34) (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar) and 37 kDa were apparent, and their intensities correlated with the level of nuclease activity in the DNA fragmentation assay (Fig. 1). For consistency with our previous report (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar), we refer to the 37-kDa endonuclease band as AN37. To identify AN34 and AN37, the two proteins bands were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. Protein identification was then performed using MALDI and electrospray mass spectrometry. Peptide analysis of both AN37 and AN34 showed matched sequences from the major AP endonuclease, Ape1 (Table I). In addition, N-terminal analysis of the 34-kDa (AN34) protein indicated that AN34 lacks the first 35 amino acid residues of Ape1 (Fig. 2). To further test the identity of the purified proteins, a polyclonal antibody recognizing the C-terminal region of human Ape1 was used in Western blot analysis. The Ape1 antibody reacted both with purified AN37 and AN34 as shown in Fig. 3 (lane 1). Another polyclonal antibody that recognizes the N terminus of human Ape1 reacted with Ape1 but did not react with AN34 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, immunodepletion experiments using the C-terminal region-specific Ape1 antibody demonstrated that the nuclease activities of AN34 and AN37 were strongly reduced in both the 3H-DNA fragmentation and chromatin digestion assays (Fig. 4). To test whether purified AN34 and AN37 had AP endonuclease activity, an oligonucleotide containing a single abasic site was incubated with purified AN34 and AN37, and the cleavage products were analyzed by DNA sequencing gels. As shown in Fig. 5, purified AN34 and AN37 possessed AP endonuclease activity. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that AN34 is an N-terminally truncated form of Ape1 (Δ35-Ape1, comprising residues 36–318) and that AN37 in apoptotic cells corresponds to Ape1.Table IMass fingerprinting of purified nuclease and its identification as AP-endonucleaseSpotProtein identified[M+H]+ observedaMonoisotopic.Δ, u bThe difference between experimental and calculated masses.ResiduesSequence from databasecUnderlined residues were corroborated by MS/MS product ion spectra.37 kDaAP endonuclease 1 65% coverage659.3-0.1136-140QCPLK717.4079-84GLDWVK823.40187-192WDEAFR845.4-0.178-84KGLDWVK865.41.0181-186LEYRQR952.30.8187-193WDEAFRK1019.50228-236NAGFTPQER1131.507-17GAVAEDGDELR1137.60125-135EGYSGVGLLSR1259.70.16-17KGAVAEDGDELR1690.80.1141-155VSYGIGDEEHDQEGR1786.90.135-51EAAGEGPALYEDPPDQK0.17-23GAVAEDGDELRTEPEAK1831.10.2237-253QGFGELLQAVPLADSFR1874.11.1301-317SKALGDHCPITLYLAL2267.40.2156-176VIVAEFDSFVLVTAYVPNAGR2466.50.3103-124LPAELQELPGLSHQYWSAPSDK34 kDaAP endonuclease 1 45% coverage1848.30.3237-253QGFGELLQAVPLADSFR2466.80.6103-124LPAELQELPGLSHOYWSAPSDK1136.9-0.7125-135EGYSGVGLLSR605.1-0.325-30SKTAAK631.30276-280NVGWR657.3-0.1221-226NPKGNK659.40136-140QCPLK717.4079-84GLDWVR823.40187-192WDEAFR846.00.578-84KGLDWVK890.6-0.4194-201FLKGLASR1007.51.3177-184GLVRLEYR1019.60.1228-236NAGFTPQER193-201KFLKGLASR1109.52.0185-192QRWDEAFR1787.50.735-51EAAGEGPALYEDPPDQa Monoisotopic.b The difference between experimental and calculated masses.c Underlined residues were corroborated by MS/MS product ion spectra.

However, it is known that Ape1 itself has no endonuclease activity toward undamaged DNA (i.e. non-AP site-containing DNA). Thus, we analyzed whether AN34 possesses endonuclease activity toward undamaged (normal) DNA substrates. Recombinant full-length Ape1 and recombinant AN34 (Δ35-Ape1) were used for this experiment and tested in a DNA cleavage assay using supercoiled SV40 DNA. As shown in Fig. 6a, recombinant full-length Ape1 did not cleave SV40 DNA. By contrast, recombinant AN34 generated both nicked and linearized DNA, indicating that recombinant AN34 can produce both DNA single and double strand breaks, which is consistent with our previous biochemical characterization of AN34 from apoptotic cells (18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the endonuclease activity of AN34 (Δ35-Ape1) for undamaged DNA was eliminated by mutation of Asp-210, an essential catalytic residue, to Asn (25Rothwell D.G. Hang B. Gorman M.A. Freemont P.S. Singer B. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2207-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6a). We also tested the activity of recombinant AN34 in isolated nuclei from normal cells. As shown in Fig. 6c, increasing amounts of recombinant AN34 produced increasing level of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Purified AN34/Ape1 from Apoptotic Cells Possesses 3′-5′-Exonuclease Activity—We next examined whether purified AN34/Ape1 from apoptotic cells possessed exonuclease activity. The 20-mer duplex oligodeoxynucleotide shown in Fig. 7a was either 5′- or 3′-32P-end-labeled. Incubation of purified AN34/Ape1 with the 3′-end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide released a radiolabeled mononucleotide (Fig. 7b, lane 2). Similarly, recombinant Ape1 released this same mononucleotide (Fig. 7b, lane 5). When the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide was used, AN34/Ape1 from apoptotic cells generated oligonucleotide bands between 9 and 20 nucleotides in length (Fig. 7c, lane 2). Longer oligonucleotide bands (17Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 18Yoshida A. Pourquier P. Pommier Y.

Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) were observed in the case of recombinant Ape1 (Fig. 7c, lane 4), indicating that the 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of recombinant Ape1 was either weaker than that of AN34/Ape1 (AN37) purified from apoptotic cells or less processive. These results demonstrate that recombinant AN34 (Δ35-Ape1) has 3′-5′-exonuclease activity (∼2.5-fold greater than recombinant Ape1).

Our previous studies showed that MUC8 gene expression was overexpressed in in vivo polyp epithelium in chronic sinusitis and was also increased by treatment with inflammatory mediators in an in vitro culture condition. However, the mechanisms by which the inflammatory mediators-induced MUC8 gene expression in normal nasal epithelial cells evolved remain unclear. We examined the mechanism by which the important proinflammatory mediator, interleukin (IL)-1β, increases MUC8 gene expression levels. We found that pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of ERK MAPK pathway abolished IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial cells. Moreover, the overexpression of wide-type or of the dominant-negative mutant of p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (RSK1) enhanced or suppressed, respectively, IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression. RSK1 was found to directly phosphorylate cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and this event led to the stimulation of subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription. In conclusion, IL-1β was found to induce MUC8 gene expression via a sequential ERK/RSK1/CREB pathway in human airway epithelial cells.

Mucins are highly glycosylated, high molecular mass glycoproteins and are major components of the mucus produced by the epithelia of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. They are responsible for the viscoelastic properties of secreted mucus and provide lubrication and protection for mucus membranes (1Gray T. Nettesheim P. Basbaum C. Koo J.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the airway, virtually all forms of airway inflammation are associated with the overproduction of mucus, which can lead to airway obstruction (2Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. McNamara N. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care. Med. 1999; 160: S44-S48Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

Accordingly, most studies on mucin genes have been focused on these two mucins. However, although MUC5AC is known to be expressed by most surface goblet cells, we found that only a portion of the goblet cells (11Kim C.H. Song K.S. Kim S.S. Kim H.U. Seong J.K. Yoon J.H. Laryngoscope. 2000; 110: 2110-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) expressed MUC5AC mRNA. This suggests that other mucin genes in addition to MUC5AC might be important for mucus hypersecretion. We have previously investigated the expressions of other mucin genes using various inflammatory tissues and cell lysates. Interestingly, in vivo, we found that MUC8 mRNA levels are clearly up-regulated in the polyp epithelium, which is invariably stimulated by inflammatory mediators (12Kim S.S. Kim K.S. Lee J.K.

Acta Otolaryngol. 2002; 122: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results showed that MUC8 mRNA is increased both in vivo and in vitro during inflammatory conditions. However, the mechanisms of MUC8 gene expression during inflammation in normal airway epithelial cells and the signal molecules involved have not been elucidated. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are ubiquitous kinases and are involved in signal transduction in eukaryotic organisms. This family of kinases is characterized by their activation by MAPKs through the dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues in their activation loop. The MAPK family includes extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), which are activated in response to growth factors, via the Ras protooncogene. Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK constitute two other families, collectively known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK), because they are induced by UV radiation, heat-shock, oxidative stress, or tumor necrosis factor-α. The stimulation of ERK initiates a cascade of activating events, including the phosphorylation of p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (RSK1), and its translocation to the nucleus, where RSK1 phosphorylates nuclear substrates (15Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, the phosphorylation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK), which localized in the nuclei (16Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), could lead to the phosphorylation and activation several transcription factors like cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) (17Van Seuningen I. Pigny P. Perrais M. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 1216-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the mechanism by which the important proinflammatory mediator, IL-1β, increases MUC8 gene expression levels. Here we show that ERK MAPK is essential for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression in normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells. We also show that RSK1 mediates the IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of CREB and CRE-mediated transcription. Molecular cloning of the MUC8 promoter regulated by various stimuli may yield a deeper insight into cellular function. Materials—PD98059, SB203580, and anti-α-tubulin antibody were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK MAPK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody, anti-phospho-RSK1 (Ser380) antibody, and anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). cDNA construct encoding dominant-negative Raf1 construct was kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Kim (University of Korea, Seoul, Korea). Cell Cultures—The culture system used for the normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells has been previously reported (13Yoon J.H. Kim K.S. Kim H.U. Linton J.A. Lee J.G. Acta Otolaryngol. 1999; 119: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line, NCI-H292, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1848, Manassas, VA) and was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber. For serum deprivation, confluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and re-cultured in RPMI 1640 with 0.2% FBS. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Primers and probes were designed using PerkinElmer Life Sciences Primer Express® software, purchased from PE Biosystems. Commercial reagents (TaqMan PCR Universal PCR Master Mix, PE Biosystems) and conditions were applied according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of cDNA (reverse transcription mixture), oligonucleotides at a final concentration of 800 nm of primers, and 200 nm TaqMan hybridization probe were used in a 25-μl volume. The probe of real-time PCR was labeled with carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5′-end and with the quencher carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) at the 3′-end. The following primers and TaqMan probes were used: MUC8, forward (5′-GACCTGCCCCCATGGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-CAGGAGTTCGAGACCAGCCT-3′) and TaqMan probe (6FAM-CCACCTCCGAGCCCGTCACTGAG-TAMRA). β 2M, forward (5′-CGCTCCGTGGCCTTAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GAGTACGCTGGATAGCCTCCA-3′) and TaqMan probe (6FAM-TGCTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCTGGC-TAMRA). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection System (Foster City, CA). The thermocycler (ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection System) parameters were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Relative quantity of MUC8 mRNA was obtained using a comparative cycle of threshold method, and results were normalized against β 2M as an endogenous control. Western Blot Analysis—NCI-H292 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. After 15 or 45 min of treatment with IL-1β, the cells were lysed with 2× lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol). Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature. This membrane was then incubated overnight with primary antibody in TTBS (0.5% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). After washing with TTBS, the blot was further incubated for 45 min at room temperature with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling) in TTBS and then visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of an Inducible Dominant-negative Mutant Stable Cell Line—Plasmid encoding the kinase-deficient MEK1 mutant (pcDNA5-MEK1DN) was cut with BamH1 (Promega, Madison, WI) and ligated with pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This clone was cut with HindIII (Promega), filled in with Klenow, re-cut with SacII (Promega), and then ligated to pTRE vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid encoding kinase-inactive p38 mutant (pcDNA3-p38AGF) was cut with BamH1, filled in with Klenow, re-cut with XbaI (Promega), and then ligated to pTRE vector. NCI-H292 cells were then cotransfected with pTet-off (Clontech) regulation vector and pTRE-p38DN or pTRE-MEK1DN (1:20 ratio of regulation vector to expression vector) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Stably transfected cell lines were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem), and the medium was replaced with G418 and doxycycline every 3 days. Immunoprecipitation—One microgram of polyclonal anti-phospho CREB antibody was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 400 μg of cell extract prepared using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 g/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Forty microliters of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to the cell lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling the samples in PAGE sample buffer, and whole samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gel. In Vitro RSK1 Assay—For serum deprivation, confluent cells were washed twice with PBS and recultured in RPMI 1640 containing 0.2% FBS. Cells were treated with IL-1β for 30 min, harvested, and lysed in lysis buffer. 300 μg of the protein so obtained was incubated with anti-phospho-RSK1 (Ser380) antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were added to 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Samples were washed three times in lysis buffer, and kinase reactions were carried out for 1 h at 30 °C in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mm MnCl2, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg of acid-treated enolase, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 5 μg of bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CREB as a substrate. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and pelleted. Pellets were then resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer I (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated for 15 min on ice, and vortexed vigorously. Nuclei were pelleted, resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer II (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and vigorously vortexed. The nuclear extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at –70 °C. For EMSA, oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus CRE sequences (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extract was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with the 32P-labeled CRE probe in binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). DNA-nuclear protein complexes were separated from the DNA probe by electrophoresis through 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA (TBE) buffer. Supershift experiments were conducted using 2 μl of anti-phospho-CREB antibody. The gel was dried and autoradiographed using an intensifying screen at –70 °C. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Luciferase reporter construct (pCRE-luc) and plasmid expressing mutant CREB (pCREB S133A, with serine residue 133 replaced by alanine) vector, were transiently transfected using a FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 48 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity, using a luciferase assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase activity was also assayed to standardize the transfection efficiencies. Effects of ERK MAPK on IL-1β-induced MUC8 Gene Expression—Previously, ERK and p38 MAPKs had shown maximum activation after 15-min treatment with IL-1β, this effect decreased at 45 min in NHNE cells. No change was detected in the activation of JNK (18Song K.S. Lee W.J. Chung K.C. Koo J.S. Yang E.J. Choi J.Y. Yoon J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23242-23250Google Scholar). To investigate the possible involvement of ERK or p38 MAPK pathway in IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression, we performed real-time PCR after pretreatment with 20 μm PD98059 or 20 μm SB203580 for 1 h. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that pretreatment with PD98059 for 1 h inhibited MUC8 gene expression (Fig. 1). However, pretreatment with SB203580 did not affect MUC8 gene expression (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the activation of ERK MAPK, but not of p38 MAPK, appeared to be closely related to IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression. When the same experiment (Fig. 1) was performed using NCI-H292 cells, a human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line, we obtained results that were similar to those of normal cells (data not shown). To further confirm the significance of ERK or p38 kinase upon the cellular level of MUC8 gene expression, we generated cells stably expressing dominant-negative (DN) mutant MEK1 or p38 under control of the Tet-off system. After removing doxycycline to induce MEK1DN, cells were stimulated with IL-1β for 15 min, and IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of ERK significantly decreased (Fig. 2A). However, no change in ERK expression was observed. Real-time quantitative PCR showed a significant decrease in MUC8 gene expression after 24 h (Fig. 2A). In a similar way, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK on IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression using p38DN. An in vitro kinase assay showed that the activation of p38 MAPK in this mutant stable cell lines was reduced in the presence of IL-1β (Fig. 2B). However, the IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression was not affected by p38DN induction. These results showed that ERK MAPK, but not p38 MAPK, was essential for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression in NCI-H292 cells. To examine whether the sequential Ras/Raf/MEK1/ERK pathway plays a role in IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression, we transiently transfected DNA with constructs encoding RasDN (Ras N17) or Raf1DN (craf1, a kinase-defective form of Raf1). The transient overexpressions of Ras or Raf1 DN did not affect the IL-1β-activated phosphorylation of ERK MAPK (Fig. 2C), and the IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression (Fig. 2D). ECV304 cells were used as a positive control for these dominant-negative vectors (19Genersch E. Hayess K. Neuenfeld Y. Haller H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4319-4330PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that the activation of ERK MAPK via MEK1 by IL-1β might occur via a Ras-independent pathway to induce MUC8 gene expression in airway epithelial cells. Effects of RSK1 on IL-1β-induced MUC8 Gene Expression—To determine which molecules are involved in the downstream signaling of ERK MAPK in IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression, we investigated RSK1 and MSK1. RSK1 has been reported to be activated by ERK MAPK (20Zhang Y. Zhai Q. Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19042-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Kim K.W. Kim S.H. Lee E.Y. Kim N.D. Kang H.S. Kim H.D. Chung B.S. Kang C.D. J. Biol.

Pathol. 2002; 161: 2087-2098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of RSK1 by IL-1β peaked at 30 min and then decreased at 60 min after IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment with 20 μm PD98059 inhibited IL-1β-induced RSK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), indicating that RSK1 is regulated by ERK MAPK. These results showed that RSK1 acts as a downstream signaling mediator of ERK MAPK. To determine whether RSK1 plays an important role in IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression, an RSK1 mutant study was performed. RSK1 is currently a candidate for the mediation of cytokine-induced CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 (20Zhang Y. Zhai Q. Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19042-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Janknecht R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45793-45802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wide-type (W/T) RSK1 increased IL-1β-induced CREB phosphorylation. However, the overexpression of RSK1DN (D205N) suppressed the IL-1β-induced CREB phosphorylation. Consistently, IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression was increased by overexpression of W/T RSK1, whereas the IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression was significantly suppressed by RSK1DN (D205N) (Fig. 3C). These results show that RSK1 is required for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression. Effects of CREB on IL-1β-induced MUC8 Gene Expression—We examined whether IL-1β-activated RSK1 specifically binds to CREB in human airway cells. Cell extracts obtained after stimulation with IL-1β were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho CREB antibody and then blotted with an anti-phospho RSK1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, protein complex formation was observed between RSK1 and CREB. The control IgG was used as an immunoprecipitating antibody. In addition, a transient phosphorylation of CREB was observed upon the stimulation with IL-1β, reaching the maximum peak at 30 min. These results suggest that IL-1β-induced RSK1 leads to the phosphorylation of CREB in NCI-H292 cells. To confirm whether IL-1β-induced phospho-RSK1 is enzymatically active, we performed an immunocomplex in vitro kinase assay using bacterially expressed GST-CREB as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4B, IL-1β-induced RSK1 activity remarkably increased in cells transfected with W/T RSK1, whereas the overexpression of RSK1 DN diminished IL-1β-induced RSK1 activity. To determine whether CREB plays a role in MUC8 gene expression, we used both forskolin (an activator of adenylate cyclase) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, an inhibitor of AMP phosphodiesterase). The transient phosphorylation of CREB was observed after stimulation with both forskolin and IBMX, and this reached a maximum peak at 10 min (18Song K.S. Lee W.J. Chung K.C. Koo J.S. Yang E.J. Choi J.Y. Yoon J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23242-23250Google Scholar). The cAMP pathway-induced CREB phosphorylation increased MUC8 gene expression (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression was significantly suppressed in cells transfected with plasmid encoding CREBDN (S133A) (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that the activation of CREB is essential for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression via ERK MAPK and RSK1. CREB Activates CRE-mediated Gene Transcription in Response to IL-1β—To determine the DNA binding activity of IL-1β-activated CREB, we performed EMSA using nuclear extracts from NCI-H292 cells after treatment with IL-1β for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 5A, the activity of consensus CRE oligonucleotide remarkably increased in response to IL-1β. To identify specific CRE binding complex, competition and supershift analysis were performed using a 50-fold excess of nonradiolabeled (cold) CRE oligonucleotide and an anti-phospho-CREB antibody, respectively. Specific band was found to be selectively inhibited by the specific CRE competitor and to be supershifted by anti-phospho-CREB antibody. These results indicate that activated CREB binds to a cis-acting element, which we refer to as CRE. Next, we assayed the gene expression of the pCRE-luc construct to determine whether IL-1β exerts a stimulatory effect on the activation of CREB and on the subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription. To investigate the role of CREB phosphorylation on CRE-mediated gene transcription, cells were transfected transiently with pCRE-luc vector only or both pCRE-luc vector and plasmid encoding CREB DN (S133A). Treatment of transfected NCI-H292 cells with IL-1β resulted in increased CRE-mediated gene transcription in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). The expression of CREB containing a mutation of the critical regulatory Ser133 residue was found to significantly inhibit the luciferase activity induced by IL-1β. Mock transfection, used as a negative control, showed no significant induction of CRE-mediated reporter transcription. These results suggest that IL-1β-activated CREB triggers CRE-mediated transcription by binding to CRE. Mucociliary clearance is an important function of the airway epithelium. Human beings inhale noxious gases, air pollutants, bacteria, and viruses through the nose, and these are usually trapped by mucus and removed by ciliary beating toward the nasopharynx. Increased mucus secretion during inflammation may represent a defensive mechanism, and inflammatory mediators increase the ciliary beating of respiratory epithelial cells to promote mucociliary clearance (25Van Der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 398-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Martin L.D. Rochelle L.G. Fischer B.M. Krunkosky T.M. Adler K.B. Eur. Respir.

Invest. 2001; 108: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which MUC8 gene expression is up-regulated by IL-1β remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which MUC8 gene expression is up-regulated by IL-1β in normal human nasal epithelial cells. Our results show that only the activation of ERK MAPK was required for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression, although several reports have concluded that more than one MAPK might be necessary for the signal transduction of various inflammatory mediators (28Bernatchez P.N.

Moreover, the ERK MAPK cascade is known to be activated by G-protein-coupled receptor via: (i) EGFR transactivation (Ras-dependent); (ii) a protein kinase C-dependent, but epidermal growth factor receptor- and Ras-independent, pathway; or (iii) a Ras-independent and cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated pathway (31Liebmann C. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Of these pathways, the activation of ERK MAPK is known to be mainly mediated by Ras (32Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether IL-1β-induced activation of ERK MAPK is Ras-dependent or -independent. The overexpression of Raf1 DN (craf1) and Ras DN (RasN17) mutants did not affect the IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of ERK MAPK and MUC8 gene expression (Fig. 2, C and D). These results show that activation of ERK MAPK by MEK1, as induced by IL-1β, might occur via a Ras/Raf-independent pathway to induce MUC8 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells. Further work is necessary to explore these pathways. To date, the signal molecules involved in the downstream signaling of ERK MAPK, for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression, have not been yet identified. The role of RSK1 and CREB in the downstream signaling of ERK MAPK to induce MUC8 gene expression is a major finding of the present study. The substrates of ERK MAPK are known to be the MSK and RSK family members (33Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Our results show that RSK1 might be essential for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression. In addition, the activation of MSK1 appears to be closely related to IL-1β-induced MUC5AC gene expression by IL-1β in human airway epithelial cells (18Song K.S. Lee W.J. Chung K.C. Koo J.S. Yang E.J. Choi J.Y. Yoon J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23242-23250Google Scholar). Differences in the activations of these kinases by IL-1β may be responsible for differences in target genes. RSK1 phosphorylates several transcription factors, including CREB (34Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), c-Fos (35Chen R.H.

Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that RSK1 phosphorylates Ser133 of CREB (16Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 39Arthur J.S.

Although CREB activation by RSK1 has been established by previous studies in other cells, and CREB is a potent regulator of mucin (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6) gene expression in the p15 arm of chromosome 11 (11p15) (17Van Seuningen I. Pigny P. Perrais M. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 1216-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its role remains unclear in airway epithelial cells. In addition, little is known about the involvement of CREB in MUC8 gene expression. In the present study, the activation of CREB was found, at least in part, essential for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression via ERK MAPK and RSK1. Interestingly, MUC8 gene expression was inhibited in CREB DN (S133A)-transfected cells treated with IL-1β. In addition, treatment with both forskolin and IBMX activated the phosphorylation of CREB and increased MUC8 gene expression (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggest that CREB might be a transcription factor for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression. However, increased MUC8 expression induced by both forskolin and IBMX was less than that induced by IL-1β, indicating that activation by CREB alone is insufficient for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression. These results suggest that a transcription factor, other than CREB, may be required for IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression. We examined whether IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells is a CRE-mediated transcription. We found that the IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of CREB had the DNA binding activity to CRE (Fig. 5A). Moreover, IL-1β-induced CRE activation increased in a time-dependent manner, whereas the overexpression of CREB DN mutant led to a ∼90% decrease in the response of the CRE minimal promoter to IL-1β (Fig. 5B). These results showed that the activation of the cis-element, CRE, appeared closely related to IL-1β-induced MUC8 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells. These results indicate that the MUC8 promoter might have CRE site(s) and the CRE might be an important transcription factor of the MUC8 promoter, like the mucins of 11p15 chromosome (17Van Seuningen I. Pigny P. Perrais M. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 1216-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unfortunately, the promoter and cDNA sequences of the MUC8 gene have not yet been fully identified. Thus, further studies upon the MUC8 promoter seem warranted. In summary, IL-1β was found to induce MUC8 gene expression via the MEK1/ERK pathway. Furthermore, the activations of RSK1 and CREB are a crucial aspect of the intracellular mechanisms that mediate MUC8 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells. Molecular cloning of the MUC8 promoter regulated by various stimuli may yield a deeper insight into ciliated cell differentiation or function. We are deeply grateful to Dr. Jae-Hong Kim for the cDNA construct encoding dominant-negative Raf1 vector."

However, the mechanism by which it promotes cell cycle progression has remained undefined. Using an inducible expression system, we show that constitutively active Cdc42 (Cdc42V12) is sufficient by itself to induce anchorage-independent but not mitogen-independent growth in NIH3T3 cells. However, Cdc42V12 markedly accelerates activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 in response to mitogen. These effects were highly specific, as the kinetics of cyclin D-Cdk4 activation was unaltered. Cdc42V12 promotes Cdk2 activation by selectively inducing cyclin E expression without affecting other regulatory proteins such as the p27 Cdk inhibitor or Cdc25A. Furthermore, Cdc42V12 was able to activate a reporter gene driven by the cyclin E promoter in the absence of exogenous mitogen or adhesion. Cyclin E induction was sensitive to rapamycin but not inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases, implicating p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k) as the relevant mediator. Consistent with this notion, wild type and constitutively active alleles of p70S6k were sufficient to activate the cyclin E promoter. In sum, these studies provide novel insights into the mechanism by which Cdc42 promotes G1 progression.

Rho family GTPases play a central role in controlling cellular proliferation and transformation. Work from many laboratories has demonstrated that members of this family can induce various aspects of the transformed phenotype including mitogen- and anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness in multiple cell types (for reviews, see Refs. 1Van Aelst L.

These effects are elicited through the ability of the GTPases to regulate diverse functions, such as cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal remodeling, survival, adhesion, and vesicular trafficking. Furthermore, many effectors for Rho GTPases have been identified in recent years, and in some cases specific effectors have been linked to distinct responses, such as actin reorganization and cell cycle progression (for reviews, see Refs. 1Van Aelst L.

Several studies have identified proximal effectors of Cdc42 that are dispensable for their ability to induce S phase entry, but none has identified those that are required (7Lamarche N. Tapon N.

One report identified the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein as a distal target of Cdc42 (10Gjoerup O. Lukas J. Bartek J. Willumsen B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18812-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rb plays a central role in inhibiting the activity of the E2F family transcription factors, which are activated during G1 phase and drive expression of genes required for S phase, such as cyclin A (for review, see Ref. 25Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of activated Cdc42 induced hyperphosphorylation of Rb, resulting in the release of E2F. Accordingly, Cdc42 activated a synthetic reporter construct driven by E2F-responsive elements (10Gjoerup O. Lukas J. Bartek J. Willumsen B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18812-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An important unanswered question is the identity of the kinase that mediates Cdc42-induced Rb hyperphosphorylation. Both cyclin D-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 phosphorylate Rb on multiple sites that regulate its ability to bind E2F (26Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 27Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell.

The study above suggested that transient overexpression of activated Cdc42 can induce a modest increase in cyclin D protein (10Gjoerup O. Lukas J. Bartek J. Willumsen B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18812-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, cyclin D-associated kinase activity was not examined. Another report showed that activated Cdc42 more potently stimulates expression of cyclin A (24Philips A. Roux P. Coulon V. Bellanger J.M. Vie A. Vignais M.L. Blanchard J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5911-5917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, cyclin A-Cdk2 activation occurs after Rb phosphorylation in vivo, excluding it as the relevant kinase. Thus, the primary cell cycle target(s) of Cdc42 remain incompletely defined.In the current study we define the effects of Cdc42 on the cell cycle machinery and identify the signaling pathway utilized to promote G1 progression. Using stable NIH3T3 cell lines that inducibly express activated Cdc42 (Cdc42 G12V; Cdc42V12), we show that Cdc42V12 is sufficient by itself to induce anchorage-independent but not mitogen-independent growth. However, Cdc42V12 specifically accelerates cyclin E-Cdk2 activation in response to growth factor. Strikingly, the kinetics of cyclin D-Cdk4 activation was not affected by Cdc42V12. We further demonstrate that Cdc42V12 functions by specifically activating the cyclin E promoter without affecting other regulators of Cdk2, such as p27 or Cdc25A. Induction of the cyclin E promoter by Cdc42V12 was sensitive to rapamycin but not to pharmacological inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases, implicating p70S6k as an important mediator. Consistent with this interpretation, the cyclin E promoter was also activated by co-expression of wild type or constitutively active alleles of p70S6k. Together, these results define a signaling pathway through which Cdc42 contributes to G1 progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% calf serum, Glutamax, and penicillin/streptomycin (5% calf serum/DMEM). The Cdc42V12-expressing cells were derived from LAP3/NIH3T3 cells (denoted LAP3 in the text), which express the Lac repressor/VP16 activator (a generous give from Drs. Lester Lau and Dmitri Pestov) (30Pestov D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12549-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LAP3 clones expressing HA-tagged Cdc42V12 were isolated by co-transfection of HA-Cdc42V12/pX11 with a hygromycin resistance plasmid. Clonal cell lines were isolated and maintained in 5% calf serum/DMEM. Expression of HA-Cdc42V12 was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). Rapamycin, SB203580, and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem. For plating of cells in the absence of adhesion, cells were trypsinized then replated in tissue culture dishes coated with 1% agarose or in the presence of 1 μm cytochalasin D, as previously described (24Philips A.

IPTG was either omitted or added at a concentration of 1 mm. Cells were grown for 5–7 days, supplementing with 1 mm IPTG every second day.Cyclin Kinase Assays—LAP3 or CV12/LAP3 cells were treated with 1 mm IPTG overnight where indicated, then starved for 24 h in 0.5% FBS/DMEM. PDGF (20 ng/ml) was added to induce cell cycle entry, and cells were harvested at various times. For cyclin E kinase assays, cells were lysed in Cdk2 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Brij-35, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Clarified supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin E antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 2–3 h. Immunocomplexes were washed 3 times in Cdk2 lysis buffer, once in ST buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), then once in 1.5× kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 1.5× kinase buffer, and kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of Cdk2 kinase mixture containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 μm ATP, and 4 μg of histone HI (Sigma). Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography to assess histone phosphorylation. For cyclin D kinase assays, cells were lysed in Cdk4 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol). Clarified supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin D antibody and protein G-Sepharose for 2–3 h. Immunocomplexes were washed 4 times in Cdk4 lysis buffer, once in (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), then once in Cdk4 kinase buffer (75 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm sodium vanadate). Samples were resuspended in 20 μl of Cdk4 kinase buffer, and kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of Cdk4 kinase mixture containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Rb (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Adams, Fox Chase Cancer Center). Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography.Cyclin E Promoter Activation Assays—LAP3 or CV12/LAP3 cells were seeded at 2.4–2.7 × 106 cells/10-cm dish the day before transfection. The following day, the cyclin E-luciferase reporter plasmid was transfected using LipofectAMINE. After a 4–5-h incubation, cells were allowed to recover overnight in 5% calf serum/DMEM in the presence or absence of IPTG. The next morning, cells were trypsinized, then replated in starvation medium (0.5% FBS/DMEM) in the absence or presence of IPTG and the various pharmacological inhibitors. Cells were harvested the following day according to manufacturer instructions (Promega Corp.). Lysates were also immunoblotted in parallel with p70S6k or mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies to confirm that equal amounts of protein were present in each sample (data not shown). For co-transfections of cyclin E-luciferase with p70S6k, CV12/LAP3 cells were seeded at 3.0–3.4 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish. Cyclin E-luciferase and p70S6k cDNAs were transfected at a 1:1 ratio, and cells were treated as described above.Antibodies—Anti-HA, cyclin E, cyclin D, Cdc25A, Cdc42, and p27 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. Cyclin E antibody was also purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-glutathione S-transferase was affinity-purified from rabbits immunized with glutathione S-transferase peptide. Anti-Erk and p70S6k antisera were kindly provided by Dr. John Blenis. Anti-p70S6k anti-serum raised against the C terminus of the rat enzyme was used for immunoblotting; antiserum raised against the N terminus (anti-p70S6k-N2) was used for immunoprecipitation.Co-immunoprecipitation of p70S6k and Cdc42V12—CV12/LAP3 cells were treated with IPTG as indicated, then lysed and immunoprecipitated as previously described (23Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Anti-p70S6k-N2 and pre-immune sera were covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated on 12% Laemmli gels; the top portion was immunoblotted with anti-p70S6k, and the bottom portion was immunoblotted with anti-HA.RESULTSCdc42V12 Induces Anchorage-independent but Not Mitogen-independent Growth—To elucidate the mechanism by which Cdc42 stimulates progression through G1 phase of the cell cycle, we generated NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Cdc42V12 in an inducible manner (CV12/LAP3). Expression of Cdc42V12 was controlled by a chimeric Lac repressor-VP16 protein, which drives expression of target genes in the presence of IPTG. As seen in Fig. 1A, expression of Cdc42V12 was strongly induced in the presence of IPTG. Anti-Cdc42 immunoblotting revealed that the transgene was expressed at a level below that of endogenous Cdc42. Strikingly, however, this level was sufficient to induce anchorage-independent growth, as judged by the ability of Cdc42V12 to form colonies in soft agar strictly in the presence of IPTG (Fig. 1B). Approximately 10% of CV12/LAP3 cells seeded in the presence of IPTG gave rise to colonies containing at least four cells; ∼5% gave rise to macroscopically visible colonies as typified in Fig. 1B. In contrast, LAP3 or CV12/LAP3 in the absence of IPTG remained as single cells in suspension.To determine whether Cdc42V12 could also induce mitogen-independent growth, S phase entry was monitored using tritiated thymidine incorporation of adherent cells. No difference in thymidine incorporation was observed between CV12/LAP3 or parental LAP3 cells under conditions of serum starvation or mitogen addition (data not shown). These results were confirmed using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (data not shown). Thus, Cdc42V12 is sufficient to induce only a subset of hallmarks of the transformed phenotype, namely anchorage-independent but not mitogen-independent growth, in NIH3T3 cells.Cdc42V12 Accelerates PDGF-dependent Activation of Cyclin E- but Not Cyclin-D-associated Kinase—The inability of Cdc42 to induce mitogen-independent growth is consistent with a previous report using Rat1 fibroblasts stably and inducibly expressing Cdc42V12 (11Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, other studies suggest that Cdc42 can promote Rb phosphorylation when transiently overexpressed (10Gjoerup O. Lukas J. Bartek J. Willumsen B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18812-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that it can induce specific molecular events that contribute to G1 progression. We, therefore, undertook a detailed analysis of the cell cycle machinery, examining cyclin D- and cyclin E-associated kinase activity. CV12/LAP3 or parental LAP3 cells were grown either in the absence or presence of IPTG, starved of serum for 24 h, then stimulated for various times with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Anti-cyclin E or anti-cyclin D immunoprecipitates were prepared followed by in vitro kinase assays using histone HI or Rb as substrate, respectively. Under starved conditions, no induction of cyclin D- or cyclin E-associated kinase activity was seen in CV12/LAP3 cells treated with IPTG, consistent with the notion that Cdc42V12 is insufficient by itself to drive cell cycle entry (the modest increase in cyclin E-Cdk2 activity in CV12/LAP3 treated with IPTG was not consistently observed) (Fig. 2A). However, a marked acceleration of cyclin E-Cdk2 activation was observed in response to PDGF in induced CV12/LAP3 cells. As seen in Fig. 2A, in parental cells (LAP3) treated with IPTG or CV12/LAP3 in the absence of IPTG, cyclin E activity began to increase at 9–12 h and peaked 15 h after the addition of PDGF. In contrast, in CV12/LAP3 cells treated with IPTG, cyclin E-Cdk2 activation was accelerated, first appearing at 6 h and peaking at 9–12 h. Thus, Cdc42V12 accelerates mitogen-induced activation of cyclin E-Cdk2.Fig. 2CV12/LAP3 cells exhibit accelerated cyclin E-Cdk2 activation but not cyclin D-Cdk4 activation. CV12/LAP3 or parental LAP3 cells were grown in the presence or absence of IPTG as indicated, starved, and then stimulated for the indicated times with PDGF (20 ng/ml). Anti-cyclin E (A) or anti-cyclin D (B) immunoprecipitates were prepared and subjected to kinase assays using histone H1 or glutathione S-transferase-Rb as substrates, respectively. C, whole cell lysates from A were immunoblotted with anti-HA to confirm expression of HA-CV12. Similar results were obtained using lysates from B (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given that activation of cyclin D normally precedes cyclin E, we analyzed whether cyclin D-Cdk4 activity was similarly accelerated in CV12/LAP3 cells. Surprisingly, the kinetics of cyclin D activation were identical in parental LAP3 cells and CV12/LAP3 cells regardless of the presence of IPTG (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that signals generated by Cdc42 feed into the cell cycle machinery downstream of cyclin D activation and specifically promote activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes.Cdc42V12 Activates the Cyclin E Promoter in a Mitogen- and Adhesion-independent Manner—The activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 is a multi-step process that requires the coordinated induction of cyclin E mRNA and dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites on Cdk2 as well as degradation of the p27 Cdk inhibitor. Any of these events is a potential target for Cdc42 in modulating cyclin E-Cdk2 activation. We first examined expression of cyclin E by immunoblotting. In LAP3 and uninduced CV12/LAP3, cyclin E levels were low under serum-starved conditions and increased upon PDGF addition (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, induction of Cdc42V12 expression in the absence of mitogen was sufficient to drive cyclin E expression to levels induced by PDGF.Fig. 3Cdc42V12 specifically activates the cyclin E promoter in a mitogen- and adhesion-independent manner. A, CV12/LAP3 or LAP3 cells were starved for 24 h in the absence or presence of IPTG. Cells were stimulated with PDGF (20 ng/ml) for 15 h, lysed, then subjected to immunoblotting using anti-cyclin E antibody. B, CV12/LAP3 or LAP3 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the murine cyclin E promoter. After transfection, cells were treated with IPTG or not overnight, then starved for 24 h in the presence of IPTG as indicated. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured. Data are represented as fold activation over LAP3 cells grown in the absence of IPTG. For cytoD treatment, cells were resuspended the morning after transfection and re-seeded with cytoD (1 μm) and IPTG in the absence of serum. C, CV12/LAP3 or LAP3 cells were grown in the presence or absence of IPTG and then starved for 24 h, again with or without IPTG. After PDGF stimulation for 15 h, cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-p27 antibody. D, cells were grown as in B, except PDGF stimulation was for 8 h. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Cdc25A antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the above effects reflected a transcriptional response, we examined the ability of Cdc42V12 to activate a luciferase reporter construct driven by the murine cyclin E promoter. Cells were grown in the presence or absence of IPTG, starved, then assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, luciferase activity was strongly increased in the presence of IPTG in CV12/LAP3 cells. The effect of Cdc42V12 on the cyclin E promoter was specific, as no activation of the cyclin D promoter was observed (data not shown). Together, these data reveal that Cdc42V12 is sufficient to induce cyclin E expression in the absence of mitogen.Because Cdc42V12 induces anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 1), we wished to test whether this correlated with its ability to induce cyclin E expression in the absence of adhesion. Adhesion-mediated proliferative signals are conveyed through integrin-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (for review, see Ref. 32Assoian R.K. Zhu X. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A commonly used method for testing whether a signaling event can occur in the absence of adhesion is to test its sensitivity to cytochalasin D (cytoD), which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton (33Bottazzi M.E. Zhu X. Bohmer R.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We found that Cdc42V12 was able to fully activate the cyclin E promoter in cells treated with cytoD; in fact, activity was consistently enhanced (Fig. 3B). Thus, Cdc42V12 induces activation of the cyclin E promoter in an adhesion- and mitogen-independent manner.We next examined whether Cdc42V12 might regulate other events associated with cyclin E-Cdk2 activation. Previous reports suggest that Rho family GTPases contribute to the degradation of the Cdk2 inhibitor p27 (37Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K.

However, induction of Cdc42V12 expression had no effect on the accumulation of p27 in serum-starved cells (Fig. 3C). We also examined expression of Cdc25A, the phosphatase that mediates de-phosphorylation of inhibitory sites on Cdk2 (39Hoffmann I. Draetta G"
https://openalex.org/W1997624109,"We investigated putidaredoxin-induced structural changes in carbonmonoxy P450cam by using NMR spectroscopy. The resonance from the β-proton of the axial cysteine was upfield shifted by 0.12 ppm upon the putidaredoxin binding, indicating that the axial cysteine approaches to the heme-iron by about 0.1 Å. The approach of the axial cysteine to the heme-iron would enhance the electronic donation from the axial thiolate to the heme-iron, resulting in the enhanced heterolysis of the dioxygen bond. In addition to the structural perturbation on the axial ligand, the structural changes in the substrate and ligand binding site were observed. The resonances from the 5-exo- and 9-methyl-protons of d-camphor, which were newly identified in this study, were upfield shifted by 1.28 and 0.20 ppm, respectively, implying that d-camphor moves to the heme-iron by 0.15–0.7 Å. Based on the radical rebound mechanism, the approach of d-camphor to the heme-iron could promote the oxygen transfer reaction. On the other hand, the downfield shift of the resonance from the γ-methyl group of Thr-252 reflects the movement of the side chain away from the heme-iron by ∼0.25 Å. Because Thr-252 regulates the heterolysis of the dioxygen bond, the positional rearrangement of Thr-252 might assist the scission of the dioxygen bond. We, therefore, conclude that putidaredoxin induces the specific heme environmental changes of P450cam, which would facilitate the oxygen activation and the oxygen transfer reaction.

Cytochrome P450 Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995Crossref Google Scholar). The P450 catalysis reaction requires two electrons from NADH or NADPH through the redox-linked proteins. In microsomal P450s, the electron transfer (ET) from NADPH to P450s is mediated by NADPH-P450 reductase containing FMN and FAD as the redox centers. In contrast, the electron from NADH or NADPH is sequentially transferred to ferredoxin reductase, ferredoxin, and finally P450 in mitochondrial and bacterial systems. The ET reaction between P450 and its redox partner is essential for the subsequent activation of molecular oxygen and the monooxygenation reaction.To understand the mechanism of the ET reaction in P450 and its redox partner system, the ET reaction between cytochrome P450cam (P450cam) from Pseudomonas putida, one of the bacterial P450s, and its redox partner, putidaredoxin (Pdx), has intensively been investigated. P450cam catalyzes the regio- and stereo-specific hydroxylation of its substrate, d-camphor (1Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450 Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry.

Chem. 1968; 25: 3543-3546Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) by accepting two electrons from NADH. The ET from NADH to P450cam is sequentially mediated by a flavin group of putidaredoxin reductase and a [2Fe-2S] center of putidaredoxin (Pdx). With the availability of the P450cam (3Poulos T.L.

These studies demonstrated that Pdx interacts with the proximal surface of P450cam through the electrostatic interaction (12Unno M. Shimada H. Toba Y. Makino R. Ishimura Y. J. Biol.

Beratan D.N. Vilker V.L. J. Am. Chem.

Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipscomb et al. (18Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carried out the mixing of oxy-P450cam with several electron donors, including the non-physiological electron donors as well as the physiological redox partner, Pdx, and examined the formation of the hydroxylation product. Low potential iron-sulfur protein such as spinach ferredoxin and bovine adrenodoxin can donate an electron to ferric P450cam (the first ET) but yield no hydroxylation products. On the other hand, the addition of rat liver cytochrome b 5 (cyt b 5) and bacterial rubredoxins to oxy-P450cam can yield the hydroxylation product, whereas these non-physiological electron donors cannot transfer the first electron to ferric P450cam. Thus, the specific complex formation between P450cam and Pdx is required for the turnover reaction.We have studied the mechanism of the specific complex formation between P450cam and Pdx (19Aoki M. Ishimori K. Fukada H. Takahashi K. Morishima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Furukawa Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12983-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and clarified that the P450cam·Pdx system exhibits unique features compared with other protein·protein ET complexes. Aoki et al. (19Aoki M. Ishimori K. Fukada H. Takahashi K. Morishima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have reported the negative values for the changes in the enthalpy and entropy for the formation of the P450cam·Pdx complex determined from the isothermal titration and suggested that the recognition mechanism between P450cam and Pdx is similar to that of the antigen·antibody complex formation. A subsequent study performed by Furukawa and Morishima (20Furukawa Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12983-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) examined the osmotic pressure dependence of the association between P450cam and Pdx and revealed that water molecules participate in the complex formation and cause the negative entropy change upon the complexation of P450cam with Pdx.Other important feature of the P450cam·Pdx complex is that Pdx induces conformational changes of P450cam upon the complex formation (21Unno M.

EPR and resonance Raman studies clearly exhibited that the complex formation with Pdx converts the spin-state of ferric P450cam from the high to low spin state (21Unno M. Christian J.F. Benson D.E. Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. Champion P.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6614-6620Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Associated with the change of the spin-state, the heme-iron axial ligand (Fe–S) stretching mode is upshifted by 3 cm–1 (21Unno M. Christian J.F. Benson D.E. Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. Champion P.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6614-6620Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the ferrous-CO form, the Fe–CO and FeC–O stretching modes indicate 2 cm–1 upshift and 8 cm–1 downshift, respectively, by the binding of reduced Pdx, respectively (29Makino R. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Uno T. Nishimura Y. Tsuboi M. Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Raman Spectroscopy. The Chemical Society of Japan, Tokyo1984: 492-493Google Scholar). Recent multidimensional NMR study on the complex of P450cam with Pdx showed that the binding of Pdx structurally perturbs the several regions involving the substrate access channel in P450cam (28Pochapsky S.S. Pochapsky T.C. Wei J.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5649-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).These structural changes of P450cam upon the binding of Pdx are supposed to be essential for the enzymatic activity of P450cam. Shimada et al. (30Shimada H. Nagano S. Ariga Y. Unno M. Egawa T. Hishiki T. Ishimura Y. Masuya F. Obata T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9363-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Shimada H. Nagano S. Hori H. Ishimura Y. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) found that the mutations at the putative Pdx binding site, Arg-109 or Arg-112, inhibit the conformational changes in P450cam and suppress the hydroxylation activity to 1–500 μm/min/μm heme corresponding to 1/1000 to 1/3 of that for the wild-type enzyme (12Unno M. Shimada H. Toba Y. Makino R. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17869-17874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Shimada H. Nagano S. Hori H. Ishimura Y. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the Pdx-induced structural changes of P450cam have been supposed to be crucial for the P450cam catalysis, it is still unclear how the conformational changes in the active site of P450cam promote the turnover reaction. It is strongly desirable to identify the detailed structural changes of P450cam upon the binding of Pdx.To clarify the conformational changes by the binding of Pdx to P450cam and discuss the functional significance on the catalytic oxygenation reaction, we characterized the Pdx-induced conformational changes of P450cam by using NMR spectroscopy. In the diamagnetic ferrous-CO form of P450cam, the ring-current of the porphyrin separates several resonances of the protons near the heme-iron from the crowded signal region between 0 and 10 ppm (32Dalvit C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Berzinis A.P. Traylor T.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 1: 229-235Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Mabbutt B.C. Wright P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 832: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In fact, Mouro et al. (35Mouro C. Bondon A. Simonneaux G. Jung C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported that the β-proton of the axial Cys in carbonmonoxy P450cam indicates the resolved peak at –2.76 ppm. However, most of the ring-current-shifted signals of the ferrous-CO form of P450cam have not yet been assigned. Therefore, we first assigned several ring-current-shifted NMR signals by comparing wild-type and mutants of P450cam in the absence and presence of the substrate and substrate analogues. With the help of the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum, we have successfully assigned the signals arising from d-camphor and Thr-252. Based on these signal assignments, we examined the structural effects of the Pdx binding on the heme environmental structure. As a control experiment for the Pdx-induced structural changes, we also measured the NMR spectrum for carbonmonoxy P450cam in the presence of cyt b 5, whose binding site in P450cam is supposed to overlap with that of Pdx. The detailed information on the structural changes of the heme pocket upon the binding of Pdx allowed us to discuss the functional significance of the Pdx-induced structural changes in P450cam.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Proteins—Wild-type P450cam was expressed in a strain of Escherichia coli, BL21, as an inclusion body. Following the procedures described in our previous reports (36Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 37Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Hori H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we performed the heme reconstitution and the purification of P450cam.P450cam mutants (T252A and T252G) were expressed in an E. coli strain, JM109, and purified as previously reported (38Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Purified proteins with the R/Z value (A 392/A 280) greater than 1.5 were employed in this study. The purified samples were dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm d-camphor and stocked at –70 °C. The substrate-free sample was prepared by passing the substrate bound P450cam through a G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4. The buffer of the eluted sample was exchanged to 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl.Construction of the expression vector for the Asp-38 → Asn mutant of Pdx (D38N) was reported by our group (14Aoki M. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Wild-type Pdx and the D38N mutant were expressed in an E. coli strain, RR1, and were purified by the method of Gunsalus and Wagner (39Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with a minor modification (40Aoki M. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Wada Y. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 272: 80-88Crossref Google Scholar). The preparation of Pdx used in this study had a A 325 nm to A 280 nm ratio of at least 0.60. The sample was dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl and 80 μl/100 ml β-mercaptoethanol. β-Mercaptoethanol was removed from the solution before the NMR measurements to avoid the interference of the complex formation with P450cam.Rat liver cyt b 5, whose C-terminal membrane binding domain was deleted, was used in this study. The expression and purification of cyt b 5 were carried out by using a method described previously (41Beck von Bodman S. Schuler M.A. Jollie D.R. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9443-9447Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Purified proteins with the R/Z value (A 412/A 280) greater than 5.5 were employed. The purified samples were dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl and 1-mm d-camphor.NMR Measurements—One-dimensional 1H NMR measurements were performed on a BRUKER Avance DRX500 spectrometer at 40 °C. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual water signal that was calibrated against tetramethylsilane. The WET and PRESAT pulse sequences were used to minimize the water signal (42Ogg R.J. Kingsley P.B. Taylor J.S. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). One-dimensional NOE experiments with 30–100 ms of the mixing times were performed using the standard pulse sequence (43Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wutrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional NOESY, COSY and TOCSY spectra were recorded with a BRUKER Avance DRX600 equipped with a cryo-cooled probe at 25 °C by using the standard pulse sequence (43Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wutrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar, 44Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 45Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar).NMR samples were prepared by the following procedures. Substrate-bound P450cam was dissolved in 10% D2O or 100% D2O containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, and 1-mm d-camphor at pH (pD) 7.4. Substrate-free sample was dissolved in 10% D2O or 100% D2O containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl at pH (pD) 7.4. The d-camphor analogue-bound form of P450cam was prepared by use of the same buffer as the substrate-free sample but saturated with one of the d-camphor analogues: norcamphor, adamantanone, or 3-bromocamphor. Concentrations of P450cam in the NMR samples were 0.2 mm and 0.5–1.0 mm for the one-dimensional NMR and one-dimensional NOE/two-dimensional NOESY measurements, respectively. 500 μl of samples was transferred to the NMR tubes, which were capped with a rubber septum. After flushing with argon gas, samples were reduced by the injection of a small aliquot of degassed sodium dithionite solution. CO gas was anaerobically introduced into the NMR tube to prepare the ferrous-CO form of P450cam.Measurement of the Dissociation Constant (Kd) of Reduced Pdx with the Ferrous-CO Form of P450cam—We measured one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of the ferrous-CO form of P450cam in the presence of various concentrations of Pdxred from 50 μm to 2 mm. The dissociation constant (K d) of the complex between Pdxred and the ferrous-CO form of P450cam was calculated by the shifts of the NMR signals upon the binding of Pdxred. We confirmed that the rate of equilibrium between Pdx-bound P450cam and Pdx-free P450cam was fast in our experimental condition (see “Results” session). In this fast exchange limit, K d can be determined by Equation 1 (46Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 153-182Google Scholar), δobs=δ0+δmax-δ0[P450]tot×Kd+[P450]tot+[Pdx]tot-(Kd+[P450]tot+[Pdx]tot)2-4·[P450]tot·[Pdx]tot2(Eq. 1) where δobs denotes the chemical shift of P450cam in the titration experiment. δmax and δ0 represent the chemical shifts of P450cam in the presence and absence of Pdxred, respectively. [P450]tot and [Pdx]tot correspond to the total concentrations of the ferrous-CO form of P450cam and Pdxred in the sample solution, respectively.RESULTSAssignments of NMR Signals for the Ferrous-CO Form of P450cam— Fig. 1 illustrates the NMR spectra for the ferrous-CO forms of P450cam in the absence and presence of the substrate, d-camphor, and substrate analogues, showing several well resolved and ring-current-shifted resonances in the upfield region (35Mouro C. Bondon A. Simonneaux G. Jung C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The intensities of the signals in Fig. 1 were unchanged in the deuterated solution (data not shown). In these ring-current-shifted signals, the signal a observed at –2.76 ppm in the presence of d-camphor has already been assigned to the β-proton of the axial cysteine, Cys-357 (35Mouro C. Bondon A. Simonneaux G. Jung C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, other ring-current-shifted signals b, c, and d have not yet been assigned.The most prominent spectral change by the binding of d-camphor (traces A and E) is the increased intensity of the signal b. Based on the intensity of the signal a, the intensity of the signal b in the absence of the substrate (trace A) corresponds to three protons. The intensity of the signal b was increased to six protons by addition of d-camphor (trace E), indicating that a signal of three protons, which is designated as the signal x, overlapped with the signal b in the presence of d-camphor. It should be noted that the increase of the intensity of the signal b was not observed in the presence of the substrate analogue, norcamphor (trace B) or adamantanone (trace C), whereas the addition of 3-bromocamphor (trace D) increased the intensity of the signal b. These observations suggest that the signal x might be assigned to one of the methyl groups, 8- or 9-methyl groups, attached to the C7 position of d-camphor.To further examine the assignments of the signal x, we measured the two-dimensional NMR spectra, NOESY, COSY, and TOCSY, of the ferrous-CO form of P450cam in the presence of d-camphor. Unfortunately, however, we could not obtain the high quality COSY and TOCSY spectra due to the large molecular weight of P450cam (M r = 46,000) (data not shown) (47Wüthrich K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the assignment of the signal x was validated by examining the NOESY data in relationship to the crystal structure of carbonmonoxy P450cam. Fig. 2 depicts the upfield region of the NOESY spectra for carbonmonoxy P450cam in the presence and absence of d-camphor at 25 °C. Due to the low temperature to avoid the denaturation of the samples during the NOESY measurements, the chemical shifts for the ring-current-shifted signals in the one-dimensional spectra at the top of Fig. 2 were different from those at 40 °C (Fig. 1). In the absence of d-camphor, the signals b (–1.23 ppm), c (–1.14 ppm), and d (–1.04 ppm) were observed. On the other hand, in the d-camphor-bound enzyme, the signal at –0.90 was observed as a resolved signal, and the signals –1.14 and –1.24 ppm were observed as shoulder signals due to the overlapping with the signal at –1.20 ppm. The signal at –1.23 ppm (signal b) in the substrate-free P450cam gave NOE cross-peaks with the signals at 0.07 (b1), 1.56 (b2), 3.96 (b3), 4.38 (b4), and 4.94 ppm (b5) (red spectrum in Fig. 2), which are the same NOE pattern observed for the shoulder peak at –1.24 ppm in the d-camphor-bound enzyme (black spectrum in Fig. 2). This indicates that the signal at –1.24 ppm in the d-camphor-bound enzyme corresponds to the signal b. The signal at –1.14 ppm (signal c) in the substrate-free enzyme exhibited the NOE cross-peaks (c1, c2, c3, and c4) as found for the signal at –1.14 ppm in the d-camphor-bound enzyme, showing that the signal at –1.14 ppm in the d-camphor-bound enzyme is derived from the protons that give the signal c in the substrate-free form. The signal at –1.04 ppm (signal d in red spectrum of Fig. 2) in substrate-free P450cam displayed strong NOE cross-peaks with the signal from the α-meso proton of the heme (9.74 ppm) (d4) and the signals at 1.33 (d1), 4.01 (d2), and 4.19 ppm (d3), and the same NOE pattern was also observed for the signal at –0.90 ppm in the d-camphor-bound enzyme. These results clearly confirm that the remaining signal at –1.20 ppm (signal x in the black spectrum) is derived from the substrate, d-camphor. It should be noted here that the signal x shows NOEs to the 8-methyl-(3.43 ppm) and δ-mesoprotons (10.17 ppm) of the heme (black spectrum in Fig. 2). Because both of the 8-methyl- and δ-mesoprotons of the heme are located near the 9-methyl group of d-camphor in the crystal structure of the ferrous-CO form of P450cam (48Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), we can unambiguously assign the signal x to the 9-methyl group of d-camphor.Fig. 2Two-dimensional NOESY spectra of the ferrous-CO form of P450cam at 25 °C. The spectra of d-camphor-bound wild-type P450cam, substrate-free wild-type P450cam, and the T252A mutant are shown with black, red, and green, respectively. The top panel represents the one-dimensional NMR spectra of carbonmonoxy P450cam. The signal x gives NOE cross-peaks with the signal d, 8-methyl, and δ-meso protons of the heme. The signal d exhibits NOE cross-peaks with the signal x, α-meso proton of the heme. The sample condition is 0.7–1 mm P450cam in 100% D2O of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pD 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl for the substrate-free enzyme, and 1-mm d-camphor for d-camphor-bound wild-type P450cam and the T252A mutant.

https://openalex.org/W1997681117,"Understanding the role of partially folded intermediate states in the folding mechanism of a protein is a crucial yet very difficult problem. We exploited a kinetic approach to demonstrate that a transient intermediate of a thermostable member of the widely studied cytochrome c family (cytochrome c552 from Thermus thermophilus) is indeed on-pathway. This is the first clear indication of an obligatory intermediate in the folding mechanism of a cytochrome c. The fluorescence properties of this intermediate demonstrate that the relative position of the heme and of the only tryptophan residue cannot correspond to their native orientation. Based on an analysis of the three-dimensional structure of cytochrome c552, we propose an interpretation of the data which explains the residual fluorescence of the intermediate and is consistent with the established role played by some conserved interhelical interactions in the folding of other members of this family. A limited set of topologically conserved contacts may guide the folding of evolutionary distant cytochromes c through the same partially structured state, which, however, can play different kinetic roles, acting either as an intermediate or a transition state."
https://openalex.org/W2044167776,"The de novo design and biophysical characterization of two 60-residue peptides that dimerize to fold as parallel coiled-coils with different hydrophobic core clustering is described. Our goal was to investigate whether designing coiled-coils with identical hydrophobicity but with different hydrophobic clustering of non-polar core residues (each contained 6 Leu, 3 Ile, and 7 Ala residues in the hydrophobic core) would affect helical content and protein stability. The disulfide-bridged P3 and P2 differed dramatically in α-helical structure in benign conditions. P3 with three hydrophobic clusters was 98% α-helical, whereas P2 was only 65% α-helical. The stability profiles of these two analogs were compared, and the enthalpy and heat capacity changes upon denaturation were determined by measuring the temperature dependence by circular dichroism spectroscopy and confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that P3 assembled into a stable α-helical two-stranded coiled-coil and exhibited a native protein-like cooperative two-state transition in thermal melting, chemical denaturation, and calorimetry experiments. Although both peptides have identical inherent hydrophobicity (the hydrophobic burial of identical non-polar residues in equivalent heptad coiled-coil positions), we found that the context dependence of an additional hydrophobic cluster dramatically increased stability of P3 (ΔTm ≈ 18 °C and Δ[urea]½ ≈ 1.5 m) as compared with P2. These results suggested that hydrophobic clustering significantly stabilized the coiled-coil structure and may explain how long fibrous proteins like tropomyosin maintain chain integrity while accommodating polar or charged residues in regions of the protein hydrophobic core.

These results suggested that hydrophobic clustering significantly stabilized the coiled-coil structure and may explain how long fibrous proteins like tropomyosin maintain chain integrity while accommodating polar or charged residues in regions of the protein hydrophobic core. Understanding protein folding remains a challenging problem: how does information encoded in the amino acid sequence translate into the three-dimensional structure necessary for protein function? Although hydrophobic interactions are generally accepted as the predominant source of free energy change that maintains the folded state, this non-specific stabilization does not describe how the “hydrophobic collapse” guides the formation of specific secondary structure (α-helices and β-sheets) in the final tertiary and quaternary structure in the native protein. The concomitant model suggests that the hydrophobic collapse restricts the conformation of the polypeptide chain into a “molten globule,” thus facilitating secondary structure folding in this limited conformational context (1Dill K.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1166-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Examples of hydrophobic interactions participating in the early events of protein folding are observed via stopped flow fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in apomyogloblin (2Yao J. Chung J. Eliezer D. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 12: 3561-3571Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and cytochrome c (3Colon W. Elove G.A. Wakem L.P. Sherman F. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5538-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), illustrating the importance of the packing of non-polar residues in stabilizing helix-helix interactions. Recently, non-polar residues have also been observed to form non-native hydrophobic clustering in denatured proteins (4Shortle D. Ackerman M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 5Klein-Seetharaman J. Oikawa M. Grimshaw S.B. Wirmer J. Duchardt E. Ueda T. Imoto T. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. Schwalbe H. Science. 2002; 295: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and the authors postulated that non-native hydrophobic interactions can stabilize the long range order of the protein scaffold via an intermediate not observed in the folded state, thus indirectly guiding the extended polypeptide chain toward the correct native fold. Such an observation suggests that the amino acid sequence encodes for structural characteristics other than that of the native fold; in other words, the hydrophobic patterning in the sequence encodes the pathway that ultimately leads to the native functional state. Considering that hydrophobic interactions mediate protein folding both in the folded and the unfolded state, several questions arise: 1) How does a cluster of non-polar residues contribute to stability? 2) Is the free energy derived from the burial of hydrophobic residues simply a sum of the energy derived from the removal of non-polar surface area from aqueous medium? 3) Does hydrophobic clustering enhance stability via favorable enthalpic, geometric packing, and van der Waals interactions? The two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil is the simplest protein fold consisting of two amphipathic α-helices wound around one another forming a left-handed supercoil stabilized by hydrophobic burial (6Hodges R.S. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Semchuk P.D. Pept. Res. 1990; 3: 123-137PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhou N.E. Zhu B.-Y. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All coiled-coils share a characteristic heptad (7-residue) repeat denoted as ( abcdefg) n in which non-polar residues occupy the a and d positions, forming an amphipathic surface where non-polar interactions allowed assembly of two-, three-, and higher oligomeric states (8Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The quantitative contribution of 20 amino acids in positions a and d and their effects on protein stability and oligomerization state have been determined (9Wagschal K. Tripet B. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 785-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Wagschal K. Tripet B. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 11: 2312-2329Google Scholar, 11Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, the secondary structure formation and hydrophobic collapse of coiled-coils are tightly coupled and cooperative since single-stranded amphipathic α-helices are unstable in aqueous medium. This hydrophobic surface where amphipathic α-helices interact via hydrophobic interactions provides an ideal model to test the effects of hydrophobic clustering. We postulated that hydrophobic clustering in the core of coiled-coils would have a significant influence on secondary structure formation and protein stability. Here we present the de novo design and characterization of two α-helical coiled-coils that have the same inherent hydrophobicity, i.e. the identical hydrophobic core residues (6 Leu, 3 Ile, and 7 Ala residues) but with different clustering of large and small hydrophobic core residues (see Fig. 1.). Their biophysical characteristics are compared by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), 1The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism spectroscopy; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MBHA, copoly(styrene, 1% divinylbenzene)-4-methylbenzhydrylamine-HCl; TFE, trifluoroethanol.1The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism spectroscopy; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MBHA, copoly(styrene, 1% divinylbenzene)-4-methylbenzhydrylamine-HCl; TFE, trifluoroethanol. analytical ultracentrifugation, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results are discussed in the context of non-polar residue clustering enhancing protein stability. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides were synthesized by automated solid-phase methodology described previously (12Hodges R.S. Semchuk P.D. Taneja A.K. Kay C.M. Parker J.M. Mant C.T. Pept. Res. 1988; 1: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sereda T.J. Mant C.T. Quinn A.M. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by conventional t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry (reviewed in Ref. 14Merrifield B. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer as described previously (15Kwok S.C. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the polypeptide chain was assembled on copoly(styrene, 1% divinylbenzene)-4-methylbenzhydrylamine-HCl (MBHA) resin, 100–200 mesh, substitution of 0.73 mmol amino groups/g (Novabiochem). The following side chain-protecting groups were used: benzyl (Thr, Ser), cyclohexyl (Asp), 4-methylbenzyl (Cys), trityl (Asn), and tosyl (Arg). A peptide resin core (1.0 g of MBHA resin containing 0.6 mmol of peptide chain was swelled and washed repeatedly with dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylformamide in a 25-ml polypropylene solid-phase extraction reservoir. Activation reagent O-benzotriazol-1-yl-1,1,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (0.45 m) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide/dichloromethane/dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (85:10:5 v/v/v) and reacted with excess t-butyloxycarbonyl-protected amino acid (1.1 equivalent to mmol of polypeptide chain) and excess diisopropylethylamine (1.5 equivalent to mmol polypeptide chain bound to resin) for 5 min. The activated amino acid ester (4.0 equivalent excess as compared with mmol of polypeptide chain bound to resin) was then coupled onto the solid-phase support by agitation for 1 h. Excess unreacted amino acids were removed by three alternating washes of dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylformamide. Cleavage of the t-butyloxycarbonyl and side chain-protecting groups and the subsequent release of the completed peptides from the MBHA resin support was achieved with hydrogen fluoride containing scavengers, 10% (v/v) anisole, and 1% (v/v) 1,2 ethanedithiol, magnetically stirred for 60 min in a reaction vessel with the temperature controlled at (–4 °C) by immersion in a sodium chloride water bath. The peptide resin was then washed three times with cold diethyl ether to remove scavengers and amino acid-protecting groups. Subsequent resin extraction with glacial acetic acid and overnight lyopholization yielded the crude peptide. Crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase chromatography (reviewed in Ref. 16Mant C.T. Kondejewski L.H. Cachia P.J. Monera O.D. Hodges R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 426-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) on a Zorbax semipreparative SB-C8 column (250 × 9.4 mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) by linear AB gradient elution (0.2% increasing acetonitrile/min), where eluent A is 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The purification was carried out at room temperature with a constant flow rate of 2 ml/min. The purity and homogeneity of the peptide was verified by analytical reversed-phase chromatography on a Zorbax analytical 300-Å SB-C8 column (150 × 2.1 mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size), by quantitative amino acid analysis (Beckman Model 6300 amino acid analyzer), and by electrospray mass spectroscopy on a Fisons Quattro (Fisons, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). Formation of the disulfide-bridged two-stranded homodimeric coiled-coil was obtained by overnight stirring in a 100 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.5, and the desired product was purified by reversed-phase chromatography (described above). Analytical Ultracentrifugation Equilibrium Experiments—Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed on a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge with absorbance optics at 274 nm for the detection of tyrosine. Samples were first dialyzed exhaustively against an aqueous solution of 100 mm KCl, 50 mm PO4, pH 7.0 (benign buffer) at 4 °C. A 100-μl aliquot was loaded into the 12-mm Epon cell (charcoal-filled), and the initial loading concentrations of peptide stock solutions ranged from 50 to 500 μm in benign buffer. The samples were spun at 20 °C at 20,000, 25,000, and 35,000 rpm for 24 h to achieve equilibrium, as demonstrated by successive identical radial absorbance scans at 274 nm. The behavior of the peptide species at equilibrium is described by the following equation, Mbuoy=Mm(1-νρ)(Eq. 1) where M buoy is the measured buoyant weight, Mm is the molecular mass in daltons, ν is the partial specific volume of the sample, and ρ is the density of the buffer solution. The partial specific volume of the sample and density of the buffer were calculated using SednTerp (version 1.06, University of New Hampshire) using the weighted average of the amino acid content. The peptide oligomerization behavior was determined by fitting the sedimentation equilibrium data from different initial loading concentrations and rotor speeds to various monomer-oligomer equilibrium schemes using WIN NonLIN (version 1.035, University of Connecticut), a non-linear least squares algorithm for equilibrium ultracentrifugation analyses (17Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter with constant N2 flushing (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). A Lauda circulating water bath was used to control the temperature of the optic cell chamber, where rectangular cells of 1-mm path length were used. The concentration of peptide stock solutions was determined by absorbance at 275 nm in 6 m urea (extinction coefficient, ϵ = 1420 cm–1·m–1, 1 tyrosine per peptide chain). For wavelength scan analysis, a 5 mg/ml stock solution of each peptide in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm PO4, pH 7.0 (benign buffer) was diluted and scanned in the presence and absence of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). Mean residue molar ellipticity was calculated using the equation, [θ]=θobs·mrw/10lc(Eq. 2) where θobs is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, mrw is the mean residue molecular weight, l is the optical path length of the CD cell (cm), and c is the peptide concentration (mg/ml). Each peptide spectrum was the average of eight wavelengths scans collected at 0.1-nm intervals from 195 to 250 nm. The uncertainty in the molar ellipticity values was ±300 degrees·cm2 · dmol–1. Protein stability measurements were monitored at wavelength 222 nm, indicative of the secondary structure of α-helices, by thermal and chemical (urea) denaturations (18Cooper T.M. Woody R.W. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Temperature-induced Denaturation Monitored by Circular Dichroism—For thermal melting experiments, data points were taken at 1 °C intervals at a scan rate of 60 °C/h. The temperature dependence of the mean residue ellipticity θ was fitted to obtain fraction of the unfolded state, P U( t ), using a non-linear least-squares algorithm assuming a two-state unfolding reaction with pretransitional (folded state, θN( t )) and post-translational (unfolded state, θU( t )) baseline corrections (19Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 21: 8063-8068Crossref Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 20Lavigne P. Kondejewski L.H. Houston Jr., M.E. Sonnichsen F.D. Lix B. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), θ(t)=[(1-PU(t))·θN(t)]+[PU(t)·θU(t)](Eq. 3) where the pre- and post-transitional baselines are assumed to be linearly dependent on temperature, and with θN(0) and θU(0) as 0 °C intercepts, respectively, θN(t)=θN(0)-m·T(Eq. 4) and θU(t)=θU(0)-m·T(Eq. 5) The calculated fraction of the unfolded state, P U( t ), is given by, PU(t)=exp[(-ΔGU(t)/RT]/[1+exp(-ΔGU(t)/RT)](Eq. 6) where ΔG U( t ) is the apparent Gibbs free energy of folding described by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, ΔGU(t)=ΔH∘(1-T/tm)+ΔCp(T-Tm)-Tln(T/Tm)(Eq. 7) where tm is the temperature midpoint of the thermal transition, ΔH° is the apparent enthalpy of unfolding, and ΔCp is the change in heat capacity change associated with protein unfolding. Although ΔCp is temperature-dependent (21Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 22Gomez J. Hilser V.J. Xie D. Freire E. Proteins. 1995; 22: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), but in the narrow temperature range of our experiments (5–60 °C), this term is generally insensitive to changes (23Betz S.F. Liebman P.A. DeGrado W.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2450-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These thermodynamic parameters were fitted using the program Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc.) with the protocol described in Ref. 20Lavigne P. Kondejewski L.H. Houston Jr., M.E. Sonnichsen F.D. Lix B. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. Chemical Denaturation Monitored by Circular Dichroism—For chemical denaturation experiments, the stock peptide solution was diluted with appropriate volumes of benign buffer and a stock solution of 10.0 m urea in benign buffer to give a series of data points in increasing denaturant concentration. Data points were left to equilibrate overnight before scanning, and to ensure accuracy, selected data points were rescanned to ascertain proper buffer equilibration. The data were fitted to a linear extrapolation method described previously in Ref. 15Kwok S.C. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1519-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar to determine denaturation midpoint, slope associated with the transition, and the change in free energy associated with the transition, ΔGU. A two-state unfolding model was used to derive peptide stability values from urea denaturation results, ff=([θ]obs-[θ]u)/([θ]f-[θ]u)(Eq. 8) where [θ] f and [θ] u represents the mean residue molar ellipticity for the fully folded and unfolded species, respectively, and the [θ]obs is the observed molar ellipticity at a given denaturant concentration. The free energy of unfolding was derived from the equation, ΔGU=RTlnKu(Eq. 9) where Ku is the equilibrium constant of the unfolding process. In the case of disulfide-bridged peptides, where the unfolding process is concentration-independent, Ku can be simplified as, Ku=(1-ff)/(ff)(Eq. 10) thus, ΔGU=RTln(1-ff)/(ff)(Eq. 11) Estimates of the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, ΔG U(water) and slope term m were obtained by linear extrapolation to zero, ΔGU=ΔGU(water)-m[denaturant](Eq. 12) where m is the slope associated with unfolding. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Excess heat versus temperature for the peptides was determined using a Microcal differential scanning calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Sample concentrations ranged from 105 to 140 μm coiled-coil dimer, and peptides were dissolved in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm PO4, pH 7.0, buffer. The sample solutions and buffer were filtered and degassed under vacuum and stored at 5 °C. Buffer scans were repeated until identical baselines were achieved. The heating rate was 60 °C/h, and the cooling rate was 90 °C/h with the excess heat monitored from 5 to 70 °C. Each sample was heated and cooled for three cycles to ensure folding reversibility. Data analyses were carried out in Microcal Origin software (Microcal DSC, version 1.2a) using a two-state model with change in heat capacity. Design of the α-Helical Coiled-coils with Different Hydrophobic Clustering—The peptides used in this study were modeled on heptad sequences that had strong α-helical potential and a heptad repeat ( gabcdef)n where non-polar residues at positions a and d facilitate coiled-coil formation. In the design of these hydrophobic clustered peptides, we took advantage of the features of the successful α-helical coiled-coil models in our laboratory (6Hodges R.S. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Semchuk P.D. Pept. Res. 1990; 3: 123-137PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhou N.E. Zhu B.-Y. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Wagschal K. Tripet B.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4914-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), balance of charged residues across the coiled-coil interface in heptad positions e and g (27Kohn W.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28McClain D.L. Binfet J.P. Oakley M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and a flexible disulfide bridge linkage (29O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil sequences consisted of 8 heptads (56 residues) based on 2 repeating heptad sequences: EXEAXKA and KXEAXEG where positions X represent hydrophobic core positions occupied by Ala, Ile, or Leu in positions a or d (Fig. 1.). We defined a hydrophobic cluster as a consecutive string of three large non-polar residues (Ile or Leu) in the core positions of the coiled-coil. In our coiled-coils, non-polar residues Leu, Ile, Leu in the consecutive d, a, d heptad positions defined a stabilizing hydrophobic cluster. Our approach was to design two proteins with identical inherent hydrophobicity, i.e. identical number and character of non-polar residues in equivalent coiled-coil core positions but with a different arrangement, i.e. P3 having three hydrophobic clusters and P2 having two (Fig. 1, rectangular boxes). The N-terminal hydrophobic cluster of P3 was disrupted by an interchange of Ile at position 9 and Ala at position 16, both at heptad a positions, to give P2 (Fig. 1, bottom). Therefore, the two analogs have identical inherent hydrophobicity but different clustering patterns. The hypothesis is that the hydrophobic clusters are independent units that contribute to coiled-coil stability and folding when separated along the coiled-coil chain by consecutive strings of Ala residues (Fig. 1, open circles). Thus, this pattern of large and small non-polar core residues helped distinguish the contribution of a hydrophobic cluster from inherent hydrophobicity. Interchain and intrachain ionic interactions were engineered by placing Lys and Glu at positions b, e , and g , resulting in ionic stabilization due to interchain electrostatic attractions (i to i′ + 5 or g to e ′) and intrachain ionic attractions (i to i +3 or i to i + 4). To promote coiled-coil formation, a C-terminal disulfide bridge, Gly-Gly-Cys-Tyr linker was introduced to facilitate the formation of a parallel and in-register coiled-coil, and the single Tyr residue allows for protein concentration determination by UV spectroscopy. The disulfide bridge was distant from the N-terminal hydrophobic cluster under investigation (Fig. 1). Secondary Structure Characterization by Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism is a sensitive probe of secondary structural features, and this technique was used to detect the difference in helical content between the two peptides. Reduced P3 and P2 peptides were helical in benign condition (∼50% α-helical), but in the helix-promoting environment of 50% TFE (30Sonnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 37: 8790-8798Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar), significant helical structure was induced in both peptides (Table I). Although the amino acid sequences of these peptides have a strong underlying helical propensity, potential stabilizing ionic interactions, and amphipathicity, in the reduced state, there is insufficient hydrophobic stabilization to overcome the monomer-dimer equilibrium, at the concentration of ∼200 μm (Table I), to form a fully folded coiled-coil. An interchain disulfide bridge has been shown to enhance coiled-coil folding and stability by eliminating the concentration-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium that prevented folding (7Zhou N.E. Zhu B.-Y. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6190-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to the reduced peptides, both the disulfide-bridged two-stranded coiled-coils P3 and P2 exhibited more helical structure, and the P3 coiled-coil with three hydrophobic clusters was fully folded (98% α-helical) at room temperature (Fig. 2 and Table I). The P2 coiled-coil with two hydrophobic clusters was only 65% folded at 20 °C in benign buffer, although more helicity was induced at 5 °C (Fig. 3A). P3 coiled-coil showed a [θ]222/208 = 1.02, indicative of a fully folded coiled-coil (32Lau S.Y.M. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 317: 129-140Google Scholar), whereas that of P2 coiled-coil is less than 1 (0.74) due to the presence of the single-stranded unfolded state (Fig. 2.). Thus, without the presence of the third hydrophobic cluster, P2 did not fully fold in benign condition. In 50% TFE, both the disulfide-bridged peptides showed nearly 100% helical content, and the [θ]222/208 ratios for P3 and P2 were, respectively, 0.91 and 0.89, indicative of the single-stranded α-helical conformation (32Lau S.Y.M. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 317: 129-140Google Scholar). The significant helix induction for P2 in TFE, an increase of 35% helicity, showed the underlying high helical propensity of this sequence. However, P2 remained partially unfolded in benign condition because of insufficient hydrophobic stabilization in the hydrophobic core (having only two clusters).Table IBiophysical characterization of the oxidized and reduced hydrophobic cluster peptidesPeptide nameaPeptides are named by the number of stabilizing hydrophobic clusters shown in Fig. 1.[θ]222 (reduced)b[θ]222 (reduced) is the mean residue molar ellipticity measured at 222 nm in a reducing buffer 2 mM dithioerythritol (DTE), 50 mM PO4 (K2HPO4/KH2PO4), 100 mm KCl buffer, pH 7.0, in the absence (Benign) or presence of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE, v/v) at 20°C.

https://openalex.org/W2102724102,"Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is a quatrotopic membrane protein that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine through three sequential methylation reactions. Analysis of mice lacking a functional PEMT gene revealed a severe reduction in plasma homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is generated by the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is also a product of the PEMT reaction. To gain insight into the PEMT transmethylation reaction and the mechanism by which PEMT regulates homocysteine levels, we sought to define residues that are required for binding of the methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of human PEMT identified two putative AdoMet-binding motifs (98GXG100 and 180EE181). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated the requirement for the conserved motifs in PEMT specific activity. Analysis of the AdoMet binding ability of mutant recombinant PEMT derivatives established that residues Gly100 and Glu180 are essential for binding of the AdoMet moiety. A significantly elevated KD with respect to AdoMet is observed following conservative mutagenesis of residues Gly98 (400 pmol) and Glu181 (666.7 pmol), relative to the unmodified enzyme (303.1 pmol), suggesting that these residues also participate in AdoMet binding.

The liver is the primary site of PEMT activity, and the PEMT-controlled pathway accounts for ∼30% of hepatic phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (1Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid.

The enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway, which are active in all nucleated cells, catalyze the remaining 70% of PC biosynthesis in the liver (2DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol.

In addition to being a key modulator of PC biosynthesis, the liver is the site of ∼85% of all methylation reactions (6Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1582-1587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet, the primary methyl group donor, is utilized by at least 39 mammalian methyltransferases, including DNA, RNA, protein, lipid, and small molecule methyltransferases (7Fauman E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-32Crossref Google Scholar, 8Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each AdoMet-dependent transmethylation reaction generates AdoHcy, which in turn is hydrolyzed to yield adenosine and the non-protein amino acid, homocysteine (Hcy) (9Finkelstein J.D. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S40-S44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because mild hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and atherosclerotic disease, circulating plasma homocysteine levels are of significant clinical interest (10Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previous studies on PEMT focused on the PC biosynthetic function of the enzyme and, in particular, whether PEMT-derived PC was targeted to a specific hepatic fate such as very low density lipoprotein particles or bile (11Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4486-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Okochi E. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys.

Hepatology. 1999; 30: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, however, phenotypic analysis of mice homozygous for a disrupted PEMT allele revealed a novel role for PEMT in the regulation of plasma Hcy levels (15Noga A.A. Stead L.M. Zhao Y. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the liver is the site of numerous AdoMet-dependent methylation reactions, each of which contributes to the Hcy pool, genetic ablation of the PEMT gene alone resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating Hcy levels (15Noga A.A.

Furthermore, hepatoma cells transfected with a cDNA encoding PEMT secreted more Hcy than mock transfected cells (15Noga A.A. Stead L.M. Zhao Y. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Combined, these results suggest a key yet previously unknown role for PEMT in the regulation of hepatic one-carbon metabolism. To gain further insight into the PEMT transmethylation reaction and the mechanism by which this enzyme modulates plasma Hcy levels, we sought to identify residues that are required to bind AdoMet/AdoHcy. A plethora of enzymes bind AdoMet and/or AdoHcy, including the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, AdoMet synthetase, AdoMet decarboxylase, and AdoHcy hydrolase (16Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Comparative amino acid sequence analysis previously identified several conserved motifs that bind the AdoMet/AdoHcy moieties, but a small number of methyltransferases including the eukaryotic PEMT family of enzymes do not contain any of these motifs (16Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 17Posfai J. Bhagwat A.S. Posfai G. Roberts R.J.

Using bioinformatic analysis, two putative AdoMet/AdoHcy-binding motifs were identified that are conserved among the eukaryotic PEMT proteins. Here, we describe the biochemical evaluation of the motifs in the human PEMT enzyme. Understanding the nature of the interaction between AdoMet/AdoHcy and PEMT will promote resolution of the mechanism by which the enzyme modulates plasma Hcy levels and facilitate the design of agents for therapeutic intervention in cases of hyperhomocysteinemia. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, restriction endonucleases, and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were synthesized in the DNA core facility at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Alberta. FuGENE transfection reagent was from Roche Applied Science. S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (15 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine was from Sigma. HAWP 02500 filters and Multiscreen 96-well filtration/assay plates (MHABN4510) for AdoMet binding assays were from Millipore. Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were of the highest standard commercially available. Bioinformatic Analysis—The PROWL ProteinInfo sequence analysis program (prowl.rockefeller.edu) was used to screen for putative AdoMet-binding motifs in the predicted human PEMT primary structure (accession number, NP_009100). The ALIGN program (based on the ClustalW algorithm) at the San Diego Supercomputer Biology Workbench (workbench.sdsc.edu) was utilized to analyze the conservation of motifs between orthologous eukaryotic PEMT enzymes (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55405) Google Scholar). Recombinant Plasmid Construction—Mutant PEMT derivatives for analysis of putative AdoMet-binding residues/motifs were generated by the “splice by overlap extension” PCR mutagenesis method, using the wild type hPEMT-pCI plasmid as a template for all reactions (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar, 21Walkey C.J. Shields D.J. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This plasmid consists of the human PEMT open reading frame cloned 5′ to 3′ into the XhoI and XbaI sites, respectively, of the pCI mammalian expression vector polylinker (Promega) (21Walkey C.J. Shields D.J. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transcription is under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Full-length mutant PCR products were blunt end-ligated to SmaI-cut pBluescript II (KS) (Stratagene) and recloned into the pCI expression vector using XhoI and XbaI restriction sites. All of the constructs were sequenced to confirm fidelity of amplification and orientation of the insert at the Molecular Biology Services Unit of the University of Alberta. Plasmids encoding conservative GXG motif mutants were generated as follows. To mutagenize the glycine residue at the first position in the GXG tripeptide motif to an alanine residue and generate the plasmid, hP-G98A, PCR A was performed with oligonucleotide 1 (5′-CTCGAGATGACCCGGCTGCTGGGCTAC-3′) and oligonucleotide 2 (5′-CAGGAGCGCGAGGCCCAGGCTG-3′), PCR B was performed with the mutant oligonucleotide 3 (5′-AGCCTGGGCCTCGCGCTCCTGGCACTGGGCGTCGT-3′) and oligonucleotide 4 (5′-TCTAGATCAGCTCCTCTTGTGGGAC-3′), and PCR C, to generate the full-length mutant product, was performed with oligonucleotides 1 and 4, using amplicons from PCR A and B as templates. Each of the other mutant plasmids was produced by the same protocol but using a different mutant oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide 3) for the construction of each PEMT derivative. To mutagenize the glycine residue at the second position in the GXG tripeptide motif to an alanine residue and generate the plasmid, hP-G100A, oligonucleotide 3 was 5′-AGCCTGGGCCTCGCGCTCCTGGGACTGGCCGTCGT-3′. To mutagenize both glycine residues in the GXG tripeptide motif to alanine residues and generate the plasmid, hP-GAGA, 5′-AGCCTGGGCCTCGCGCTCCTGGCACTGGCCGTCGT-3′ was the mutant oligonucleotide. For construction of the single and combinatorial non-conservative GXG mutant plasmids, the mutant oligonucleotides were as follows: hP-G98E, 5′-AGCCTGGGCCTCGCGCTCCTGGAACTGGGCGTCGT-3′; hP-G100D, 5′-AGCCTGGGCCTCGCGCTCCTGGGACTGGACGTCGT-3′; and hP-GEGD, 5′-AGCCTGGGCCTCGCGCTCCTGGAACTGGACGTCGT-3′. Plasmids encoding the di-glutamate motif mutants E180D and E181D were generated as follows. To mutate the glutamate at position 180 to an aspartate residue and generate the plasmid, hP-E180D, PCR A was performed with oligonucleotide 1 (as above) and oligonucleotide 5 (5′-ATAGGAGAGCCATTATGTAGGTG-3′), PCR B was performed with the mutant oligonucleotide 6 (5′-CTACATAATGGCTCTCCTATACGACGAGCCCTTCACCGCTGAGATC-3′) and 4 (as above), and PCR C, to generate the full-length mutant product, was performed with oligonucleotides 1 and 4, using amplicons from PCR A and B as templates. To mutate the glutamate at position 181 to an aspartate residue and generate the plasmid, hP-E181D, a similar protocol was followed except the mutant oligonucleotide was 5′-CTACATAATGGCTCTCCTATACGAAGATCCCTTCACCGCTGAGATC-3′. Cell Culture and Transfections—Cos-7 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection repository, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfection of various plasmids encoding PEMT and mutant PEMT derivatives was performed using the FuGENE reagent as described previously (22Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PEMT Activity Assays and Immunoblots—PEMT activity assays were performed as described previously using phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME) as the methyl acceptor and S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine as the methyl group donor (23Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of the recombinant PEMT protein and mutant derivatives were performed as described previously using an anti-PEMT peptide antibody at the indicated concentrations (22Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine Binding Assays—Binding assays were performed on microsomes prepared from transiently transfected Cos-7 cells. The microsomes were prepared as described previously except the resultant microsomal pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of Buffer X (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol) (22Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Binding assays were carried out according to a modified version of the method of Zhu et al. (24Zhu Y. Qi C. Cao W.Q. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10380-10385Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal protein (50 μg) was incubated with 10 μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 3H]methionine (15 Ci/mmol) in Buffer X for 10 min at 37 °C (total assay volume, 30 μl). The binding assay mixture was passed over a HAWP 02500 filter (Millipore) on a filtration funnel, and unbound S-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 3H]methionine was removed by washing with 100 ml of Buffer X. The filters were dried, and bound S-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 3H]methionine was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Similar assays were performed in the absence of microsomal protein to account for nonspecific binding of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 3H]methionine to the filter. Binding assays on microsomes from mock transfected cells quantitated AdoMet bound by microsomal components other than PEMT. Binding activities of microsomes from cells expressing mutant PEMT proteins were expressed relative to the binding activity of microsomes from cells expressing the unmodified enzyme. Microtitre S-Adenosylmethionine Binding Assays—Binding assays were adapted for high throughput analysis as follows. Briefly, microsomal protein (30 μg), prepared as above, was incubated with 3 μCi of radiolabeled AdoMet and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled AdoMet for 10 min at 37 °C in a round-bottomed microtitre plate. 200 μl of Buffer X was added to each sample, and the resultant mixture was transferred to a 96-well filtration plate (MHABN4510, Millipore) and centrifuged immediately at 1500 × g for 5 min. Microtitre plates were placed on an aspiration apparatus, and each well was washed 15 times with 200 μl of Buffer X. Microtitre filters were air-dried, 50 μl of Microscint PS (Packard Biosciences) was added to each well, and bound S-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 3H]methionine was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry in a microbeta scintillation counter (model 1450, Wallac Trilux). Control binding assays were performed as described above for nonmicrotitre S-adenosylmethionine binding assays. Statistical Analyses—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The Student-Newman-Keuls method was utilized to perform an analysis of variance to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05). Kinetic Analyses—Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation and with nonlinear regression algorithms using the Curvefit kinetic analysis program (Graphpad.com). Identification of a Putative AdoMet-binding Motif—PEMT catalyzes a series of AdoMet-dependent methylation reactions to produce PC and the byproduct, AdoHcy (Fig. 1). Three AdoMet-binding motifs (I, II, and III) are conserved in the majority of non-DNA AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (Fig. 2A, row (i)), but a small number of methyltransferases including the enzymes of the eukaryotic PEMT family do not contain the three motifs (16Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, using bioinformatic analysis, we identified a partial motif I consensus sequence that is conserved among the eukaryotic PEMT orthologs (Fig. 2, B and C) (25Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this partial motif (GXG, where X is any amino acid) is similar to a DNA methyltransferase AdoMet-binding motif, one of the AdoMet-binding motifs of AdoMet synthetase, as well as a nucleotide-binding motif found in protein kinases and other nucleotide-binding proteins such as the NAD-binding proteins (Fig. 2A, rows (ii), (iii), and (iv)) (17Posfai J.

To evaluate the effect of conservative mutagenesis of each glycine residue on PEMT activity, Cos-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild type PEMT or the mutant PEMT derivatives or mock transfected with empty vector, and cell homogenate protein was assayed for PEMT activity. Mutagenesis of Gly98 to an alanine residue decreased PEMT activity by ∼25%, whereas similar mutagenesis of Gly100 completely abolished enzymatic activity in the recombinant PEMT derivatives (Fig. 3A). Immunoblots with an anti-PEMT peptide antibody demonstrated similar levels of abundance of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 3B). Enzymatic assays of homogenates performed in the presence of various concentrations of substrate revealed that conservative mutagenesis of Gly98 results in a slightly elevated Km with respect to the methyl donor, AdoMet, but not with respect to the methyl acceptor, PMME (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, mutagenesis of Gly98 would appear to have perturbed a facet of the transmethylation reaction pertaining to the AdoMet moiety. The hP-G100A mutant was inactive at all concentrations of PMME and AdoMet evaluated (data not shown). Conservative Mutagenesis of 100G Abolishes AdoMet Binding Activity—To determine whether the changes in PEMT activity were specifically due to decreased AdoMet binding activity, we transfected Cos-7 cells with the wild type or mutant PEMT plasmids or mock transfected with empty vector. The microsomes were prepared for AdoMet binding assays. The microsomal fraction was utilized for AdoMet binding assays because we have previously demonstrated that PEMT activity is enriched in the microsomal subcompartment (22Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Microsomes from cells expressing the mutant hp-G98A protein displayed a reduction of ∼20% in AdoMet binding activity compared with the unmodified enzyme (Fig. 4A). In contrast, conservative mutagenesis of Gly100 completely abolished the AdoMet binding activity of the mutant enzyme. To determine whether the altered enzymatic activity of the mutant recombinant PEMT proteins was a consequence of direct changes in AdoMet binding activity, binding assays were performed with various concentrations of AdoMet. Mutagenesis of Gly98 to an alanine results in a PEMT derivative with an elevated KD with respect to AdoMet, relative to values for the unmodified enzyme (Fig. 4B). Thus, a specific role for the GXG motif in binding of the AdoMet moiety is supported. Increasing concentrations of AdoMet did not result in detectable AdoMet binding activity for the Gly100 mutant (data not shown), suggesting that the integrity of this residue is essential to the AdoMet binding function of PEMT. Nonconservative and Combinatorial Mutations of the GXG Motif—To further investigate the role of the glycine residues in the putative AdoMet-binding motif, we performed nonconservative mutagenesis of each glycine residue to glutamate or aspartate residues to yield the mutant plasmids hP-G98E and hP-G100D, respectively. Additionally, combinatorial mutant plasmids were generated in which both glycine residues were mutated to alanine residues (hP-GAGA) or to glutamate and aspartate residues (hP-GEGD). To assess the PEMT activity of the nonconservative and combinatorial mutants, Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant plasmids or mock transfected with empty vector. The cellular homogenates were assayed for PEMT activity. The cells expressing the nonconservative mutant PEMT derivatives (hP-G98E and hP-G100D) were completely inactive as compared with mock transfected cells (Fig. 5A). In the case of hP-G98E, this was in contrast to the conservative G98A mutation, which only caused a decrease of 20% in PEMT activity (Fig. 3A). Cells expressing the combinatorial mutant PEMT derivatives were similarly devoid of PEMT activity (Fig. 5A). Immunoblots with an anti-PEMT peptide antibody confirmed the expression of each PEMT derivative (Fig. 5B). Assays performed in the presence of various concentrations of PMME or AdoMet did not demonstrate enzymatic activity in any of the nonconservative or combinatorial GXG mutants (Fig. 5, C and D). Nonconservative Mutagenesis of Gly98 Reduces AdoMet Binding Activity—In the next series of experiments, we resolved the issue of whether the reduction in PEMT activity of the nonconservative hP-G98E mutant was due to a specific decrease in the AdoMet binding activity of the recombinant mutant protein. Cos-7 cells were transfected, and microsomal AdoMet binding assays were performed as described. Although the cells expressing the mutant hP-G98E protein did not display any significant PEMT activity (Fig. 5A), the mutant protein still retained ∼55% of AdoMet binding activity as compared with the unmodified enzyme (Fig. 6A). Binding assays performed in the presence of various concentrations of AdoMet revealed that the mutant hP-G98E protein displays an increased KD with respect to AdoMet, relative to values for the unmodified enzyme (Fig. 6B). Combined, these results suggest that although the mutant protein is partially capable of binding AdoMet, the bound AdoMet moiety is not available for PEMT-catalyzed transmethylation (i.e. the mutant PEMT enzyme is unable to transfer the methyl group from the bound AdoMet moiety). This may arise because AdoMet is bound in such a conformation that the methyl group is not accessible to the transmethylation machinery. Furthermore, because mutagenesis of Gly98 to the small amino acid, alanine, had only minimal effects on both PEMT activity and binding activity (Figs. 3A and 4A), but mutation to the larger and charged glutamate residue caused a significant decrease in binding activity (Fig. 6, A and B), Gly98 may serve to structurally position Gly100 or other residues for optimal binding activity rather than actually binding to AdoMet itself. As expected, the hP-G100D mutant protein and the combinatorial mutant PEMT derivative, hP-GEGD did not bind AdoMet, whereas the mutant PEMT protein, hP-GAGA, retained only fractional activity (Fig. 6A). Assays performed in the presence of various concentrations of AdoMet did not enhance binding (data not shown). Identification of a Second Putative AdoMet-binding Motif—A number of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases do not contain the classical AdoMet-binding motifs (16Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 17Posfai J. Bhagwat A.S. Posfai G. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 26Lauster R. Trautner T.A. Noyer-Weidner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Analysis of enzymes that lack the three classical AdoMet-binding motifs (including the yeast PEM2-encoded PEMT ortholog) identified a novel tripartite motif (Fig. 7A) (18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), referred to in abbreviated form as the “RHPXY-hyd-EE” motif. This motif consists of two regions of homology (Region A and Region B) separated by a hydrophobic region of ∼30 residues (18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether the tripartite motif is conserved among the higher eukaryotic PEMT enzymes, we performed feature analysis of the aligned amino acid sequences. Although the greater part of Regions A and B do not exist in human PEMT, two specific portions of the motifs, which flank the hydrophobic region, are conserved, i.e. PXY-hydrophobic region-EE, where X represents any amino acid (Fig. 7). Recently, we demonstrated that PEMT is a quatrotopic ER membrane protein with a topographical orientation that localizes both termini external to the ER subcompartment (22Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such a topographical orientation would localize the PXY motif to the ER lumen and the di-glutamate motif to the external surface of the ER membrane. Because AdoMet is most concentrated in the cytosolic compartment, we hypothesize that the di-glutamate motif is more likely to function in an AdoMet binding capacity in human PEMT (29Farooqui J.Z. Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 757: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Di-glutamate Motif Decreases PEMT Activity—To examine the role of the conserved di-glutamate motif in binding to AdoMet, we mutated each glutamate residue to an aspartate residue to generate the mutant PEMT plasmids hP-E180D and hP-E181D. To evaluate the conservative glutamate mutants, we assayed PEMT activity in homogenates from cells that express the recombinant PEMT derivatives. Mutagenesis of Glu180 to an aspartate residue completely abolished PEMT activity, whereas similar mutagenesis of Glu181 resulted in a 70% decrease in PEMT activity (Fig. 8A). Immunoblots with an anti-PEMT peptide antibody demonstrated similar levels of abundance of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 8B). Provision of various concentrations of PMME or AdoMet did not suffice to restore the enzymatic activity to wild type levels (Fig. 8, C and D). However, assays performed in the presence of various concentrations of AdoMet revealed an elevated Km with respect to AdoMet in the case of the hP-E181D mutant (Fig. 8D). Thus, a role for the di-glutamate motif in an AdoMet-specific aspect of the transmethylation reaction is suggested. Mutagenesis of the Di-glutamate Motif Diminishes AdoMet Binding Activity—To elucidate whether the changes in PEMT activity could be attributed to a reduction in AdoMet binding activity, we performed microsomal AdoMet binding assays on transfected cells. Mutation of Glu180 to an aspartate residue abolished the AdoMet binding capacity of the recombinant mutant enzyme (Fig. 9A). Similar mutagenesis of Glu181 yielded a protein that exhibited a 55% decrement in AdoMet binding activity (Fig. 9A). Binding assays of the hP-E181D PEMT derivative did not detect binding activity at any AdoMet concentration evaluated (data not shown). Thus, the integrity of residue Glu180 is essential to the AdoMet binding activity of PEMT. Mutagenesis of Glu181 results in a PEMT derivative with significantly reduced AdoMet binding ability (KD , 666.7 pmol) relative to the wild type enzyme (KD , 303.1 pmol) (Fig. 9B). Because the changes in binding activity and enzymatic activity of the hP-E181D mutant are proportionally similar (Figs. 8A and 9A), and the replacement of Glu181 with an aspartate residue yields a protein with severely reduced AdoMet binding ability, it appears that the altered PEMT activity of the di-glutamate mutants was a consequence of specific changes in the AdoMet binding activity. Thus, a functional role for the di-glutamate motif in the AdoMet binding activity of the human PEMT enzyme is supported. AdoMet is the most commonly used substrate after ATP (7Fauman E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-32Crossref Google Scholar). The AdoMet moiety is required for the synthesis of several essential biomolecules including PC, creatine, and epinephrine, as well as for the methylation of DNA and RNA (30Clarke S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 63-78Google Scholar). A measure of the importance of AdoMet is perhaps best illustrated in that the only known genome that lacks the gene encoding AdoMet synthetase is that of the obligate intracellular parasite Chlamydia trachomatis (31Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Of clinical relevance, the AdoMet molecule is intrinsically linked with the non-protein amino acid, Hcy, elevated plasma concentrations of which are considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (10Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the PEMT transmethylation reaction and, thereby, the mechanism by which genetic ablation of PEMT can cause decreased circulating plasma homocysteine levels, we examined the role of specific PEMT amino acid residues in the binding of AdoMet/AdoHcy. We have now identified two distinct motifs that are required for PEMT to bind the methyl donor. Three AdoMet-binding motifs are conserved in the majority of the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, but these motifs are absent from several enzymes including those of the eukaryotic PEMT family and the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) family of enzymes (16Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ICMT enzymes constitute part of a post-translational modification process, in which proteins that terminate in a CAAX motif, such as Ras, undergo isoprenylation, C-terminal proteolytic cleavage and carboxyl methylation (10Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although absent from all eukaryotic PEMT enzymes, the three classical AdoMet-binding motifs are present in the prokaryotic Rhodobater sphaeroides PEMT ortholog, encoded by the pmtA gene (16Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Arondel V. Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this enzyme is a soluble cytosolic protein that has little homology with the higher eukaryotic, membrane-bound PEMT orthologs (32Arondel V. Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cain B.D. Donohue T.J. Shepherd W.D. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 942-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial consensus AdoMet-binding motif (98GXG100) is conserved in the eukaryotic PEMT enzymes, and site-directed mutagenesis of each glycine residue demonstrated their importance in the AdoMet binding activity of PEMT. Whereas an intact Gly100 residue is essential for binding of the AdoMet moiety, Gly98 may serve in a structural capacity, because conservative mutagenesis of the residue was quite well tolerated. Moreover, significant binding activity was retained even when Gly98 was substituted with a glutamate residue. However, because the KD with respect to AdoMet was elevated in the case of each Gly98 mutant, a role for this residue in binding of AdoMet is suggested. Our data do not allow us to exclude the possibility that the glutamate residue is also mediating the binding of AdoMet, especially because we have demonstrated the role of other PEMT glutamate residues in AdoMet binding. However, because an intact Gly100 residue is essential for AdoMet binding function, and the replacement of Gly98 with an alanine residue has a lesser impact on AdoMet binding, insertion of a glutamate residue combined with an intact Gly100 might be expected to result in enhanced AdoMet binding. Because this was not the case, we favor a structural role for Gly98 in the AdoMet binding activity of the human PEMT enzyme. To further define the AdoMet binding site of human PEMT, we examined a novel, recently proposed, AdoMet-binding motif (RHPXY-hyd-EE) (18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This nonclassical motif was derived following alignment-based analyses of the ICMT family of enzymes, homologs thereof, the yeast PEM2 enzyme, and several sterol reductases (18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). By in silico analysis, we determined that the consensus motif is also partially conserved in the rat, mouse, and human PEMT orthologs. Topographical analysis of Ste14p, a member of the ICMT family of methyltransferases, indicated that the enzyme is oriented in the ER membrane such that the two flanking regions of the motif are colocalized on the external face of the membrane (18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Such an orientation might be possible because the intervening hydrophobic domain is predicted to “double back” within the membrane plane through the use of a helical hairpin (18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C-terminal transmembrane domain of the yeast PEM2 enzyme is proposed to adopt a similar structural conformation (18Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the corresponding transmembrane domain in the human PEMT enzyme is shorter than the minimum length (31 amino acids) necessary for helical hairpin formation, and a topographical model based on four transmembrane domains has been elucidated (22Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such a topographical structure would position the two flanking segments of the motif on opposite sides of the ER membrane. Hence, in this model, the N-terminal portion of the motif (PXY) is lumenally oriented and therefore diametrically opposed to the AdoMet-rich cytosol (22Shields D.J. Lehner R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2956-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Farooqui J.Z. Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 757: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although we have not eliminated the possibility that the lumenally oriented PXY motif might still have a role in the AdoMet binding activity of PEMT, our working hypothesis is that the cytosolic-localized di-glutamate motif is the functional AdoMet-binding portion of the RHPXY-hyd-EE motif in the human PEMT enzyme. Mutagenesis of the di-glutamate motif coupled with AdoMet binding assays verified the importance of the glutamate pair, with Glu180 in particular being essential to the AdoMet binding activity of PEMT. However, Glu181 also has a role in AdoMet binding, because mutagenesis of the residue results in a significantly elevated KD with respect to AdoMet. Nucleotide-binding proteins such as p21, contain an invariant acidic residue and a GXGXXG motif that are separated by ∼20 amino acids (34Wierenga R.K. Hol W.G. Nature. 1983; 302: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonding between the acidic residue of such proteins and the 2′-hydroxy group of the adenosine ribose has been demonstrated (34Wierenga R.K. Hol W.G. Nature. 1983; 302: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, either or both glutamate residues in the conserved di-glutamate motif of PEMT may bind the AdoMet moiety through hydrogen bonding. Mutagenesis of each glutamate residue to an aspartate residue reduced AdoMet binding activity. Although aspartate residues may also form hydrogen bonds, the shorter length of the aspartate side chain may impair the AdoMet binding capacity of the residues in this region of the human PEMT enzyme. From the topographical orientation of the PEMT enzyme and the predicted length of the transmembrane domains, we envision a model that would position the conserved GXG and diglutamate motifs toward the cytosolic face of the third and fourth transmembrane helices, respectively (Fig. 10). This would provide optimal access to the AdoMet pool in the cytosol (29Farooqui J.Z. Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 757: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, because the third and fourth transmembrane helices are adjacent domains, the conserved GXG and di-glutamate motifs may be juxtaposed (Fig. 10). Intriguingly, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which hydrolyzes AdoHcy to Hcy and adenosine, is also localized in the cytosol (35Ueland P.M. Berge R.K. Saebo J. Farstad M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 101: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, the combined topographical organization of these disparate elements may provide the basis of a mechanism that links the AdoMet-dependent PEMT reaction to circulating Hcy levels. In summary, we identified two closely oriented amino acids motifs in the human PEMT enzyme that are essential for binding of AdoMet. The resolved AdoMet-binding site of PEMT is unique in that it conforms to neither the classical nor nonclassical binding motifs but rather is a novel combination of both classes. Because PEMT has been shown to modulate circulating plasma Hcy levels, the enzyme represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia. Resolution of key motifs that bind AdoMet will greatly accelerate the design of such therapeutic agents. We thank Susanne Lingrell for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W1998529957,"We previously showed that ethanol regulates dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) mRNA and protein levels in human neuroblastoma cells (Thibault, C., Lai, C., Wilke, N., Duong, B., Olive, M. F., Rahman, S., Dong, H., Hodge, C. W., Lockhart, D. J., and Miles, M. F. (2000) Mol. Pharmacol. 58, 1593-1600). DBH catalyzes norepinephrine synthesis, and several studies have suggested a role for norepinephrine in ethanol-mediated behaviors. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of mechanism(s) underlying ethanol regulation of DBH expression in SH-SY5Y cells. Transient transfection analysis showed that ethanol (25-200 mm) caused concentration- and time-dependent increases in DBH gene transcription. Progressive deletions identified ethanol-responsive sequences in the -262 to -142 bp region of the DBH gene promoter. Mutagenesis of cAMP-response element (CRE) sequences in this region abolished ethanol responsiveness while maintaining responsiveness to phorbol esters. Coexpression of dominant-negative CRE-binding protein greatly reduced ethanol induction of DBH. Inhibitors of protein kinase A, casein kinase II, and MAPK reduced ethanol induction of DBH promoter activity. Pharmacogenomic studies with microarrays showed that protein kinase A, MEK, and casein kinase II inhibitors blocked induction of DBH and a large subset of ethanol-responsive genes. These genes had diverse functional groupings, including multiple members of the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol signaling cascades. Real-time PCR analysis validated select microarray results. Taken together, these results suggest that ethanol regulation of DBH requires a functional CRE and its binding protein and may require interaction of multiple kinase pathways. This mechanism may also mediate ethanol responsiveness of a complex subset of genes in neural cells.

Acute and chronic exposure to ethanol can cause changes in signal transduction and gene expression in multiple cell types or organ systems (1Miles M.F. Alcohol Health Res.

In the nervous system, some of these changes in gene expression likely contribute to mechanisms underlying development of long-lasting behaviors such as tolerance, dependence, sensitization, and craving, as seen with other drugs of abuse (3Nestler E.J.

However, relating individual gene regulation events to complex phenotypic changes induced by ethanol in cells or the nervous system is a difficult task. To circumvent this difficulty, we recently utilized expression profiling with high density oligonucleotide arrays to identify patterns of gene regulation occurring with ethanol (12Thibault C. Lai C. Wilke N. Duong B. Olive M.F. Rahman S. Dong H. Hodge C.W. Lockhart D.J. Miles M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These studies identified several distinct mRNA expression patterns occurring in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to ethanol. Among these patterns were a group of genes involved in the production and metabolism of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Indeed, the most prominent mRNA induction occurred with dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), 1The abbreviations used are: DBH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PKA, protein kinase A; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase; CKII, casein kinase II; PKC, protein kinase C; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; SAM, statistical analysis of microarrays; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: DBH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PKA, protein kinase A; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase; CKII, casein kinase II; PKC, protein kinase C; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; SAM, statistical analysis of microarrays; RT, reverse transcription. the enzyme responsible for conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. We also found that ethanol increased DBH protein levels and norepinephrine production in SH-SY5Y cells and elevated DBH mRNA levels in mouse adrenal gland. DBH is localized in neurosecretory vesicles of noradrenergic neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems and in chromaffin granules of adrenal medullary cells (13Kirshner N. Goodall McC. J.

Norepinephrine has been suggested to play an important role in several ethanol-related behaviors. Infusion of norepinephrine into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus increases ethanol consumption in rats (15Hodge C.W. Slawecki C.J. Aiken A.S. Alcohol Clin. Exp.

Some studies have also shown that acute administration of ethanol increases synthesis, turnover, and release of norepinephrine in rat brain (16Carlsson A. Lindqvist M. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1973; 25: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 17Corrodi H. Fuxe K. Hokfelt T. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1966; 18: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Hunt W.A.

Recently, DBH knockout mice were shown to have reduced ethanol preference in a two-bottle choice paradigm (21Weinshenker D. Rust N.C. Miller N.S. Palmiter R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is significant evidence suggesting a role of DBH in ethanol-related behaviors. Defining how ethanol regulates DBH gene expression could have important implications for understanding ethanol-dependent long-term changes in central nervous system function. Our recent microarray studies suggested a role for cAMP signaling in ∼30% of the ethanol-responsive genes, including DBH (12Thibault C. Lai C. Wilke N. Duong B. Olive M.F. Rahman S. Dong H. Hodge C.W. Lockhart D.J. Miles M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized elements regulating DBH gene expression is the cAMP-response element (CRE) motif, which binds the CRE-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor (22Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 23Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol.

CREB can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK), casein kinase II (CKII), protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (25Sheng M.

Phosphorylation at Ser133 is required for CREB-induced gene transcription; however, CREB activity and specificity can be modulated by phosphorylation at additional sites on CREB or of proteins associated with CREB (for review, see Ref. 33Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). Although there is significant evidence suggesting that cAMP signaling is an important target for ethanol action (34Saito T. Lee J.M. Tabakoff B. J.

Diehl A.M. Wand G.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 338-346PubMed Google Scholar), there is little evidence actually linking ethanol-induced changes in expression of a native gene to the cAMP pathway. Therefore, we undertook this study to investigate the mechanism of ethanol regulation of DBH expression and, in particular, whether cAMP signaling plays a role in ethanol induction of DBH transcription. Here, we report that ethanol activates DBH gene expression at the transcriptional level. We also show that ethanol stimulates human DBH gene transcription through a CRE requiring CREB and multiple protein kinase pathways in SH-SY5Y cells. Importantly, these kinase pathways also seem to be required for a complex subset of ethanol-responsive genes identified by microarray studies. Our results provide important insight into mechanisms of ethanol regulation of DBH and point to the utility of pharmacogenomic studies for understanding the mechanism of action for pleiotropic drugs such as ethanol. Reagents—Cell culture medium, serum, and supplies were obtained from Invitrogen and Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Plasmid preparation kits were obtained from QIAGEN Inc. (Santa Clarita, CA). Inhibitors (H-89, GF 109203X, PD 98059, and KN62) were purchased from Calbiochem. Chrysin and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). STAT-60 reagent was purchased from Tel-Test (Friendswood, TX). Cell Culture—The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y-AH1861 (passage 7) was obtained from Dr. Robert Messing (University of California, San Francisco). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 10% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Fresh medium was supplied every 2 days, and cultures were split after 1 week. Plasmid Constructs—The DBH promoter deletion plasmids (2600CAT, 978CAT, 262CAT, 142CAT′, 114CAT′, 62CAT′, and 38CAT′) were generated in the laboratory of Dr. Kwang-Soo Kim and have been previously described (23Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs 978CAT′ and 262CAT′ were constructed by subcloning the SphI-XhoI fragments from 978CAT and 262CAT into the pBLCAT3-1 plasmid (41Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). pBLCAT3-1 is a derivative of pBLCAT3 that was constructed by deleting the CRE-like and TATA-like sequences upstream of the multiple cloning site and derives significantly lower background CAT activity compared with the pBLCAT3 backbone (41Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The original mutant constructs mAP1, mYY1, and mCRE (24Seo H. Yang C. Kim H.S. Kim K.-S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were similarly subcloned in the pBLCAT3-1 backbone to generate mAP1′, mYY1′, and mCRE′, respectively. Dr. M. E. Greenberg (Harvard Medical School) kindly provided the dominant-negative construct pRcRSVCREBM1 expressing CREBM1. Transient Transfection Assays—DNA constructs used for transfections were purified by alkaline lysis using a QIAGEN Endo-Free maxiprep kit. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/well 24 h prior to transfections. Transient transfections were performed with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight incubation, ethanol (0-200 mm) was added with fresh medium, and plates were sealed with Parafilm. Cells were harvested 24 h later in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and aliquots of cell extracts were assayed for protein and CAT activity (42Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid indicated that ethanol reduced β-galactosidase activity in the presence of the DBH construct (30-50%) and therefore could not be used as an internal control. Furthermore, when basal CAT activity was normalized with β-galactosidase, no significant differences were observed in transfection efficiency between deletion constructs (see Fig. 2C). Therefore, CAT activity was normalized to total lysate protein (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar), and transfections were repeated three to nine times in triplicate with two to three independent preparations of plasmids. Results are expressed as CAT activity/μg/min. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm) and forskolin (1 μm) treatments were carried out for 24 h. The inhibitors of PKA (H-89; 10 μm), CaMK (KN62; 5 μm), CKII (chrysin; 10 μm), PKC (bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203X); 100 nm), and MEK (PD 98059; 10 μm) were added 30 min prior to the addition of ethanol or dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP; 0.5 mm) and were present during ethanol incubation (6 h). Statistical analysis of CAT assay results was performed by analysis of variance using GraphPAD Prism Version 3.0 software. Total RNA Isolation and Biotinylated cRNA Preparation—For microarray analysis, 80% confluent cells were treated with H-89 (10 μm), chrysin (10 μm), or PD 98059 (10 μm) for 30 min prior to the addition of 100 mm ethanol and incubated additionally for 16 h. Following ethanol treatment, cells were trypsinized, and pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until needed. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated by homogenizing cell pellets in STAT-60 reagent using a tissue homogenizer (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The protocols for cDNA and cRNA synthesis were performed according to the recommendations of Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) and have been described previously (12Thibault C. Lai C. Wilke N. Duong B. Olive M.F. Rahman S. Dong H. Hodge C.W. Lockhart D.J. Miles M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In short, equivalent amounts (15 μg) of total RNA for each sample were reversed-transcribed into double-stranded cDNA using the Superscript choice system (Invitrogen), followed by biotin-labeled cRNA synthesis using a BioArray HighYield RNA transcript labeling kit (ENZO Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). Prior to hybridization, cRNA samples (10 μg) were fragmented randomly to an average size of 30-60 bases by incubation at 94 °C for 35 min in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 30 mm magnesium acetate. Array Hybridization and Scanning—Labeled cRNA samples were analyzed on Human Genome U95Av2 oligonucleotide array Set A (Affymetrix), representing 12,625 known genes and expressed sequence tags, in which each gene is represented by a probe set consisting of 16-20 probes. Hybridizations and scanning were performed according to Affymetrix protocols and as described previously (12Thibault C. Lai C. Wilke N. Duong B. Olive M.F. Rahman S. Dong H. Hodge C.W. Lockhart D.J. Miles M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of fragmented cRNA (10 μg in a 200-μl master mixture) were hybridized to arrays at 45 °C for 16 h in a rotisserie oven set at 60 rpm. Following hybridization, arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) using an Affymetrix fluidics station. Hybridization signals were amplified by incubating arrays with biotinylated goat anti-streptavidin antibody (Sigma) in staining buffer. After washing, arrays were scanned using a confocal GeneArray scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA). Microarray Data Analysis—Initial analysis of microarray data, including calculations of “average difference” expression intensity levels, was performed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite software (MAS Version 4.0). All arrays were normalized by correction to a set value for median total hybridization intensity. Scaling factors for all arrays were between 2.0 and 3.6. The ratio of hybridization to 3′-versus 5′-end probes for β-actin did not exceed 2 for any array. To generate lists of genes with reliable altered expression patterns, we employed the following analysis criteria. Initially, all genes from triplicate experiments were subjected to an analysis algorithm (S-score) developed in our laboratory for comparison of two high density oligonucleotide arrays (44Zhang L. Wang L. Ravindranathan A. Miles M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The S-score analysis determines the likelihood that the hybridization signal for a given gene is different between two arrays. The S-score is the sum of differences between perfect match/mismatch probe pairs for two arrays compared, with weighting for both multiplicative and additive error. S-scores are derived to have a mean of zero (no change) with an S.D. of 1. Next, array data were filtered to have an average difference ≥50 in at least one sample, resulting in 9644 potentially “expressed” genes. The filtered S-scores were then analyzed for consistent changes in replicate experiments using a permutation technique (45Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9751) Google Scholar). This statistical analysis of microarrays (SAM) method gives a more valid estimate of statistical significance when studying a large data set and identifies genes with changes in expression by assimilating a set of gene-specific t tests. The percentage of genes having scores greater than threshold by chance is the false discovery rate. We utilized SAM with a multiclass analysis and selected 410 reliable genes using a false discovery rate of 20%. This somewhat relaxed stringency level was used so as not to exclude potentially informative genes from multivariate and functional group analyses. S-scores from SAM analysis results were again filtered to select genes having an S-score ≥ 1.5 or < -1.5 in at least two samples. This resulted in 390 final candidate genes. To identify and graphically display groups of genes with correlated expression patterns, hierarchical clustering was applied using the centered correlation method in the program Cluster (46Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13204) Google Scholar). Results were visualized with the Tree View program (46Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13204) Google Scholar). Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Quantitative real-time RT-PCRs for selected genes were performed in the Nucleic Acid Research Facility of the Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center using the ABI Prism® 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Probes and primers were designed using Primer Express® Version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems), and these primers span intron-exon sequences of the gene. TaqMan fluorogenic probes were labeled at the 5′-end with a reporter, 6-carboxyfluorescein, and at the 3′-end with a quencher dye, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Probe and primer sequences were as follows: 1) for the DBH gene, sense primer (5′-GTGCTACATTAAGGAGCTTCCAAAG-3′), antisense primer (5′-GGCCTCATTGCCCTTGGT-3′), and TaqMan probe (5′-TCGGCACCACATTATCAAGTACGAGCC-3′); 2) for the δ-like kinase gene, sense primer (5′-CTCCTGCGCGTCCTCTTG-3′), antisense primer (5′-CACCTGCAAACATTGTCATCCT-3′), and TaqMan probe (5′-CACAGCACCTATGGGGCTGAATGCTTC-3′); and 3) for the thioredoxin-interacting protein gene, sense primer (5′-GCGCTATGAAGACACGCTTCT-3′), antisense primer (5′-CTCATATTTGTTTCCAGGTCTCATGA-3′), and TaqMan probe (5′-ACCATCTCATTCTCA-CCTGTTGGCTGG-3′). All quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed in triplicate under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (TaqMan® One Step PCR Master Mix reagent kit, P/N 4309169; ABI, Foster City, CA). The cycling conditions were 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The threshold cycle was determined to provide optimal standard curve value (0.98-1.0). 18 S rRNA from the pre-developed TaqMan® assay reagents (P/N 4310893E) was used as endogenous control. Input RNA amounts were calculated with relative standard curves for all mRNAs of interest and 18 S RNA. Transcript abundance was calculated as the ratio of control or experimental sample values normalized to 18 S RNA. Ethanol Causes Dose- and Time-dependent Increases in Human DBH Gene Transcription—To determine whether ethanol regulates DBH gene expression at the transcriptional level, we performed transient transfection assays in SH-SY5Y cells. The 5′-flanking sequences (-978 to +9 bp) of the DBH promoter, containing defined regulatory elements such as glucocorticoid-response element, AP1, AP2, CRE, YY1, and TATA, were fused to a CAT reporter gene (Fig. 1A). Cells transfected with either 978CAT′ or pBLCAT3-1 plasmid DNA (vector control) were treated with increasing concentrations of ethanol (50-200 mm) for 24 h or with 100 mm ethanol for 6, 12, and 24 h. Ethanol increased DBH promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal induction at 150 mm ethanol (Fig. 1B). The -fold increase in CAT activity was 2.5 ± 0.1 (mean ± S.D.) after a 6-h exposure to 100 mm ethanol (Fig. 1C). Maximal DBH promoter induction (4.3 ± 0.3-fold × mock-treated) was seen at 12 h post-ethanol exposure. Identification of an Ethanol-responsive Region in the DBH Gene Promoter—Deletion analysis was performed to identify potential ethanol-responsive regulatory elements residing within the 5′-proximal region of the DBH gene (Fig. 2A). The basal CAT activity of the deleted constructs showed variable expression levels, depending upon the presence of various positive and negative elements, as previously reported by Ishiguro et al. (47Ishiguro H. Kim K.-S. Joh T.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deletions of the 5′-promoter sequences (-2600 to -262 bp) did not produce any significant change in ethanol responsiveness of the gene (Fig. 2B). However, further deletion from -262 to -142 bp markedly reduced ethanol responsiveness. These results indicate that the region between -262 and -142 bp contains sequence information necessary for ethanol regulation of DBH transcription. Fig. 2C shows the basal CAT activity for various DBH deletion constructs normalized to β-galactosidase activity produced by cotransfection with a cytomegalovirus-lacZ vector. However, ethanol reduced β-galactosidase activity (30-50%) when cytomegalovirus-lacZ was used as an internal control in the presence of the DBH promoter (data not shown). Thus, we did not use such internal standards for normalization of CAT activity in cells treated with ethanol. The normalized basal CAT activity results (Fig. 2C) indicate similar levels of expression for DBH constructs compared with CAT activity normalized to total protein content (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the CRE Abolishes Ethanol Responsiveness of the DBH Promoter—The DBH promoter sequences from -262 to -142 bp contain CRE, AP1, and YY1 cis-regulatory elements. CRE is an essential cis-regulatory element for cAMP-stimulated transcription of DBH and also modulates basal expression of the gene (23Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible role of these promoter elements in ethanol induction of DBH transcription, transient transfection analysis of site-directed mutant constructs (Fig. 3A) was performed in SH-SY5Y cells. Mutations of putative sites for AP1 and YY1 did not alter ethanol responsiveness of the DBH promoter. However, mutation of the CRE site completely abolished ethanol induction (Fig. 3B). Even though the basal level of expression for the mCRE construct was greatly reduced, this was still 2-fold higher than the background of mock-treated cells, suggesting that decreases in basal activity did not account for loss of ethanol responsiveness. Furthermore, the mCRE construct was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, thus confirming that it could still be activated (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggest that a CRE cis-regulatory element mediates ethanol responsiveness of the DBH gene. Coexpression of Dominant-negative CREB Attenuates Ethanol"
https://openalex.org/W2072440793,"Histones are thought to have specific roles in mammalian spermatogenesis, because several subtypes of histones emerge that are post-translationally modified during spermatogenesis. Though regular assembly of nucleosome is guaranteed by histone chaperones, their involvement in spermatogenesis is yet to be characterized. Here we identified a histone chaperone-related factor, which we designated as CCG1-interacting factor A-II (CIA-II), through interaction with bromodomains of TAFII250/CCG1, which is the largest subunit of human transcription initiation factor IID (TFIID). We found that human CIA-II (hCIA-II) localizes in HeLa nuclei and is highly expressed in testis and other proliferating cell-containing tissues. Expression of mouse CIA-II (mCIA-II) does not occur in the germ cell-lacking testes of adult WBB6F1-W/Wv mutant mice, indicating its expression in testis to be specific to germ cells. Fractionation of testicular germ cells revealed that mCIA-II transcripts accumulate in pachytene spermatocytes but not in spermatids. In addition, the mCIA-II transcripts in testis were present as early as 4 days after birth and decreased at 56 days after birth. These findings indicate that mCIA-II expression in testis is restricted to premeiotic to meiotic stages during spermatogenesis. Also, we found that hCIA-II interacts with histone H3 in vivo and with histones H3/H4 in vitro and that it facilitates supercoiling of circular DNA when it is incubated with core histones and topoisomerase I in vitro.

Eukaryotic genomic DNA is packaged into a nucleoprotein complex of nucleosomes and forms chromatin structure in a nucleus (1Kornberg R.D. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Conversion of nucleosome structure is a critical step in the regulation of DNA-mediated transactions (2Adams C.R.

In addition to histone-modifying enzymes (i.e. acetyltransferase, deacetylase, and methylase) and chromatin-remodeling factors (i.e. ATPase), histone chaperone is a type of protein that modulates formation of nucleosomes (5Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev.

It binds to core histones and facilitates conversion of the topology of the relaxed form of a circular plasmid DNA into the supercoiled form in the presence of topoisomerase I and core histones (5Ito T.

This conversion activity is considered to stimulate assembly of histones and DNA and is therefore called nucleosome assembly activity. Such activity was confirmed by micrococcal nuclease digestion assay, where DNA ladders were detected as a gel electrophoresis pattern when histones and DNA were incubated with a histone chaperone (5Ito T.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CIA is the most conserved histone chaperone characterized to date (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It was identified as human factor that interacts with human cell cycle gene 1 (hCCG1), which is the largest subunit of hTFIID (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Chimura T. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). TFIID is the key factor responsible for specific binding with the TATA box, which is the basal sequence observed within the promoter of typical eukaryotic genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (14Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). CCG1 associates with TATA box-binding protein (TBP) (15Takada R. Nakatani Y. Hoffmann A. Kokubo T. Hasegawa S. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11809-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and inhibits binding of TBP onto TATA box via its N-terminal region (16Kokubo T. Gong D.W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G.

Cell. 1998; 94: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To date, CIA is the only histone chaperone known to associate with TFIID, through interaction with the bromodomain-containing domain of CCG1 (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Chimura T. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The gene encoding CIA counterpart in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was genetically identified as anti-silencing function-1 (ASF1) that causes derepression of genes located at silenced loci when it is exogeneously overexpressed (18Le S. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Singer M.S. Kahana A. Wolf A.J. Meisinger L.L. Peterson S.E. Goggin C. Mahowald M. Gottschling D.E. Genetics. 1998; 150: 613-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Umehara T Chimura T. Ichikawa N. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Yeast Asf1p was shown to have nucleosome assembly activity as well, and its highly conserved domain is essential for histone binding, nucleosome assembly, cell growth, and anti-silencing activities, indicating preservation of the function of CIA/Asf1p throughout evolution (20Umehara T Chimura T. Ichikawa N. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Through such activities, CIA is thought to contribute chromatin DNA-mediated reactions such as gene transcription (13Chimura T. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as well as DNA replication (21Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and DNA repair (18Le S. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Involvement of Asf1p in gene transcription is suggested by its suppressor of Ty phenotype-causing activity (13Chimura T. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). More importantly, Asf1p physically associates with yeast bromodomain factor 1 (yBdf1p) (13Chimura T. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has been reported that yBdf1p acts as the missing bromodomain in yCCG1/TAFII145, which is the counterpart for hCCG1 in S. cerevisiae but lacks C-terminal tandem bromodomains (22Matangkasombut O. Buratowski R.M. Swilling N.W. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 951-962PubMed Google Scholar). These reports strongly indicate functional involvement of CIA/Asf1p in both gene transcription and gene silencing. Also, CCG1 is involved in the cell cycle regulation because expression of CCG1 gene complements growth defect of hamster cell lines tsBN462 and ts13 at nonpermissive temperature (23Sekiguchi T. Miyata T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1998; 7: 1683-1687Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Sekiguchi T. Nohiro Y. Nakamura Y. Hisamoto N. Nishimoto T. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Kimura A. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) is responsible for regulation of apoptotic cell death (30Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), CIA, as a TFIID-interactive histone chaperone, might also control cell fate of multicellular organisms (31Yamaki M. Umehara T. Chimura T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, contribution of TFIID-interactive chromatin factors in multicellular organisms, such as in development and cell differentiation, is poorly understood. Because TFIID-binding onto a promoter before nucleosomal formation is essential for gene activation in vitro (32Workman J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 51: 613-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and TFIID subunits exhibit sequence similarities to core histones (33Kokubo T. Gong D.W. Wootton J.C. Horikoshi M.

Biochem. 1997; 121: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we thought that TFIID associates with chromatin-mediated molecules. In this aspect, we screened mammalian factors that interact with TFIID to identify novel chromatin-mediated molecules by using a human two-hybrid cDNA library (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). During the screening, in addition to the cloning of human CIA cDNA (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), to our surprise we isolated human cDNA encoding a novel factor that has sequence similarity to CIA. Through subsequent analysis of the corresponding gene, which we designated CIA-II, we found that CIA-II transcripts are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, whereas those for CIA are expressed in an apparently ubiquitous manner. Although a subtype of histone acetyltransferases was also recently shown to be involved in spermatogenesis (37Lahn B.T. Tang Z.L. Zhou J. Barndt R.J. Parvinen M. Allis C.D. Page D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8707-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), involvement of histone chaperones in the regulation of mammalian development or differentiation is poorly characterized. To better understand the role of histone chaperones in development and cellular differentiation, we investigated the expression profiles of CIA-II during spermatogenesis because testis highly expresses CIA-II transcripts compared with other organs. Here, we describe the expression analyses, which indicate involvement of CIA-II in the premeiotic to meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, as well as explain its biochemical characteristics as a histone chaperone. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—We isolated the cDNA of CIA-II by using a yeast two-hybrid screen (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 39Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), searching for factors that interact with bromodomain (residues 1342–1629) of human CCG1, a subunit of TFIID. A human peripheral lymphocyte cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain in pACT was co-transformed with the pAS1-CYH2-CCG1 plasmid (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in Y190 yeast cells. Yeast transformants (∼0.9 × 106 cells) were cultured on Trp(–) Leu(–) plates and replicated on Trp(–) Leu(–) His(–) plates containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. The resultant colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity by using X-gal (Wako). This assay for detecting specific interactions was done as previously described (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Bando M. Ijuin S. Hasegawa S. Horikoshi M. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By this screening, we isolated two independent clones that have an ∼1.6 kbp insert DNA that contains CIA-II sequences. We sequenced one of the clones (BRD 101) and found that this insert DNA consists of 1659 nucleotides and contains the full-length sequence of CIA-II. The entire coding sequence of CIA-II cDNA was also identified as anti-silencing function 1B (ASF1B) (40Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1068-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or hypothetical protein FLJ10604 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF279307 and NM_018154, respectively). For confirmation of protein-protein interaction, we constructed plasmid with “bait” cDNA in “prey” vector (pACTII) and plasmid with “prey” cDNA in “bait: vector (pAS1-CYH2) by excising the inserted cDNA with appropriate restriction enzymes and then ligating it with the other vector in its open reading frame. The co-transformants of pAS1-CYH2 and pACTII derivatives were spotted on filters (PROTRAN BA 85; Schleicher & Schuell) and tested for β-galactosidase activity. We used a cDNA for histone H3.3 (residues 97–135) for the interaction assay with CIA-II because this clone was obtained as an interactor for CIA (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The sequence of H3.3 is the same as the corresponding region of somatic histone H3. Subcellular Localization—Each human cDNA that encodes CIA-II, CIA, or TBP was respectively cloned into β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110. Forty micrograms of plasmid DNA were transformed into HeLa or COS cells. Resultant cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 4–8 h. Cells were further incubated in 10 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 2 days. After the cells were then rinsed with PBS, 10 ml of PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% gluteraldehyde was added to the cells. After 10 min of incubation at 4 °C, 10 ml of PBS containing 1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2 was added to the cells. After incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2, cells were rinsed with PBS. X-gal-stained cells were observed and photographed by using an optical microscope and a camera. Isolation of Mouse CIA-II cDNA—Partial cDNAs that encode mouse CIA-II or CIA were screened from mouse poly(A)+ RNA by RT-PCR using 5′-GA(A/G)TGGAA(A/G)(A/C)TIA(C/T)ITA(C/T)GT-3′ (sense) as the forward primer and using 5′-TCCCAI(A/T)(C/T)IAT(A/G)T(G/T)(A/G)AAIC(G/T)IGTIAC-3′ (antisense) as the reverse primer, corresponding to +115 to +134 and +436 to +461 of human CIA (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), respectively. Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from testis and other tissues was used as templates. RT-PCR involved 30 cycles of the following three steps: 1.5 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 37 °C, and 3 min at 63 °C. Amplified DNA products were cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(–) (Stratagene) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences similar to that of human CIA-II or that of human CIA were obtained. The mouse DNA fragments that were conserved with human CIA-II sequences were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (Roche Applied Science) for Northern blot analysis. Preparation and Separation of Testicular Germ Cells—Male ICR mice (Nippon Bio-Supp. Center) were used for mouse RNA blot analyses. The testes of WBB6F1-W/Wv and WBB6F1+/+ mice (Shizuoka Experimental Animal Farm) were used for the mutant analysis (Fig. 4). Preparation of testicular germ cells was essentially the same as that previously described (41Umehara T. Kida S. Hasegawa S. Fujimoto H. Horikoshi M. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, testes were dissected from 20 adult (8-week-old) male mice, and the tunic albuginea was removed by using forceps and then placed in PBS containing 0.1% glucose. The seminiferous tubule masses were incubated in PBS containing 0.1% glucose and 0.1% collagenase S1 for 20 min at 33 °C. The dissociated seminiferous tubules were washed with PBS containing 0.1% glucose, then resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% glucose, 200 units/ml of trypsin, and 120 units/ml DNaseI, and finally incubated for 10 min at 31 °C. The suspension was placed on ice, and then 8% fetal calf serum, 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 500 units/ml of DNaseI were added. After the suspension was filtered, centrifugal elutriation of mouse testicular germ cells was carried out with a Beckman JE6 elutriator (42Meistrich M.L. Trostle P.K. Frapart M. Erickson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 428-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RNA Blot Analysis—Filters for the human Northern blot analysis (multiple tissue Northern blot; Clontech) were hybridized at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 16 h with either the [32P]dCTP-labeled human CIA-II XbaI-XhoI fragment-(+780–+1671), human CIA HindIII-XhoI fragment-(+534–+950), or β-actin gene. The filters were washed three times at room temperature in a solution of 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS for 10 min and then twice at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min. Autoradiography was performed with intensifying screens at –80 °C for 6 days. Mouse RNA was prepared by the acid guanidine/phenol/chloroform (AGPC) method (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by using Oligotex-dT30 (Takara Shuzo) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon filter (Gene Screen plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Filters for the mouse Northern blot analysis were hybridized at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 12 h using the mouse CIA-II cDNA fragment (nucleotides 213–559) labeled with [32P]dCTP. Filters were washed three times at room temperature in 2× SSC for 10 min and then twice at 50 °C in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min. Then, exposure was done for 1 day. The same procedures were performed using human β-actin cDNA (Clontech) and the EcoRI-XhoI fragment of mouse S-II-T1 gene (41Umehara T. Kida S. Hasegawa S. Fujimoto H. Horikoshi M. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as controls. Recombinant Proteins—cDNA encoding full-length of human CIA-II was inserted into pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce the GST·CIA-II fusion protein. GST·CIA-II was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and extracted in BA-500 (BA: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.35% 2-mercaptoethanol; BA-500 contains 500 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml of leupeptin and pepstatin A. The extract was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with BA-500, and adsorbed proteins were eluted in BA-0 (i.e. no NaCl) containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. The eluted fraction was loaded on a Poros HQ column (PerSeptive Biosystems) equilibrated with BA-0 and eluted with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 1 m NaCl. GST·CIA-II protein was eluted at about 0.4 m NaCl. Core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 from HeLa cells were purified as a mixture using a hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad) (44Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assay—The method for the GST pull-down assay was described previously (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with the binding buffer (pH 7.5, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, 200 mm KCl, 13 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.3% 2-mercaptoethanol), and purified recombinant protein (0.2 μg) was bound to the resin. HeLa core histones (3.6 μg) were then added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, with rotation. The resin was washed in the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 15 μl of SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Plasmid Supercoiling Assay—Nucleosome assembly reactions were performed as follows (11Bortvin A. Winston F. Science. 1996; 272: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Covalently closed circular plasmid DNA pBluescript II SK (–) (2.96 kbp) was relaxed by wheat germ topoisomerase I (Promega). Relaxed circular DNA (0.1 μg; with 5 units of topoisomerase I) was combined with purified recombinant GST or GST·CIA protein (0.5 μg) and HeLa core histones (0.3 μg) in the assembly buffer (pH 7.5; 50 μl final volume; 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 2 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated for 30 min to stop the reaction after adding an equal volume of the stop A buffer (20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K). Plasmid was extracted by phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Purified plasmid was subjected to 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Identification of Histone Chaperone-related Factor CIA-II— In a previous study, we isolated human cDNA for histone chaperone CIA by a yeast two-hybrid screen using cDNA that encodes the bromodomain-containing fragment of human CCG1 (CCG1-BrD) as bait (12Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). From this screening, we simultaneously obtained an ∼1.6 kbp insert cDNA that encodes the polypeptide consisting of 202 amino acids in the correct coding frame. Because this sequence is similar to that of human CIA, we designated this putative product as CIA-II. As shown in the assay (Fig. 1A), the colony that co-expresses the full-length of CIA-II fused to Gal4 activation domain and CCG1-BrD fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain exhibits dark blue color in the X-gal assay (38Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). This assay also showed that the combination of SNF1-SNF4 and CCG1-BrD-CIA was a positive control of interaction and that other combinations yielding white colonies indicated negative interaction between exogenous products in yeast cells. As judged from the colony's color, interaction between CIA-II and CCG1-BrD was apparently as strong as that between CIA and CCG1-BrD (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we tested the interaction of CIA-II with other baits, such as TAFIIs (i.e. hTAFII80), or with other domains of hCCG1, such as high mobility group (HMG) box-like domain, but none of them detects any positive interaction (data not shown). To further exclude the possibility that these interactions might be false positives because of artificial expression, we reconstructed plasmid with bait cDNA in prey vector (pACTII) and that with prey cDNA in bait vector (pAS1-CYH2). The results (Fig. 1B) showed that the co-transformants of CIA-II fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain and CCG1-BrD fused to Gal4 activation domain did indeed form a dark blue colony in the X-gal assay, hence suggesting two-hybrid interaction exists between CIA-II and CCG1-BrD in vivo. Structural Features of CIA-II— Fig. 1C shows the deduced amino acid sequence of human CIA-II aligned with those of human CIA. The amino acid sequence of CIA-II is highly similar to that of human CIA from the BLAST homology search. Sequence comparison between CIA-II and CIA suggests that CIA-II possesses 71% sequence identity with CIA. Based on sequence similarity between CIA-II and CIA, we divided the CIA-II and CIA sequences into three segments with 1–36, 37–153, and 154–202 (or 204 in CIA) (Fig. 1C; see also Fig. 4A). The N-terminal segment (residues 1–36) is well conserved, and its sequences exhibit 67% identity to each other. The central segment (residues 37–153) is highly conserved between CIA and CIA-II, and 91% of their amino acid sequences are identical to each other without any gap. Also, this central segment is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human, although there are two gap sequences in cia1, which is the Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologue of CIA (20Umehara T Chimura T. Ichikawa N. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal segment (residues 154–202 in CIA-II and 154–204 in CIA) is less conserved with 29% identity and has one gap. Interestingly, this C-terminal segment of CIA-II contains 7 acidic residues (14%), whereas human CIA possesses 10 residues (20%).

To understand how these apolipoproteins behave at an hydrophobic lipoprotein interface, the interfacial properties of a consensus sequence peptide (CSP) derived from three exchangeable apolipoproteins (A-I, A-IV, and E) were studied using an oil drop tensiometer at air/water (A/W) and dodecane/water (DD/W) interfaces. CSP ((PLAEELRARLRAQLEELRERLG)2-NH2) contains two 22-amino acid tandem repeat sequences that form amphipathic α-helices. CSP, when added into the aqueous phase, lowered the interfacial tension (γ) of A/W and DD/W in a concentration-dependant fashion. The γA/W was lowered ∼24 mn/m, and γDD/W ∼31 mn/m, indicating a greater affinity of CSP for DD/W. Using the Gibbs equation for surface, the surface area per CSP molecule was estimated at ∼702 Å2 (∼16 Å2/amino acid) on A/W and ∼622 Å2 on DD/W (∼14 Å2/amino acid) suggesting that adsorbed CSP lies flat with α-helices in the plane of both interfaces. At equilibrium γ, CSP desorbed from the interface when compressed and re-adsorbed when expanded. The adsorption rate was concentration-dependant, but the desorption rate was not. Less CSP desorbed from DD/W than A/W indicating that CSP has higher affinity for DD/W. Dynamic analysis of elasticity shows that the faster the oscillation period (4, 8 s) and the lower the oscillation amplitude the more elastic the surfaces.

High density lipoproteins (HDLs) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; A/W, air/water; DD/W, dodecane/water; CSP, consensus sequence peptide. are small aggregates of exchangeable apolipoproteins (apoA-I, apoA-II, apoC's, and apoE, etc.) and lipids that reside in the plasma and are important mediators in reverse cholesterol transport. They also play roles as cofactors for a number of plasma lipoprotein modifying enzymes (e.g. lechthin:cholesterol acetyltransferase, lipoprotein lipase). For many years it has been known (1Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that apolipoproteins can exchange off of HDL onto other lipoproteins like very low density lipoprotein and move back and forth between different lipoprotein classes. Thus they are located at the lipoprotein/water interface. The predominant secondary structural feature of exchangeable apolipoproteins is the amphipathic α-helix (2Segrest J.P. Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D. Gotto Jr., A.M. FEBS Lett. 1974; 38: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), which has been described and studied by a number of investigators (1Atkinson D. Small D.M.

These structural units are about 20 amino acids in length, fold into an α-helix, and present one face, sub-tending less than 180°, as a band of hydrophobic amino acids. It is this hydrophobic face along the amphipathic α-helix that allows it to bind to the lipoprotein surfaces. A variety of different kinds of amphipathic α-helices have been described (4Segrest J.P. DeLoof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouilette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), but the specific function of the different classes is not clear. The class A amphipathic helix (3Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. DeLoof H. Brouilette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J.

K., DeLoof, H, and Dashti, H. (2001) J. Lipid Res., 1346–1367Google Scholar). It consists of a narrow band of hydrophobic amino acids on one face. At the hydrophilic/hydrophobic boundaries lysines and arginines give a positive charge, and acidic residues are located on the face opposite the hydrophobic side. The interaction of soluble, exchangeable apolipoproteins with phospholipids and combinations of phospholipid together with hydrophobic core lipids (triglyceride, cholesterol ester) has been widely studied (1Atkinson D.

Apolipoprotein surface behavior and interaction with phospholipids spread at the air/water interface have been studied extensively, primarily by Phillips and others (14Phillips M.C. Krebs K.E.

Lipid Research. 2000; 41: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments the surface pressure of the phospholipid monolayer was varied, and the increase in pressure upon injection of apolipoprotein into the sub-phase was recorded. The increase in pressure is because of the fact that the apolipoprotein penetrates the interface and compresses the lipid monolayer. When the increase in surface pressure is plotted against the initial pressure Πi of the monolayer a straight line is generated that extrapolates to the pressure where the apolipoprotein can no longer penetrate into the monolayer, i.e. no increase in pressure is recorded. This is called the exclusion pressure Πe. For instance, apoA-I has an exclusion pressure of about 32 mN/m (14Phillips M.C. Krebs K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A number of investigators have studied consensus sequences of amphipathic α-helices modeling different sequences of apolipoproteins (8Brouilette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 103-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Brouilette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Borhani D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) using the Πe technique. Some of these peptides, as short as 18 amino acids, have high Πe in phospholipids monolayers, and others exhibit lower Πe depending upon the specific amino acid arrangement of the amphipathic helical segment. For instance, by substituting phenylalanine (F) for other hydrophobic amino acids in an A-type 18-amino acid α-helix (18A) Πe rose from 30 mN/m for 18A–1F to 46 mN/m for 18A–6F (23Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1096-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A hypothesis suggested by Πe studies is that if the interfacial pressure in the phospholipid monolayer on a lipoprotein surface is greater than Πe for a given apolipoprotein, then the apoprotein cannot penetrate and bind to the lipoprotein. Conversely, if an apolipoprotein was present in the lipoprotein surface when the surface pressure increased above Πe then that apolipoprotein would be desorbed from the surface into the aqueous media. This hypothesis suggests that the surface pressure and the kinetics of adsorption/desorption from lipoprotein surfaces governs which soluble apolipoproteins will be present on the lipoprotein. For instance, it has been suggested that LDL has a high surface pressure, because very little apoA-I is present in LDL isolated from plasma (24McNamara J.R. Small D.M. Li Z. Schaefer E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1924-1935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second hypothesis is that in a complex apolipoprotein such as apoA-I or apoE where a number of different amphipathic helices are predicted to exist (25Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), an increase surface pressure might partially desorb those helices with a low Πe from the interface, whereas those with a high Πe would remain attached. This would allow for varying surface coverage by complex soluble apolipoproteins driven by small changes in the interfacial pressure. Finally, the non-exchangeable apolipoprotein B appears to change its surface area coverage on different sized LDL particles (24McNamara J.R. Small D.M. Li Z. Schaefer E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1924-1935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. Lopez F. Willund O. Bondjers G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1387-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If true, some domains must come off of the surface whereas other parts remain. It has been implied that certain amphipathic α-helices present in apolipoprotein B have the characteristics similar to those in soluble apolipoproteins and that these might be able to pop off the lipoprotein if surface pressure were increased (6Segrest, Jere P., Jones, M. K., DeLoof, H, and Dashti, H. (2001) J. Lipid Res., 1346–1367Google Scholar). We have reported that consensus peptides modeling amphipathic β-strands in the first amphipathic β-sheet region of apoB (residues 960–1892) binds strongly to hydrophobic surfaces (dodecane/water and triolein/water) and are not readily ejected from the surface by increasing the surface pressure (27Wang L. Small D. Biophysical Journal. 2002; 149Google Scholar). It is our hypothesis that in apoB the amphipathic β-strands and -sheets remain attached as the surface pressure increases, but that amphipathic α-helices can be first compressed and then desorbed from the surface. If the surface pressure falls again, then the amphipathic α-helices can rapidly readsorb. This would allow apoB to cover varying areas of surface depending on surface pressure. It is generally believed that apolipoproteins interact primarily with the phospholipids hydrocarbon chains on HDL. However, it is possible that they also interact with the hydrophobic core of the HDL particles, and it is probable that they interact with the hydrophobic core of very low density lipoprotein and LDL. Weinberg et al. (22Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Research. 2000; 41: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that apoA-I and apoA-IV could lower the triolein/water interfacial γ, but little more is known about the interaction of the apolipoproteins with the hydrocarbon core. Especially, how do amphipathic α-helices lie at the interface, how much do they lower the interfacial free energy, how rapidly do they adsorb or desorb, and are they elastic, and if so under what conditions? Such information will be helpful not only to understand the structure of apolipoproteins on lipoproteins but also to understand the structural changes that occur during remodeling of lipoproteins in plasma and on assembly of apoB containing lipoproteins during synthesis in cells. This paper compares the interaction of an amphipathic α-helical peptide with a hydrocarbon/water interface and an air/water interface. The peptide consists of two 22-residue, type A amphipathic helices designed from consensus sequences of apoA-I, A-IV, and E3 linked together, making a 44-amino acid peptide called consensus sequence peptide, CSP (25Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Chao, Y. (2002) Conformational Studies of a Consensus Sequence Peptide (CSP) and a Real Sequence Peptide (RSP) of Apolipoproteins by Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy and X-Ray Crystallography, Ph.D. thesis, Boston University School of Medicine, BostonGoogle Scholar). The results indicate that CSP binds strongly to the hydrocarbon/water interface and the air/water interface to lower the interfacial tension. Thus, this peptide is surface active and lowers the interfacial free energy at the air/water and oil/water interface. The interaction at the air/water interface differs significantly from that at the oil/water interface. The peptide binds more tightly to the oil/water interface and is displaced less readily by compression of the surface. At equilibrium surface coverage CSP has a very limited compressibility (<12%) on both surfaces, and above a critical surface pressure (Πmax) it is ejected from the surface. Materials—The CSP peptide ((PLAEELRARLRAQLEELRERLG)2-NH2), which contains two 22-amino acid tandem repeats derived from the consensus sequence of the tandem repeats of human apoA-I, apoA-IV, and apoE (25Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was synthesized at Quality Controlled Biochemical Inc. (Hopkinton, MA) using a Biosearch9050 Plus continuous flow synthesizer, and purified to 97+%. Stock solution of CSP (9–10 mg/ml) was prepared in ultra-filtered water obtained from a Hydro Picosystem (Research Triangle Park, NC). The peptide has been shown to exhibit ∼90% α-helical conformation in solution (25Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Chao, Y.

To do interfacial tension measurements, varied amounts of peptide stocks were added to the aqueous phase to obtain different peptide concentrations (from 1.5 × 10–8 to 5 × 10–6m). Two interfacial systems were used, air/water and dodecane/water. The pH of the aqueous phase was kept at pH 7.4 with phosphate buffer (2 mm). Dodecane (>99% pure) was purchased from EM SCIENCE (Gibbstown, NJ). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Interfacial Tension Measurement—The interfacial tension of air/water and dodecane/water interfaces in the presence of different amounts of CSP was measured with an I. T. CONCEPT (Longessaigne, France) Tracker oil-drop tensiometer (29Labourdenne S. Gaudry-Rolland N. Letellier S. Lin M. Cagna A. Esposito G. Verger R. Rivière C. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 163-173Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Air bubbles (∼4 μl), or dodecane drops (∼8 μl) were formed in gently stirred pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (6.0 ml) containing a given amount of CSP peptide. The interfacial tension was then recorded continuously until it approached an equilibrium value. All experiments were carried out at 25 ± 0.1 °C in a thermostated system. Estimation of the Surface Area per Molecule of Peptide—From the interfacial tension measurement, the equilibrium interfacial tension γ was obtained for each concentration, c, of peptide in the aqueous phase. A plot of γ versus lnc was fitted to a straight line, and the slope of the fitted line dγ/dlnc was obtained. According to the Gibbs equation for the surface (30Adam N.K. The Physics and Chemistry of Surfaces. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, London1941: 107-115Google Scholar), the surface concentration of an adsorbed molecule, Γ(mol/cm2) = –(1/RT)(dγ/dlnc) T.P. , was calculated. The surface area per molecule of peptide S(Å2/molecule) = 1/(Γ × N), where N = Avagadros number, was obtained for different interfaces. Compression and Expansion of the Interfaces—Once the interfacial tension curve approached equilibrium, the air bubble or oil drop was compressed by rapidly decreasing the volume by about 25, 12, or 6%. The sudden decrease in volume instantaneously decreases the drop surface area, and results in a sudden compression causing the tension (γ) to decrease abruptly. This system was held at this reduced volume for 3–10 min, and γ was recorded continuously. If molecules readily desorb from the surface, γ rises back toward the equilibrium value. This is called the desorption curve. If γ doesn't change, then no net desorption or absorption occurs. To expand the surface, the volume of the oil droplet was rapidly increased by about 25, 12, or 6%, which suddenly increases the area and as a result γ abruptly increases. If molecules adsorb from the bulk phase to adhere to the newly formed extra surface, then γ will drop back toward equilibrium. This is called the adsorption curve and results from the expansion of the interfacial area to produce new area to which molecules from the bulk can adsorb. These curves were fitted by a bi-exponential equation: y = y 0 + A 1 exp(–x/t 1) + A 2 exp(–x/t 2). The time constants t 1 and t 2 are related to the desorption and adsorption processes. Oscillations in Volume around the Equilibrium Surface Tension— After the tension curve has reached a near equilibrium value, oscillations of the volume can be made at different amplitudes and periods (i.e. frequencies). The standard protocol for oscillations was carried out using a 4-μl air bubble or an 8-μl droplet of dodecane in phosphate buffer with various added amounts of CSP. The drops were then oscillated at different periods ranging from 4 to 128 s (0.25–0.008 Hz) at amplitudes of about ±25, ±12, or ±6%. As the volume V was oscillated in a sinusoidal fashion, interfacial area A and surface tension γ were recorded continuously, and the phase angle ϕ between compression and expansion was computed. The interfacial elasticity modulus ϵ was derived (ϵ = dγ/dlnA). The elasticity real part ϵ′ and the elasticity imaginary part ϵ″ were obtained (ϵ′ = ϵ cosϕ, ϵ″ = ϵ sinϕ) (31Benjamins J. Lucassen-Reynders E.H. Möbius D. Miller R. Proteins at Liquid Interfaces. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1998: 341-384Google Scholar, 32Benjamins J. Cagna A. Lucassen-Reynders E.H. Colloids Surf. 1996; 114: 245-254Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Continuous Oscillation Starting with Drop Formation—To calculate the elasticity modulus as a function of surface pressure generated by the peptide monolayer at the surface, continuous oscillations were carried out 10 s after an air bubble or oil drop was formed in the peptide solution. Allowing 10 s to form the drop allowed the system to stabilize, and then the volume was oscillated by about ±25, ±12, or ±6% at different periods continuously until the mean interfacial tension reached equilibrium. This gave a continuous measurement of the mean surface tension (and surface pressure), ϵ, ϵ′, ϵ″, and ϕ. The surface tension of the interface without peptide (γ0) minus the surface tension of the interface with CSP (γCSP) is the surface pressure (Π), i.e. Π = γ0 – γCSP. The Adsorption of CSP to Air/Water (A/W) and Hydrocarbon (Dodecane)/Water (DD/W) Surfaces— Fig. 1 shows a typical set of curves illustrating the effect of concentration on the adsorption isotherms of CSP at the A/W interface. Without CSP the surface tension (γ) remained constant at about 71 mN/m. At the most dilute concentration (1.5 × 10–7m) there was a short lag period of about 150 s and then a rapid fall in the surface tension. After 500 s the surface tension fell more slowly toward an equilibrium value. As the concentration increased, the lag period shortened, and the steepness of the curve increased. The slope of the rapid part of the descent of γ versus time (dγ/dt) appears to be concentration-dependant (Fig. 1, inset). The final surface tension was very close to equilibrium by 1200 s (20 min). The equilibrium γA/W at the highest concentration (4.8 × 10–6m) was about 46.5 mN/m. Thus CSP lowered γA/W by about 24.5 mN/m. Because Π = γ0 – γCSP the CSP produced about 24.5 mN/m surface pressure at the A/W interface. Fig. 2 shows similar data collected at the DD/W interface. The same general features were present; however, the starting interfacial tension for DD/W was about 52 mN/m and fell to about 21 mN/m on approaching equilibrium at 1.2 × 10–6m. Thus CSP produced a Π of about 31 mN/m on the DD/W interface. A lag period similar to that on the A/W interface occurred with the low concentrations of CSP. The lag period was shortened as the concentration increased. The most dilute concentration studied (1.5 × 10–8m), γ, failed to fall below 42 mN/M even after 4 h. At 3.1 × 10–8m equilibrium was approached by 2.5 h (data is not shown). The surface tension approached equilibrium by 3600 s (1 h) at concentrations at and above 6.2 × 10–8m (Fig. 2). The most rapid fall in surface tension (dγ/dt) shows (Fig. 2, inset) that the rate decrease in the surface tension is a function of the concentration, being fastest at the highest concentration and slower at lower concentrations.Fig. 2Interfacial tension γ versus time at DD/W interface.

The inset shows that the slope, dγ/dt, of the steep part of the curve plotted against the molar concentration of CSP. Linear regression was made to the plot, r = –0.998, p = 0.0001, and the slope is –3.8 × 107.

The estimated surface concentration Γ and the area per molecule (A) are given in Table I. These values suggest that the surface concentration is similar at the two interfaces. The area per residue of about 14 and 16 Å2 per amino acid at the DD/W and A/W interfaces are consistent with the peptide lying flat on the surface with both helices contacting the water along the hydrophilic face (13Pittman R.C.

To produce compression, the drop volume (V) was decreased instantly, which results in a decreased surface area (A). γ, A, and V were followed with time (Fig. 4). At the A/W interface (Fig. 4A), immediately after compression, A and γ fell instantly. Because at the instant the V and A were reduced all the original molecules were at the interface, the surface concentration Γ was increased. γ then rose with time indicating the loss of molecules from the interface and a return toward the equilibrium surface concentration Γeq. Conversely when the surface was expanded by increasing the volume instantaneously, the surface tension rose immediately and then fell as new molecules adsorbed to the surface to take the vacant space made by increasing A. An example of the changes that occurred at the A/W interface with an ∼25% change in volume are shown in Fig. 4A. After decreasing the V from 5.4 to 4.4 μl, γ plummeted from about 48 to 37 mN/m, corresponding to an 11 mN/m increase in Π and then rapidly moved back to the equilibrium value. The volume was then increased to about 6.4 μl, and expanding A and γ jumped to almost 60 mN/m and then fell back toward the equilibrium value as molecules from the aqueous phase adsorbed. These curves indicate that the adsorption and desorption phenomena around the equilibrium surface tension are the result of the surface attempting to maintain a constant surface concentration, Γeq.

https://openalex.org/W2144975186,"In mammalian cells, membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transported from ER to Golgi where they are processed proteolytically to generate soluble transcription factors that activate lipid synthesis. ER-to-Golgi transport requires SCAP, a sterol-regulated escort protein. In sterol-treated cells, the SCAP/SREBP complex binds to Insig-1 or Insig-2, which retains the complex in the ER, blocking SREBP processing and decreasing lipid synthesis. In Drosophila cells, the endogenous SCAP/SREBP complex is transported to Golgi, but transport is blocked by phosphatidylethanolamine instead of sterols. Here, we show that mammalian SREBP-2 is not transported to Golgi when expressed in Drosophila cells. Transport requires co-expression of mammalian SCAP. Sterols block transport of the mammalian SCAP/SREBP-2 complex, but only when mammalian Insig-1 or -2 is co-expressed. These reconstitution studies define SCAP and Insig as the minimal requirements for sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from ER to Golgi. They indicate that insect cells can respond to sterols when proper regulatory proteins are expressed."

Jurkat T cells and primary CD4+ T cells expressing a CD8α/CD28 chimeric receptor containing a mutation at tyrosine 200 in the cytoplasmic tail were unable to fully induce HIV-1 proviral transcription in response to CD8α/28 receptor cross-linking in comparison to CD28 costimulation. The loss of transactivation seen with the mutant chimeric receptor correlated with a decrease in Vav tyrosine phosphorylation. CD28-dependent activation of HIV-1 transcription also required the GTPase activity of Rac1, which was not activated during costimulation with the mutated receptor. Furthermore, the mutated receptor was unable to induce NF-κB DNA binding or transactivation, as demonstrated by electromobility shift assays and HIV-1 long terminal repeat and NF-κB-dependent reporter constructs.

Signaling events initiated by the TcR and CD28 lead to increases in intracellular calcium, changes in cytoskeletal organization, and triggering of several kinase cascades.

However, it is unclear which signals emanating from CD28 are responsible for the induction of these transcription factors and the activation of HIV-1 transcription. One potential candidate is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav which has been shown to be targeted by CD28 signaling in the absence of TcR signaling (11Kim H.-H. Tharayil M. Rudd C.E. J.

Vav has multiple binding domains including SH2 and SH3 domains allowing it to serve as an adapter molecule for T cell signaling. It has also been suggested that Vav is essential for properly integrating TcR and CD28 signals (34Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 476-486Google Scholar). Negative regulation of Vav occurs through its interaction with cbl-b, which, upon CD28 ligation, releases Vav and is targeted for autoubiquitination and degradation (35Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C.

Using Jurkat T cell lines and primary CD4+ T lymphocytes expressing chimeric CD8α/28 receptors with mutations in critical tyrosines located in the cytoplasmic tail, we have shown that CD28 signaling is required for efficient HIV-1 transcription (18Cook J.A. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, we specifically examine the role of Tyr200 in regulating HIV-1 transcription. We show that Tyr200 is necessary for efficient HIV-1 transcription in Jurkat T cells and primary CD4+ T cells through initiation of signaling events that enhance Vav phosphorylation, Rac1 activation, and NF-κB binding activity. Cell Lines and Primary Cells—Jurkat T cell line clone E6–1 obtained from ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.2 m l-glutamine, and 0.5% Fungizone. 293T human embryonic kidney cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing FcRγII receptors (CHO-Fc) (gift from Dr. I.

Jurkat cell lines overexpressing CD8α/28 chimeric receptors 8WT and F200 were described previously (17Teng J.M.C. King P.D. Sadra A. Liu X. Han A. Selvakumar A. August A. Dupont B.

Primary blood lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood using a Ficoll/Histopaque (Sigma) gradient. Macrophages were separated by adherence to plastic overnight and CD4+ T cells were then positively selected from the non-adherent population using a CD4+ isolation kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Generation of HIV-1 Infectious Titers and Infections—Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped HIV-1 was generated by transfecting 293T cells with 15 μg of cDNA for either pNL4–3-Luc(+) Env(–) Nef(–) (HIV-luc) (39Henderson A.J.

Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45-micron disc prior to infection. Typically, the multiplicity of infection of infectious supernatants was ∼0.1–0.5. Cells were infected by culturing in the presence of virus stock for 12–24 h before replacing with fresh media. Cells were cultured for an additional 24 h before measuring luciferase activity to assess virus transcription. In some experiments, cells were infected with HIV-PLAP and 72-h post-infection HIV-PLAP positive cells were selected using CELLection Pan Mouse IgG kit (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) along with anti-human PLAP antibodies (Sigma). Activation of T Cells—Jurkat cells were washed and serum-starved for 4 h prior to activation. CHO-Fc cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate, incubated for 12 h to allow adherence, treated with mitomycin-C (Sigma) at 10 μg/ml and incubated in the absence of serum for 2 h before using to activate the Jurkat cell lines. 1 × 106 Jurkat cells were activated by coculturing cells with the CHO-Fc and 0.1 μg/ml mouse anti-human CD3 and 1.0 μg/ml anti-human CD28 or 1.0 μg/ml anti-human CD8α antibodies (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Following stimulation, Jurkat cells were harvested and luciferase activity measured. Transient Transfections—1.2 × 107 Jurkat cells were resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 and placed on ice for 15 min along with 15 μg HIV-luc, LTR-luc, –205LTR-luc, –158LTR-luc, or –205mκB-luc and then electroporated using a T280 square electroporation system (BTX, San Diego, CA) (39Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments, 12 μg of LTR-luc and 10 μg of RacN17 (generously provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) or 10 μg of pEF empty vector DNA were added to cells. Cells were given 1 pulse for 25 ms at 240 V in a 4-mm cuvette. Cells were then cultured for 24 h and stimulated as described above. Primary CD4+ cells were stimulated for 12 h with 10 ng/ml PMA and 2 μg/ml PHA prior to electroporation. Following stimulation, 1.2 × 107 primary CD4+ T cells were resuspended in 400 μl of 10% fetal calf serum RPMI 1640 and placed on ice for 15 min with 20 μg of HIV-luc, and 20 μg of pMHneo 8WT or F200 (17Teng J.M.C.

DNA was transfected into primary T cells by electroporation using the following conditions: 4 mm cuvette, 250 volts, 1 pulse, and 40 ms (T280 square electroporation system). Cells were cultured 24 h prior to stimulation by anti-CD3, anti-CD28, or anti-CD8α. Receptor expression was monitored by flow cytometry. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—Jurkat cells were either left uninfected or infected as described above with HIV-luc or HIV-PLAP. The infected Jurkat cells were serum-starved 4 h prior to stimulation with 0.1 μg/ml mouse anti-human CD3, 1.0 μg/ml anti-human CD28, or 1.0 μg/ml anti-human CD8α antibodies (BD Pharmingen) and cross-linked using 5.0 μg/ml goat anti-mouse Ig (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 5 min. Protein extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-CL (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.0 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm pepstatin). Protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was incubated with whole cell extracts for 2 h to preclear the lysates. Protein A/G beads were precoated with 1.0 μg of anti-Vav (New England Biolabs), washed twice in lysis buffer before adding to precleared whole cell extracts (5 × 106 cells/sample to 20 μl of beads) for 15 h at 4 °C. Protein-bound beads were washed three times in lysis buffer before adding 1× SDS loading buffer containing dithiothreitol. Samples were then treated at 100 °C for 5 min before resolving on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) and associated Vav was detected with primary antibodies against phosphotyrosine or anti-human Vav (New England Biolabs). Blots were developed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL kit. Transduction of Primary CD4 + —Retroviral expression vectors for CD8α/28 8WT and CD8α/28 F200 were generated by blunt-ended ligation of a HindIII/EcoRI fragment containing the chimeric receptors from the original pMHneo vector into blunted EcoRI and XhoI sites of murine stem cell virus vector 2.2 (MSCV 2.2; generously provided by G. Nolan, Stanford University, CA). MSCV-8WT or MSCV-F200 retrovirus were then packaged in 293T cells by transfecting 15 μg of the viral DNA with 3 μg of VSV-G envelope, 3 μg of pECO, and 3 μg of Tat by CaPO4 transfection (42Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45-micron disc prior to infection. Typically, the multiplicity of infection of infectious supernatants was ∼0.1–0.5. Cells were infected by culturing in the presence of virus stock and 10 ng/ml PMA and 2 μg/ml PHA (Sigma) for 12–24 h before replacing with fresh media. Cells were cultured an additional 3 days prior to sorting with CD8 positive isolation kit (Dynal, Oslow, Norway). Sorted cells were allowed to rest overnight prior to activation. Rac GTP Exchange Assay—Cells were stimulated as described above for immunoprecipitations. Lysates were made according to Rac1 Activation Assay Kit (Upstate Technologies, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, cells were lysed in magnesium lysis buffer (MLB) supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml apoprotin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm sodium flouride. Cell lysates were precleared for 10 min with GST beads. Lysates were then incubated with PAK-1 PBD-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in MLB and samples were prepared for electrophoresis by adding 1× SDS loading dye. Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and GTP-bound Rac1 was identified by anti-Rac1 antibody. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts from Jurkat and primary cells were prepared as previously described (43Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed by incubating 4 μg of protein from nuclear extracts with 4 μg of poly dIdC (Amersham Biosciences), 0.25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.6 m KCl, 9.0% glycerol, 1.0 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm MgCl2. Reaction mixtures were preincubated with 50-fold excess specific or nonspecific competitors, or 0.5 μg of polyclonal antibodies against NF-κB subunits or C/EBP for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 120 V in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. Probes for EMSA were generated by annealing oligonucleotides representing the HIV-1 NF-κB sites 5′-AGCTCCTGGAAAGTCCCCAGCGGAAAGTCCCTT-3′ and 5′-AGCTAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG-3′ and C/EBP site 5′-GATCGCCTAGCATTTCATCACACGT-3′ and 5′-GATCACGTGTGATGAAATGCTAGGC-3′. Probes were generated by end filling with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli polymerase in the presence of [α-P32]dCTP (44Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Tyr200 Is Necessary for CD28-induced HIV-1 Transcription—We have previously shown that Tyr173 within the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 initiates a negative signal in CD28-mediated costimulation of HIV-1 transcription (18Cook J.A. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, CD28 signaling overall increases HIV-1 transcription suggesting that other residues must be required for this activity. We tested the role of Tyr200 in CD28-dependent HIV-1 transcription using CD8α/28 chimeric receptors in which the extracellular and transmembrane domains derived from CD8α were fused to the CD28 cytoplasmic domain, which is sufficient for T cell costimulation (17Teng J.M.C. King P.D. Sadra A. Liu X. Han A. Selvakumar A. August A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Jurkat cell lines were generated that express CD8α/28 chimeric receptors, in which all four tyrosine residues are maintained (8WT), or the Tyr200 has been mutated to phenylalanine (F200) (17Teng J.M.C. King P.D. Sadra A. Liu X. Han A. Selvakumar A. August A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CD8α/28 receptor expression was confirmed using antibodies directed against CD8α and quantified by flow cytometry. Expression of the 8WT or F200 chimeric receptor was comparable between both cell lines and did not affect CD3 or CD28 expression (Ref. 18Cook J.A. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Fig. 1A). In order to determine if Tyr200 was necessary for provirus expression, 8WT and F200 cell lines were infected with an HIV-1 clone that included a luciferase reporter (HIV-luc) in place of the viral Nef gene (39Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were stimulated with different combinations of antibodies against CD3, CD8α, and CD28 and cross-linked with CHO-Fc as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Luciferase activity was assessed as a measure of proviral transcription. Cells stimulated through the 8WT chimeric receptor plus CD3 showed induction of HIV-1 transcription comparable to that observed when they were stimulated through the endogenous CD28 plus CD3 (Ref. 18Cook J.A. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Fig. 1B). However, stimulating cells through CD3 and the F200 receptor did not result in induction of proviral transcription over the levels of CD3 stimulation alone (Fig. 1B). Engagement of CD3, CD8α, or CD28 alone did not efficiently activate viral transcription. These results suggest that tyrosine residue 200 in CD28 is necessary for efficient induction of HIV-1 transcription following CD3 and CD28 activation. To determine whether these chimeric receptors were functional in primary T cells and mimic normal signals, 8WT and F200 receptors were transiently transfected with the HIV-luc cDNA into CD4+ T cells. Expression of the chimeric receptors was confirmed by flow cytometry with antibodies directed against CD8α (Fig. 1C). Receptors were stimulated with antibodies against CD3 plus CD28 or CD8α and cocultured with CHO-Fc for cross-linking. Activation through the wild type chimeric receptor resulted in induction of transcription that was comparable to that observed when endogenous CD28 was used as the costimulatory signal (Fig. 1D). However, cells transfected with the F200 mutant chimeric receptor and stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD8α were unable to induce HIV-1 transcription over background levels (Fig. 1D). These data show that the CD8α/28 chimeric receptors are functional in primary cells, as well as Jurkat cells, and suggest that Jurkat cells are a suitable model system for investigating the mechanisms of CD28 signaling. More importantly, results from both the primary CD4+ T cells and the Jurkat T cell lines demonstrate that Tyr200 is necessary for CD28-dependent HIV-1 activation. Tyr200 Mediates Vav Phosphorylation and Rac1 Activity—To identify molecules downstream of Tyr200, changes in tyrosine phosphorylation were examined following stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 or anti-CD8α. A decrease in the phosphorylation of an ∼98 kDa protein was consistently observed in cells activated through CD3 and F200 compared with those in which endogenous CD28 provided the costimulatory signal (data not shown). Vav is guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) with a molecular weight of ∼95 kDa that has been shown to be phosphorylated post-CD28 ligation (15August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T.

To determine if phosphorylation of Vav was altered in F200 cells, immunoprecipitations were performed using 8WT and F200 cells either untreated or receiving costimulation through the endogenous CD28 or chimeric receptor. Cells activated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 resulted in an increase in Vav phosphorylation over unstimulated cells. Costimulation through the 8WT chimeric receptor resulted in an equivalent induction of Vav phosphorylation; whereas, cells receiving costimulation through the F200 chimeric receptor had significantly less phosphorylated Vav (Fig. 2). These data suggest that Vav is a critical downstream target of CD28 Tyr200 and plays a role in the activation of HIV-1 transcription. Vav mediates guanine nucleotide exchange of Rac1 downstream of CD28 signals (36Marinari B. Costanzo A. Viola A. Michel F. Mangino G. Acuto O. Levrero M. Piccolella E. Tuosto L. Eur. J.

However, the length of the two b subunits need not be fixed. This led us to ask whether it is possible for two b subunits of unequal length to dimerize in a functional enzyme complex. A two-plasmid expression system has been developed that directs production of b subunits of unequal lengths in the same cell. Two b subunits differing in length have been expressed with either a histidine or V5 epitope tag to facilitate nickel-affinity resin purification (Ni-resin) and Western blot analysis. The epitope tags did not materially affect enzyme function. The system allowed us to determine whether the different b subunits segregate to form homodimers or, conversely, whether a heterodimer consisting of both the shortened and lengthened b subunits can occur in an intact enzyme complex. Experiments expressing different b subunits lengthened and shortened by up to 7 amino acids were detected in the same enzyme complex. The V5-tagged b subunit shortened by 7 amino acids (b Δ7-V5) was detected in Ni-resin-purified membrane preparations only when coexpressed with a histidine-tagged b subunit in the same cell. The results demonstrate that the enzyme complex can tolerate a size difference between the two b subunits of up to 14 amino acids.

The b subunit dimer constitutes the majority of the peripheral stalk stretching from within the membrane to near the top of F1 (21Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Dimerization of the b subunits is required for the normal assembly and function of F1F0-ATP synthase (22Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The two b subunits are believed to exist in parallel as an extended structure spanning from the periplasmic side of the membrane to near the top of F1. Each has an N-terminal transmembrane domain, a tether domain extending from the surface of the membrane to the bottom of F1, a dimerization domain, and a δ-binding domain (23Dunn S.D. Revington M. Cipriano D.J. Shilton B.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ability of b to bind to F1 is proportional to the ability of b to form dimers, suggesting the necessity of the b dimer formation before the binding of F1 to the complex (22Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Presently, there is no high-resolution structure of the entire b subunit.

These studies revealed that the overall structure of the b subunit dimer is a highly extended conformation with ∼80% α-helix. Previous studies have shown that b subunits with deletions of up to 11 amino acids and insertions of up to 14 amino acids, corresponding to ∼16 and 21 Å, respectively, formed functional F1F0 complexes (33Sorgen P.L.

When b subunits with either a seven amino acid deletion or an insertion, b Δ or b +7, respectively, were incorporated into the F1F0-ATP synthase complex, the properties of the enzymes were essentially wild type. These observations suggested that the role of the b dimer is more of a flexible structural feature. However, it was not known whether this flexibility extended to the dimerization of two b subunits of unequal lengths and their incorporation into an enzyme complex. In the present study an experimental system was developed to allow expression of two different b subunit genes and determine whether the differing b subunits were assembled into an F1F0-ATP synthase complex. Here, we demonstrate that the F1F0-ATP synthase complex can tolerate b subunits with a size difference of at least 14 amino acids. Materials—Molecular biology enzymes and oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen, New England Biolabs, and Stratagene. Reagents were obtained from Sigma, Bio-Rad, and Fisher.

The plasmids encoding the uncF(b) gene were used to compliment E. coli strain KM2 (Δb) carrying a chromosomal deletion of the gene. All strains were streaked onto plates containing Minimal A media supplemented with succinate (0.2% w/v) to determine enzyme viability. Cells harvested for membrane preparation were grown in Luria broth supplemented with glucose (0.2% w/v). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (40 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) were added to media as needed. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C for the appropriate duration. Recombinant DNA Techniques—Plasmid DNA was purified with the Qiagen Mini-Prep and Maxi-Prep kits. Restriction endonuclease digestions, ligations, and transformations were performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturers (New England Biolabs, Stratagene, and Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed either by means of a Stratagene QuikChange kit or by ligation-mediated mutagenesis. DNA fragments were separated in an 0.8% agarose gel by electrophoresis and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen).

Epitope tags were inserted into each of the plasmids using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. A histidine epitope tag was inserted at the N terminus by mutagenesis between the first and second codons of the uncF(b) gene to express b his or b +7-his (Fig. 1A). All of the recombinant histidine-tagged b subunit plasmids were then digested with PstI and NdeI and subsequently ligated into a plasmid conferring the chloramphenicol resistance gene and the pA-CYC184 origin of replication (Table I). A V5 epitope tag was added to the C terminus by site-directed mutagenesis before the termination codon of the uncF(b) gene to express b V5 or b Δ7-V5 (Fig. 1A). The recombinant V5-tagged b subunit plasmids included the ampicillin resistance gene and the pUC18 origin of replication. Unique restriction enzyme sites SphI and NdeI were constructed near the histidine and V5 epitope tag sequence, respectively, for an initial detection of the insertions, and then the nucleotide sequence was subsequently confirmed by automated sequencing in the core facility of the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. Throughout this paper, the insertion or deletion and the epitope tag are indicated after the plasmid name for clarity, for example plasmid pTAM35 (b +7-his). Each plasmid and the control plasmids pKAM14 (b) and pBR322 were expressed in the E. coli cell line KM2 (Δb) for purposes of study, so that the only b subunits in the cells were the product of the plasmid genes. The two plasmid expression system allowed expression of various combinations of histidine-tagged and V5-tagged b subunits in the same cell (Fig. 1, B and C). Appropriate antibiotics were added to the growth medium, and in the case of the coexpressed plasmids, both ampicillin and chloramphenicol were added to select for cells expressing both plasmids.Table IAerobic growth properties of mutants expressing epitope-tagged uncF(b) genes and membrane-associated ATP hydrolysis activityStrainsDesciptionGrowthaE. coli strains were grown aerobically on succinate minimal medium.

Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (37Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Ni-resin 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-resin, nickel-affinity resin (purification); BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; wt, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. purification was achieved using the high capacity nickel chelate affinity matrix purchased from Sigma. A total of 5 mg of membrane protein was brought up to 1 ml with final concentrations of 0.2% tegamineoxide WS-35, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm imidazole. The purification procedure was accomplished using the batch method as described by the manufacturer. To control for possible enzyme disruption during the solubilization and purification procedures, the tagged wild-type length b subunits were either mock treated or treated with the homobifunctional cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) after the addition of detergent. Membrane preparations were chemically cross-linked by treating with 1 mm BS3 for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm ethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min. Assay of F1F0-ATP Synthase Activity—Growth on a minimal succinate medium was used as an initial in vivo assay for enzyme viability. ATP hydrolysis activity was assayed by the acid molybdate method (38Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were assayed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.1) to determine the linearity with respect to time and enzyme concentration. Membrane energization was detected by the fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) (39Aris J.P. Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11207-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were loaded on a 15% tris-glycine SDS gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose by electroblot. The b subunit antibody incubation was performed essentially as described previously by Tamarappoo et al. (40Tamarappoo B.K. Handlogten M.E. Laine R.O. Serrano M.A. Dugan J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2370-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1:25,000 dilution of the anti-b subunit antibodies. Secondary antibody incubation was performed with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:50,000), and the antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The V5 subunit antibody incubation was performed as described by the manufacturer followed by a secondary antibody incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000). Signals were visualized on high performance chemiluminescence film using a Kodak X-Omat. Construction and Growth Characteristics of Mutants—To investigate whether it is possible for two b subunits of unequal length to dimerize to form the peripheral stalk in a functional enzyme complex, a collection of plasmids expressing histidine or V5 epitope-tagged b subunits was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The epitope tags were needed to facilitate enzyme purification and subunit detection, respectively, on a Western blot. To express two different b subunits in the same cell, we developed a two-plasmid expression system (Fig. 1B). A total of four plasmids were constructed expressing b wt-his (Cmr), b +7-his (Cmr), b wt-V5 (Apr), or b Δ7-V5 (Apr) (Table I). The deletion removed the segment from Leu54 to Ser60, and the insertion resulted in duplication of the same series of amino acids. A previous analysis of F1F0-ATP synthase complexes with b subunits shortened and lengthened by 7 amino acids found the mutants to be essentially wild type (33Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36261-36266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, it was possible that the epitope tags would affect enzyme assembly or function. This was particularly a concern at the C terminus where small deletions at the extreme C-terminal end of the subunit had been shown to inhibit F1F0-ATP synthase function (41Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Addition of the 14 amino acid V5 epitope tag to the C terminus of b might have impinged on enzyme assembly. The effects of the added epitope tags were studied by the ability of the plasmids to complement the E. coli strain KM2 (Δb) (43McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth on succinate minimal medium was used as an initial qualitative gauge of enzyme activity in vivo because E. coli strains lacking F1F0-ATP synthase cannot derive energy from nonfermentable carbon sources. In each case, the strains expressing the epitope-tagged b subunits grew comparably to the wild-type strain (Table I). Hence, even though deletion of as few as 2 amino acids affected the ability of the b dimer to interact with the F1 δ subunit (41Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the addition of 14 amino acids to the C terminus did not interfere with the interaction of the b and δ subunits. Effects of Epitope Tags—Because F1 has little affinity for the membrane in the absence of intact F0, total membrane-associated F1-ATP hydrolysis activity was used as a test of F1F0-ATP synthase complex assembly. Under conditions of high pH, F1 can be released from the influence of F0 (38Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the amount of ATPase activity in the solution was used as a measure of the amount of intact enzyme complex located in the membrane vesicles. The V5 epitope tag did not have a significant affect on enzyme assembly. Membrane preparations with a b wt-V5 or b Δ7-V5 incorporated into the F1F0-ATP synthase complex had specific activities of about 95 and 82% of the wild-type strain, respectively (Table I). The latter value was comparable with the effect of the 7-amino acid deletion in the absence of the epitope (33Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A slightly greater decrease in specific activity was reproducibly observed in membrane vesicles isolated from cells when a histidine epitope tag was incorporated onto the b wt or b +7 subunit, about 90 and 79% of wild type, respectively. Nevertheless, abundant activity was retained, suggesting very limited effects resulting from the addition of the epitope tags. Furthermore, comparable activities were observed in samples in which the histidine-tagged and V5-tagged b subunits were coexpressed. F1F0-ATP synthase-mediated ATP-driven proton pumping activity in membrane vesicles prepared from the epitope-tagged mutants was used as an indication of coupled activity. Acidification of inverted membrane vesicles was examined by the fluorescence of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (Fig. 2). The level of NADH-driven fluorescence quenching was monitored for all membrane preparations to demonstrate that the vesicles were intact and closed. The levels of NADH-driven fluorescence quenching were strong and directly comparable in every case (data not shown). Membranes isolated from cells with a V5 epitope tag incorporated onto the b wt or b Δ7 subunit, KM2/pTAM46 or KM2/pTAM47, respectively, displayed a very slight reduction in coupled activity. The reduction in coupled activity correlated very closely with the minor reduction in F1-ATP hydrolysis activity. A larger reduction in coupled activity, of about 20–25%, was observed in membrane vesicles isolated from cells when a histidine epitope tag was incorporated onto the b wt or b +7 subunit, KM2/pTAM37 or KM2/pTAM35, respectively. The decrease in coupled activity also paralleled the reduction seen in F1-ATP hydrolysis activity. Moreover, the coupled activities observed in membranes isolated from cells coexpressing histidine-tagged and V5-tagged b subunits were, as expected, intermediate between the V5-tagged species and the histidine-tagged species. The larger reduction seen in the cells expressing a histidine epitope tag arose in part from the plasmid vector. The moderate-copy plasmid vector pACYC184 was used to express the histidine-tagged b subunits. When histidine-tagged b subunits were expressed from the pUC18 plasmid vector, both coupled activity and ATP hydrolysis activity were similar to untagged b subunits (data not shown). Hence the reductions in activity observed in membranes from the histidine-tagged strains reflected reduced amounts of intact F1F0-ATP synthase incorporated into the membranes. For the purposes of this study, the important parameters were the presence of an intact and functional F1F0-ATP synthase enzyme complex and the ability to distinguish the two differently tagged b subunits via Western blot. Detection of Heterodimers—Dimerization of the b subunits is thought to be an early event in enzyme assembly, making the requirement for immediate dimerization of b via co-translation of a single b subunit transcript, feasible. Therefore, it was necessary to establish whether a two-plasmid expression system could be utilized to direct production of two different b subunits that will dimerize to form an intact F1F0 enzyme complex. Two wild-type-length b subunits, expressed from plasmids pTAM37 (b wt-his, Cmr) and pTAM46 (b wt-V5, Apr), were expressed in the same cell and studied for their ability to dimerize. Under the appropriate conditions, the histidine-tagged b subunits allowed for the easy purification of enzyme from a crude membrane preparation using a nickel affinity resin. Via immunoblot analysis, the presence or absence of the V5 epitope tag provided a means to determine whether the two different tagged b subunits are interacting to form a heterodimer. Immunoblot analysis of crude membrane preparations using anti-b antibodies showed the presence of the b subunit in all strains complemented with an epitope-tagged b subunit (Fig. 3A , lanes 2–4). As expected, only b subunits with a histidine tag were retained by Ni-resin purification (Fig. 3A , lanes 5–12). Importantly, F1F0 complexes with only the V5-tagged b subunits were completely removed from the resin during the wash steps (Fig. 3A , lanes 7–8). To detect a heterodimer formation consisting of wild-type-length b subunits, b wt-his and b wt-V5 expressed from two plasmids, immunoblot analysis was performed using the anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 3B). When the two plasmids were coexpressed in the same cell the anti-V5 antibody detected the presence of b wt-V5 after Ni-purification, indicating that the expression system was successful and the tags do not hinder heterodimerization (Fig. 3B , lanes 11–12). To confirm that the F1F0-ATP synthase complex did not rupture during the solubilization and purification procedures, the tagged b subunits were either mock treated or treated with the homobifunctional cross-linker, BS3, after the addition of detergent. As expected, cross-linked b subunits were readily observed only in samples that had undergone BS3 treatment and survived Ni-resin purification (Fig. 3A , lanes 6, 10, and 12). BS3 chemical cross-linking also demonstrated that the b +7-his subunit dimer was stable during solubilization with tegamineoxide WS-35, taurodeoxycholate, and lauryldimethylamine oxide, but not with SDS (data not shown). As an added precaution to ensure there was no nonspecific aggregation of b subunits after membrane solubilization or during Ni-resin purification, two independent membrane preparations were mixed together (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10). Membrane vesicles derived from strains KM2/pTAM37 (b wt-his) and KM2/pTAM46 (b wt-V5) were mixed, and the membranes were solubilized with 0.2% tegamineoxide, allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min, and then treated with BS3 before Ni-resin purification was performed. Immunoblot analysis with anti-b antibodies showed normal levels of histidine-tagged b subunit upon Ni-resin purification (Fig. 3A , lanes 9–10). No V5 epitope was present after Ni-resin purification, indicating that nonspecific aggregation was not a factor in the observed results (Fig. 3B , lanes 9–10). Therefore, any observed interactions of b subunits must have been because of heterodimers integrating within an intact F1F0-ATP synthase complex in a cell expressing both b subunits. Importantly, immunoblotting using the anti-V5 antibody clearly detected V5 epitope-tagged b subunits in Ni-resin-purified samples when the two were coexpressed (Fig. 3B , lanes 11 and 12). Formation of Mixed Length b Subunits in F1F0-ATP Synthase—The expression system was used to study whether unequal length b subunits could form a dimer or, alternatively, whether the b subunits dimerize and incorporate into enzyme complexes in a segregated manner. To determine whether there is a direct protein-protein interaction between the different length b subunits, we investigated the ability of b +7-his to retain an interaction with a b wt-V5 or a b Δ7-V5 subunit following Ni-purification (Fig. 4). All membranes prepared from strains expressing a b subunit were readily detectable and distinguishable by size on an immunoblot (Fig. 4A , lanes 1–7). Only b subunits with a histidine tag were retained by Ni-resin purification (Fig. 4A , lanes 8–12). Immunoblot analysis using an anti-V5 antibody was performed on the membrane preparations and Ni-purified products (Fig. 4B). The V5-epitope tag was detected only in membrane vesicles derived from KM2 strains expressing either the V5-tagged b subunit or the coexpressed V5-tagged and his-tagged b subunits (Fig 4B , lanes 4–7). As expected, upon Ni-resin purification, the V5 epitope was not detected in samples containing only histidine-tagged b subunit (Fig. 4B , lane 8). Likewise, samples containing only the V5-tagged b subunits were not detected upon Ni-resin purification, signifying that they were efficiently removed from the resin during wash steps (Fig. 4B , lanes 9–10). Finally, we investigated the ability of b +7-his to dimerize to form intact F1F0-ATP synthase complexes with b wt-V5 or b Δ7-V5. The b wt-V5 was detected with anti-V5 antibodies and was readily observed to dimerize with the b +7-his, indicating a bwt -his/b wt-V5 interaction (Fig. 4B , lane 11). To a much lesser extent, the b Δ7-V5 subunit was also distinguishable with anti-V5 antibodies (Fig 4B , lane 12). The data indicated that the F1F0-ATP synthase enzyme complex could tolerate b subunit heterodimers with a size difference of at least 14 amino acids. Detection of b subunit heterodimers led directly to two additional questions. How many b subunit heterodimer F1F0-ATP synthase complexes were formed? Were they active? We have not yet purified a heterodimeric complex to homogeneity, and so the direct assay has not been performed. However, an indication of activity could be assessed based on the percentage of homodimeric and heterodimeric F1F0 complexes. Therefore membranes were prepared from strains KM2/pTAM37/pTAM46 (b wt-his/b wt-V5) and KM2/pTAM35/pTAM47 (b +7-his/b Δ7-V5). All membranes prepared from strains expressing an epitope-tagged b subunit were readily detectable and distinguishable by size on an immunoblot of a 15-cm 15% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Densitometry was used to determine the relative amounts of histidine-tagged and V5-tagged b subunits in samples coexpressing the different subunits (Fig. 5B). Relative amounts of the histidine- and V5-tagged b subunits were determined for crude membrane preparations containing the different coexpressed b subunits. In each case, expression of the b his and b V5 subunits led to nearly equal incorporation into F1F0-ATP synthase complexes (Fig. 5B). Relative amounts of the b his and b V5 subunits were also determined from Ni-resin-purified samples coexpressing both b subunits. Upon Ni-resin purification, all of the b V5 subunit seen on a Western blot must necessarily be incorporated into the enzyme complex as a heterodimer along with a b his subunit. Hence, when the two different wild-type-length b subunits were coexpressed, there was at least 15% heterodimer formation (Fig. 5B). It is possible that further manipulation of subunit expression and optimization of the purification procedure might result in a higher percentage of heterodimers being found in the membranes. Somewhat lower percentages of heterodimer formation were found when b +7-his was coexpressed with b wt-V5 or b Δ7-V5 (Fig. 5B). Based on the percentage of heterodimer formation and the activities observed when the different b subunits were coexpressed in the same cell (Fig. 5, Table I), it is likely that the heterodimeric F1F0-ATP synthase species are functionally active. In the present work, we have developed an expression system that facilitates the production, purification, and detection of b subunits of unequal lengths within E. coli. The experiments involved an epitope tag system that allowed us to determine whether the different b subunits segregated into homodimers, or alternatively, whether a heterodimer of long and short b subunits can be incorporated into an F1F0-ATP synthase complex. The histidine and V5 epitope tags introduced into the b subunits did not appreciably affect enzyme assembly or function. Expression of two different wild-type-length b subunits led to three distinct F1F0-ATP synthase complexes in the same cell; 1) a homodimer of histidine-tagged b subunits, 2) a homodimer of V5-tagged b subunits, and 3) a heterodimer consisting of a histidine-tagged b and a V5-tagged b subunit. More importantly, three different F1F0-ATP synthase complexes were present even when the b subunits were not of identical length. We observed dimerization of b subunits between b +7-his and both b wt-V5 and b Δ7-V5. This demonstrates that b subunits that differ in length by at least 14 amino acids can be incorporated into an enzyme complex. Given that the tether domain is likely an α-helix, the difference in length between the b subunits would be ∼21 Å. Dimerization could occur in two ways. First, assuming that the transmembrane domains were in parallel, the hydrophilic domains could be out of register. Alternatively, we favor a conformation in which both the transmembrane domains and the dimerization domains as defined by Dunn et al. (23Dunn S.D. Revington M. Cipriano D.J. Shilton B.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) exist in parallel. This would require that a section of the tether domain in the longer b subunit be out of contact with the shorter b subunit (Fig. 6). It is likely that a parallel alignment of the dimerization domain is required for enzyme assembly. Recent electron microscopy and NMR studies have revealed a distinctive 20° bend in the b dimer within the tether domain (24Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J.

The research presented here suggests the possibility of straightening or further bending of the two b subunits within the peripheral stalk and lends support to the concept of a flexible peripheral stalk. This raises the question of why the tether domain should be so flexible as to allow insertions, deletions, and dimerization of b subunits of unequal lengths. If one views the peripheral stalk to be a rope-like structure linking F1 to F0, then its position holding F1 against the rotation of the central stalk would not be expected to be the same for counterclockwise and clockwise rotation. Flexibility of the tether domain might facilitate the reorientation of the peripheral stalk, to act as a stator for rotation in either direction during ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis. The ability to generate and purify F1F0 complexes with two genetically different b subunits provides a potentially useful experimental tool. It is now feasible to specifically label a single b subunit within a purified complex. This will facilitate biochemical modification experiments and the use of physical methods."
https://openalex.org/W2055016726,"It has been suggested that cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (II) (CRABP(II)) may have a role in the movement of retinoic acid (RA) to its nuclear receptors, thereby enhancing the action of RA in the cells in which it is expressed. RA has also been shown to increase expression of CRABP(II). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that 17 beta-estradiol (E2) administration to prepubertal female rats leads to acquisition of the ability of the lining epithelium to synthesize RA as well as to express CRABP(II). To determine whether this appearance of CRABP(II) was dependent on the production of RA, both E2 and RA were administered to ovariectomized rats. E2 administration induced expression of the CRABP(II) gene in the uterus within 4 h, and this induction was not inhibited by prior administration of puromycin, indicating that the induction was direct. In contrast, RA caused no change in CRABP(II) message level, even at times as late as 48 h after administration. Isolation and analysis of 4.5 kb of the 5'-flanking region of the gene revealed no apparent E2-response element. Using this portion of the gene to drive expression of the luciferase gene in transfected cells allowed identification of a region containing an imperfect estrogen-response element and estrogen-response element half-site, necessary for E2-driven induction. A possible Sp1 binding site in the 5'-flanking region of the CRABP(II) gene was also required for this induction. The ability of E2 to induce expression of CRABP(II) suggests that it can enhance the activity of RA, directly affecting expression of retinoid-responsive genes."

We have previously generated a number of fusion proteins comprising a complement regulator coupled to Fc and shown that the hybrid molecule has a long plasma half-life and retains biological activity. However, several of the fusion proteins generated had substantially reduced biological activity when compared with the native regulator or regulator released from the Fc following papain cleavage. We have taken advantage of this finding to engineer a prodrug with low complement regulatory activity that is cleaved at sites of inflammation to release active regulator.

In each, specific cleavage sites for matrix metalloproteinases and/or aggrecanases have been incorporated between the complement regulator and the Fc. These prodrugs have markedly decreased complement inhibitory activity when compared with the parent regulator in vitro. Exposure of the prodrugs to the relevant enzymes, either purified, or in supernatants of cytokine-stimulated chondrocytes or in synovial fluid, efficiently cleaved the prodrug, releasing active regulator.

Its activation results in production of proinflammatory mediators (such as C3a and C5a) and formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex (MAC). Host cells are protected from damage by proteins present on cell membranes, complement regulatory proteins (CReg). These proteins include complement receptor 1 (CR1; CD35), membrane cofactor protein (CD46), and decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), which act early in the C cascade to inactivate the amplification enzymes, and CD59, which acts late in the cascade and prevents MAC formation (1Morgan B.P.

The genes encoding the regulators of the activation cascades are linked on chromosome 1 and the proteins are structurally related, comprising a number of protein domains known as short consensus repeats (SCRs). These domains consist of ∼60 amino acids, many of which are highly conserved, and are linked end-to-end in the CReg to give flexible, elongated structures (3Reid K.B. Day A.J. Immunol.

DAF and membrane cofactor protein comprise four SCR domains, whereas the most common isoform of CR1 has 30. Under normal circumstances the CReg are sufficient to protect cells from damage by homologous C. However, the active products that enable complement to perform its physiological roles can inappropriately target self-tissues; C-mediated inflammation and tissue destruction is an important drive to pathology in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and transplantation, where it acts to sustain the “vicious cycle” of inflammation and tissue damage. In RA, soluble products of C activation are present in the synovial fluid of affected joints and complement deposits are evident on synovial tissue (5Morgan B.P. Daniels R.H. Williams B.D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 73: 473-478PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brodeur J.P. Ruddy S. Schwartz L.B. Moxley G. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Oleesky D.A. Daniels R.H. Williams B.D. Amos N. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 84: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, affected joints are full of leukocytes (neutrophils and T cells) attracted to the site by a gradient of C5a and other chemoattractants. Although C itself is not always the primary cause of disease in these inflammatory diseases, it acts to sustain the proinflammatory cycle and perpetuate tissue damage. The involvement of C in the perpetuation and exacerbation of these disorders has driven the search for therapeutic reagents capable of inhibiting dysregulated C activation. Drugs mimicking the action of CReg have been effective at controlling pathological activation of complement in vivo in many animal models of disease (8Goodfellow R.M. Williams A.S. Levin J.L. Williams B.D. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Goodfellow R.M. Williams A.S. Levin J.L. Williams B.D. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These reagents are frequently recombinant forms of membrane CReg that have been engineered without their membrane-anchoring domains as soluble proteins (10Harris C.L. Fraser D.A. Morgan B.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some of these reagents, such as soluble CR1 (sCR1), have progressed to trials in humans and have been beneficial in the treatment of acute inflammation, such as in adult respiratory distress syndrome (11Rioux P. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 2: 364-371PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are drawbacks associated with anti-C therapy, including rapid clearance of reagents in vivo, which can be within minutes of administration, and the side effects of long term systemic inhibition of the C system. Individuals genetically deficient in C components are prone to recurrent bacterial infections and immune complex disease, provoking caution in the use of anti-C agents. Such agents might be suitable for short term therapy, for example, in myocardial infarction or adult respiratory distress syndrome, but cannot be used for chronic treatment. To circumvent the short half-life of CReg-based therapeutic reagents, we and others have previously fused CReg to antibody Fc domains, generating “antibody-like” molecules that have a much enhanced half-life in vivo and are effective in animal models of C-mediated disease (12Quigg R.J. Kozono Y. Berthiaume D. Lim A. Salant D.J. Weinfeld A. Griffin P. Kremmer E. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4553-4560PubMed Google Scholar, 13Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that fusion of DAF to antibody domains increased the half-life in rats from 20 min to 33 h. However, functional analysis of two reagents, rat DAF-Ig and rat CD59-Ig, indicated that the CReg function was substantially impaired in the fusion protein. Comparison of activities (moles of CReg) indicated that DAF-Ig had a 10-fold reduction in activity, whereas CD59-Ig had a 35-fold reduction in activity (13Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Insertion of “spacing” domains between the CReg and the antibody hinge partially restored function, which was totally restored if the Fc domains were removed with papain. These data implicated steric constraints in the reduction in function. We have taken advantage of this phenomenon to generate anti-C prodrugs by deliberately fusing functional domains of human CReg to inflexible antibody hinge regions. Insertion of a short enzyme site between the CReg, illustrated here with DAF, and the Ig hinge generates a reagent that can be targeted by specific enzymes to release active DAF from the fusion protein in the relevant tissue. Our model prodrugs contain short regions from aggrecan, the major proteoglycan in cartilage that is degraded by aggrecanases and MMPs in arthritis (14Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Curtis C.L. Janusz M.J. Bohne R. Wang-Weigand S. Taiwo Y.O. Mitchell P.G. Otterness I.G. Flannery C.R. Caterson B. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Aggrecan comprises two globular domains at the amino terminus (G1, G2) separated by a polypeptide stretch of ∼150 amino acids, termed the interglobular domain (IGD), followed by a long glycosaminoglycan attachment region that separates G2 from a third globular domain at the COOH terminus, G3. Extensive proteolytic degradation of aggrecan is associated with cartilage destruction in arthritic diseases; two major sites of catabolism have been identified within the IGD of aggrecan. The major site of cleavage appears to be hydrolysis of the peptide bond Glu373-Ala374 (human sequence enumeration (15Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) generated by the activity of the aggrecanases (members of a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family, namely ADAMTS-4, -5, and -1) (16Abbaszade I.

Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), whereas a secondary cleavage is generated by hydrolysis of the Asn341-Phe342 bond by a number of MMPs and recently reported by ADAMTS-4. Various other minor sites of cleavage within the IGD have also been characterized (18Buttner F.H. Hughes C.E. Margerie D. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Caterson B. Bartnik E. Biochem.

Cleavage of aggrecan is enhanced in inflammatory joint disease resulting in cartilage damage, indeed soluble products of aggrecan catabolism generated by aggrecanases and MMPs can be found in synovial fluid and cartilage extracts of patients with arthritis (14Little C.B.

First, the reagent has enhanced circulating half-life because of the antibody Fc domains; second, it is designed to have little or no systemic activity; and third, it is a targeted reagent, having potential to unleash powerful anti-C activity at sites that express an abundance of the target enzyme.

Construction of Ig Fusion Protein Expression Vectors—Total RNA was prepared from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Ultraspec total RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX) and was reverse transcribed according to standard protocols using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) (CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACGAGGACTGGAGCTCAAGCT17). DNA encoding the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions of human IgG2 or IgG4 was amplified by PCR with primers (see below) that incorporated restriction sites (indicated in bold) enabling direct ligation into the expression vector pDR2ΔEF1α. DNA encoding either three or four SCR of human DAF was amplified using plasmid template and primers that incorporated restriction sites (indicated in bold) enabling direct ligation into pDR2ΔEF1α immediately upstream of and in-frame with DNA encoding the Ig domains. Sequencing confirmed that no errors had been introduced by PCR. Primers for IgG and DAF were as follows: IgG2 sense, 5′-CACGGATCCGAGCGCAAATGTTGTGTCG; IgG4 sense, 5′-GTTGGATCCAAATATGGTCCCCCATG for DAF-IgG4 and AACGGATCCGTGGACAAGAGAGTT for DAF4-IGD75-IgG4 prodrug; IgG2 and IgG4 antisense, 5′-CGAGATATCGGGGAGCGGGGGCTTGC; DAF sense, GCTTCTAGACTAACCCGGCGCGCCATGACC; DAF4-IgG4 antisense, TAGGGATCCTCCTCTGCATTCAGGTGGTGG; DAF4-IGD75-IgG4 prodrug antisense, TGGGGATCCCTTGGAAGTTAGAGATTTTC; three SCR forms of DAF antisense TGCGGATCCATAAATTTCTCTGCACTCTGG. Incorporation of Enzyme Sites—To incorporate the short enzyme site derived from the aggrecan IGD (Fig. 2) into the DAF (3 SCRs)-IgG2 construct, complementary DNA oligomers were used that encoded the polypeptide flanked on both sides by DNA forming the restriction site for BamHI (sense primer, 5′-GCAGGATCCGGAGAAGACTTTGTAGATATTCCAGAAAATTTCTTCGGCGTCGGTGGAGAGGAGGACGGATCCACG, encoding amino acids GEDFVDIPENFFGVGGEED). Oligomers were annealed, digested with BamHI, and ligated into the vector encoding DAF3-IgG2 at the BamHI site (located at 3′ end of DAF, 5′ end of IgG2). To generate the larger construct, DAF4-IGD75-IgG4, DNA encoding 75 amino acids of aggrecan IGD sequence (sequence, GYTGEDFVDIPENF342FGVGGEEDITVQTVTWPDMELPLPRNITEG EA374RGSVILTVKPIFEVSPSPLEPEEPFTFAP) was amplified by PCR from plasmid template, primers encoded the BamHI restriction site at either end of the construct enabling ligation into the expression vector between DAF and the Ig hinge. The major aggrecanase and MMP cleavage sites are underlined. In all cases sequencing confirmed orientation and fidelity of DNA sequence. Cell Transfection and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with expression vectors using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stable lines were established by selection with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Tissue culture supernatant was collected and passed over a Prosep A column (Bioprocessing Ltd., Consett, UK) to purify the fusion protein. The column was washed with PBS and with 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.0, to remove most contaminating bovine Ig and the fusion protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine/HCl, pH 2.5. Eluted protein was neutralized with Tris, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed into PBS. In some cases reagents were applied to a Superose 12 size exclusion column to exchange buffer to MMP digest buffer and to remove minor contaminants such as bovine Ig. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce & Warriner, Chester, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions and using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and either Coomassie or silver stain (35Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 117: 307-310Crossref Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). Soluble DAF without Fc—Soluble forms of DAF comprising either the amino-terminal three or all four SCR domains from human DAF have been described previously (36Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J.

In brief, DAF was expressed as a soluble protein in Pichia pastoris with a carboxyl-terminal oligohistidine tag to enable purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns. The soluble forms of DAF produced had NMR spectra typical of SCR-containing proteins and bound a large range of monoclonal CD55 antibodies (37Daniels G.L. Green C.A. Powell R.M. Ward T. Transfusion. 1998; 38: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sheep E (TCS Microbiology, Claydon, UK) were sensitized by incubating 1 volume of 4% E (v/v) with 1 volume of 1/250 rabbit anti-sheep E (Amboceptor; Behring Diagnostics) for 20 min at 37 °C. Sensitized cells were washed twice in GVB and resuspended to 2%. A 50-μl aliquot was incubated with 50 μl of normal human serum and 50 μl of a dilution of DAF-Ig or control protein. All dilutions were made in GVB and serum was previously titered to yield between 50 and 70% lysis in the absence of inhibitor. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, pelletted, and 75 μl of supernatant was removed for measurement of absorbance at 415 nm (hemoglobin released). Control incubations included cells incubated in buffer only (0%) or in 0.03% Nonidet P-40 (100%). Percent lysis was calculated as follows: percent lysis = 100 × (A 415 test sample - A 415 0% control)/(A415 100% control - A 415 0% control). A non-regulatory fusion protein was used as a negative control protein and inhibitory activity of the test protein was calculated: percent inhibition = 100 × (% lysis with negative control protein - % lysis test sample)/% lysis with negative control protein (13Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The IH50 represents the concentration of test protein at which 50% inhibition was obtained. Where reagents had been incubated in MMP digest buffer and activity subsequently assessed by hemolysis assay, an equivalent volume of this buffer was added to all other incubations. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using the Hoeffer Mighty Small Gel system (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, Newcastle-under-Lyme, UK). Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose that was then blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS, 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated overnight with primary antibody (BC-4, BC-3, and BC-14, all at 1/100 dilution tissue culture supernatant; HD1A anti-DAF at 10 μg/ml) or polyclonal goat anti-human Fc-HRP (1/1000). Blots incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies were then washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min each, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS, 5% milk for 1 h. Blots were then washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min each, followed by PBS, and were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal, Pierce & Warriner) and Kodak x-ray film. Where samples were analyzed following culture with chondrocytes, an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect primary antibody and blots were developed as described previously (39Hughes C.E.

Reagents that were subjected to enzymatic cleavage by MMPs or aggrecanase were first buffer-exchanged into digest buffer on a Superose 12 column. Purified enzymes (MMP3, MMP8, or ADAMTS-4) were added to the final concentrations stated in the text and reagents were incubated at 37 °C for the specified time. To analyze cleavage by native enzyme released from cytokine-stimulated chondrocytes, porcine chondrocytes were isolated from metacarpophangeal joints as described previously (39Hughes C.E.

Samples were reconstituted in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and proteins were separated on a 10% reducing SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with neoepitope antibodies as described above. To analyze ex vivo cleavage by native enzyme, synovial fluid (SF) was collected aseptically from the knees of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. All patients gave written consent and had symptomatic knee effusions needing aspiration for clinical relief. These human SFs were preadsorbed on Prosep A prior to addition of the prodrug to deplete human IgG already present in the joint fluid. SF was also collected from knee joints of rats with antigen-induced arthritis (AIA), the disease was induced as described elsewhere (8Goodfellow R.M. Williams A.S. Levin J.L. Williams B.D. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and fluid was aspirated from the knee joint 9 days following disease induction. The prodrug was added to the fluid at 0.33 (human SF) or 0.2 mg/ml (rat SF) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Fluid was incubated with 50 μl of Prosep A (solid phase) to bind human Fc fragments, the pellet was washed once with PBS, and bound protein was eluted with HCl, pH 1.5. The eluate was lyophilized, reconstituted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above, blots were probed with neoepitope antibodies reacting with the Fc portion of the cleaved molecule. In vivo cleavage was analyzed in the joints of rats with AIA 9 days following disease induction, 200 μg of the DAF4-IGD75-IgG4 prodrug or an equivalent molar concentration of a reagent lacking an enzyme site (DAF3-IgG2) was injected into the knee joint. Four hours later, fluid was aspirated, human Fc-containing fragments were harvested and analyzed as described above. In Vitro Functional Analysis of Human DAF-Ig—We have previously demonstrated that fusion of rat DAF or CD59 to human IgG1 Fc domains reduces their C-inhibitory function (13Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In that study, comparison of rat DAF-Ig to soluble DAF (no Fc) that had been generated in the same cell line demonstrated an approximate 10-fold increase in function when compared on a moles of DAF basis and that of CD59-Ig to soluble CD59 a 35-fold increase in regulatory function. To generate the most effective prodrug based on human CReg, we first determined which fusion protein best abrogated function of human DAF. We assessed the effect on function of both antibody isotype and the length of the DAF molecule incorporated into the fusion protein. The two most “inflexible” human antibody isotypes are documented as IgG4 and IgG2 (42Dangl J.L. Wensel T.G. Morrison S.L. Stryer L. Herzenberg L.A. Oi V.T.

https://openalex.org/W2058761496,"The RecA protein from Escherichia coli promotes an ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction between a circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a homologous linear double-stranded (dsDNA). We have now found that under certain conditions, the RecA protein is also able to promote the three-strand exchange reaction using the structurally related nucleoside triphosphate, ITP, as the nucleotide cofactor. However, although both reactions are stimulated by single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein, the ITP-dependent reaction differs from the ATP-dependent reaction in that it is observed only at low SSB protein concentrations, whereas the ATP-dependent reaction proceeds efficiently even at high SSB protein concentrations. Moreover, the circular ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein is strongly inhibited by SSB protein (suggesting that SSB protein displaces RecA protein from ssDNA when ITP is present), whereas the ATP hydrolysis activity is uninhibited even at high SSB protein concentrations (because RecA protein is resistant to displacement by SSB protein when ATP is present). These results suggest that SSB protein does not stimulate the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction presynaptically (by facilitating the binding of RecA protein to the circular ssDNA substrate) but may act postsynaptically (by binding to the displaced strand that is generated when the circular ssDNA invades the linear dsDNA substrate). Interestingly, the mechanistic characteristics of the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction of the E. coli RecA protein are similar to those of the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction of the RecA protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae. These findings are discussed in terms of the relationship between the dynamic state of the RecA-ssDNA filament and the mechanism of the SSB protein-stimulated three-strand exchange reaction. The RecA protein from Escherichia coli promotes an ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction between a circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a homologous linear double-stranded (dsDNA).

These results suggest that SSB protein does not stimulate the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction presynaptically (by facilitating the binding of RecA protein to the circular ssDNA substrate) but may act postsynaptically (by binding to the displaced strand that is generated when the circular ssDNA invades the linear dsDNA substrate). Interestingly, the mechanistic characteristics of the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction of the E. coli RecA protein are similar to those of the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction of the RecA protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae. These findings are discussed in terms of the relationship between the dynamic state of the RecA-ssDNA filament and the mechanism of the SSB protein-stimulated three-strand exchange reaction. The RecA protein of Escherichia coli (M r 37,842; 352 amino acids) is essential for homologous genetic recombination and recombinational DNA repair. The purified RecA protein binds cooperatively to ssDNA, 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ϕX, bacteriophage ϕX174; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding; DTT, dithiothreitol. forming a helical filament-like structure with 1 RecA monomer/3 nucleotides of ssDNA and 6 RecA monomers/filament turn. This RecA-ssDNA complex catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. In addition, the RecA protein is able to promote a variety of ATP-dependent DNA pairing reactions that reflect in vivo recombination functions. The most extensively studied is the three-strand exchange reaction, in which a circular ssDNA and a homologous linear dsDNA are recombined to form a nicked circular dsDNA and a linear ssDNA. This reaction proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, the circular ssDNA is covered with a continuous filament of RecA protein, forming a structure known as the presynaptic complex. In the second phase, the presynaptic complex interacts with a homologous linear dsDNA, and pairing between the circular ssDNA and the complementary strand from the linear dsDNA is initiated. In the third phase, the complementary linear strand is completely transferred to the circular ssDNA by unidirectional branch migration to yield the nicked circular dsDNA and displaced linear ssDNA products. The E. coli SSB protein, which stimulates the strand exchange reaction both presynaptically (by melting out secondary structure in the circular ssDNA substrate, which otherwise impedes RecA protein binding) and postsynaptically (by binding to the displaced strand that is generated when the ssDNA substrate invades the homologous dsDNA), is routinely included as an accessory factor in strand exchange assays (1Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we found that the RecA protein has a curious nucleotide cofactor specificity. For example, the structurally related nucleoside triphosphates ATP and ITP are hydrolyzed by the RecA protein with identical turnover numbers (20 min-1). However, ATP (S 0.5 = 50 μm) functions as a cofactor for the three-strand exchange reaction, whereas ITP (S 0.5 = 500 μm) is inactive as a strand exchange cofactor under standard reaction conditions (pH 7.5, 37 °C) (3Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 2The S 0.5 value is the NTP concentration required for a half-maximal rate of NTP hydrolysis. We have recently shown that the observed S 0.5 value for the ssDNA-dependent NTP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein can vary depending on the nature and concentration of the ssDNA effector (4Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11082-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All of the S 0.5 values cited in this paper were determined under standard reaction conditions (pH 7.5, 37 °C) with 3 μm RecA protein and 75 μm ϕX ssDNA, unless noted otherwise. We have now found that although ITP is ineffective at pH 7.5, the RecA protein is able to promote the three-strand exchange reaction using ITP as the nucleotide cofactor at pH 6.5. The mechanistic characteristics of the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction, however, differ significantly from the ATP-dependent reaction, especially in terms of the dependence on SSB protein. These findings provide new insight into the relationship between the dynamic state of the RecA-ssDNA filament and the mechanism of the SSB protein-stimulated three-strand exchange reaction and are described in this report.

ATP, ITP, and [α-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences. [γ-32P]ITP was prepared as described (3Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Circular ϕX ssDNA (+ strand) and circular ϕX dsDNA were from New England Biolabs. Linear ϕX dsDNA was prepared from circular ϕX dsDNA by PstI digestion as described (7Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). All DNA concentrations are expressed as total nucleotides. NTP Hydrolysis Assay—ATP and ITP hydrolysis reactions were analyzed using a thin layer chromatography method as previously described (8Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The specific conditions that were used for each set of reactions are given in the relevant figure legends. Three-strand Exchange Assay—Three-strand exchange reactions were analyzed using an agarose gel electrophoresis method as previously described (7Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Aliquots (20 μl) were removed from the reaction solutions and quenched with SDS (final concentration, 1%) and EDTA (final concentration, 15 mm). The quenched aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel using a Tris acetate-EDTA buffer system. The substrates and products of the reactions were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The specific conditions that were used for each set of reactions are given in the relevant figure legends. ATP and ITP-dependent Three-strand Exchange Reactions— The RecA protein was analyzed for three-strand exchange activity at pH 7.5 and 6.5, using either ATP or ITP as the nucleotide cofactor. In the three-strand exchange assay, a circular ϕX ssDNA molecule (5386 nucleotides) and a homologous linear ϕX dsDNA molecule (5386 base pairs) are recombined to form a nicked circular ϕX dsDNA molecule and a linear ϕX ssDNA molecule. The substrates and products of this reaction are readily monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis (7Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The reaction solutions contained 5 μm circular ϕX ssDNA, 15 μm linear ϕX dsDNA (7.5 μm base pairs; 1.5-fold excess relative to ϕX ssDNA), 6 μm RecA protein (all RecA protein concentrations are given as monomer concentrations), and 0.05 μm SSB protein (all SSB protein concentrations are given as tetramer concentrations). The strand exchange reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of SSB protein and either ATP or ITP (3 mm). The strand exchange reactions that were promoted by the RecA protein at pH 7.5 are shown in Fig. 1. When ATP was provided as the nucleotide cofactor, partially exchanged DNA intermediates were visible within 10 min, and essentially all of the circular ssDNA substrate was converted into the completely exchanged nicked circular dsDNA product within 30 min. In contrast, there was no detectable strand exchange activity at pH 7.5 when ITP was provided as the nucleotide cofactor, even after a prolonged reaction period (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with our previously reported results (3Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The strand exchange reactions that were promoted by the RecA protein at pH 6.5 are also shown in Fig. 1. The reaction that was observed with ATP as the nucleotide cofactor was similar to that at pH 7.5, with nearly all of the circular ssDNA being converted into the fully exchanged nicked circular dsDNA product within 30 min. In contrast to the results at pH 7.5, however, the RecA protein also exhibited strand exchange activity at pH 6.5 with ITP as the nucleotide cofactor (Fig. 1). Although the yield of fully exchanged products was somewhat lower in the ITP-dependent reaction than in the ATP-dependent reaction, these results clearly demonstrate that ITP is able to function as a cofactor for the three-strand exchange reaction. Dependence of ATP and ITP-dependent Strand Exchange Reactions on SSB Protein Concentration—To compare the ATP- and ITP-dependent strand exchange reactions in more detail, additional sets of reactions were carried out at pH 7.5 and 6.5 in which the concentrations of circular ϕX ssDNA (5 μm), linear ϕX dsDNA (15 μm), NTP (3 mm), and RecA protein (6 μm) were kept constant, and the concentration of SSB protein was varied from 0 to 0.5 μm (the concentration of SSB protein required to saturate the ϕX ssDNA (5 μm) under our reaction conditions was ∼0.15–0.3 μm). 3S. E. Steffen and F. R. Bryant, unpublished results. As shown in Fig. 2, a low level of strand exchange was observed at pH 7.5 in the absence of SSB protein when ATP was provided as the nucleotide cofactor. The efficiency of the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction increased significantly, however, as the concentration of SSB protein was increased to 0.05 μm (the concentration used in the reaction shown in Fig. 1), with nearly all of the circular ssDNA being converted into the nicked circular dsDNA product at this SSB protein concentration. Moreover, the ATP-dependent reaction remained undiminished even when the SSB protein concentration was increased to 0.5 μm. In contrast, no strand exchange was observed at pH 7.5 when ITP was provided as the nucleotide cofactor, at any of the SSB protein concentrations tested (Fig. 2). A low level of strand exchange was also observed in the absence of SSB protein at pH 6.5 when ATP was provided as the nucleotide cofactor (Fig. 2). The efficiency of the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction increased as the concentration of SSB protein was increased to 0.05 μm (the concentration used in the reaction shown in Fig. 1) and remained undiminished even when the SSB protein concentration was increased to 0.5 μm. These results are similar to those at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2). In contrast to the results at pH 7.5, however, the RecA protein also exhibited a low level of strand exchange activity at pH 6.5 in absence of SSB protein when ITP was provided as the nucleotide cofactor (Fig. 2). Moreover, the efficiency of the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction increased as the concentration of SSB protein was increased to 0.05 μm (the concentration used in the reaction shown in Fig. 1). Unlike the ATP-dependent reaction, however, the level of ITP-dependent strand exchange decreased markedly as the SSB protein concentration was increased above 0.05 μm, with no strand exchange being detectable with ITP at 0.5 μm SSB protein. These results indicate that the ITP-dependent strand exchange activity of the RecA protein is stimulated optimally by low concentrations of SSB protein and that higher concentrations of SSB protein act to counter this stimulatory effect. Effect of SSB Protein on the ssDNA-dependent ATP and ITP Hydrolysis Reactions—SSB protein has been shown to stimulate the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction, at least in part, by facilitating the binding of RecA protein to the circular ssDNA substrate. This facilitated binding is thought to occur in two steps. First, SSB protein binds to the circular ssDNA and melts out regions of secondary structure that otherwise impede the binding of RecA protein. RecA protein then displaces the SSB protein from the ssDNA, leading to the formation of a presynaptic complex in which the circular ssDNA is covered by a continuous filament of RecA protein. Although this facilitated binding mechanism is well established for the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction, the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction showed a more complex dependence on SSB protein concentration (Fig. 2). Thus, it was not clear that the ITP-dependent reaction was stimulated by SSB protein in the same manner as the ATP-dependent reaction. An experimental consequence of the SSB protein-mediated increase in RecA protein binding that occurs in the presence of ATP is that the observed rate of ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis increases when SSB protein is added to the reaction solution (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the role of SSB protein in the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction, the effect of SSB protein on the ϕX ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein was determined at pH 7.5 and 6.5. The ϕX ssDNA-dependent ATP and ITP hydrolysis reactions were first compared in the absence of SSB protein. In these reactions, the concentrations of ϕX ssDNA (5 μm) and NTP (3 mm) were fixed, and the concentration of RecA protein was varied (0–10 μm). As shown in Fig. 3, the observed rate of ATP hydrolysis at pH 7.5 increased with increasing RecA protein concentration until reaching a maximal value of ∼15 μm min-1 at RecA protein concentrations above 2 μm. Similar results were obtained for the ITP hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 3). Because the turnover number for ssDNA-dependent ATP and ITP hydrolysis is ∼20 min-1 at pH 7.5 (Ref. 3Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and data not shown), the maximal rate of ATP or ITP hydrolysis that would be expected under the conditions of the reactions shown in Fig. 3 (with 5 μm ϕX ssDNA) would be ∼34 μm min-1 (1.7 μm RecA protein bound, assuming a maximum binding stoichiometry of 1 RecA monomer/3 nucleotides ssDNA; Refs. 1Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed rate of 15 μm min-1 indicates that only about one-half of the ϕX ssDNA was covered with RecA protein at pH 7.5 in the presence of either ATP or ITP, even when the concentration of RecA protein was in stoichiometric excess, relative to the ϕX ssDNA. These results suggest that approximately one-half of the ϕX ssDNA was inaccessible to the RecA protein under these conditions, presumably because of the existence of the secondary structure that impedes RecA protein binding (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). By comparison, when the reactions were carried out at pH 6.5, the observed rates of ATP and ITP hydrolysis reached values of ∼36 μm min-1, at RecA protein concentrations above 4 μm (Fig. 3). Because the turnover number for ATP and ITP hydrolysis is ∼24 min-1 at pH 6.5 (data not shown), the maximal rate of hydrolysis that would be expected under these reaction conditions would be ∼41 μm min-1. Therefore, the observed rate of ∼36 μm min-1 indicates that the ϕX ssDNA was almost completely covered by RecA protein at pH 6.5, in the presence of either ATP or ITP. The ϕX ssDNA-dependent ATP and ITP hydrolysis reactions were next examined in the presence of SSB protein. In these reactions, the concentrations of ϕX ssDNA (5 μm), NTP (3 mm), and RecA protein (6 μm) were fixed, and the concentration of SSB protein was varied (0–0.5 μm). Because the binding of RecA protein and SSB protein to ssDNA is competitive and mutually exclusive, the maximal rates of ATP or ITP hydrolysis will be observed when the ϕX ssDNA is completely covered by RecA protein, and no ATP or ITP hydrolysis will be observed if the ϕX ssDNA is completely covered by SSB protein (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the rates of ATP and ITP hydrolysis were similar at pH 7.5 in the absence of SSB protein (10–12 μm min-1) and were consistent with a partial coverage of the ϕX ssDNA by RecA protein at this pH. When SSB protein was included in the reaction solution, the rate of the ATP hydrolysis reaction increased with increasing SSB concentration until reaching a value of ∼30 μm min-1 at SSB concentrations above 0.1 μm (Fig. 4). This rate is close to the expected maximal value of 34 μm min-1 (see above) and indicates that SSB protein is able to promote the binding of additional RecA protein to the ϕX ssDNA at pH 7.5 when ATP is provided as a nucleotide cofactor. In contrast, the rate of the ITP hydrolysis reaction decreased with increasing SSB concentration, with ITP hydrolysis being completely inhibited at SSB concentrations above 0.1 μm (Fig. 4). The complete elimination of ITP hydrolysis activity suggests that SSB protein acts not to facilitate RecA protein binding but rather to displace RecA protein from the ϕX ssDNA at pH 7.5 when ITP is present as the nucleotide cofactor. The rates of ATP and ITP hydrolysis were also similar in the absence of SSB protein at pH 6.5 (27–30 μm min-1) and were consistent with a more extensive coverage of the ϕX ssDNA by RecA protein than at pH 7.5 (Fig. 4). When SSB protein was included in the reaction solution, the rate of the ATP hydrolysis reaction increased with increasing SSB protein concentration, until reaching a value of ∼40 μm min-1 at SSB protein concentrations above 0.1 μm. This rate is comparable with the expected maximal value of 41 μm min-1 (see above) and indicates that SSB protein is able to promote the binding of additional RecA protein to the ϕX ssDNA at pH 6.5, when ATP is provided as the nucleotide cofactor. As found at pH 7.5, however, the rate of the ITP hydrolysis reaction decreased with increasing SSB concentration, with ITP hydrolysis being completely inhibited at SSB concentrations above 0.3 μm (Fig. 4). The elimination of ITP hydrolysis activity suggests that SSB protein is able to displace RecA protein from ϕX ssDNA at pH 6.5, when ITP is provided as the nucleotide cofactor. To investigate the SSB protein-mediated inhibition of the ITP hydrolysis reaction more closely, a set of reactions was carried out in which SSB protein was added to an ongoing ITP hydrolysis reaction. The reaction solutions contained ϕX ssDNA (5 μm), NTP (3 mm), RecA protein (6 μm), and a concentration of SSB protein (0.5 μm; added at 12 min) that was sufficient to give complete inhibition of the ITP hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 5, the rate of ITP hydrolysis at pH 6.5, before the addition of SSB protein, was 30 μm min-1 (consistent with the results in Figs. 3 and 4). When SSB protein was added to the reaction solution (at 12 min), however, the ITP hydrolysis reaction was completely inhibited. Moreover, the amount of ITP hydrolysis that was measured immediately before the addition of SSB protein (12 min) was indistinguishable from that measured after the inhibition was complete (15 min), indicating that the onset of inhibition was too fast to be resolved by our experimental protocol. A rapid inhibition of ITP hydrolysis was also observed at pH 7.5 when SSB protein was added to the reaction solution (data not shown). By comparison, when SSB protein was added to an ongoing ATP hydrolysis reaction at pH 6.5, the rate of ATP hydrolysis immediately increased from 30 to 40 μm min-1, consistent with facilitated binding of additional RecA protein to the ϕX ssDNA (Fig. 5). A rapid enhancement of ATP hydrolysis was also observed at pH 7.5 when SSB protein was added to the reaction solution (data not shown). These results suggest that RecA protein is readily displaced from ϕX ssDNA by SSB protein at either pH 7.5 or 6.5 in the presence of ITP but is resistant to displacement in the presence of ATP. To further explore the inhibitory effect of SSB protein on the ITP hydrolysis reaction, a set of reactions was carried out in which the ϕX ssDNA was incubated with SSB protein before the RecA protein was added to the reaction solution. The reaction solutions contained ϕX ssDNA (5 μm), NTP (3 mm), SSB protein (0.5 μm), and RecA protein (6 μm; added at 12 min). As shown in Fig. 6, there was no ITP hydrolysis at pH 6.5 when this order of addition was followed, whereas a full ITP hydrolysis reaction was observed when SSB was omitted from the solution. By comparison, under the same conditions, a full ATP hydrolysis reaction was observed both in the absence and in the presence of SSB protein (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained for the ITP hydrolysis reaction and for the ATP hydrolysis reaction at pH 7.5 (data not shown). These results suggest that RecA protein is able to displace SSB protein from the ϕX ssDNA at either pH 7.5 or 6.5 in the presence of ATP but is unable to do so in the presence of ITP. The inhibitory effect of SSB protein on the ϕX ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis reaction is intriguing inasmuch as the results in Fig. 2 show that the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction (pH 6.5) is strongly stimulated by SSB protein. A comparison of the results in Figs. 2 and 4, however, shows that the low concentration of SSB protein (0.05 μm) that was found to stimulate the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction (Fig. 2) does not result in a significant inhibition of the ITP hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 4). This indicates that this concentration of SSB protein (which is not sufficient to cover the circular ϕX ssDNA) does not displace a significant amount of RecA protein from the circular ssDNA substrate and therefore would not be expected to inhibit the strand exchange reaction. When SSB protein is present at higher concentrations (that are sufficient to cover the circular ϕX ssDNA), however, the ITP hydrolysis activity is strongly inhibited, suggesting that the RecA protein has been displaced from the ssDNA (Fig. 4). Correspondingly, ITP-dependent strand exchange activity is not observed at these higher concentrations of SSB protein (Fig. 2). ITP Hydrolysis by the [D100N]RecA Protein—Although they are hydrolyzed with similar turnover numbers, the S 0.5 value for ITP (S 0.5 = 500 μm) is significantly higher than that for ATP (S 0.5 = 50 μm) (3Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the inhibition of ϕX ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis by SSB protein is related to the elevated S 0.5 value for ITP. To explore this idea, we examined the effect of SSB protein on the ITP hydrolysis activity of our mutant [D100N]RecA protein. In the ATP-binding site of the RecA protein, the negatively charged carboxylate side chain of Asp100 forms a hydrogen bond with the exocyclic 6-amino group of ATP (11Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). This same Asp100 side chain presumably interacts unfavorably with the 6-carbonyl group of ITP, and this unfavorable interaction is likely responsible for the elevated S 0.5 value of ITP relative to that of ATP. In the [D100N]RecA protein, however, the Asp100 group has been replaced with an uncharged Asn residue. This mutation has no effect on the turnover number for ITP hydrolysis but does lower the S 0.5 value for ITP (S 0.5 = 90 μm). Moreover, unlike the wild type protein, the [D100N]RecA protein is able to promote the three-strand exchange reaction under standard conditions (pH 7.5, 37 °C) with ITP as a cofactor (6Stole E. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18326-18328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ϕX ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis activity of the [D100N]RecA protein was first examined under standard reaction conditions in the absence of SSB protein. As shown in Fig. 7A, the observed rate of ITP hydrolysis increased with increasing [D100N]RecA protein concentration until reaching a value of ∼30 μm min-1 at [D100N]RecA protein concentrations above 2 μm. Because the turnover number for ITP hydrolysis by the [D100N]RecA protein is ∼22 min-1 at pH 7.5 (data not shown), the maximal rate of ITP hydrolysis that would be expected under these conditions would be ∼37 μm min-1 (1.7 μm [D100N]RecA protein bound, assuming a maximum binding stoichiometry of 1 [D100N]RecA monomer/3 nucleotides ssDNA). Therefore, the observed maximal rate of 30 μm min-1 indicates that the ϕX ssDNA was extensively covered by [D100N]RecA protein in the presence of ITP. The ϕX ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis reaction of the [D100N]RecA protein was next examined under standard reaction conditions in the presence of SSB protein. As shown in Fig. 7B, the rate of ITP hydrolysis in the absence of SSB protein was 32 μm min-1 and increased further with increasing SSB protein concentration, until reaching a maximal value of ∼42 μm min-1 at SSB protein concentrations above 0.1 μm. This rate is comparable with the expected maximal value of 37 μm min-1 and indicates that SSB protein is able to promote the binding of [D100N]RecA protein to ϕX ssDNA at pH 7.5 in the presence of ITP. These results are in direct contrast to the strongly inhibitory effect of SSB protein on the ITP hydrolysis activity of the wild type RecA protein (Fig. 4) and demonstrate that the [D100N]RecA protein is resistant to displacement from ϕX ssDNA by SSB protein when ITP is provided as the nucleotide cofactor. Accordingly, the [D100N]RecA protein is able to promote an ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction, even at pH 7.5 and in the presence of a concentration of SSB protein (0.5 μm) that is completely inhibitory for the ITP-dependent strand exchange activity of the wild type RecA protein (Fig. 8). The RecA protein is able to promote the three-strand exchange reaction at pH 6.5, using either ATP or ITP as the nucleotide cofactor. However, although both reactions are stimulated by SSB protein, the ITP-dependent reaction differs from the ATP-dependent reaction in that it is only observed at low SSB protein concentrations, whereas the ATP-dependent reaction proceeds optimally even at high SSB protein concentrations. Moreover, the ϕX ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein is strongly inhibited by SSB protein (suggesting that SSB protein displaces RecA protein from ssDNA when ITP is present), whereas the ATP hydrolysis activity is uninhibited even at high SSB concentrations (because RecA protein is resistant to displacement from ssDNA by SSB protein when ATP is present). Taken together, these results indicate that the stimulatory effect of SSB protein on the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction must be due to a mechanism other than the facilitation of presynaptic complex formation between RecA protein and the circular ϕX ssDNA substrate. In addition to enhancing presynaptic complex formation, it has been reported that SSB protein also stimulates the three-strand exchange reaction postsynaptically by binding to the partially displaced linear single strand that is generated when the circular ssDNA invades the homologous linear dsDNA substrate. This binding may stabilize the initial DNA pairing intermediates, prevent secondary DNA pairing reactions, and drive the reaction forward to the formation of the completely exchanged circular dsDNA product (12Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Azhderian E. Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Flory J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the stimulatory effect of SSB protein on the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction is due to this postsynaptic mechanism. This idea is consistent with the observation that the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction is only observed at SSB protein concentrations below that which would be required to cover the circular ϕX ssDNA. At low (subsaturating) concentrations, the SSB protein may bind to the partially displaced linear ssDNA rather than displace RecA protein from the circular ϕX ssDNA substrate and would therefore serve to stimulate the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction. At higher concentrations, however, SSB protein may displace the RecA protein from the circular ϕX ssDNA substrate, resulting in the elimination of the ITP-dependent strand exchange activity. Even at the optimum SSB protein concentration, the competing displacement of RecA protein from the circular ssDNA substrate may reduce the efficiency of the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction, relative to the ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 2). By comparison, because RecA protein is not displaced from ϕX ssDNA by SSB protein when ATP is present as the nucleotide cofactor, the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction proceeds with high efficiency, even in the presence of an excess concentration of SSB protein. The results discussed above establish that ITP is able to induce the strand exchange active state of the RecA-ssDNA filament. This raises the question of why the ITP-dependent strand exchange reaction was observed at pH 6.5, but not at pH 7.5. Because it is generally believed that the ssDNA substrate has to be covered with a continuous filament of RecA protein before strand exchange can occur (1Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the reason for the pH dependence may be that the circular ϕX ssDNA substrate can be extensively covered by RecA protein at pH 6.5 in the presence of ITP, without the assistance of SSB protein. In fact, ITP-dependent strand exchange activity was detected in the absence of SSB protein at pH 6.5. At pH 7.5, on the other hand, the coverage of ϕX ssDNA by RecA protein is much lower (presumably because RecA protein is more impeded by regions of secondary structure), and the level of coverage cannot be increased by including SSB protein in the reaction solution when ITP is present as the nucleotide cofactor. These findings may account for the apparent absence of ITP-dependent strand exchange activity at pH 7.5, either in the absence or presence of SSB protein. However, there also appears to be a low level of coverage of the ϕX ssDNA at pH 7.5 when ATP is provided as the nucleotide cofactor, and yet a limited amount of ATP-dependent strand exchange is observed in the absence of SSB protein at this pH. These results suggest that (i) although only about one-half of the ϕX ssDNA, on average, is covered by RecA protein at pH 7.5, there may be some ϕX ssDNA molecules that are much more extensively covered by RecA protein, and (ii) these RecA-ϕX ssDNA complexes may be intrinsically less active in strand exchange with ITP than with ATP, even when SSB protein is not present to displace RecA protein from the ssDNA. It has been shown that the binding of RecA protein and SSB protein to ssDNA is competitive and mutually exclusive (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, for SSB protein to displace RecA protein from ϕX ssDNA, the RecA protein presumably must first dissociate from the ssDNA before the SSB protein can bind to the vacated site (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that RecA protein dissociates uniquely from the 5′ end of the polymeric RecA-ssDNA filament and that the rate of filament disassembly is dependent on the nucleotide cofactor that is present. For example, although RecA-ssDNA filament disassembly can be detected in the presence of ATP, the disassembly process is completely suppressed when dATP is provided as the nucleotide cofactor (14Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45740-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although ATP and dATP are hydrolyzed with similar turnover numbers, the S 0.5 value for dATP (S 0.5 = 20 μm) is lower than that for ATP (S 0.5 = 50 μm) (16Nayak S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25979-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that filament disassembly is related to the S 0.5 value of the NTP being hydrolyzed, with those NTPs with higher S 0.5 values leading to increased rates of disassembly. If this is the case, it would follow that ITP (S 0.5 = 500 μm) may induce a rate of filament disassembly than is even greater than that which occurs with ATP. This increased rate of disassembly may, in turn, leave the RecA-ssDNA filament more susceptible to displacement by SSB protein. This proposal is consistent with our results with the mutant [D100N]RecA protein, in which Asp100 in the NTP-binding site of the RecA protein has been replaced by an Asn residue. This mutation lowers the S 0.5 value for ITP (S 0.5 = 90 μm), and accordingly, the [D100N]RecA protein is resistant to displacement from ssDNA by SSB protein when ITP is provided as the nucleotide cofactor. We have also shown that the apparent S 0.5 value for an NTP can decrease as much as 2–3-fold when the pH of the reaction solution is decreased from pH 7.5 to 6.5 (3Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that ATP-mediated RecA-ssDNA filament disassembly is strongly suppressed at pH 6.5, relative to that at pH 7.5 (15Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although this pH-mediated stabilization is apparently not sufficient to render the RecA-ssDNA filament resistant to displacement by SSB protein in the presence of ITP (S 0.5 = 240 μm at pH 6.5, data not shown), it may contribute to the activation of ITP-dependent strand exchange activity at pH 6.5. Intriguingly, the ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis and ITP-dependent strand exchange reactions of the E. coli RecA protein (pH 6.5) are similar to the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent strand exchange activities that we recently described for the RecA protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae (17Steffen S.E. Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14493-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ϕX ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the S. pneumoniae RecA protein is completely inhibited by SSB protein (at either pH 7.5 or 6.5), apparently because SSB protein displaces S. pneumoniae RecA protein from ssDNA when ATP is present as the nucleotide cofactor. Nevertheless, the ATP-dependent strand exchange activity of the S. pneumoniae RecA protein is strongly stimulated by SSB protein. However, the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction of the S. pneumoniae RecA protein differs from that of the E. coli RecA protein in that it proceeds optimally at low SSB protein concentrations and is completely inhibited at high SSB protein concentrations. These results indicated that SSB protein does not stimulate the S. pneumoniae RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction by facilitating the formation of a presynaptic complex between the S. pneumoniae RecA protein and the ϕX ssDNA substrate and that stimulatory effect of SSB protein in this reaction is likely due to the postsynaptic mechanism discussed above (17Steffen S.E. Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14493-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the dynamic state of the E. coli RecA-ssDNA filament in the presence of ITP may be similar to that of the S. pneumoniae RecA-ssDNA filament in the presence of ATP (as judged by the susceptibility to displacement by SSB protein). As a result, the E. coli RecA protein can be induced to behave in a manner that is functionally similar to that of the S. pneumoniae RecA protein (in terms of the SSB protein-dependence of the strand exchange reaction), simply by providing ITP in place of ATP as the nucleotide cofactor. More generally, these findings indicate that the dynamic state of the RecA-ssDNA filament will depend strongly on the NTP that is provided as the nucleotide cofactor and can also vary significantly between RecA proteins from different bacterial species. These NTP cofactor and species-dependent variations in RecA-ssDNA filament dynamics can directly affect the nature of the strand exchange reaction and, in particular, the manner in which the reaction is influenced by recombination accessory proteins."
