https://openalex.org/W2737563286,"In this study, we show that evolutionarily conserved chromosome loop anchors bound by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin are vulnerable to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2B (TOP2B). Polymorphisms in the genome that redistribute CTCF/cohesin occupancy rewire DNA cleavage sites to novel loop anchors. While transcription- and replication-coupled genomic rearrangements have been well documented, we demonstrate that DSBs formed at loop anchors are largely transcription-, replication-, and cell-type-independent. DSBs are continuously formed throughout interphase, are enriched on both sides of strong topological domain borders, and frequently occur at breakpoint clusters commonly translocated in cancer. Thus, loop anchors serve as fragile sites that generate DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2736600747,"Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate and propagate action potentials. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of EeNav1.4, the Nav channel from electric eel, in complex with the β1 subunit at 4.0 Å resolution. The immunoglobulin domain of β1 docks onto the extracellular L5I and L6IV loops of EeNav1.4 via extensive polar interactions, and the single transmembrane helix interacts with the third voltage-sensing domain (VSDIII). The VSDs exhibit ""up"" conformations, while the intracellular gate of the pore domain is kept open by a digitonin-like molecule. Structural comparison with closed NavPaS shows that the outward transfer of gating charges is coupled to the iris-like pore domain dilation through intricate force transmissions involving multiple channel segments. The IFM fast inactivation motif on the III-IV linker is plugged into the corner enclosed by the outer S4-S5 and inner S6 segments in repeats III and IV, suggesting a potential allosteric blocking mechanism for fast inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2738291674,"In this study, we investigated whether intrinsic glial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ). Our approach was to establish humanized glial chimeric mice using glial progenitor cells (GPCs) produced from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with childhood-onset SCZ. After neonatal implantation into myelin-deficient shiverer mice, SCZ GPCs showed premature migration into the cortex, leading to reduced white matter expansion and hypomyelination relative to controls. The SCZ glial chimeras also showed delayed astrocytic differentiation and abnormal astrocytic morphologies. When established in myelin wild-type hosts, SCZ glial mice showed reduced prepulse inhibition and abnormal behavior, including excessive anxiety, antisocial traits, and disturbed sleep. RNA-seq of cultured SCZ human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) revealed disrupted glial differentiation-associated and synaptic gene expression, indicating that glial pathology was cell autonomous. Our data therefore suggest a causal role for impaired glial maturation in the development of schizophrenia and provide a humanized model for its in vivo assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2737731334,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel evolved from an ATP-binding cassette transporter. CFTR channel gating is strictly coupled to phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis. Previously, we reported essentially identical structures of zebrafish and human CFTR in the dephosphorylated, ATP-free form. Here, we present the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the phosphorylated, ATP-bound conformation, determined by cryoelectron microscopy to 3.4 Å resolution. Comparison of the two conformations shows major structural rearrangements leading to channel opening. The phosphorylated regulatory domain is disengaged from its inhibitory position; the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) form a ""head-to-tail"" dimer upon binding ATP; and the cytoplasmic pathway, found closed off in other ATP-binding cassette transporters, is cracked open, consistent with CFTR's unique channel function. Unexpectedly, the extracellular mouth of the ion pore remains closed, indicating that local movements of the transmembrane helices can control ion access to the pore even in the NBD-dimerized conformation."

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with an increased incidence of congenital defects, most prominently microcephaly (Mlakar et al., 2016Mlakar J. Korva M. Tul N. Popović M.

In adults, ZIKV can lead to serious neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016Cao-Lormeau V.M. Blake A. Mons S.

Recent studies using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived human cortical neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and forebrain organoids demonstrated that ZIKV replication persists in human fetal neural progenitors for weeks, leading to cell death and attenuation of cortical growth (Garcez et al., 2016Garcez P.P.

Furthermore, ZIKV can infect neural stem cells in the murine adult brain (Li et al., 2016Li H. Saucedo-Cuevas L. Regla-Nava J.A. Chai G. Sheets N. Tang W. Terskikh A.V. Shresta S. Gleeson J.G.

These data support a direct link between ZIKV infection and congenital and adult neurologic symptoms. Two high-content chemical screens reported the identification of drug candidates inhibiting ZIKV (Barrows et al., 2016Barrows N.J. Campos R.K. Powell S.T. Prasanth K.R. Schott-Lerner G.

Med. 2016; 22: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Although these studies validated a screening platform to identify ZIKV inhibitors, none of the hit compounds were evaluated for therapeutic use in ZIKV-infected animals. Here, we describe a high-content screen using hNPCs identifying two compounds that can inhibit ZIKV infection. One of these drug candidates, hippeastrine hydrobromide (HH), suppresses ZIKV infection in the brain of mice carrying replicating ZIKV, validating the therapeutic potential of this drug candidate. To identify anti-ZIKV compounds, we screened the Prestwick library, which includes 1,120 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug and drug candidates, selected for known bioavailability and safety in humans. hNPCs were treated with each compound from the library or vehicle control (DMSO) for 1 hr, followed by addition of ZIKV MR766 (MOI = 0.125) for 2 hr. After an additional 3 days of culture, cells were stained with antibodies against the ZIKV envelope protein (ZIKV E) and the cell proliferation marker Ki67 (Figure 1A). Quantifications were performed by an automated imaging and analysis system (Figure S1A). Positive hits were defined as compounds that increased total cell number by greater than 100% and suppressed ZIKA infection to <20% of control. Based on the fold change of the percentage of ZIKV infection, the signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio is 4.2 and the coefficient of variation (CV) is 6.9%. The Z factor is 0.59, indicating a robust screening system. Using these criteria, nine primary hit compounds were confirmed to significantly inhibit ZIKV infection without inhibiting cell proliferation at 10 μM (Figures S1B–S1D; Table S1). Two hit compounds that showed the highest efficacy (Figure S1C), HH (IC50 = 1.95 μM) and amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate (AQ; IC50 = 2.28 μM), were chosen for further study (Figures 1B and 1C). Both compounds effectively inhibited ZIKV infection and blocked ZIKV-induced growth arrest or apoptosis compared to DMSO controls (Figures 1D–1H). HH and AQ also significantly suppressed the production of ZIKV viral RNA (vRNA) (Figure 1I) and infectious ZIKV (Figures 1J, 1K, and S1E). Furthermore, transcript profiling suggested that HH or AQ treatment reversed the transcriptional changes induced by ZIKV infection (Figure 1L). Interestingly, gene ontology analysis highlighted neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway in both mock versus HH and mock versus AQ conditions (Figure S1F). Finally, 25 μM HH or 15 μM AQ effectively inhibited infection of another ZIKV strain, PRVABC59 (Figures 1M and 1N). Merbromin significantly increased hNPC proliferation but did not affect ZIKV infection (Figures S1G–S1K). Therefore, we focused on HH and AQ for further validation as drug candidates. HH or AQ was applied 2 hr post-ZIKV infection (hpi; Figure 2A). The compounds eliminated ZIKV infection with IC50 = 3.62 μM (HH; Figure 2B) and IC50 = 2.81 μM (AQ; Figure S2A). In addition, HH successfully rescued ZIKV-induced loss of cell viability with no obvious cytotoxicity (Figure 2C). In contrast, AQ affected cell viability at 25 μM, suggesting that AQ can be toxic to hNPCs (Figure S2B). ZIKV-infected hNPCs were treated with HH or AQ for 3 days, followed by 3 days culture in drug-free medium. Both compounds suppressed ZIKV infection to undetectable levels by day 3 (Figures 2D and S2C). By day 6, HH-treated hNPCs remained undetectable for ZIKV infection (Figures 2D and 2E). Consistent with these observations, HH treatment also rescued the cell death rate and total cell number at levels comparable to mock infection conditions (Figures 2D and 2E). Neither ZIKV vRNA (Figure 2F) nor production of infectious ZIKV was detected in day 6 supernatant under HH-treated conditions (Figures 2G and 2H). Furthermore, hNPCs with or without ZIKV infection treated with HH for 3 days maintained the expression of the neural progenitor markers SOX2 and NESTIN and were capable of differentiation into cortical neurons expressing MAP2 and beta-tubulin III (Figure 2I). Therefore, HH can eliminate ZIKV from infected hNPCs without affecting cell identity or differentiation capacity. In contrast, AQ treatment resulted in viral rebound after 3 days of growth in drug-free medium (Figures S2C and S2D), suggesting that AQ only transiently suppresses ZIKV infection. We used qRT-PCR analysis to monitor the dynamics of ZIKV vRNA expression (MR766 strain) in hNPCs. Both (+) and replicating (−) vRNA strands could be detected at 24 hpi, and the vRNA level increased progressively at 36 and 48 hpi (Figure 2J). Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that the percentage of ZIKV E+ cells started to plateau at 48 hpi. Moreover, cell apoptosis was detected at 48 hpi, with substantial cell death from 48 to 72 hpi indicated by induction of CAS3 expression and a decrease in the total cell number (Figure S2E). HH treatment at 24, 36, or 48 hpi successfully suppressed ZIKV vRNA levels (Figure 2K). HH consistently suppressed the production of ZIKV vRNAs in hNPCs derived from different donors (Figure S2F). HH treatment at 48 hpi, 12 hr after the initial detection of replicating (−) strand vRNA (Figure S2H), completely suppressed the production of vRNAs of another ZIKV strain (FSS13025; Figure S2G). The data suggest that HH can eliminate virus from hNPCs carrying replicating ZIKV. hPSC-derived forebrain organoids provide a unique platform to study disorders of brain growth including microcephaly (Bershteyn and Kriegstein, 2013Bershteyn M. Kriegstein A.R. Cerebral organoids in a dish: progress and prospects.Cell. 2013; 155: 19-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We tested both short- and long-term effects of HH and AQ on day 20 (D20) forebrain organoids following ZIKV infection. D20 forebrain organoids were inoculated with ZIKV (MR766) for 24 hr, followed by treatment with 15 μM AQ or 25 μM HH for 3 days (D20+4, short-term) or 17 days (D20+18, long-term). Organoids were analyzed for ZIKV infection, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical analysis of SOX2 and ZIKV E showed that D20 organoids consist mainly of SOX2+ NPCs, and more than 80% of the cells were infected by ZIKV at D20+4 (Figures 3B and 3C). HH was effective at suppressing the percentage of ZIKV E+ cells (Figures 3B and 3C) and reduced the total amount of ZIKV vRNA in the supernatant (Figure 3D) to undetectable levels. Infection of D20 organoids with ZIKV reduced the relative number of Ki67+ proliferating cells and increased the number of CAS3+ apoptotic cells, phenotypes that were completely rescued by HH (Figure 3E). Although 15 μM AQ suppresses ZIKV infection in organoids, it resulted in a substantial reduction in mitotic cells and an increase in apoptotic cells (Figure S3A). D20 organoids were infected with ZIKV and analyzed for ZIKV infection after 18 additional days of growth. While ZIKV-infected organoids without drug treatment were strongly infiltrated by virus, HH-treated organoids were devoid of detectable ZIKV (Figure 3F). Organoid size was measured 18 days post-infection (dpi). The cross-sectional area of ZIKV-infected organoids was significantly decreased compared to mock-infected conditions, modeling ZIKV-associated congenital microcephaly (Figures 3G and 3H). In contrast, ZIKV-infected organoids treated with 25 μM HH and mock-infected organoids grew to a similar size (Figures 3G and 3H). Moreover, HH successfully rescued the ZIKV-induced structural defects seen in long-term cultures. In the ZIKV-infected organoids treated with HH, there are clearly defined zones of progenitors (SOX2+) and neurons (TUJ1+), similar to mock conditions, while in the ZIKV-infected organoids that were not treated with HH, the progenitor and neuronal zones are intermixed and lack discernible organization (Figure 3I). We also monitored ZIKV vRNA expression dynamics using qRT-PCR. Both (+) strand and replicating (−) ZIKV vRNA strands were detected at 42 and 48 hpi (Figure S3B). Significant cell apoptosis was detected in ZIKV-infected cells in organoids at 42 hpi (Figure S3C). HH treatment significantly decreased ZIKV vRNA levels when added at 42 or 48 hpi (Figure S3D). Therefore, HH successfully inhibits ZIKV activity during long-term forebrain organoid growth and rescues crucial aspects associated with fetal brain development. To evaluate the prophylactic activity of drug candidates in vivo, HH or AQ was administered to 6- to 8-week-old severe combined immunodeficiency beige (SCID-beige) mice 12 hr before they were infected with ZIKV (MR766). HH was injected at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day subcutaneously (Figure 4A), and AQ was administered at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day through intraperitoneal injection (Figure S4A). The mice were euthanized at 7 dpi. The levels of (+) strand ZIKV vRNA were low in liver, spleen, and kidney, whereas strong ZIKV infection was detected in brains of infected mice (Figure 4B). HH treatment significantly suppressed levels of ZIKV vRNA in brain (Figure 4C). AQ treatment achieved a similar prophylactic effect (Figure S4B). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ZIKV broadly infects forebrain structures, with strong infiltration of the adult cortex (Figure 4D). ZIKV was found in many post-mitotic TUJ1+ cortical neurons (Figure 4E), but not GFAP+ cortical astrocytes (Figure 4F). HH fully inhibited infection of adult cortex (Figures 4D–4F). ZIKV also strongly infiltrated hippocampal structures, including the cornu ammonis (CA1 and CA3) regions, suggesting infection of post-mitotic neurons (Figure 4G). High-magnification images revealed that ZIKV can infect SOX2+ neural progenitors (Figure 4H) and DCX+ immature neurons (Figure 4I). HH completely inhibited infection of the adult hippocampus, including immature cells (Figures 4G–4I). ZIKV strongly infiltrated the striatum (Figure 4J), localized outside the neurogenic subventricular zone (SVZ), with few ZIKV-infected SOX2+ neural progenitors (Figure 4K) or DCX+ immature neurons (Figure 4L). HH fully inhibited infection of the adult striatum (Figures 4J–4L). Given the strong infiltration of adult brain structures, we analyzed whether ZIKV exerts detrimental cellular effects in the adult nervous system. Immunostaining for CAS3 revealed that ZIKV infection increases the number of apoptotic cells in the cortex (Figure 4M). ZIKV induced apoptosis in both infected and non-infected cells (Figure 4N). Treatment of mice with HH rescued cellular apoptosis associated with ZIKV infection in the cortex (Figure 4M). AQ treatment was also able to inhibit ZIKV infection from all cell types in the adult (Figures S4C–S4K) and rescue ZIKV-induced cellular apoptosis (Figure S4L). To evaluate the therapeutic potential of HH, we first monitored the kinetics of ZIKV infection in adult mouse organs. SCID-beige mice were inoculated with ZIKV (MR766) and euthanized at 24 hpi, 4 dpi, and 5 dpi. Organs were analyzed for vRNA by qRT-PCR (Figures 4O and S4M) and Vero re-infection assays (Figures 4P and S4O). Both (+) (Figure 4O, left) and replicating (−) (Figure 4O, right) vRNAs strands were detected in brains of ZIKV-infected mice at 24 hpi, 4 dpi, and 5 dpi. The (+) vRNA strand was occasionally detectable in liver, spleen, and kidney (Figure S4M, left). However, the (−) strand was only detectable in spleen and became undetectable after 4 dpi (Figure S4M, right). Consistently, infectious viral particles were detected in brain (Figure 4P), but not liver, spleen, or kidney (Figure S4O). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of HH on the infected brain. Based on the dynamics of viral replication, we tested the anti-ZIKV potential of HH at 24 hpi and 5 dpi, two time points when vRNA is detected. At 24 hpi, the ZIKV-infected mice were randomly separated into two groups and treated with vehicle or HH (100 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) for 7 days (Figure 4Q). The (+) and (−) ZIKV vRNA strands were rarely detectable following HH treatment (Figure 4R). In addition, HH treatment at 5 dpi, 4 days after the emergence of detectable ZIKV, consistently decreased levels of both (+) and replicating (−) vRNA strands when compared to the vehicle-treated cohort (Figures 4S and 4T). High-dose HH treatment (200 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) applied at 5 dpi also suppressed (+) and (−) ZIKV vRNA strands in the brain (Figure 4U). Importantly, high-dose HH treatment starting at 5 dpi also significantly suppressed the infectious capacity of ZIKV in mouse serum (Figure 4V). To test the breadth of HH therapeutic activity, we inoculated mice with a second ZIKV strain (Asian strain, FSS13025). HH also significantly decreased levels of this strain when administered at 7 dpi, 6 days after the initial detection of ZIKV in brain (Figures S4O–S4R). Therefore, in immuno-compromised adult hosts, ZIKV achieves disseminated infection outside of progenitor zones, where it typically resides. HH has broad anti-ZIKV activity in mouse brain carrying replicating ZIKV, highlighting its therapeutic potential. We carried out a high-content chemical screen using an FDA-approved drug library and discovered two drug candidates with anti-ZIKV activity. Both HH and AQ can inhibit ZIKV infection of hNPCs. HH, but not AQ, eliminates ZIKV from hNPCs previously infected with ZIKV. As a result, HH can rescue microcephaly-related defects in human fetal-like forebrain organoid cultures, with little or no evidence of cellular toxicity. Finally, HH exhibits anti-ZIKV activity in vivo in the adult mouse brain. Two other anti-ZIKV compounds were reported in mouse models, NITD008 (Deng et al., 2016Deng Y.Q. Zhang N.N. Li C.F. Tian M. Hao J.N. Xie X.P. Shi P.Y. Qin C.F. Adenosine Analog NITD008 Is a Potent Inhibitor of Zika Virus.Open Forum Infect. Dis. 2016; 3: ofw175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and 7-deaza-2′-C-methyladenosine (Zmurko et al., 2016Zmurko J. Marques R.E. Schols D. Verbeken E. Kaptein S.J. Neyts J. The viral polymerase inhibitor 7-deaza-2′-C-methyladenosine is a potent inhibitor of in vitro Zika virus replication and delays disease progression in a robust mouse infection model.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2016; 10: e0004695Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but were only tested for their prophylactic activity. Here, we demonstrated that HH has strong in vivo anti-ZIKV activity, inhibiting virus production and spread in the brains of ZIKV-infected immunocompromised SCID-beige mice. Additional work needs to be done to further confirm the anti-ZIKV effect of HH on other tissues that can potentially be infected by ZIKV, including eyes (Miner et al., 2016Miner J.J. Sene A.

HH was first isolated from the amaryllidaceae family plant species Lycoris radiata and reported to exhibit anti-avian influenza H5N1 activity (He et al., 2013He J. Qi W.B. Wang L. Tian J. Jiao P.R. Liu G.Q. Ye W.C. Liao M. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids inhibit nuclear-to-cytoplasmic export of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1.Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2013; 7: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A chemical analog of HH inhibits another flavivirus, hepatitis C (Chen et al., 2015Chen D. Cai J. Cheng J. Jing C. Yin J. Jiang J. Peng Z. Hao X. Design, synthesis and structure-activity relationship optimization of lycorine derivatives for HCV inhibition.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HH shows no toxicity, even at high doses (100 μM in vitro and 200 mg/kg in vivo). Given the safety and efficacy of HH to suppress ZIKV infection in hNPCs, human forebrain organoids, and adult mice, HH is a highly promising drug candidate for further clinical development to treat ZIKV-infected patients across the lifespan. We also identified AQ (also called amodiaquine) as another FDA-approved drug with anti-ZIKV activity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended AQ as an optional treatment of uncomplicated malaria (Olliaro and Mussano, 2003Olliaro P. Mussano P. Amodiaquine for treating malaria.Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2003; : CD000016PubMed Google Scholar). AQ inhibits replication and infectivity of another flavivirus, dengue virus type 2 (Boonyasuppayakorn et al., 2014Boonyasuppayakorn S. Reichert E.D. Manzano M. Nagarajan K. Padmanabhan R. Amodiaquine, an antimalarial drug, inhibits dengue virus type 2 replication and infectivity.Antiviral Res. 2014; 106: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We found that AQ effectively inhibits ZIKV infection in neural progenitor cells both in vitro and in a mouse model. However, AQ exhibited high cytotoxicity in brain organoid cultures, which raises safety concerns about using this drug during pregnancy. Few options are currently available to treat potentially devastating infections from the ZIKV pandemic, but chemical-based drugs may provide a first-response option. Our findings suggest a strong drug candidate for the treatment of ZIKV infection, in addition to indicating targets for drug development against other flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus, which all cause severe illness.

https://openalex.org/W2737206084,"Obesity is associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation, which can disrupt homeostasis within tissue microenvironments. Given the correlation between obesity and relative risk of death from cancer, we investigated whether obesity-associated inflammation promotes metastatic progression. We demonstrate that obesity causes lung neutrophilia in otherwise normal mice, which is further exacerbated by the presence of a primary tumour. The increase in lung neutrophils translates to increased breast cancer metastasis to this site, in a GM-CSF- and IL5-dependent manner. Importantly, weight loss is sufficient to reverse this effect, and reduce serum levels of GM-CSF and IL5 in both mouse models and humans. Our data indicate that special consideration of the obese patient population is critical for effective management of cancer progression. Joyce and colleagues report that obesity promotes lung neutrophilia in mice, which in the presence of a primary breast tumour fosters metastasis to the lung in a manner dependent on GM-CSF and IL5."
https://openalex.org/W2739478490,"After influenza infection, lineage-negative epithelial progenitors (LNEPs) exhibit a binary response to reconstitute epithelial barriers: activating a Notch-dependent ΔNp63/cytokeratin 5 (Krt5) remodelling program or differentiating into alveolar type II cells (AEC2s). Here we show that local lung hypoxia, through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α), drives Notch signalling and Krt5pos basal-like cell expansion. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of human AEC2s from fibrotic lungs revealed a hypoxic subpopulation with activated Notch, suppressed surfactant protein C (SPC), and transdifferentiation toward a Krt5pos basal-like state. Activated murine Krt5pos LNEPs and diseased human AEC2s upregulate strikingly similar core pathways underlying migration and squamous metaplasia. While robust, HIF1α-driven metaplasia is ultimately inferior to AEC2 reconstitution in restoring normal lung function. HIF1α deletion or enhanced Wnt/β-catenin activity in Sox2pos LNEPs blocks Notch and Krt5 activation, instead promoting rapid AEC2 differentiation and migration and improving the quality of alveolar repair."
https://openalex.org/W2736857446,"The genome is organized via CTCF-cohesin-binding sites, which partition chromosomes into 1-5 megabase (Mb) topologically associated domains (TADs), and further into smaller sub-domains (sub-TADs). Here we examined in vivo an ∼80 kb sub-TAD, containing the mouse α-globin gene cluster, lying within a ∼1 Mb TAD. We find that the sub-TAD is flanked by predominantly convergent CTCF-cohesin sites that are ubiquitously bound by CTCF but only interact during erythropoiesis, defining a self-interacting erythroid compartment. Whereas the α-globin regulatory elements normally act solely on promoters downstream of the enhancers, removal of a conserved upstream CTCF-cohesin boundary extends the sub-TAD to adjacent upstream CTCF-cohesin-binding sites. The α-globin enhancers now interact with the flanking chromatin, upregulating expression of genes within this extended sub-TAD. Rather than acting solely as a barrier to chromatin modification, CTCF-cohesin boundaries in this sub-TAD delimit the region of chromatin to which enhancers have access and within which they interact with receptive promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2738417757,"AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system. Gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, AMPA receptors are critical for synaptic strength, and dysregulation of AMPA receptor-mediated signalling is linked to numerous neurological diseases. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structures of AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes in the apo, antagonist- and agonist-bound states and determine the iris-like mechanism of ion channel opening. The ion channel selectivity filter is formed by the extended portions of the re-entrant M2 loops, while the helical portions of M2 contribute to extensive hydrophobic interfaces between AMPA receptor subunits in the ion channel. We show how the permeation pathway changes upon channel opening and identify conformational changes throughout the entire AMPA receptor that accompany activation and desensitization. Our findings provide a framework for understanding gating across the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors and the role of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2738156861,"ARID1A, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, is the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulator across all human cancers. ARID1A and TP53 mutations are typically mutually exclusive. Therapeutic approaches that correlate with this genetic characteristic remain to be explored. Here, we show that HDAC6 activity is essential in ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers. Inhibition of HDAC6 activity using a clinically applicable small-molecule inhibitor significantly improved the survival of mice bearing ARID1A-mutated tumours. This correlated with the suppression of growth and dissemination of ARID1A-mutated, but not wild-type, tumours. The dependence on HDAC6 activity in ARID1A-mutated cells correlated with a direct transcriptional repression of HDAC6 by ARID1A. HDAC6 inhibition selectively promoted apoptosis of ARID1A-mutated cells. HDAC6 directly deacetylates Lys120 of p53, a pro-apoptotic post-translational modification. Thus, ARID1A mutation inactivates the apoptosis-promoting function of p53 by upregulating HDAC6. Together, these results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 is a therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutated cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2737056551,"Blocking motor cortical output with lesions or pharmacological inactivation has identified movements that require motor cortex. Yet, when and how motor cortex influences muscle activity during movement execution remains unresolved. We addressed this ambiguity using measurement and perturbation of motor cortical activity together with electromyography in mice during two forelimb movements that differ in their requirement for cortical involvement. Rapid optogenetic silencing and electrical stimulation indicated that short-latency pathways linking motor cortex with spinal motor neurons are selectively activated during one behavior. Analysis of motor cortical activity revealed a dramatic change between behaviors in the coordination of firing patterns across neurons that could account for this differential influence. Thus, our results suggest that changes in motor cortical output patterns enable a behaviorally selective engagement of short-latency effector pathways. The model of motor cortical influence implied by our findings helps reconcile previous observations on the function of motor cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2737467198,"Glutamate receptors are well characterized channels that mediate cell-to-cell communication during neurotransmission in animals, but their functional role in organisms without a nervous system remains unclear. In plants, genes of the GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family have been implicated in defence against pathogens, reproduction, control of stomata aperture and light signal transduction. However, the large number of GLR genes present in angiosperm genomes (20 to 70) has prevented the observation of strong phenotypes in loss-of-function mutants. Here we show that in the basal land plant Physcomitrella patens, mutation of the GLR genes GLR1 and GLR2 causes failure of sperm cells to target the female reproductive organs. In addition, we show that GLR genes encode non-selective Ca2+-permeable channels that can regulate cytoplasmic Ca2+ and are needed to induce the expression of a BELL1-like transcription factor essential for zygote development. Our work reveals functions for GLR channels in sperm chemotaxis and transcriptional regulation. Sperm chemotaxis is essential for fertilization in both animals and early land plants such as bryophytes and pteridophytes. Therefore, our results suggest that ionotropic glutamate receptors may have been conserved throughout plant evolution to mediate cell-to-cell communication during sexual reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2738184573,"Signaling pathway modules are often encoded by several closely related paralogous genes that can have redundant roles and are therefore difficult to analyze by loss-of-function analysis. A typical example is the Wnt signaling pathway, which in mammals is mediated by 19 Wnt ligands that can bind to 10 Frizzled (FZD) receptors. Although significant progress in understanding Wnt-FZD receptor interactions has been made in recent years, tools to generate systematic interaction maps have been largely lacking. Here we generated cell lines with multiplex mutant alleles of FZD1, FZD2, and FZD7 and demonstrate that these cells are unresponsive to canonical Wnt ligands. Subsequently, we performed genetic rescue experiments with combinations of FZDs and canonical Wnts to create a functional ligand-receptor interaction map. These experiments showed that whereas several Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, induce signaling through a broad spectrum of FZD receptors, others, such as Wnt8a, act through a restricted set of FZD genes. Together, our results map functional interactions of FZDs and 10 Wnt ligands and demonstrate how multiplex targeting by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 can be used to systematically elucidate the functions of multigene families.-Voloshanenko, O., Gmach, P., Winter, J., Kranz, D., Boutros, M.

https://openalex.org/W2737521299,"Individual and unorganized sports with a health-related focus, such as recreational running, have grown extensively in the last decade. Consistent with this development, there has been an exponential increase in the availability and use of electronic monitoring devices such as smartphone applications (apps) and sports watches. These electronic devices could provide support and monitoring for unorganized runners, who have no access to professional trainers and coaches. The purpose of this paper is to gain insight into the characteristics of event runners who use running-related apps and sports watches. This knowledge is useful from research, design, and marketing perspectives to adequately address unorganized runners' needs, and to support them in healthy and sustainable running through personalized technology. Data used in this study are drawn from the standardized online Eindhoven Running Survey 2014 (ERS14). In total, 2,172 participants in the Half Marathon Eindhoven 2014 completed the questionnaire (a response rate of 40.0%). Binary logistic regressions were used to analyze the impact of socio-demographic variables, running-related variables, and psychographic characteristics on the use of running-related apps and sports watches. Next, consumer profiles were identified. The results indicate that the use of monitoring devices is affected by socio-demographics as well as sports-related and psychographic variables, and this relationship depends on the type of monitoring device. Therefore, distinctive consumer profiles have been developed to provide a tool for designers and manufacturers of electronic running-related devices to better target (unorganized) runners' needs through personalized and differentiated approaches. Apps are more likely to be used by younger, less experienced and involved runners. Hence, apps have the potential to target this group of novice, less trained, and unorganized runners. In contrast, sports watches are more likely to be used by a different group of runners, older and more experienced runners with higher involvement. Although apps and sports watches may potentially promote and stimulate sports participation, these electronic devices do require a more differentiated approach to target specific needs of runners. Considerable efforts in terms of personalization and tailoring have to be made to develop the full potential of these electronic devices as drivers for healthy and sustainable sports participation."

The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of humans has historically been viewed as an association area that receives diverse inputs from sensory cortex, “associates” these inputs for processing more cognitive functions such as spatial awareness, attention, and action planning, and delivers the outcomes of the associative process to more motor regions of the frontal cortex (Balint, 1909Balint R.

However, subsequent single-neuron recording experiments with behaving non-human primates (NHPs) point to a systematic organization of functions in PPC (Andersen and Buneo, 2002Andersen R.A. Buneo C.A. Intentional maps in posterior parietal cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to the current investigation, separate cortical areas around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) have concentrations of neurons selective for saccades (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) (Andersen et al., 1987Andersen R.A. Essick G.K. Siegel R.M. Neurons of area 7 activated by both visual stimuli and oculomotor behavior.Exp. Brain Res. 1987; 67: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), reach (parietal reach region [PRR]) (Snyder et al., 1997Snyder L.H. Batista A.P. Andersen R.A. Coding of intention in the posterior parietal cortex.Nature. 1997; 386: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), and grasping (anterior intraparietal area [AIP]) (Murata et al., 2000Murata A.

Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2580-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). These data suggest that this part of the PPC, rather than being one large association region, is rather composed of a number of anatomically separated cortical fields that are specialized for intended movements that are effector specific (eye, arm, hand). More recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have presented a mixed picture with some studies finding similar segregation for the types of intended movement in areas around the IPS (Astafiev et al., 2003Astafiev S.V.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 1991-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings provide evidence for a degree of distributed and overlapping representation of effectors on both sides of the body within PPC. With the first chronic single-neuron recordings of PPC in humans, we found similarities with the NHP studies. Neurons in human AIP are highly selective for different imagined grasp shapes, while neurons in nearby Brodmann area (BA) 5 are not (Klaes et al., 2015Klaes C. Kellis S. Aflalo T. Lee B. Pejsa K. Shanfield K. Hayes-Jackson S. Aisen M. Heck C. Liu C. Andersen R.A. Hand shape representations in the human posterior parietal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 15466-15476Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the human neural recordings also pointed to some degree of distributed representation, with AIP neurons also selective for reach direction and with AIP and BA5 neurons being selective for reaches with either the left or the right limb or both (Aflalo et al., 2015Aflalo T. Kellis S. Klaes C. Lee B. Shi Y. Pejsa K. Shanfield K. Hayes-Jackson S. Aisen M. Heck C. et al.Neurophysiology. Decoding motor imagery from the posterior parietal cortex of a tetraplegic human.Science. 2015; 348: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). While we have found evidence that multiple effectors are encoded in the same anatomical region of cortex, these studies were carried out in separate sessions and thus the functional organization of multiple effectors within the same population of neurons remains unclear. Pertinent to how different effectors are coded within PPC are recent results that address encoding strategies for multiple dimensions of representations and their computational advantages in association cortices more generally. Neurons in prefrontal cortex and PPC (Raposo et al., 2014Raposo D. Kaufman M.T. Churchland A.K. A category-free neural population supports evolving demands during decision-making.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S.

Miller E.K. Rigotti M. Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), a neural encoding scheme in which different task variables and behavioral choices are combined indiscriminately in a non-linear fashion within the same population of neurons. This scheme generates a high-dimensional non-linear representational code that allows for a simple linear readout of multiple variables from the same network of neurons (Fusi et al., 2016Fusi S. Miller E.K. Rigotti M. Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A basic question is whether such an organization of functional variables is universal or, rather, is in part due to the types of functional variables that were compared or the cortical subregions selected for study. In the current study, we examine the anatomical and functional organization of different types of motor variables within a 4 × 4 mm patch of human AIP. We varied movements along three dimensions: the body part used to perform the movement (hand versus shoulder), the body side (ipsilateral/left versus contralateral/right), and the cognitive strategy (attempted versus imagined movements). Each of these variables has been shown to modulate PPC activity (Andersen and Cui, 2009Andersen R.A. Cui H.

Thus, we are able to look at how different dimensions of motor variables are encoded, and whether different variable types are treated in an equivalent manner (e.g., all variables exhibiting mixed selectivity) or whether different functional organizations are found for different types of variables. Finally, we compare the hand and shoulder movements to speech movements, a very different type of motor behavior. We find that movements of the hand and shoulder are well represented in human AIP, whether they are imagined or attempted, or performed with the right or left side. Single units were heterogeneous and coded for diverse conjunctions of different variables: there was no evidence for specialized subpopulations of cells that selectively coded one movement type. However, the different motor dimensions were not indiscriminately mixed, as body side and cognitive strategy were fundamentally different from body part at the level of neural coding. There was a high degree of correlation between movement representations of the right and left side, within, but not between body parts. The same was true for cognitive strategy. Thus, body part acted as a superordinate variable that determined the structure of how the other variables were encoded. Mixed coding of some movement variables, but not others, argues in favor of PPC having a partially mixed encoding strategy. Finally, while AIP lacks anatomical segregation of body parts, the mixed coding between body parts leads to what we call functional segregation of body parts. Such segregation is hypothesized to enable multiple body parts to be coded in the same population with minimal interference. Recording from AIP of a female, C3/C4 tetraplegic participant 7 years post-injury (N.S.), we compared neural responses of attempted and imagined actions of the hand or shoulder on the right and left side of the body. Hand movements involved squeezing the hand into a fist and shoulder movements involved shrugging the shoulder. Shoulder shrugs are a staple of the participant’s behavioral repertoire being a primary method to operate her motorized wheelchair. For imagined movements, we instructed N.S. to visualize her limb performing the instructed action, while for attempted movements, she was instructed to send the appropriate motor command to move the instructed limb. In the case of shoulder movements, attempted movement resulted in overt motor execution, while for the hand, there was no resulting movement because of paralysis. For the shoulder, we confirmed behavioral compliance by measuring the presence of trapezius EMG activity during attempted but not imagined movement. We used a delayed movement paradigm (Figure 1A). Following an inter-trial interval (ITI), N.S. was instructed to attempt or imagine movement of the left or right hand or shoulder. This instruction was extinguished during a delay period. A generic “Go” cue, visually identical across trial conditions, prompted movement. From initial pilot data, we knew that all hand and shoulder movements evoked activity in the population; however, we were unsure how the different conditions mapped onto individual neurons. Shoulder and hand movements are frequently performed together, opening the possibility that hand and shoulder movements would frequently be localized to the same neural population. We therefore introduced speech as a fundamentally different action that could provide an additional movement for comparison. During the speech conditions, N.S. simply said “left” or “right” as instructed. Eight repetitions of each trial type were pseudorandomly inter-leaved such that one repetition of each condition was performed before repeating a condition. Figures 1B–1E show several well-tuned example units that highlight how neurons commonly coded for a complex assortment of different condition types. For instance, Example B codes for movements of the right hand, whether or not the movement was imagined or attempted. Example C codes exclusively for attempted movements of the left hand. Example D responds similarly for imagined actions of the left or right hand, but not attempted actions. Example E codes for when N.S. spoke “left.” To better understand the strength of tuning in the population to each condition, we fit a linear model to each neuron that explained firing rate relative to baseline (taken as the firing rate during the ITI) as a function of each task condition for both the Go and Delay phases. All eight primary movement conditions as well as speaking were represented in the neural population (Figure 2A). We also examined the magnitude of information content for recorded units by computing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) generated when comparing the Go/Delay period activity to ITI activity for each condition separately (Figure 2B). While there were significant differences between specific pairwise comparisons (Figure S3), results across these measures were comparable overall. We performed a second type of linear analysis, fitting a linear model that explained the firing rate relative to baseline as a function of the three motor variables of strategy, body side, and body part (Figure 2C). This analysis revealed an asymmetry in how body part is represented compared to body side or strategy. In particular, relatively larger non-linear interactions of strategy and body side with body part indicate that body part may in some way structure the functional responses to the other variables, a point we directly address below. We found significant differences in mean firing rates between hand and shoulder movements (hand greater than shoulder, MANOVA p = 5.614e-8) and attempted and imagined movements (attempt greater than imagine, p = 0.0020), and no significant differences in mean firing rates between left- and right-sided movements (p = 0.2951). Comparing the firing rates of all eight movement conditions (pooled together) with the firing rates of the speech conditions, we found a significant bias toward hand and shoulder movements over speaking (t test p = 4.7048e-8). How are these different motor representations coded with respect to each other in the same region of cortex? Figure 3 shows five possibilities: (1) the eight movement condition representations could be anatomically segregated from each other, with a highly specialized sub-population of neurons dedicated to each (sparse mixed selectivity, Figure 3A); (2) an organization similar to (1), save that some variables are subordinate to others, for instance, imagined movements may be a subset or suppressed version of attempted movements (Figure 3B); (3) highly specialized sub-populations are tuned to each motor variable class exclusively (body part, body side, strategy) (pure selectivity, Figure 3C); (4) each motor variable class could be randomly mixed together (Churchland and Cunningham, 2014Churchland M.M. Cunningham J.P. A dynamical basis set for generating reaches.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2014; 79: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Fusi et al., 2016Fusi S. Miller E.K. Rigotti M. Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 37: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) (all mixed, Figure 3D); and (5) some variables may be randomly mixed while others are organized with more structure (partially mixed, Figure 3E). We first performed a degree of specificity analysis (Figure 4) to determine (1) whether highly specialized sub-populations of neurons are dedicated to each movement type, and (2) whether some variables exist as subsets or suppressed versions of other variables. A specificity index was computed as the normalized difference in beta values between motor variables for each neuron (taken from the linear models described above). Values near zero indicate equivalent neural responses to the two conditions being compared, while values near 1 (or −1) indicate exclusive neural responses for one condition. By proposition (1), we would expect values to be clustered near 1 (or −1) as, e.g., either a neuron is tuned to the right side or the left side. By proposition two, we would expect strong biases such that values would be clustered on one side of the range (between 0 and 1 or 0 and −1) as, e.g., a neuron tuned to imagine movement should be better (or equivalently) tuned to attempted movement. Inconsistent with these proposals, we found that specificity values were distributed over the full range (Figures 4A–4F). For instance, despite a small population bias for attempted movements, a sizable proportion of neurons were exclusively or more strongly activated for imagined movements (Figures 4A and 4B; see Figure 1D). The neural representation of motor imagery is thus not a subset, or less strongly represented version, of motor execution. Likewise, many neurons showed preferential coding for the left hand (Figures 4C and 4D) even with a population bias for the right hand. There was a strong specificity bias toward the movement conditions (imagined or attempted movements of the hand or shoulder) over the speech conditions (Figures 4G and 4H). This is expected given that speech tuning is found in a smaller proportion of neurons in a weaker fashion (Figure 2). Of special note, the results here are very similar for both movements of the shoulder (above the level of injury) and movements of the hand (below the level of injury). Thus, movements below and above the level of injury are coded in a similar manner. We failed to find complete specialization of function across the population for single units, and the distributed and overlapping nature of responses makes it difficult to find structure in the responses of individual neurons. We therefore turned to population-based analyses to more readily identify how the different conditions are encoded with respect to each other. We measured all pairwise correlations between population responses for each of the eight movement conditions and looked for systematic structure in how the different motor variables (body part, body side, cognitive strategy) were coded (Figure 5). Correlation was used as a measure of similarity over other distance measures such as Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance because the sign of the correlation is potentially informative of the underlying structure. For example, two conditions represented by distinct neural populations (e.g., sparse mixed selectivity) would manifest as a negative correlation between the two conditions, while a positive correlation would indicate a degree of overlap between the populations. Asymmetric relationships between the different variables were immediately apparent. Correlations between conditions that differed in body side or cognitive strategy were high if the comparisons were made within a body part. In stark contrast, correlations between conditions that differed in body part were low even if cognitive strategy and body side were held constant (Figures 5A and 6A ). Low correlation between body parts was also apparent when comparing speech with shoulder or hand (Figure 5B). Such low correlations despite activating overlapping neural populations are a signature of network responses that occupy distinct neural subspaces, thus minimizing crosstalk during planning and execution epochs (Churchland and Cunningham, 2014Churchland M.M. Cunningham J.P. A dynamical basis set for generating reaches.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2014; 79: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Kaufman et al., 2014Kaufman M.T. Churchland M.M. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Cortical activity in the null space: permitting preparation without movement.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Here the same principal may be at play for cortical representations of different effectors in an overlapping neural population. We term this “functional segregation” of body parts. That the functional organization is based around effector is especially apparent when the distances between conditions were hierarchically clustered (Figure 5C), with body part being the primary differentiating variable. Further, for a given body part, movements with more shared traits are coded more similarly than movements with fewer shared traits (Figure 6B). For instance, a neuron tuned to imagined left-hand movements was more likely tuned to imagined right-hand movements (but not attempted right-hand movements). Likewise, a neuron tuned to right-hand imagined movements was likely to be tuned to right-hand attempted movements (but not left-hand attempted movements). This functional segregation likely accounts for the non-linear interaction terms of Figure 2C. Neural differences between hand and shoulder movements may be driven by the fact that the hand is below the level of injury while the shoulder is above the level of injury: in this case, proprioceptive feedback or long-term effects from the injury might be the primary difference. To address this issue, we replaced shoulder shrugging movements with shoulder abduction movements (shoulder abduction resulted in no overt movement) and repeated the correlation analyses. The results are similar when both body parts are chosen to be below the level of injury (Figures 6C and 6D). In particular, the largest degree of separation exists between body parts. Functional segregation of body parts should lead to minimal shared information about other motor variables when compared across body parts. The motor dimensions can be thought of as categorical variables with two levels (e.g., body part has the levels of shoulder and hand). Given functional segregation, a classifier trained on one level (“Level A”) should fail to generalize to the other category (“Level B”) and vice versa (Figure 7A). Alternatively, for highly overlapping representations, a classifier trained on Level A should generalize to Level B and vice versa (Figure 7B). For example, given functional segregation between hand and shoulder, the neural signature that differentiates right- from left-sided movements for the hand should fail to generalize to the shoulder. We tested for this possibility by looking at patterns of generalization across trained classifiers. The results of such an analysis are shown in Figures 7C–7H. For Figure 7C, we trained a linear discriminant classifier on all shoulder movement trials to differentiate between left- and right-sided movements, regardless of strategy. The decoder performed well within its own training data as expected (leave-one-out cross-validation, Figure 7C, left blue bar) but performed at chance differentiating left- from right-sided movements for hand trials (Figure 7C, right blue bar). The reverse was true when applying a classifier trained on hand trials to shoulder trials (Figure 7C, orange bars). Likewise, Figure 7D shows that a decoder trained to differentiate strategy using shoulder trials failed to generalize to hand trials, and vice versa. In contrast, decoders trained to differentiate strategy or body part were able to generalize and perform well across different body sides (Figures 7E and 7F) and different strategies (Figures 7G and 7H). Body part differences exhibit functional segregation, while cognitive strategy and body side do not. Given that some motor variables are similar in their neural encoding, is it possible to decode the body part, body side, and cognitive motor strategy from the neural population? We constructed a neural classifier to differentiate all conditions (Figure 8). Cross-validated classification performance was high. However, as expected, misclassification tended to occur between conditions with more variables in common. This is especially true between attempted and imagined movements as predictable from the high degree of similarity in the neural responses (Figure 6A). We tested how a variety of motor variables were coded at the level of single neurons in human AIP. This allowed us to address several questions about how intent is coded in human AIP and to better understand how the motor variables are coded with respect to each other. Classically, the regions around the IPS have been viewed as organizing around the control of different effectors such as the eye, hand, and arm. In a recent challenge to the centrality of an effector-based organization, Medendorp and colleagues have found that effector specificity in the BOLD response of fMRI is much more pronounced between the hand and eye than the hand and other body parts, arguing that effectors as such are not differentiated in the planning regions of PPC (Heed et al., 2011aHeed T.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 3066-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In line with these results, we found significant numbers of neurons tuned to movements of the hand and shoulder in a small patch of AIP. However, unlike the response at the level of voxels, the neural response to each effector was functionally segregated. Thus, while our results challenge the idea of strict anatomical segregation of effector representations across cortical areas, we do find local functional segregation of effectors within a cortical field. The current findings suggest that effector specificity at th"

Both cell identities are not static, as endothelial cells (ECs) constantly compete for the tip cell position in a dynamic fashion. Here, we show that both bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and BMP6 are proangiogenic in vitro and ex vivo and that the BMP type I receptors, activin receptor-like kinase 3 (ALK3) and ALK2, play crucial and distinct roles in this process. BMP2 activates the expression of tip cell–associated genes, such as delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), and p38-heat shock protein 27 (HSP27)–dependent cell migration, thereby generating tip cell competence. Whereas BMP6 also triggers collective cell migration via the p38-HSP27 signaling axis, BMP6 induces in addition SMAD1/5 signaling, thereby promoting the expression of stalk cell–associated genes, such as hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1). Specifically, ALK3 is required for sprouting from HUVEC spheroids, whereas ALK2 represses sprout formation. We demonstrate that expression levels and respective complex formation of BMP type I receptors in ECs determine stalk vs. tip cell identity, thus contributing to endothelial plasticity during sprouting angiogenesis. As antiangiogenic monotherapies that target the VEGF or ALK1 pathways have not fulfilled efficacy objectives in clinical trials, the selective targeting of the ALK2/3 pathways may be an attractive new approach.—Benn, A., Hiepen, C., Osterland, M., Schütte, C., Zwijsen, A., Knaus, P.

Here we show that serotonin 5-HT1B receptors in cholecystokinin (CCK) inhibitory interneurons of the mammalian dentate gyrus (DG) initiate the therapeutic response to antidepressants. In these neurons, 5-HT1B receptors are expressed presynaptically, and their activation inhibits GABA release. Inhibition of GABA release from CCK neurons disinhibits parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and, as a consequence, reduces the neuronal activity of the granule cells. Finally, inhibition of CCK neurons mimics the antidepressant behavioral effects of SSRIs, suggesting that these cells may represent a novel cellular target for the development of fast-acting antidepressant drugs."

We investigated whether NAFLD, as determined by the fatty liver index (FLI), could predict incident CKD in 10-year prospective cohort study. We also assessed the clinical utility of FLI to predict the development of CKD.6,238 adults aged 40 to 69 years without baseline CKD from the Ansan-Ansung cohort were examined. Patients were classified according to FLI as follows: FLI<30, no NAFLD; FLI≥60, NAFLD; and 30≤ FLI<60, intermediate. Incident CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The clinical utility of FLI in predicting incident CKD was estimated via area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analyses.During an average of 10 years of follow-up, 724 subjects (15.21%) developed CKD. The adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for incident CKD increased in a graded manner with FLI increased (<30 vs. 30-59 vs. ≥60 = 1 vs. 1.17 [0.997-1.375] vs. 1.459 [1.189-1.791], respectively, P for trend = 0.0012). Incorporation of FLI into traditional risk factors of CKD significantly increased prediction of incident CKD based on NRI (17%; 95% CI, 8.9-25%; P-value <0.001) and IDI (0.002; 95% CI, 0.0046-0.0143; P-value = 0.046).FLI, a surrogate marker of NAFLD, was an independent risk factor for incident CKD. FLI provides meaningful incremental risk reclassification beyond that of conventional risk factors of CKD."

Oleic acid is, by far, the most abundant component of olive oil. Since it can be made through de novo synthesis in animals, it is not an essential fatty acid. While it has become clear that dietary oleic acid regulates many biological processes, the signaling pathway involved in these regulations remains poorly defined. In this work we tested the impact of an oleic acid-rich diet on hepatic gene expression. We were particularly interested in addressing the contribution of Liver X Receptors (LXR) in the control of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis, an essential process in whole body energy homeostasis. We used wild-type mice and transgenic mice deficient for both α and β Liver X Receptor isoforms (LXR-/-) fed a control or an oleate enriched diet. We observed that hepatic-lipid accumulation was enhanced as well as the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of wild-type mice fed the oleate enriched diet. In contrast, none of these changes occurred in the liver of LXR-/- mice. Strikingly, oleate-rich diet reduced cholesterolemia in wild-type mice and induced signs of liver inflammation and damage in LXR-/- mice but not in wild-type mice. This work suggests that dietary oleic acid reduces cholesterolemia while promoting LXR-dependent hepatic lipogenesis without detrimental effects to the liver."

We find that translation of dyrk1a, a Down syndrome- and autism spectrum disorders-related gene, is dependent on Mena, both in steady-state conditions and upon BDNF stimulation. We identify hundreds of additional mRNAs that associate with the Mena complex, suggesting that it plays broader role(s) in post-transcriptional gene regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2739356410,"Background Gestational diabetes is a risk factor for perinatal complications; include shoulder dystocia, birth injuries such as bone fractures and nerve palsies. It is associated with later development of type 2 diabetes, the risk of macrosomia and other long-term health effects of infants born to diabetic mothers. The study assesses placental peptides and maternal factors as potential predictors of gestational diabetes among pregnant women. Material and methods A total of 200 pregnant women were recruited for the study, 150 pregnant women without pre gestational diabetes including 50 women with low risk factors of diabetes as controls and 50 other pregnant women with pregestational diabetes as control. Fasting blood glucose and the lipid profile were determined by enzymatic methods using Envoy® 500 reagents (Vital Diagnostics, USA). Glycated haemoglobin was assessed using the Cation Exchange resin method. Leptin and the Human Placenta Lactogen were assayed using the Sandwich-ELISA technique. Beta chorionic gonadotrophin, insulin, progesterone and estradiol were determined using chemilumiscence imunoassay technique on MAGLUMI 600 analyzer. Anthropometry, including BMI and blood pressure were also measured. Results Fasting plasma glucose (FBG), insulin, insulin resistance, glycated haemoglobin and Human Placenta Lactogen(HPL)were significantly (p<0.0001) increased in the pregestational diabetic women whereas progesterone and estradiol were significantly decreased. In the second trimester however, there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in estradiol, insulin, insulin resistance and HPL between the pregnant women who developed gestational diabetes and those who did not. Leptin, progesterone and FBG were significantly increased in those who developed GDM. The risk of developing gestational diabetes increased with overweight (OR = 1.76, P = 0.370) and family history of diabetes (OR = 2.18, P = 0.282). Conclusion Leptin, progesterone, estradiol estimated in this study were increased in the gestational diabetes mellitus women and fairly predicted gestational diabetes in the non-diabetics pregnant women. Obesity, aging and family history of diabetes were strongly predictive of gestational diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2739423598,"Introduction Although tumor metastases remain significant drivers of mortality, the genetic factors that increase the risks of metastases are not fully identified. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has emerged as an important factor in breast cancer progression with IL-6 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants shown to affect survival. We hypothesized that SNPs of the IL-6 promoter at rs1800795 in breast cancer patients are associated with distant metastases. Methods We performed an initial case-control study using Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s BioVU, a genomic biobank linked to de-identified electronic medical records in the Synthetic Derivative database, to identify germline SNPs that may predict the development of metastatic disease to any site from any solid tumor including breast cancer. We identified a SNP in IL-6: rs1800795 to be of significance and evaluated this finding using a separate, matched-pair cohort of breast cancer patients with and without metastases from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Results The initial study suggested that GG relative to CG at rs1800795 (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.14–2.02; p = 0.004) was significantly associated with the development of metastases. This association was also observed in the Ohio State University cohort (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.06–4.71; p = 0.001). There were no significant relationships between rs1800795 status and any patient or tumor characteristics, including estrogen receptor status. Conclusions These findings suggest that GG SNP at IL-6: rs1800795 may indicate an increased risk of metastasis of primary breast cancer. Further studies in larger population sets are warranted as advanced screening and prophylactic intervention might be employed in GG carriers."

We undertook two complimentary approaches to find EPO-dependent pSTAT5 target genes in murine erythroid cells: RNA-seq of newly transcribed (4sU-labelled) RNA, and ChIP-seq for pSTAT5 30 minutes after EPO stimulation. We found 302 pSTAT5-occupied sites: ~15% of these reside in promoters while the rest reside within intronic enhancers or intergenic regions, some >100kb from the nearest TSS. The majority of pSTAT5 peaks contain a central palindromic GAS element, TTCYXRGAA. There was significant enrichment for GATA motifs and CACCC-box motifs within the neighbourhood of pSTAT5-bound peaks, and GATA1 and/or KLF1 co-occupancy at many sites. Using 4sU-RNA-seq we determined the EPO-induced transcriptome and validated differentially expressed genes using dynamic CAGE data and qRT-PCR. We identified known direct pSTAT5 target genes such as Bcl2l1, Pim1 and Cish, and many new targets likely to be involved in driving erythroid cell differentiation including those involved in mRNA splicing (Rbm25), epigenetic regulation (Suv420h2), and EpoR turnover (Clint1/EpsinR).

https://openalex.org/W2736814050,"Oxaliplatin (Oxa) treatment to SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells has been shown by previous studies to induce oxidative stress, which in turn modulates intracellular signaling cascades resulting in cell death. While this phenomenon of Oxa-induced neurotoxicity is known, the underlying mechanisms involved in this cell death cascade must be clarified. Moreover, there is still little known regarding the roles of neuronal mitochondria and cytosolic compartments in mediating Oxa-induced neurotoxicity. With a better grasp of the mechanisms driving neurotoxicity in Oxa-treated SH-SY5Y cells, we can then identify certain pathways to target in protecting against neurotoxic cell damage. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether one such agent, melatonin (Mel), could confer protection against Oxa-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Results from the present study found Oxa to significantly reduce SH-SY5Y cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Alternatively, we found Mel pre-treatment to SH-SY5Y cells to attenuate Oxa-induced toxicity, resulting in a markedly increased cell viability. Mel exerted its protective effects by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reducing superoxide radicals inside Oxa-exposed. In addition, we observed pre-treatment with Mel to rescue Oxa-treated cells by protecting mitochondria. As Oxa-treatment alone decreases mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), resulting in an altered Bcl-2/Bax ratio and release of sequestered cytochrome c, so Mel was shown to inhibit these pathways. Mel was also found to inhibit proteolytic activation of caspase 3, inactivation of Poly (ADP Ribose) polymerase, and DNA damage, thereby allowing SH-SY5Y cells to resist apoptotic cell death. Collectively, our results suggest a role for melatonin in reducing Oxa induced neurotoxicity. Further studies exploring melatonin's protective effects may prove successful in eliciting pathways to further alter the neurotoxic pathways of platinum compounds in cancer treatment."

Identifying the developmental origin of signaling centers, as well as their subsequent cell fate, is an important step in our quest to understand the morphogenetic processes underlying organ formation.

Despite these efforts, there is still much to learn about how signaling centers arise, and the dentition provides an excellent system to address this. A central feature of the developing tooth are interactions between the dental epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme as the tooth germ undergoes a series of morphological changes and transitions through placode, bud, cap, and bell stages (Fig. 1, A–C). This epithelial–mesenchymal interaction depends on the formation of a number of signaling centers. For instance, in the placode stage beginning at E11, several signaling molecules, such as Shh, Wnt10b, and Bmp2, are expressed in the dental epithelium (12.Dassule H.R. McMahon A.P.

Biol. 2000; 44: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). As development progresses through later stages, additional distinct signaling centers are then formed. At E12.5, a signaling center is observed in the anterior portion of the developing tooth bud and expresses genes encoding several signaling molecules, including Shh (15.Hovorakova M. Prochazka J.

Biol. 2012; 4: a008425Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the incisor, this signaling center is known as the initiation knot (IK) and is located at the junction between the tooth germ and the vestibular lamina that becomes the future cleft between lips and teeth (22.Hovorakova M. Lochovska K. Zahradnicek O. Domonkosova Tibenska K. Dornhoferova M. Horakova-Smrckova L. Bodorikova S. One odontogenic cell-population contributes to the development of the mouse incisors and of the oral vestibule.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0162523Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The IK is composed of non-proliferative cells and has been shown to regulate the size of the early tooth germ (Fig. 1, A and D) (23.Ahtiainen L. Uski I. Thesleff I. Mikkola M.L. Early epithelial signaling center governs tooth budding morphogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At the cap stage, a second signaling center, called the EK, is formed. Similar to the IK, the EK is characterized by an array of signaling molecules, such as Shh, Bmp4, Bmp7, Wnt10a/b, Fgf4, and Fgf20, as well as the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (Fig. 1, B, C, and E) (4.Jernvall J.

Commun. 2016; 7: 12133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, several differences exist between the molar and incisor EKs related to the distinct geometries of the developing structures. For example, the molar primary EK disappears as a result of apoptosis and is subsequently succeeded by the secondary EKs, which produce a similar complement of signaling molecules as the primary EK and plays a role in defining future cusp positions (4.Jernvall J. Aberg T. Kettunen P. Keränen S. Thesleff I.

Aspects of cell proliferation kinetics of the inner dental epithelium during mouse molar and incisor morphogenesis: a reappraisal of the role of the enamel knot area.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 261-267PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, only one EK is formed in the incisor (29.Kieffer S. Peterkova R. Vonesch J.L. Ruch J.V. Peterka M. Lesot H. Morphogenesis of the lower incisor in the mouse from the bud to early bell stage.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 531-539PubMed Google Scholar). These differences reflect the eventual morphological distinctions between multicuspid molars and unicuspid incisors and point to the functional significance of the EKs during tooth morphogenesis. One potential mechanism for EK formation is through recruitment of cells from the IK, as the two signaling centers share many common features, and IK cells that are genetically labeled using ShhCreER appear to give rise to the EK (16.Hovorakova M. Smrckova L. Lesot H. Lochovska K. Peterka M. Peterkova R. Sequential Shh expression in the development of the mouse upper functional incisor.J. Exp. Zool. B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2013; 320: 455-464PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the labeling of the EK observed previously could result from tamoxifen that persisted in the animal as a result of the high dosage administered. A second potential mechanism for generating the EK is by means of de novo formation. This idea was supported by a recent study that combined live imaging and the use of Fucci (fluorescent cell cycle indicator)-red reporter mice to track G0/G1 cells, which found that the EK is formed in situ as opposed to being derived from the IK (23.Ahtiainen L. Uski I. Thesleff I. Mikkola M.L. Early epithelial signaling center governs tooth budding morphogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, as IK cells are not permanently labeled in this experiment and only G0/G1 cells are tracked, it does not exclude the possibility that IK cells re-enter the cell cycle prior to contributing to the EK, thus eluding tracking by live imaging. As a result, the lineage connection between the IK and the EK remains an open question. To definitively understand the lineage relationships between serially formed signaling centers, we utilized tamoxifen-inducible genetic lineage tracing and DiI labeling to track the cell fate of different populations in developing teeth. We found that there are at least two ways that new signaling centers are established. The first is exemplified by the incisor EK, which is formed de novo from E12.5 posterior ventral basal cells that are distinct from progeny of the IK. The second mechanism is by incorporating progeny from previously formed signaling centers, a process employed during formation of the molar buccal secondary EK. Shh is expressed during the early stages of tooth development and is essential for proper tooth morphogenesis (30.Cobourne M.T. Hardcastle Z. Sharpe P.T. Sonic hedgehog regulates epithelial proliferation and cell survival in the developing tooth germ.J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although Shh expression is well studied in the developing molar (31.Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P. Hedgehog and Bmp genes are coexpressed at many diverse sites of cell-cell interaction in the mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 32.Dassule H.R. Lewis P. Bei M. Maas R. McMahon A.P. Sonic hedgehog regulates growth and morphogenesis of the tooth.Development. 2000; 127: 4775-4785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its expression pattern in the incisor tooth germ across different developmental stages at a histological level has not been documented in as much detail. Therefore, we first set out to examine the expression of Shh by means of section in situ hybridization at several stages of early incisor development. At E12.5, a Shh-expressing domain corresponding to the IK was present in the anterior incisor adjacent to the vestibular lamina (Fig. 1D). This expression pattern remained unchanged at E13, despite the increased tooth germ size (supplemental Fig. S1A). However, at E13.5, a new Shh-expressing region, marking the newly formed EK, was observed in the posterior dental epithelium, which was distinct from the IK; no Shh-positive cells could be detected between the IK and the EK (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S1B). At this stage, Shh expression in the IK began to quickly down-regulate and could no longer be observed at later time points (supplemental Fig. S1B). Finally, at E14.5, instead of being restricted to the EK region, the posterior Shh expression expanded laterally and was present in the cells of the inner enamel epithelium (Fig. 1F). These cells eventually become ameloblasts and the stellate reticulum, a population of cells that lies underneath the enamel epithelium. To investigate whether EK cells are progeny of the Shh-expressing IK cells, we generated ShhCreER; R26RmTmG mice, where membrane EGFP expression is regulated by a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase that is under the control of the Shh promoter, thus allowing us to genetically label and lineage trace Shh-expressing cells at desired time points. To unambiguously label only the IK cells, but not the EK cells that form 24 h later, we set out to identify the appropriate tamoxifen concentration for CreER induction. This is a critical issue, because the time span for effective CreER-mediated recombination depends on the amount and the latency of tamoxifen in the body. The mouse limb bud presents an ideal system to test this, as the initiation of Shh in the ZPA at E9.75 is well established, and the ZPA represents the only Shh-expressing domain in the limb (33.Echelard Y. Epstein D.J. St-Jacques B. Shen L. Mohler J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Sonic hedgehog, a member of a family of putative signaling molecules, is implicated in the regulation of CNS polarity.Cell. 1993; 75: 1417-1430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). When 2.5 mg/30 g body weight of tamoxifen was gavaged to induce CreER activation at E7.75, 48 h prior to the onset of Shh expression in the ZPA, GFP-positive cells could still be detected in the E10.5 limb bud (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), suggesting that this concentration of tamoxifen was sufficiently high that it perdured and could label Shh-expressing cells. On the contrary, when 0.8 mg/30 g body weight of tamoxifen was administered at E7.75, no GFP-positive cells were present (supplemental Fig. S2C). Based on these results, we labeled IK cells by providing 0.8 mg/30 g body weight of tamoxifen to female mice carrying E11.5 ShhCreER; R26RmTmG embryos. We observed GFP-positive cells in the IK at the junction of the vestibular lamina and the incisor tooth germ at E12.5 (Fig. 1, G and H). Interestingly, at both E13.5 and E14.5, the EK was devoid of GFP-positive cells, although GFP-expressing cells were still present in the anterior tooth germ where the IK was previously located (Fig. 1, I and J). Similarly, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of lineage traced samples using 2-photon microscopy also showed negative labeling within the EK region (supplemental Movies S1–S3), indicating that EK cells are not descendants of IK cells. The results above point to the possibility that the EK is formed de novo from non-signaling cells and that EK cells may descend from the posterior portion of the incisor tooth germ. We tested this idea by first utilizing Sox2CreER; R26RmTmG embryos for lineage tracing, as Sox2 is expressed exclusively in the posterior tooth germ at E12.5 (Fig. 2A). To that end, we induced the Cre recombinase activity at E11.5 and were able to label the posterior region of the tooth germ at E12.5 (Fig. 2, D–E′). At E13.5, 48 h after Cre induction, GFP expression could be observed in both the basal and suprabasal cells of the posterior tooth germ (Fig. 2, F and F′). Importantly, several cells in the EK, as marked by the EK marker p21 (4.Jernvall J. Aberg T. Kettunen P. Keränen S. Thesleff I. The life history of an embryonic signaling center: BMP-4 induces p21 and is associated with apoptosis in the mouse tooth enamel knot.Development. 1998; 125: 161-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also expressed membrane EGFP (Fig. 2, F and F′), indicating that at least some of the EK cells are derived from the E12.5 posterior incisor epithelium. Of note, whereas some of the p21-positive cells were GFP-negative and could arise from a non-Sox2-expressing population, this mosaicism is likely due to varied CreER recombination in different cells. Similar lineage tracing results were obtained at E14.5, where GFP-positive cells became more widely distributed in the EK (Fig. 2, G and G′). This finding was unlikely to be confounded by delayed recombination taking place within the EK at E13.5 or E14.5 as a result of residual tamoxifen, as Sox2 is not normally expressed in the EK at these stages (Fig. 2, B and C) (34.Juuri E.

Expression pattern of Sox2 during mouse tooth development.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2012; 12: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Sox2CreER lineage studies demonstrated that the posterior incisor epithelium is the source of the EK cells, but they could not resolve the exact origin of these cells because of the relatively broad expression of Sox2. Injection of the lipophilic vital dye DiI allows accurate and specific marking of a subgroup of cells that could not otherwise be distinguished from neighboring populations using genetic labeling due to the lack of cell-specific markers. The combination of DiI labeling with tissue slice culture thus provides a powerful approach to lineage trace any region of interest over a period of time (36.Matalova E. Antonarakis G.S. Sharpe P.T.

The fate of the CNS midline progenitors in Drosophila as revealed by a new method for single cell labelling.Development. 1994; 120: 1895-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To that end, we injected DiI to E12.5 K14–actin–GFP mandible slices, which express GFP in the oral epithelium, enabling easy visualization of the tooth germ and accurate injection at the target site (Fig. 3A). Injection was carried out at four distinct locations: 1) the vestibular lamina/tooth germ junction that corresponds to the IK region (Fig. 3B); 2) the basal cells of the posterior dorsal half of tooth germ (Fig. 3C); 3) the basal cells of the posterior ventral half of tooth germ (Fig. 3D); 4) the ventral most basal cells (Fig. 3E). We then followed the movement of these cells in the GFP-positive epithelium for 2 days in culture (Fig. 3, F–I). Consistent with ShhCreER lineage tracing, DiI-labeled IK cells remained locally restricted and did not give rise to the EK, which can be visualized by Shh in situ hybridization (Fig. 3J). In comparison, many labeled tissues in the ventral tip or posterior dorsal portion of the tooth germ could be found to contribute to the stellate reticulum (suprabasal) region of the developing tooth bud after 48 h of culturing, although none moved to the EK (Fig. 3, K and M). In contrast, basal epithelium located in the posterior ventral portion of the tooth germ consistently give rise to parts of the EK, as demonstrated by overlapping DiI signal with Shh expression (Fig. 3L). Although the production of ligands from signaling centers is critical for organ development, timely termination of the signaling events is also an integral part of the regulatory process. One avenue for achieving this is by eliminating signaling cells through apoptosis, such as in the anterior neural ridge of the brain and the primary EK in the molars (4.Jernvall J. Aberg T. Kettunen P. Keränen S. Thesleff I.

Apoptosis in the developing tooth: association with an embryonic signaling center and suppression by EGF and FGF-4.Development. 1996; 122: 121-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether incisor EKs undergo similar self-destruction, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining and found that, although no apoptosis could be detected in the EK at E13.5 and E14.5, there was a slight increase in the number of apoptotic cells at E15.5 (6 ± 2.16 apoptotic cells per section, n = 4) (supplemental Fig. S3, A–C). This result is similar to what has been reported (42.Miard S. Peterková R. Vonesch J.L. Peterka M. Ruch J.V. Lesot H. Alterations in the incisor development in the Tabby mouse.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 517-529PubMed Google Scholar), although in some studies apoptosis has been observed at E13.5–E14 (29.Kieffer S. Peterkova R. Vonesch J.L. Ruch J.V. Peterka M. Lesot H. Morphogenesis of the lower incisor in the mouse from the bud to early bell stage.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 531-539PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Miard S. Peterková R. Vonesch J.L. Peterka M. Ruch J.V. Lesot H. Alterations in the incisor development in the Tabby mouse.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 517-529PubMed Google Scholar), potentially due to differences in genetic backgrounds. The amount of apoptosis we observed then became diminished at E16.5, with the EK morphological bulge still retained (supplemental Fig. S3D). As a result, at least a small portion of the incisor EK was removed through cell death. However, as not all EK cells undergo apoptosis, we hypothesized that they could be incorporated into the developing epithelium and performed lineage tracing to track the fate of EK cells. Because Shh is a key marker of the EK, we again used the ShhCreER; R26RmTmG line to address this question (Fig. 4C). We first performed lineage tracing by gavaging 0.8 mg/30 g body weight of tamoxifen to pregnant females carrying E12.5 embryos to label the EK at E13.5 without marking non-EK cells that begin to express Shh at E14.5. However, this labeling protocol yielded few GFP-positive cells in the EK at E13.5 and E14.5 (data not shown), suggesting that the denser and non-proliferating EK cells may only undergo efficient recombination when a higher concentration of tamoxifen is used. To circumvent this, 2.5 mg/30 g body weight of tamoxifen was administered at E11.5 (Fig. 4A), 72 h prior to the onset of Shh expression in non-"

A total of six candidate reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1, PPID, TBP, TUBB3) in four organs (heart, liver, spleen, and thymus) over five perinatal time points (Embryonic days 14.5, 16.5, 18.5, Post-natal days 0, 21) were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression stability of the candidate reference genes were analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, Bestkeeper, Delta CT method, and RefFinder software packages. Detailed methodology for isolation of high quality/purity RNA and analysis is presented. Detailed analysis demonstrated that TBP is the best single reference gene for embryonic samples and HPRT1 is the best single reference gene for post-natal and pooled embryonic and post-natal samples. Organ-level analysis demonstrated that HPRT1 was the most suitable reference gene for heart, liver and thymus samples, while TBP was the best candidate for spleen samples. In general, TUBB3 was consistently the least stable gene for normalization. This is the first study to describe a systematic comprehensive selection of reference genes for murine extramedullary hematopoietic tissues over a developmental time course. We provide suggested reference genes for individual tissues and developmental stages and propose that a combination of reference genes affords flexibility in experimental design and analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2952616894,"Similarly to its homologs in other bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa partitioning protein ParB facilitates segregation of newly replicated chromosomes. Lack of ParB is not lethal but results in increased frequency of anucleate cells production, longer division time, cell elongation, altered colony morphology and defective swarming and swimming motility. Unlike in other bacteria, inactivation of parB leads to major changes of the transcriptome, suggesting that, directly or indirectly, ParB plays a role in regulation of gene expression in this organism. ParB overproduction affects growth rate, cell division and motility in a similar way as ParB deficiency. To identify primary ParB targets, here we analysed the impact of a slight increase in ParB level on P. aeruginosa transcriptome. ParB excess, which does not cause changes in growth rate and chromosome segregation, significantly alters the expression of 176 loci. Most notably, the mRNA level of genes adjacent to high affinity ParB binding sites parS1-4 close to oriC is reduced. Conversely, in cells lacking either parB or functional parS sequences the orfs adjacent to parS3 and parS4 are upregulated, indicating that direct ParB- parS3/parS4 interactions repress the transcription in this region. In addition, increased ParB level brings about repression or activation of numerous genes including several transcriptional regulators involved in SOS response, virulence and adaptation. Overall, our data support the role of partitioning protein ParB as a transcriptional regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2737773586,"Background Adverse events have been reported post blood donation. Donors might refrain from donating again due to such events which lowers the blood supply in collection centers. Aim This study measured the incidence, predictors and severity of adverse events among donors of a single whole blood unit at one of the largest donation centers in Saudi Arabia. Methods A retrospective cohort was conducted in 2015 to investigate the adverse events immediately post donation. Donor characteristics such as age, blood pressure, hemoglobin level, weight and history of donation were described and tested as potential risk predictors. Eligible blood donors were 18,936/24,634 (76.8%). Results Incidence of adverse events found 1.1% (208 donors), of which 0.65% had mild symptoms (chills; nausea; pallor; dizziness; nervousness; headache), while 0.45% had severe symptoms (hypotension; convulsions; syncope; respiratory distress; emesis). Multiple logistic regression showed that, the incidence of adverse events was significantly higher among young age donors <30 years RR[95%CI] = 1.58[1.18–2.12], p < 0.002, higher hemoglobin levels RR[95%CI] = 1.30[1.15–1.46], lower weight donors <75kg RR[95%CI] = 1.71[1.29–2.27], p <0.001 and first time donors RR[95%CI] = 2.21[1.64–2.97], p < 0.001 compared to older age donors ≥30, lower hemoglobin levels, heavier weight donors ≥ 75, and previous donors, respectively. More severe adverse events were observed among older and heavier donors, previous donors, lower hemoglobin levels and hypertensive donors but with no statistical significance. Conclusion Young blood donors, donors with lower weight and first time donors are at higher risk of contracting adverse events. Higher hemoglobin level is also a potential risk predictor of adverse events post whole blood donation."
https://openalex.org/W2738661222,"Background The transplant community increasingly accepts extended criteria live kidney donors, however, great (geographical) differences are present in policies regarding the acceptance of these donors, and guidelines do not offer clarity. The aim of this survey was to reveal these differences and to get an insight in both centre policies as well as personal beliefs of transplant professionals. Methods An online survey was sent to 1128 ESOT-members. Questions were included about several extended donor criteria; overweight/obesity, older age, vascular multiplicity, minors as donors and comorbidities; hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, kidney stones, malignancies and renal cysts. Comparisons were made between transplant centres of three regions in Europe and between Europe and other countries worldwide. Results 331 questionnaires were completed by professionals from 55 countries. Significant differences exist between regions in Europe in acceptance of donors with several extended criteria. Median refusal rate for potential live donors is 15%. Furthermore, differences are seen regarding pre-operative work-up, both in specialists who perform screening as in preoperative imaging. Conclusions Remarkably, 23.4% of transplant professionals sometimes deviate from their centre policy, resulting in more or less comparable personal beliefs regarding extended criteria. Variety is seen, proving the need for a standardized approach in selection, preferably evidence based."
https://openalex.org/W2737121984,"Mutations in the gap junction protein connexin47 (Cx47) are associated with lymphedema. However, the role of Cx47 in lymphatic pathophysiology is unknown. We demonstrate that Cx47 is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells by whole-mount immunostaining and qPCR. To determine if Cx47 plays a role in lymphatic vessel function we analysed Cx47-/- mice. Cx47-deficiency did not affect lymphatic contractility (contractile amplitude or frequency) or lymphatic morphology (vessel diameter or number of valves). Interstitial fluid drainage or dendritic cell migration through lymphatic vessels was also not affected by Cx47-deficiency. Cx47 is dispensable for long-chain fatty acid absorption from the gut but rather promotes serum lipid handling as prolonged elevated triglyceride levels were observed in Cx47-deficient mice after oral lipid tolerance tests. When crossed with Apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice, LDL-cholesterol was decreased in young Cx47-/-Apoe-/- adults as compared to Apoe-/- mice, which was inverted later in life. Finally, advanced atherosclerotic plaques in thoracic-abdominal aortas of 15 months-old mice tended to be larger in Cx47-/-Apoe-/- mice. These plaques contained fewer macrophages but similar amounts of T lymphocytes, collagen and lipids than plaques of Apoe-/- mice. In conclusion, Cx47 is expressed in lymphatic endothelium and seems modestly implicated in multiple aspects of lymphatic pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2737370177,"Singlet oxygen (1O2) is formed by triplet-triplet energy transfer from triplet chlorophyll to O2 via Type II photosensitization reaction in photosystem II (PSII). Formation of triplet chlorophyll is associated with the change in spin state of the excited electron and recombination of triplet radical pair in the PSII antenna complex and reaction center, respectively. Here, we have provided evidence for the formation of 1O2 by decomposition of protein hydroperoxide in PSII membranes deprived of Mn4O5Ca complex. Protein hydroperoxide is formed by protein oxidation initiated by highly oxidizing chlorophyll cation radical and hydroxyl radical formed by Type I photosensitization reaction. Under highly oxidizing conditions, protein hydroperoxide is oxidized to protein peroxyl radical which either cyclizes to dioxetane or recombines with another protein peroxyl radical to tetroxide. These highly unstable intermediates decompose to triplet carbonyls which transfer energy to O2 forming 1O2. Data presented in this study show for the first time that 1O2 is formed by decomposition of protein hydroperoxide in PSII membranes deprived of Mn4O5Ca complex."
https://openalex.org/W2738890831,"It has long been appreciated that insulin action is closely tied to circadian rhythms. However, the mechanisms that dictate diurnal insulin sensitivity in metabolic tissues are not well understood. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) has been implicated as a driver of insulin resistance in rodents and humans, and it has become an attractive drug target in type II diabetes. RBP4 is synthesized primarily in the liver where it binds retinol and transports it to tissues throughout the body. The retinol-RBP4 complex (holo-RBP) can be recognized by a cell-surface receptor known as stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6), which transports retinol into cells. Coupled to retinol transport, holo-RBP can activate STRA6-driven Janus kinase (JAK) signaling and downstream induction of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) target genes. STRA6 signaling in white adipose tissue has been shown to inhibit insulin receptor responses. Here, we examined diurnal rhythmicity of the RBP4/STRA6 signaling axis and investigated whether STRA6 is necessary for diurnal variations in insulin sensitivity. We show that adipose tissue STRA6 undergoes circadian patterning driven in part by the nuclear transcription factor REV-ERBα. Furthermore, STRA6 is necessary for diurnal rhythmicity of insulin action and JAK/STAT signaling in adipose tissue. These findings establish that holo-RBP and its receptor STRA6 are potent regulators of diurnal insulin responses and suggest that the holo-RBP/STRA6 signaling axis may represent a novel therapeutic target in type II diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2738673870,"Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, experience disproportionate rates of stomach cancer, compared to non-Māori. The overall aim of the study was to better understand the reasons for the considerable excess of stomach cancer in Māori and to identify priorities for prevention. Māori stomach cancer cases from the New Zealand Cancer Registry between 1 February 2009 and 31 October 2013 and Māori controls, randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral roll were matched by 5-year age bands to cases. Logistic regression was used to estimate odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between exposures and stomach cancer risk. Post-stratification weighting of controls was used to account for differential non-response by deprivation category. The study comprised 165 cases and 480 controls. Nearly half (47.9%) of cases were of the diffuse subtype. There were differences in the distribution of risk factors between cases and controls. Of interest were the strong relationships seen with increased stomach risk and having >2 people sharing a bedroom in childhood (OR 3.30, 95%CI 1.95–5.59), testing for H pylori (OR 12.17, 95%CI 6.15–24.08), being an ex-smoker (OR 2.26, 95%CI 1.44–3.54) and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in adulthood (OR 3.29, 95%CI 1.94–5.59). Some results were attenuated following post-stratification weighting. This is the first national study of stomach cancer in any indigenous population and the first Māori-only population-based study of stomach cancer undertaken in New Zealand. We emphasize caution in interpreting the findings given the possibility of selection bias. Population-level strategies to reduce the incidence of stomach cancer in Māori include expanding measures to screen and treat those infected with H pylori and a continued policy focus on reducing tobacco consumption and uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2738400182,"The loss of dopamine (DA) in Parkinson’s is accompanied by the emergence of exaggerated theta and beta frequency neuronal oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) and basal ganglia. DA replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation reduces the power of these oscillations and this is coincident with an improvement in motor performance implying a causal relationship. Here we provide in vitro evidence for the differential modulation of theta and gamma activity in M1 by DA acting at receptors exhibiting conventional and non-conventional DA pharmacology. Recording local field potentials in deep layer V of rat M1, co-application of carbachol (CCh, 5 μM) and kainic acid (KA, 150 nM) elicited simultaneous oscillations at a frequency of 6.49 ± 0.18 Hz (theta, n = 84) and 34.97 ± 0.39 Hz (gamma, n = 84). Bath application of DA resulted in a decrease in gamma power with no change in theta power. However, application of either the D1-like receptor agonist SKF38393 or the D2-like agonist quinpirole increased the power of both theta and gamma suggesting that the DA-mediated inhibition of oscillatory power is by action at other sites other than classical DA receptors. Application of amphetamine, which promotes endogenous amine neurotransmitter release, or the adrenergic α1-selective agonist phenylephrine mimicked the action of DA and reduced gamma power, a result unaffected by prior co-application of D1 and D2 receptor antagonists SCH23390 and sulpiride. Finally, application of the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin blocked the action of DA on gamma power suggestive of interaction between α1 and DA receptors. These results show that DA mediates complex actions acting at dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptors, α1 adrenergic receptors and possibly DA/α1 heteromultimeric receptors to differentially modulate theta and gamma activity in M1."
https://openalex.org/W2738779891,"The emergency department (ED) is mentioned specifically in the Swiss HIV testing recommendations as a site at which patients can benefit from expanded HIV testing to optimise early HIV diagnosis. At our centre, where local HIV seroprevalence is 0.2-0.4%, 1% of all patients presenting to the ED are tested for HIV. Barriers to HIV testing, from the patient and doctor perspective, and patient acceptability of rapid HIV testing were examined in this study.Between October 2014 and May 2015, 100 discrete patient-doctor encounter pairs undertook a survey in the ED of Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland. Patients completed a questionnaire on HIV risk factors and were offered free rapid HIV testing (INSTI™). For every patient included, the treating doctor was asked if HIV testing had 1) been indicated according to the national testing recommendations, 2) mentioned, and 3) offered during the consultation.Of 100 patients, 30 had indications for HIV testing through risk factors or a suggestive presenting complaint (PC). Fifty patients accepted rapid testing; no test was reactive. Of 50 patients declining testing, 82% considered themselves not at risk or had recently tested negative and 16% wished to focus on their PC. ED doctors identified 20 patients with testing indications, mentioned testing to nine and offered testing to six. The main reason for doctors not mentioning or not offering testing was the wish to focus on the PC.Patients and doctors at our ED share the testing barrier of wishing to focus on the PC. Rapid HIV testing offered in parallel to the patient-doctor consultation increased the testing rate from 6% (offered by doctors) to 50%. Introducing this service would enable testing of patients not offered tests by their doctors and reduce missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2739086955,"β-carotene 15,15’-oxygenase (BCO1) catalyzes the first step in the conversion of dietary provitamin A carotenoids to vitamin A. This enzyme is expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues, suggesting that its activity may regulate local retinoid synthesis. Vitamin A and related compounds (retinoids) are critical regulators of lung epithelial development, integrity, and injury repair. A balance between the actions of retinoids and glucocorticoids (GCs) promotes normal lung development and, in particular, alveolarization. Alterations in this balance, including vitamin A deficiency and GC excess, contribute to the development of chronic lung disorders. Consequently, we investigated if GCs counteract retinoid effects in alveolar epithelial cells by mechanisms involving BCO1-dependent local vitamin A metabolism. We demonstrate that BCO1 is expressed in human fetal lung tissue and human alveolar epithelial-like A549 cells. Our results indicate A549 cells metabolize β-carotene to retinal and retinoic acid (RA). GCs exposure using dexamethasone (DEX) decreases BCO1 mRNA and protein levels in A549 cells and reduces BCO1 promoter activity via inhibiting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) DNA binding. DEX also induces expression of PPARα, which in turn most likely causes a decrease in PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer binding to the bco1 gene promoter and consequent inhibition of bco1 gene expression. PPARα knockdown with siRNA abolishes DEX-induced suppression of BCO1 expression, confirming the requirement for PPARα in this DEX-mediated BCO1 mechanism. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that GCs regulate vitamin A (retinoid) signaling via inhibition of bco1 gene expression in a PPARα-dependent manner. These results explicate novel aspects of local GC:retinoid interactions that may contribute to alveolar tissue remodeling in chronic lung diseases that affect children and, possibly, adults."
https://openalex.org/W2737764772,"Background The sensitivity of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) in the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection could be affected by conditions of immune dysregulation. For this reason, diabetes mellitus (DM) may increase the frequency of indeterminate results of IGRAs. However, there have been inconsistent reports of role of DM on indeterminate IGRA results. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube testing (QFT-GIT) at Chonnam National University Hospital. We collected the clinical and laboratory data of these patients. Results Of all 3,391 subjects, 1,265 (37.3%) had a positive QFT-GIT result, 266 (7.8%) had an indeterminate result, and 1,860 (54.9%) had a negative result. The mean age was 54.8 ± 18.1 years and 55.0% of the patients were male. There were 512 (15.1%) patients with DM. Multivariable analysis revealed that systemic corticosteroid use, tuberculosis, lymphocytopenia, low serum albumin, and high serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly associated with indeterminate QFT-GIT results. However, DM was not associated with indeterminate QFT-GIT results (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–1.41; P = 0.939). After propensity score matching, DM was not associated with indeterminate results of QFT-GIT. Conclusion In this large cohort study, DM does not affect the incidence of indeterminate results of QFT-GIT."
https://openalex.org/W2738638944,"Despite widespread assertions that enthusiasm is an important quality of effective teaching, empirical research on the effect of enthusiasm on learning and memory is mixed and largely inconclusive. To help resolve these inconsistencies, we conducted a carefully-controlled laboratory experiment, investigating whether enthusiastic instructions for a memory task would improve recall accuracy. Scripted videos, either enthusiastic or neutral, were used to manipulate the delivery of task instructions. We also manipulated the sequence of learning items, replicating the spacing effect, a known cognitive technique for memory improvement. Although spaced study reliably improved test performance, we found no reliable effect of enthusiasm on memory performance across two experiments. We did, however, find that enthusiastic instructions caused participants to respond to more item prompts, leaving fewer test questions blank, an outcome typically associated with increased task motivation. We find no support for the popular claim that enthusiastic instruction will improve learning, although it may still improve engagement. This dissociation between motivation and learning is discussed, as well as its implications for education and future research on student learning."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of TE using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Adverse events recorded from April 2004 to November 2014 in the JADER database were obtained from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) website (www.pmda.go.jp). We calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs) of suspected CEPs, analyzed the time-to-onset profile, and assessed the hazard type using Weibull shape parameter (WSP). Furthermore, we used the applied association rule mining technique to discover undetected relationships such as the possible risk factors. The total number of reported cases in the JADER contained was 338,224. The RORs (95% confidential interval, CI) of drospirenone combined with ethinyl estradiol (EE, Dro-EE), norethisterone with EE (Ne-EE), levonorgestrel with EE (Lev-EE), desogestrel with EE (Des-EE), and norgestrel with EE (Nor-EE) were 56.2 (44.3-71.4), 29.1 (23.5-35.9), 42.9 (32.3-57.0), 44.7 (32.7-61.1), and 38.6 (26.3-56.7), respectively. The medians (25%-75%) of the time-to-onset of Dro-EE, Ne-EE, Lev-EE, Des-EE, and Nor-EE were 150.0 (75.3-314.0), 128.0 (27.0-279.0), 204.0 (44.0-660.0), 142.0 (41.3-344.0), and 16.5 (8.8-32.0) days, respectively. The 95% CIs of the WSP-β for Ne-EE, Lev-EE, and Nor-EE were lower and excluded 1. Association rule mining indicated that patients with anemia had a potential risk of developing a TE when using CEPs. Our results suggest that it is important to monitor patients administered CEP for TE. Careful observation is recommended, especially for those using Nor-EE, and this information may be useful for efficient therapeutic planning."

Although the physical inventory of osteosarcoma biospecimens is substantive (>15,000 sample specimens), the nature of these resources remains exhaustible. Despite judicious allocation of these high-value biospecimens for conducting sarcoma-related research, a deeper understanding of osteosarcoma biology, in particular metastases, remains unrealized. In addition the identification and development of novel diagnostics and effective therapeutics remain elusive. The QuadW-COG Childhood Sarcoma Biostatistics and Annotation Office (CSBAO) has developed the High Dimensional Data (HDD) platform to complement the existing physical inventory and to promote in silico hypothesis testing in sarcoma biology. The HDD is a relational biologic database derived from matched osteosarcoma biospecimens in which diverse experimental readouts have been generated and digitally deposited. As proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that the HDD platform can be utilized to address previously unrealized biologic questions though the systematic juxtaposition of diverse datasets derived from shared biospecimens. The continued population of the HDD platform with high-value, high-throughput and mineable datasets allows a shared and reusable resource for researchers, both experimentalists and bioinformatics investigators, to propose and answer questions in silico that advance our understanding of osteosarcoma biology."

Towards developing a vaccine for this disease, we have expressed and purified EV71 virus-like particles (VLPs), which resemble the authentic virus in appearance, capsid structure and protein sequence, from insect cells (Sf9) using a multistep chromatography process. We demonstrated intracellular localization of the VLPs in host cells by in situ immunogold detection, electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Characteristics of these EV71 VLPs were studied using a variety of immunological and physicochemical techniques, which aimed to reveal that the purified EV71 VLPs have good morphology and structure consistent with natural EV71 empty capsids. Results of the amino acid analysis, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and high-performance liquid chromatography confirmed the high purity of the EV71 VLPs. However the sedimentation coefficient of the VLPs showed that they were smaller than that of secreted EV71 VLPs purified by discontinuous cesium chloride density gradients, they were similar to the empty capsids of natural EV71 virions reported previously. Combined with the previous study that EV71 VLPs purified by a multistep chromatography process were able to elicit strong humoral immune responses in mice, our results further supported the conclusion that our EV71 VLPs had well-preserved molecular and structural characteristics. The EV71 VLPs produced from the baculovirus expression system and purified by a multistep chromatography process displayed key structural and immunological features, which would contribute to their efficacy as a HFMD vaccine."

There is limited information related to community-based study to evaluate early indicators related to miscarriage. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between fetal growth restriction, measured by ultrasound crown-rump length (CRL), and subsequent occurrence of miscarriage in pregnant women in rural Bangladesh. The study was conducted within the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions Trial in Matlab (MINIMat study), Bangladesh. A total of 4436 pregnant women were enrolled in the study when they were at less than 14 gestational weeks. The expected CRL was determined based on an established growth curve of gestational age and CRL, and deviation from this curve of CRL was expressed as a z-score. After identifying related covariates, the multiple Poisson regression model was used to determine the independent contribution from the CRL to miscarriage. A total of 3058 singleton pregnant women were included in analyses, with 92 miscarriages and 2966 continued pregnancies. The occurrence of miscarriages was significantly higher in the smaller categories of CRL z-score after adjustments for maternal age, parity, early pregnancy BMI, gestational age at CRL measurement and socioeconomic status (adjusted relative risk [95% confidence interval]: 1.03 [1.02–1.05] for less than -2 z-score). In a rural Bangladesh population, smaller than expected CRL for the gestational age was related to subsequent miscarriage. Ultrasound biometry information together with careful clinical assessment should provide much needed attention and care for pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2738792035,"Introduction In sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 100 million people have CKD, yet genetic risk factors are not well-understood. Despite the potential importance of understanding APOL1 risk allele status among individuals with CKD, little genetic research has been conducted. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of and willingness to participate in genetic research on kidney disease, and we estimated APOL1 risk allele frequencies among individuals with CKD. Methods In 2014, we conducted a community-based field study evaluating CKD epidemiology in northern Tanzania. We assessed for CKD using urine albumin and serum creatinine to estimate GFR. We invited participants with CKD to enroll in an additional genetic study. We obtained dried-blood spots on filter cards, from which we extracted DNA using sterile punch biopsies. We genotyped for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defining the APOL1 G1 risk allele and an insertion/deletion polymorphism defining the G2 risk allele. Genotyping was performed in duplicate. Results We enrolled 481 participant, 57 (12%) of whom had CKD. Among these, enrollment for genotyping was high (n = 48; 84%). We extracted a median of 19.4 ng of DNA from each dried-blood spot sample, and we genotyped the two APOL1 G1 SNPs and the APOL1 G2 polymorphism. Genotyping quality was high, with all duplicated samples showing perfect concordance. The frequency of APOL1 risk variants ranged from 7.0% to 11.0%, which was similar to previously-reported frequencies from the general population of northern Tanzania (p>0.2). Discussion In individuals with CKD from northern Tanzania, we demonstrated feasibility of genotyping APOL1 risk alleles. We successfully genotyped three risk variants from DNA extracted from filter cards, and we demonstrated a high enrollment for participation. In this population, more extensive genetic studies of kidney disease may be well-received and will be feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2738878259,"Long non-coding RNAs are being increasingly recognised as important molecules involved in regulating a diverse array of biological functions. For example, many long non-coding RNAs have been associated with tumourigenesis and in this context their molecular functions often involves impacting on chromatin and transcriptional control processes. One important cellular control system that is often deregulated in cancer cells is the ERK MAP kinase pathway. Here we have investigated whether ERK pathway signaling in response to EGF stimulation, leads to changes in the production of long non-coding RNAs. We identify several different classes of EGF pathway-regulated lncRNAs. We focus on one of the inducible lincRNAs, EGF inducible long intergenic non-coding RNA 1 (EINCR1). EINCR1 is predominantly nuclear and shows delayed activation kinetics compared to other immediate-early EGF-inducible genes. In humans it is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is mainly confined to the heart but it exhibits little evolutionary conservation. Importantly, in several cancers EINCR1 shows elevated expression levels which correlate with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients. In the context of lung adenocarcinomas, EINCR1 expression is anti-correlated with the expression of several protein coding EGF-regulated genes. A potential functional connection is demonstrated as EINCR1 overexpression is shown to reduce the expression of EGF-regulated protein coding genes including FOS and FOSB."

Two independent readers categorized the shape and perfusion state of SCWEs as nodular or non-nodular and as having positive or negative perfusion compared with the contralateral grey matter on arterial spin labeling (ASL). The perfusion fraction on ASL within the contrast-enhancing lesion was calculated. The independent predictability of TTP was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards modelling.The perfusion fraction was higher in the non-progression group, significantly for reader 2 (P = 0.03) and borderline significantly for reader 1 (P = 0.08). A positive perfusion state and (P = 0.02) a higher perfusion fraction of the SCWE were found to become an independent predictor of longer TTP (P = 0.001 for reader 1 and P < 0.001 for reader 2). The contrast enhancement pattern did not become a TTP predictor.Assessment of perfusion in early post-treatment MR imaging can stratify TTP in patients with glioblastoma for adjuvant temozolomide therapy. Positive perfusion in SCWEs can become a predictor of a longer TTP."
https://openalex.org/W2737731248,"Understanding the spatial structure of populations and communities has been a dominant focus of ecological research, and spatial structure is increasingly seen as critical for understanding population dynamics. Habitat (or host) preference is a proximate mechanism that can generate aggregation or overdispersion, lending insight into the ultimate consequences of observed spatial distributions. Publilia concava is a univoltine phloem-feeding insect that forms mutualistic associations with ants, which consume honeydew and protect treehoppers from predation. Treehopper adults and nymphs are aggregated at the scale of goldenrod plant stems, and previous studies have suggested that this aggregation is an adaptive response that increases feeding performance or maximizes benefits of ant-tending. Previous studies have also shown experimentally that individual treehoppers preferentially oviposit on plants with ants present, but a complimentary hypothesis that treehoppers prefer to oviposit near conspecifics (e.g., to take advantage of density-dependent ant attraction) remains untested. We show that, as expected, the probability of treehopper oviposition increases with ant-presence and relative ant abundance. However, we also find that treehopper oviposition decreases with increasing treehopper density. Thus our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that treehopper aggregation is a socially cooperative strategy to attract ants; we suggest that aggregation is a form of conflict and an unavoidable by-product of individual responses to ant-tending levels."

One of these is participation in decisions for the treatment. “Advanced directives” is one of the examples for the participation in decisions for the treatment. Aim We wanted to determine the decisions on advanced life support at the end-stage of life in case of a life-threatening illness for the people themselves and their first degree relatives and the factors effecting these decisions. Design and setting The cross-sectional study was conducted with volunteers among patients and patient relatives who applied to all polyclinics of the Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital except the emergency, oncology and psychiatry polyclinics between 15.12.2012 and 15.03.2013. Method A questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) scale, and Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale (TDA) were applied to all individuals. SPSS for Win. Ver. 17.0 and MS-Excel 2010 Starter software bundles were used for all statistical analysis and calculations. Results The participants want both themselves and their first degree relatives included in end-stage decision-making process. Therefore, the patients and their families should be informed adequately during decision making process and quality communication must be provided. Conclusion Participants who have given their end-stage decisions previously want to be treated according to these decisions. This desire can just be possible by advanced directives.When moral and material loads of end-stage process are taken into consideration, countries, in which advanced directives are practiced, should be examined well and participants’ desire should be evaluated in terms of practicability."
