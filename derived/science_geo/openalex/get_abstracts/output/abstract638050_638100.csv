https://openalex.org/W2969196601,"Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is pervasive in our lives, influencing social interaction including human courtship. To connect with potential partners via CMC, modern relationship-seekers must master faster and shorter methods of communicating self-disclosure and affect. Although CMC can lack crucial sensory information in this context, emojis may provide useful aid. Across two studies, we assessed attitudes toward and frequency of emoji use, and whether signaling affect via emoji use relates to more romantic and sexual opportunities. Our findings suggest that emoji use with potential partners is associated with maintaining connection beyond the first date, and more romantic and sexual interactions over the previous year. This research provides evidence that emojis convey important affective information to potential partners, and are potentially associated with more successful intimate connection. Implications for multiple theoretical models and methodologies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2968003000,"Many children globally do not meet government guidelines for daily fruit and vegetable intake, and in New Zealand, adherence to the vegetable intake recommendation is declining. This study aimed to identify systemic barriers to children meeting fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines and generate sustainable actions within a local community to improve children’s FV intake. A qualitative system dynamics method of community group model building was used. The research team partnered with Healthy Families Waitākere, a Ministry of Health funded prevention initiative, to recruit 17 participants (including students, parents, teachers, community leaders, local retailers and health promoters) from a low-income, ethnically-diverse community in West Auckland, New Zealand. Three group model building workshops were held during which a systems map was created and used to identify actions by considering causal pathways and reinforcing loops in the system. Barriers to children’s FV intake identified by participants were the saturation of fast-food outlets in the community and ubiquitous marketing of these products, the high cost of fresh produce compared to fast food, and parents having little time for food preparation plus declining cooking skills and knowledge. Several actions to improve children’s FV intake by improving the local food environment were identified, which will be co-designed further and tested by a collaborative group involving community leaders. This project highlights the effectiveness of group model building for engaging a local community in systems change to improve child nutrition, and supplies a blueprint for future qualitative system dynamics research."
https://openalex.org/W2968709012,"Bacterial invasion of synovial joints, as in infectious or septic arthritis, can be difficult to treat in both veterinary and human clinical practice. Biofilms, in the form of free-floating clumps or aggregates, are involved with the pathogenesis of infectious arthritis and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Infection of a joint containing an orthopedic implant can additionally complicate these infections due to the presence of adherent biofilms. Because of these biofilm phenotypes, bacteria within these infected joints show increased antimicrobial tolerance even at high antibiotic concentrations. To date, animal models of PJI or infectious arthritis have been limited to small animals such as rodents or rabbits. Small animal models, however, yield limited quantities of synovial fluid making them impractical for in vitro research. Herein, we describe the use of ex vivo equine and porcine models for the study of synovial fluid induced biofilm aggregate formation and antimicrobial tolerance. We observed Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial pathogens adapt the same biofilm aggregate phenotype with significant antimicrobial tolerance in both equine and porcine synovial fluid, analogous to human synovial fluid. We also demonstrate that enzymatic dispersal of synovial fluid aggregates restores the activity of antimicrobials. Future studies investigating the interaction of bacterial cell surface proteins with host synovial fluid proteins can be readily carried out in equine or porcine ex vivo models to identify novel drug targets for treatment of prevention of these difficult to treat infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2967633944,"The role of eosinophilia in atopic diseases, including asthma, is well established, as is the well-known role of IL-5 as a major eosinophilopoeitin and chemoattractant. Following influenza A virus infection of mice, type 2 innate lymphoid cells are recruited to the respiratory tract and produce large quantities of IL-5, which contributes to the recruitment of eosinophils into the infected lungs during the recovery phase of infection. We demonstrate here that while IL-5 is required for optimal recovery from influenza A virus infection in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, the protective effect of IL-5 is independent of eosinophils, suggesting an alternative cellular target. We describe the unexpected finding of IL-5 receptor alpha (CD125) expression on neutrophils infiltrating the inflamed mouse lungs, as well as on neutrophils at other anatomic sites. We extend this finding of neutrophil CD125 expression to humans, specifically to neutrophils found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the inflamed lungs of children with treatment-refractory asthma. We further demonstrate that the IL-5 receptor on neutrophils is capable of signal transduction. Our data provide further evidence that neutrophils can play a role bridging atopic type 2 and innate anti-microbial immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2968035172,"Dengue fever is caused by dengue viruses (DENV) from the Flavivirus genus and is the most prevalent arboviral disease. DENV exists in four immunogenically distinct and genetically-related serotypes (DENV-1 to 4), each subdivided in genotypes. Despite the endemicity of all four DENV serotypes in Thailand, no prior study has characterized the circulation of DENV in the southern provinces of the country. To determine the genetic diversity of DENV circulating in Southern Thailand in 2015 and 2016, we investigated 46 viruses from 182 patients' sera confirmed positive for DENV by serological and Nested RT-PCR tests. Our dataset included 2 DENV-1, 20 DENV-2, 9 DENV-3 and 15 DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on viral envelop sequences. This revealed that part of the identified genotypes from DENV-1 and DENV-4 had been predominant in Asia (genotype I for both serotypes), while genotype II for DENV-4 and the Cosmopolitan genotype DENV-2 were also circulating. Whereas DENV-3 genotype II had been predominantly detected in South East Asia during the previous decades, we found genotype III and genotype I in Southern Thailand. All DENV genotype identified in this study were closely related to contemporary strains circulating in Southeast Asian countries, emphasizing the regional circulation of DENV. These results provide new insights into the co-circulation of all four DENV serotypes in Southern Thailand, confirming the hyperendemicity of DENV in the region. These findings also suggest a new trend of dissemination for some DENV serotypes with a possible shift in genotype distribution; as recently observed in other Asian countries."
https://openalex.org/W2968719696,"The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) effects of bark stripping and climatic factors on radial growth of Picea abies /L./ Karst., (2) production and structural differences between stands established on the forestland and abandoned farmland (afforested farmland-henceforth, farmland), and (3) interaction among the losses caused by ungulate damages, production, diversity, and soil types. Data acquired from four permanent research plots (PRPs) located on the forestland and eight PRPs on the farmland were used. A number of tree- and stand-level models, stand structural indices, tree-rings, and climate characteristics were analysed to evaluate the hypotheses. The results show significantly higher means of DBH, tree height and basal area on the forestland compared to those on the farmland. There was a larger mean standing stem volume on the forestland (466 m3 ha-1) compared to farmland (770 m3 ha-1). Significant difference was observed between the mean DBH and mean stem volume of healthy trees compared to those of the trees with substantial damage (girth damage >1/3 of stem circumference). A greater extent of the girth damage was found on 86% trees on the farmland, while 54% damage on the forestland. About 62% bark-strip damage was further deteriorated by rot infection on the farmland, while on the forestland such an infection was only for 39% trees. The precipitation significantly positively affected the radial growth of trees that were largely affected by ungulate damages on the farmland."
https://openalex.org/W2967407506,"To investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-27a and miR-27b in adipogenesis in an in vitro model of Graves' orbitopathy (GO).Orbital fat tissues were harvested from GO and non-GO participants for primary orbital fibroblast cultures. The expression levels of miR-27a and miR-27b between GO and non-GO orbital fat tissues were compared. During adipogenesis of GO orbital fibroblasts, the expression levels of miR-27a and miR-27b were determined, and the effects of mimics of miR-27a and miR-27b transfection on adipogenesis of GO orbital fibroblast were investigated.Real time-polymerase chain reaction showed significantly more decreases in miR-27a and miR-27b levels in orbital fat tissues in GO participants than in non-GO participants (p < 0.05). The expression of both miR-27a and miR-27b was highest in orbital fibroblasts at day 0 and declined gradually after the induction of adipogenic differentiation. The expression levels of PPARγ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α and C/EBPβ were decreased and Oil Red O-stained lipid droplets were lower in GO orbital fibroblasts transfected with miR-27a and miR-27b mimics than in negative controls.Our results indicated that miR-27a and miR-27b inhibited adipogenesis in orbital fibroblasts from GO patients. Further studies are required to examine the potential of miR-27a and miR-27b as targets for therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2967366889,"In Asian countries, many patients with type 2 diabetes fail to achieve controlled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels while taking several classes of oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs). Traditional Chinese medicine could be an alternative therapeutic option for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula that combines Rhizoma Coptidis and Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study evaluated YH1 as an add-on medication for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.Forty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned 1:1 to the YH1 or placebo group. Before the trial, all subjects had received three or more classes of OHAs with HbA1c > 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a body mass index ≥ 23 kg/m2. During the 12-week trial, participants continued to take OHAs without any dose or medication changes. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in HbA1c level. Per-protocol analysis was applied to the final evaluation.At week 12, there was an 11.1% reduction in HbA1c from baseline and a 68.9% increase in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of β cell function in the YH1 group, which also exhibited significant reductions in two-hour postprandial glucose (-26.2%), triglycerides (-29.5%), total cholesterol (-21.6%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-17.4%), body weight (-0.5%), and waist circumference (-1.1%). The changes in fasting plasma glucose, HOMA insulin resistance and symptom scores were not significantly different between the YH1 and placebo groups. No serious adverse events occurred during this clinical trial.This pilot study indicates that YH1 together with OHAs can improve hypoglycemic action and β-cell function in overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. YH1 is a safe add-on medication for OHAs and has beneficial effects on weight control and lipid metabolism. A larger study population with longer treatment and follow-up periods is required for further verification."
https://openalex.org/W2967960079,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) family cytokine shown to play a protective role in acute inflammatory settings including systemic infection. In this study we addressed the role of IL-11 in acute bacterial pneumonia using a mouse model of E. coli pneumonia. Compared with other related cytokines, IL-11 protein was maintained at high levels in the lung at baseline, with only mild alterations in whole lung and BALF levels during acute infection. The primary source of IL-11 in the lung was the epithelium, but steady state production was not dependent on the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B in cells of either myeloid or epithelial lineage. Blockade of IL-11 with neutralizing antibodies resulted in a mild but significant decrease in neutrophil recruitment and increase in pulmonary edema during pneumonia, without detectable alterations in bacterial clearance. Exogenous IL-11 administration, however, had no effect at baseline or during infection. Overall, we conclude that maintenance of lung IL-11 concentrations may influence acute pulmonary inflammation during infection, albeit modestly."
https://openalex.org/W2968451927,"Early diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is challenged by the absence of accurate early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. CA19-9 is the established, diagnostic tumour marker in PDAC, despite its limitations. Effective primary screening using circulating biomarker panels have only been considered in a handful of studies and we investigated whether combinations of inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors in multivariate logistic models could facilitate earlier diagnosis in our South African setting.Plasma levels of 38 cytokines and angiogenic factors were measured in 131 Black South African patients, 85 with PDAC, 25 with benign biliary pathology (BBP) and 21 benign non-HPB controls (BC), by use of human magnetic multiplex screening assays. Multivariate biomarker panels were developed by identifying the top performing biomolecules from univariate logistic regression. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC) are reported.Classification modelling to distinguish PDAC patients from BC showed that a panel of CA19-9 and CXCL10 (IP-10) demonstrated improved diagnostic power over CA19-9 alone (AUC = 0.977 vs. AUC = 0.807, p-value = 0.001). A combined panel including age, BMI and IL-15 showed significant diagnostic power in discriminating PDAC from BBP (AUC = 0.952, p < 0.0001). Finally, a combined panel of IL-8, IL-15 and gender demonstrated diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.830, p < 0.0001) in distinguishing PDAC in the presence of jaundice from benign controls with either jaundice, choledocholithiasis or common bile duct injury.Combined biomarker panels improve diagnostic accuracy in PDAC. In addition to CA19-9, cytokines CXCL10, IL-8 and IL-15 are strong additions to diagnostic biomarker panels in PDAC in Black South Africans."
https://openalex.org/W2967370839,"The Mauritius fruit bat (Pteropus niger) has been the subject of repeated culling campaigns, apparently in response to pressure from the fruit-growing industry concerned over damage to commercially valuable orchard crops such as lychees. More than 31,000 fruit-bearing lychee trees also exist in private backyards, making this an issue pertinent to a wide cross-section of the Mauritian general public and not just those involved in commercial fruit production. The level of damage caused by bats to fruit crops is often debated and the low number of robust damage assessment studies hampers mitigation efforts. During the fruiting season of 2016/2017, we assessed the damage among backyard lychee trees attributable to fruit bats and other causes around Vacoas-Phoenix, Central Mauritius and evaluated the impact of using protective netting as a mitigation strategy. Fruit yield from panicles that were protected from depredation by nylon netting was approximately one third greater than that from unprotected panicles. We suspect that fruit bats were responsible for approximately 42% of the total damage but illustrate the difficulties in attributing damage to a single cause in such assessments. Although we demonstrate the value of protective netting, we recognize that barriers to implementation exist and that a more holistic approach that incorporates crop protection, forest restoration strategies and addresses negative public attitudes towards bats in general is required to ensure the persistence of this endemic species."
https://openalex.org/W2967705718,"Increased prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been observed among high-risk populations such as healthcare workers (HCWs). The results may depend on the method of LTBI assessment, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and/or tuberculin skin test (TST). Here, we investigated the prevalence and risk factors for LTBI assessed by both IGRAs and TST in HCWs living in Morocco, a country with intermediate tuberculosis (TB) endemicity and high BCG vaccination coverage. HCWs were recruited in two Moroccan hospitals, Rabat and Meknes. All the participants underwent testing for LTBI by both IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, QFT-GIT) and TST. Different combinations of IGRA and TST results defined the LTBI status. Risk factors associated with LTBI were investigated using a mixed-effect logistic regression model. The prevalence of LTBI among 631 HCWs (age range 18–60 years) varied from 40.7% (95%CI 36.9–44.5%) with QFT-GIT to 52% (95%CI 48.2–56.0%) with TST using a 10 mm cut-off. The highest agreement between QFT-GIT and TST (κ = 0.50; 95%CI 0.43–0.56) was observed with the 10 mm cut-off for a positive TST. For a definition of LTBI status using a double positive result for both QFT-GIT and TST, significant associations were found with the following risk factors: being male (OR = 2.21; 95%CI 1.40–3.49; p = 0.0007), belonging to age groups 35–44 years (OR = 2.43; 95%CI 1.45–4.06; p = 0.0007) and even more 45–60 years (OR = 4.81; 95%CI 2.72–8.52; p = 7.10−8), having a family history of TB (OR = 6.62; 95%CI 2.59–16.94; p = 8.10−5), and working at a pulmonology unit (OR = 3.64; 95%CI 1.44–9.23; p = 0.006). Smoking was associated with LTBI status when defined by a positive QFT-GIT result (OR = 1.89; 95%CI 1.12–3.21; p = 0.02). A high prevalence of LTBI was observed among HCWs in two Moroccan hospitals. Male gender, increased age, family history of TB, and working at a pulmonology unit were consistent risk factors associated with LTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2968960132,"Researchers in sport often try to investigate relations between athletes' psychological skills and their sports results to predict top athletic achievements or unexpectedly poor performances. The Psychology Skills Inventory for Sports (Youth version), PSIS-Y, was developed to measure psychological characteristics of young athletes-differentiating well more talented and less talented young athletes. Nevertheless, previous studies revealed its inadequate, factorial validity. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop and investigate the psychometric proprieties of a brief version of the PSIS-Y (PSIS-Y-SF) in a sample of young Croatian athletes. Participants (n = 304; 188 females and 116 male) were recruited in clubs/teams all over Croatia and all of them competed in the Croatian Championship in youth (n = 157) and junior category (n = 147). The PSIS-Y-SF was derived by ten expert psychologists with five of them who had past experiences of agonistic sport practice. Psychometric analysis included Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), internal consistency analysis (Raykov's Maximal Reliability), and correlation between subscales. Moreover, Multivariate Analyses of Variance (MANOVA) was run to test statistical differences between the players' categories (male youth vs. male junior vs. female youth vs. female junior) in all of the subscales. Results of the CFA suggested the adequateness of the supposed six first-order factor solution for the PSIS-Y-SF. The Maximal Reliability statistics suggest a good internal consistency for all of the subscales and the MANOVA suggested differences between the player's categories. The PSIS-Y-SF resulted to be a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of sports psychological skills. Findings from the psychometric evaluation of PSIS-Y-SF suggest that this is a useful tool, which may further assist in the measurement and conceptualization of sport psychological skills."
https://openalex.org/W2968507067,"Objective Ischaemia/reperfusion-injury degrades endothelial glycocalyx. Graft glycocalyx degradation was studied in human liver transplantation. Methods To assess changes within the graft, blood was drawn from portal and hepatic veins in addition to systemic samples in 10 patients. Plasma syndecan-1, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results During reperfusion, syndecan-1 levels were higher in graft caval effluent [3118 (934–6141) ng/ml, P = 0.005] than in portal venous blood [101 (75–121) ng/ml], indicating syndecan-1 release from the graft. Concomitantly, heparan sulfate levels were lower in graft caval effluent [96 (32–129) ng/ml, P = 0.037] than in portal venous blood [112 (98–128) ng/ml], indicating heparan sulfate uptake within the graft. Chondroitin sulfate levels were equal in portal and hepatic venous blood. After reperfusion arterial syndecan-1 levels increased 17-fold (P < 0.001) and heparan sulfate decreased to a third (P < 0.001) towards the end of surgery. Conclusion Syndecan-1 washout from the liver indicates extensive glycocalyx degradation within the graft during reperfusion. Surprisingly, heparan sulfate was taken up by the graft during reperfusion. Corroborating previous experimental reports, this suggests that endogenous heparan sulfate might be utilized within the graft in the repair of damaged glycocalyx."
https://openalex.org/W2967130122,"Background The Johns Hopkins ACG System is widely used to predict patient healthcare service use and costs. Most applications have focused on adult populations. In this study, we evaluated the use of the ACG software to predict pediatric unplanned hospital admission in a given month, based on the past year’s clinical information captured by electronic health records (EHRs). Methods and findings EHR data from a multi-state pediatric integrated delivery system were obtained for 920,051 patients with at least one physician visit during January 2009 to December 2016. Over this interval an average of 0.36% of patients each month had an unplanned hospitalization. In a 70% training sample, we used the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to generate regression coefficients for demographic, clinical predictors derived from the ACG system, and prior year hospitalizations. Applying these coefficients to a 30% test sample to generate risk scores, we found that the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.82. Omitting prior hospitalizations decreased the AUC from 0.82 to 0.80, and increased under-estimation of hospitalizations at the greater risk levels. Patients in the top 5% of risk scores accounted for 43% and the top 1% of risk scores accounted for 20% of all unplanned hospitalizations. Conclusions A predictive model based on 12-months of demographic and clinical data using the ACG system has excellent predictive performance for 30-day pediatric unplanned hospitalization. This model may be useful in population health and care management applications targeting patients likely to be hospitalized. External validation at other institutions should be done to confirm our results."
https://openalex.org/W2968364969,"Acylcarnitines are fatty acyl esters of L-carnitine and facilitate the entry of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle, where they are metabolized via ß-oxidation. Alterations of acylcarnitine species can be diagnostic for fatty acid oxidation disorders and organic aciduria and are thus frequently used to screen newborns. Only a subfraction of all known acylcarnitines is thereby monitored and quantified. Therefore, a method for the simultaneous fast and robust detection of all known acylcarnitines was developed using a single concise liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach. Derivatization by 3-nitrophenylhydrazine increased the signal intensity of the acylcarnitines and a linear elution from a reversed phase column was observed that was dependent on the length of the carbon chain. This allowed a precise prediction of the exact elution time for each acylcarnitine class, which depended solely on the chemical nature of the carbon chain. This method can be further used to screen for yet unknown acylcarnitine species and adds a layer of confidence for their correct identification. Altogether 123 acylcarnitines species were used to establish a targeted low-resolution LC-MS method. The method was applied to acylcarnitine profiling in several mouse tissues and fluids, in order to identify large differences in the quantity and composition of acylcarnitines."
https://openalex.org/W2967635727,"Understanding preferences for veterinary vaccines in low and middle-income countries is important for increasing vaccination coverage against infectious diseases, especially when the consumer is responsible for choosing between similar vaccines. Over-the-counter sales of vaccines without a prescription gives decision-making power to consumers who may value vaccine traits differently from national or international experts and vaccine producers and distributers. We examine consumer preferences for La Sota and I-2 Newcastle disease vaccines in Tanzania to understand why two vaccines co-exist in the market when I-2 is considered technically superior because of its thermotolerance. Household survey and focus group results indicate consumers perceive both vaccines to be effective, use the two vaccines interchangeably when the preferred vaccine is unavailable, and base preferences more on administration style than thermotolerance. Considering the consumers’ perspectives provides a way to increase vaccination coverage by targeting users with a vaccine that fits their preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2968697374,"IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Because of its involvement in the control of cell division and proliferation, IMPDH represents a therapeutic for managing several diseases, including microbial infections and cancer. IMPDH must be tightly regulated, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for its physiological regulation remain unknown. To this end, we recently reported an important role of adenine and guanine mononucleotides that bind to the regulatory Bateman domain to allosterically modulate the catalytic activity of eukaryotic IMPDHs. Here, we have used enzyme kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) methodologies to demonstrate that adenine/guanine dinucleoside polyphosphates bind to the Bateman domain of IMPDH from the fungus Ashbya gossypii with submicromolar affinities. We found that these dinucleoside polyphosphates modulate the catalytic activity of IMPDHs in vitro by efficiently competing with the adenine/guanine mononucleotides for the allosteric sites. These results suggest that dinucleoside polyphosphates play important physiological roles in the allosteric regulation of IMPDHs by adding an additional mechanism for fine-tuning the activities of these enzymes. We propose that these findings may have important implications for the design of therapeutic strategies to inhibit IMPDHs.

https://openalex.org/W2967236220,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a recently identified, web-like, extracellular structure composed of decondensed nuclear DNA and associated antimicrobial granules. NETs are extruded into the extracellular environment via the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent cell death pathway participating in inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Transketolase (TKT) is a thiamine pyrophosphate (vitamin B1)-dependent enzyme that links the pentose phosphate pathway with the glycolytic pathway by feeding excess sugar phosphates into the main carbohydrate metabolic pathways to generate biosynthetic reducing capacity in the form of NADPH as a substrate for ROS generation. In this work, TKT was selected as a lead candidate from 24 NET-associated proteins obtained by literature screening and knowledge gap assessment. Consequently, we determined whether TKT influenced NET formation in vitro. We firstly established that the release of ROS-dependent NETs was significantly decreased after purified human PMNs were pretreated with oxythiamine, a TKT inhibitor, and in a concentration dependent manner. As a cofactor for TKT reaction, we evaluated the release of NET formation either in vitamin B1 treatment or in combined use of oxythiamine and vitamin B1, and found that those treatments also exerted a significant suppressive effect on the amount of NET-DNA and ROS production. The regulation of TKT by oxythiamine and/or vitamin B1 may therefore be associated with response to the modulation of NET formation by preventing generation of excessive NETs in inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2967344933,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) remains a major global health problem. Early treatment of TB is critical; in the absence of rapid- susceptibility testing, the empiric selection of drugs should be guided by clinical data. This study aimed to determine the clinical predictors of DR-TB. From September 2010 to August 2017, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected from 144 patients with tuberculosis at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico. Isolates were subjected to drug-susceptibility testing. Clinical predictors of DR-TB were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. Any drug, isoniazid, and rifampin resistance rates were 47.7, 23.0, and 11.6%, respectively. The visualization of cavities and nodules through either chest radiography or computed tomography were independent predictors of DR-TB. In conclusion, early detection of DR-TB in this population could be based on multiple cavities being observed using chest imaging. This study's results can be applied to future patients with TB in our community to optimize the DR-TB diagnostic process."
https://openalex.org/W2967808117,"Rationale and objectives To assess the performance of shear wave elastography (SWE) and an extended model in predicting malignant cervical lymph nodes (LNs). Materials and methods 109 patients who underwent ultrasound (US) and SWE before needle biopsy were enrolled. The optimal cutoff value of elasticity indices (EIs) was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The c-statistic, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to compare extended model and traditional one. Results Malignant LNs had higher EIs than benign nodes (p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was 42 kilopascal, corresponding to 83.3% sensitivity, 64.7% specificity, and 68.8% overall accuracy. A multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed that EI was an independent predictor for malignancy. The new extended prediction model had a positive NRI (0.96) and IDI (0.10) for predicting malignant neck LNs. Nevertheless, the c-statistic was not significantly different between the two models. Conclusion The parameter of SWE theoretically improve the model performance. However, its real clinical impact is minor, as the parameters of US-based model is already very robust. SWE can be considered as an adjunctive quantitative tool beyond conventional US examination."
https://openalex.org/W2968119645,"Design This study surveyed patients with stored frozen embryos and developed and tested an intervention through a randomized trial to support subjects to consider embryo disposition options (EDOs), especially donation for family building. Methods Based on a review of literature on EDOs, the authors developed and mailed a 2-page anonymous survey to 1,053 patients in Massachusetts (USA) to elicit their feelings about their stored embryos. Target patients had embryos cryopreserved for ≥1 year and had not indicated an EDO. Survey respondents were next randomized between usual care (control arm) or an offer of complimentary counseling and educational support regarding EDOs. These counseling sessions were conducted by a licensed mental health professional specializing in infertility treatment. Results Despite telephone reminders, only 21.3% of patients responded, likely reflecting most patients’ reluctance to address EDOs. Respondents endorsed an average of 2 of the 5 EDOs, with the following percentages supporting each option: store for future attempts (82%), continue storage (79%), donate to research (29%), discard (14%), and donate for family building (13%). When asked their opinions towards embryo donation to another couple, 78% of patients agreed that donation is a way to help another couple, 48% would consider embryo donation to another family if they had a better understanding of the process, and 38% would be willing to consider donation if they were not going to use the embryos themselves, but 73% expressed discomfort with donation. In the randomized trial, 7.8% of intervention subjects (n = 8) obtained counseling sessions compared to 0.0% (none) of usual care subjects (p = 0.0069). Counseling participants valued not only discussing EDOs, but also assistance in expressing their feelings and differences with their partners. Conclusion Improvement in counseling rates over the control arm suggests that free professional counseling is a small, but likely effective, step towards deciding on an EDO.

https://openalex.org/W2968324666,"Background Tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLA) is the most common extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis (TB), often claimed to be reactivation. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of TBLA in Denmark, as it has not previously been investigated specifically although extrapulmonary TB has been associated with an increased long-term mortality and delays in the diagnosis. Methods Register-based study of all patients notified with TBLA in Denmark from 2007 through 2016 utilizing six different nationwide registers. Patients were identified through the national TB surveillance register, and the diagnosis evaluated based on microbiology, pathology and/or clinical assessment. Results In total, 13.5% (n = 489) of all TB patients in Denmark had TBLA with annual proportions from 9.4 to 15.7%. Most patients were immigrants between 25–44 years. Incidence rates ranged from as high as 1,014/100,000 for Nepalese citizens to as a low as 0.06/100,000 for Danes. Danes had a significant higher median age and significant more risk factors and comorbidities, as well as an increased overall mortality, compared with immigrants (p<0.05). A significant and much higher proportion of unique MIRU-VNTR genotypes were seen among TBLA patients compared to other TB manifestations. Conclusion In Denmark, TBLA is a common manifestation of TB, especially in young immigrants from high-incidence countries. In Danes, it is a rare disease manifestation and associated with higher morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that TBLA is predominantly associated with reactivation of latent TB infection based on genotyping although this remains to be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W2968849748,"Background The local infectious origin and the putative role of Cutibacterium acnes (CA) of a particular subtype of discopathy (Modic 1) are still debated. Purpose To establish the association of CA in intervertebral disc (IVD) and Modic 1 discopathy in patients with low back pain. Methods The prevalence of bacteria in IVD samples obtained by anterior approach in patient with chronic low back pain harboring Modic type 1, 2 or no Modic changes was compared to that measured in IVD samples obtained by posterior approach for sciatica. From 45 patients included in the study, 77 discs samples were obtained: 58 by anterior approach (32 Modic 1/2 changes, 26 without Modic change) and 19 by posterior approach. Conventional microbial cultures, universal 16S rRNA molecular detection and a CA specific PCR were performed. Results 12 /77 (15.6%) disc samples were culture positive. Among the 10 CA positive cultures, 5 out of 58 (8.6%) were identified from specimens obtained by anterior approach and 5/19 (26.3%) from posterior approach (p = 0.046). Moreover, the percentage of CA culture positive sample was statistically no different between the patient with or without Modic changes. The CA prevalence was lower through molecular, culture—free approaches: the universal 16S rRNA PCR was positive for 6 specimens, including one CA positive sample and the CA specific PCR was positive for one specimen obtained by posterior approach. Conclusions In spine surgery the prevalence of CA in culture was significantly higher in IVD samples collected through a posterior approach compared to an anterior approach, suggesting a contamination process. This study did not support the CA related local infectious origin of Modic 1 discopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2967408266,"Increasingly studies show that immigrants have different perinatal health outcomes compared to native-born women. Nevertheless, we lack a detailed examination of the combined effects of maternal immigrant trajectory and socioeconomic status on perinatal outcomes. Our objective was to analyze the influence of time since naturalization on low birth weight and maternal socioeconomic status in Belgium.The data came from the linkage between the Brussels birth and death registers, the national register of migrant trajectories and the social security register for the years 2004-2010. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios of the associations between low birth weight (LBW) and time since naturalization, by nationality groups, taking into account socioeconomic status (SES), parity and maternal age.Data relate to all singleton births to Belgian, Maghrebi, Sub-Saharan African and Turkish women (n = 76 312). The results show an U-shaped of LBW according to time since naturalization for all migrant groups. LBW declines for women naturalized since less than one year and increases significantly thereafter (p<0.0001). In parallel, we observe an increase of SES among all migrant groups. Compared to Belgians, we found a lower risk of LBW among women from Maghreb (p<0.0001) and this protection is maintained even after 10 years since naturalization. In contrast, the risk of LBW for Sub-Saharan African and Turkish mothers is lower than for Belgians after one year of naturalization but similar to that of Belgians after 10 years of naturalization.Our results show that, despite an improvement of their SES, LBW increases among Maghrebi, Sub-Saharan African and Turkish women with time since naturalization. Mothers from Maghreb have lower rates of LBW compared to Belgians and maintain their protection even after more than 10 years of having acquired the Belgian nationality. Additional studies need to be carried out in order to gain a better understanding of the association between migration trajectories, SES and perinatal health of immigrants."
https://openalex.org/W2967559045,"Maritime pilots work in an irregular deployment system (rotation system) with unpredictable work assignments under high levels of physical and mental stress. Fatigue or chronic diseases, e.g. coronary heart disease, peptic ulcers or gastritis can occur as a consequence. This can lead to long-term limitations of pilots' work ability. The aim of this study is to analyse current stress and strain in maritime pilots.Initially, all German pilots were interviewed with an online questionnaire about their living and working situation (response rate 43%). Subsequently, a medical and psychological examination of a random sample was carried out with pilots working in a 4-month rotation system compared with those working in a 1-week system. Most of the measurements took place at the beginning and the end of continuous work assignments each lasting several weeks (pre vs post-rotation). The questionnaires RESTQ-work 27, Resilience Scale RS-13 and Berlin Questionnaire were used as well as a sleeping diary. Furthermore, cardiovascular parameters (during rest and under ergometric stress), activity and blood parameters, urine stress hormones, and the pupillary unrest index were surveyed.60 pilots were recorded with an average age of 48.7 years (SD 8.3 years). Among the parameters collected, there were no significant differences between pre and post-rotation examinations. Pilots with a 4-month rotation system experienced a much higher subjective strain level in RESTQ work-27 (OR 10.12 (95% CI 1.21-84.59)). According to the sleep diaries of the pilots working in a 4-month rotation system, reduced levels were found concerning the pre and post-rotation subjective performance level (p = 0.042 and 0.029), subjective sleep duration (p = 0.032) and current subjective feeling post-rotation (p = 0.036). Objectively measured arterial hypertension was significantly more frequent among pilots working 4 months at a time (OR 21.41 (95% CI 1.26-364.05)). In addition, elevated levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid were more common among this group of pilots (p = 0.038, p = 0.033 and p = 0.038). In particular, the risk of hypertriglyceridemia was increased (OR 4.41 (95% CI 1.15-16.91)).Maritime pilotage represents a very straining profession that has been studied very little up to this point. The present results indicate that 4-month rotation systems lead to higher levels of subjective and objective strain than 1-week rotation systems. Interventions are therefore recommended; especially a change in the rotation system should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2967777221,"In this paper, we propose a new approach for learning node embeddings for weighted undirected networks. We perform a random walk on the network to extract the latent structural information and perform node embedding learning under a similarity-based framework. Unlike previous works, we apply a different criterion to capture the proximity information between nodes in a network, and use it for improved modeling of similarities between nodes. We show that the mean commute time (MCT) between two nodes, defined as the average time a random walker takes to reach a target node and return to the source, plays a crucial role in quantifying the actual degree of proximity between two nodes of the network. We then introduce a novel definition of a similarity matrix that is based on the pair-wise mean commute time captured, which enables us to adequately represent the connection of similar nodes. We utilize pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph for calculating such a proximity measure, capturing rich structural information out of the graph for learning more adequate node representations of a network. The results of different experiments on three real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing related efforts in classification, clustering, visualization as well as link prediction tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2969182244,"Background and objective Previous reports indicated that patients on thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD) had higher mortality rates after the 3-day interdialytic interval. However, day-of-the-week patterns of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations remain under-investigated. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HD patients on thrice-weekly dialysis, using 2013 data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS). We estimated crude incidence rates of ED visits and hospitalizations by day of the week and dialysis schedule (Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday). Using Poisson regression, we estimated case-mix adjusted rate ratios of all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations, and adjusted rates of cause-specific ED visits and hospitalizations. Results We identified 241,093 eligible HD patients in 2013, who had 514,773 ED visits and 301,674 hospitalizations that year. Three distinct but related patterns of outcome events were observed. Crude and adjusted incidence rates of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-related ED visits and hospitalizations, but not vascular-access-related events, were higher on all three HD treatment days (“dialysis-day effect”). Rates for ED visits and hospitalizations were lower on weekends than weekdays, rising appreciably from Sunday to Monday for both dialysis schedules (“post-weekend effect”); and rates were highest after the long 3-day interval between dialysis sessions for both dialysis schedules (“interdialytic-gap effect”). In contrast, rates of hospitalizations not preceded by an ED visit were nearly the same Monday through Friday and lower on weekends for both dialysis schedules. Conclusions Higher rates of ED visits and hospitalizations on the days of HD sessions and early in the week are a public-health concern that should stimulate research to explain these patterns and reduce the excessive morbidity and associated costs among patients on thrice-weekly HD, while improving quality of care and patient experience with dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2967259570,"This paper proposes a method to quantitatively identify the changes of technological paradigm over time. Specifically, the method identifies previous paradigms and predicts future paradigms by analyzing a patent citation-based knowledge network. The technological paradigm can be considered as dominantly important knowledge in a specific period. Therefore, we adopted the knowledge persistence which can quantify technological impact of an invention to recent technologies in a knowledge network. High knowledge persistence patents are dominant or paradigmatic inventions in a specific period and so changes of top knowledge persistence patents over time can show paradigm shifts. Moreover, since knowledge persistence of paradigmatic inventions are increasing dramatically faster than other ordinary inventions, recent patents having similar increasing trends in knowledge persistence with previous paradigms are identified as future paradigm inventions. We conducted an empirical case study using patents related to the genome sequencing technology. The results show that the identified previous paradigms are widely recognized as critical inventions in the domain by other studies and the identified future paradigms are also qualitatively significant inventions as promising technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2967406806,"The Acinetobacter baumannii BlsA photoreceptor has an N-terminal (NT) BLUF domain and a C-terminal (CT) amino acid sequence with no significant homology to characterized bacterial proteins. In this study, we tested the biological role of specific residues located in these BlsA regions. Site-directed mutagenesis, surface motility assays at 24°C and protein overexpression showed that residues Y7, Q51 and W92 are essential for not only light-regulated motility, but also BlsA’s solubility when overexpressed in a heterologous host. In contrast, residues A29 and F32, the latter representing a difference when compared with other BLUF-containing photoreceptors, do not play a major role in BlsA’s biological functions. Analysis of the CT region showed that the deletion of the last five BlsA residues has no significant effect on the protein’s light-sensing and motility regulatory functions, but the deletion of the last 14 residues as well as K144E and K145E substitutions significantly alter light-regulated motility responses. In contrast to the NT mutants, these CT derivatives were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity to demonstrate that although these mutations do not significantly affect flavin binding and photocycling, they do affect BlsA’s photodynamic properties. Notably, these mutations map within a potential fifth α-helical component that could play a role in predicted interactions between regulatory partners and BlsA, which could function as a monomer according to gel filtration data. All these observations indicate that although BlsA shares common structural and functional properties with unrelated photoreceptors, it also exhibits unique features that make it a distinct BLUF photoreceptor."
https://openalex.org/W2968473917,"The international-normalized-ratio (INR) is typically used to monitor patients on warfarin or related oral anticoagulant therapy. The aim of our study was to investigate the association of the INR with mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients not on oral anticoagulant therapy.Between 1997 to 2000 the LUdwigshafen RIsk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study enrolled 3316 patients of German ancestry that had been referred for coronary angiography. We excluded patients on coumarin therapy (n = 222) and patients with an INR more than 5 standard deviations (SD) away from the mean (n = 30). During a median follow-up of 9.9 years, 884 patients died, 547 patients from cardiovascular causes. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors the INR was associated with all-cause mortality in all patients and the CAD positive group with HRs (95% CI) of 1.14(1.07-1.21) and 1.16(1.09-1.23) per 1-SD increase, respectively. Adjustment for NT-proBNP rendered the association insignificant.In LURIC, the INR was positively associated with mortality in patients with prevalent CAD not on oral anticoagulant therapy as well as in patients without CAD. Adjustment for NT-proBNP abolished the association suggesting clinical or subclinical heart failure strongly contributing to increased INR and higher mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2968699412,"To investigate the use of imaging methods for predicting carcinogenesis in lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH).We retrospectively analyzed preoperative images on transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 23 cases with histologically diagnosed LEGH.Shape of cervical multicystic lesions on MR images could be divided into two types the flower-type with many small cysts surrounded by larger cysts, and the raspberry-type with many tiny, closely aggregated cysts. Six (46%) of 13 cases had raspberry-type lesions that were not detected on transvaginal sonography but were seen on MRI. Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) was identified in 4 postmenopausal women with raspberry-type lesions during the follow-up periods. In these cases, cytologic examination by targeted endocervical sampling using sonography enabled early detection of AIS.MRI and cytologic examination by targeted endocervical sampling may be very useful for predicting carcinogenesis in LEGH."
https://openalex.org/W2969149256,"The energy expenditure and substrate utilisation were measured in 5 men pre- and post- a 67 day, 1750km unassisted Antarctic traverse from the Hercules Inlet to the Ross Sea Ice via the South pole pulling sledges weighing 120kg whilst experiencing temperatures as low as -57°C. A 36-hours protocol in a whole body calorimeter was employed to measure periods of rest, sleep and three periods of standardised stepping exercises at 80, 100 and 120 steps min-1; participants were fed isocalorically. Unlike previous expeditions where large weight loss was reported, only a modest loss of body weight (7%, P = 0.03) was found; fat tissue was reduced by 53% (P = 0.03) together with a small, but not statistically significant, increase in lean tissue weight (P = 0.18). This loss occurred despite a high-energy intake (6500 kcal/day) designed to match energy expenditure. An energy balance analysis suggested the loss in body weight could be due to the energy requirements of thermoregulation. Differences in energy expenditure [4.9 (0.1) vs 4.5 (0.1) kcal/min. P = 0.03], carbohydrate utilisation [450 (180) vs 569 (195) g/day; P = 0.03] and lipid utilisation [450 (61) vs 388 (127) g/day, P = 0.03] at low levels of exertion were different from pre-expedition values. Only carbohydrate utilisation remained statistically significant when normalised to body weight. The differences in energy expenditure and substrate utilisation between the pre- and post-expedition for other physiological states (sleeping, resting, higher levels of exercise, etc) were small and not statistically significant. Whilst inter-subject variability was large, there was a tendency for increased carbohydrate utilisation, post-expedition, when fasted that decreased upon feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2967194972,"Providing a broiler chicken embryo with a lighting schedule during incubation may stimulate leg bone development. Bone development may be stimulated through melatonin, a hormone released in darkness that stimulates bone development, or increased activity in embryos exposed to a light-dark rhythm. Aim was to investigate lighting conditions during incubation and leg bone development in broiler embryos, and to reveal the involved mechanisms. Embryos were incubated under continuous cool white 500 lux LED light (24L), continuous darkness (24D), or 16h of light, followed by 8h of darkness (16L:8D) from the start of incubation until hatching. Embryonic bone development largely takes place through cartilage formation (of which collagen is an important component) and ossification. Expression of genes involved in cartilage formation (col1α2, col2α1, and col10α1) and ossification (spp1, sparc, bglap, and alpl) in the tibia on embryonic day (ED)13, ED17, and at hatching were measured through qPCR. Femur and tibia dimensions were determined at hatch. Plasma growth hormone and corticosterone and pineal melatonin concentrations were determined every 4h between ED18.75 and ED19.5. Embryonic heart rate was measured twice daily from ED12 till ED19 as a reflection of activity. No difference between lighting treatments on gene expression was found. 24D resulted in higher femur length and higher femur and tibia weight, width, and depth at hatch than 16L:8D. 24D furthermore resulted in higher femur length and width and tibia depth than 24L. Embryonic heart rate was higher for 24D and 16L:8D in both its light and dark period than for 24L, suggesting that 24L embryos may have been less active. Melatonin and growth hormone showed different release patterns between treatments, but the biological significance was hard to interpret. To conclude, 24D resulted in larger leg bones at hatch than light during incubation, but the underlying pathways were not clear from present data."
https://openalex.org/W2967220047,"Effective speech communication is critical to everyday quality of life and social well-being. In addition to the well-studied deficits in cognitive and motor function, depression also impacts communication. Here, we examined speech perception in individuals who were clinically diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) relative to neurotypical controls. Forty-two normal-hearing (NH) individuals with MDD and 41 NH neurotypical controls performed sentence recognition tasks across three conditions with maskers varying in the extent of linguistic content (high, low, and none): 1-talker masker (1T), reversed 1-talker masker (1T_tr), and speech-shaped noise (SSN). Individuals with MDD, relative to neurotypical controls, demonstrated lower recognition accuracy in the 1T condition but not in the 1T_tr or SSN condition. To examine the nature of the listening condition-specific speech perception deficit, we analyzed speech recognition errors. Errors as a result of interference from masker sentences were higher for individuals with MDD (vs. neurotypical controls) in the 1T condition. This depression-related listening condition-specific pattern in recognition errors was not observed for other error types. We posit that this depression-related listening condition-specific deficit in speech perception may be related to heightened distractibility due to linguistic interference from background talkers."
https://openalex.org/W2967527527,"There is a need to investigate and better understand the inherited risk of cancer to ensure that clinical applications provide more accurate assessments and management strategies. Developing research-based next-generation sequencing gene panels that not only target (present-day) clinically actionable susceptibility genes but also genes that currently lack sufficient evidence for risk as well as candidate genes, such as those in DNA repair pathways, can help aid this effort. Therefore, gene panel B.O.P. (Breast, Ovarian, and Prostate) was developed to evaluate the genetic risk of breast, ovarian and/or prostate cancer, and this manuscript serves as an introduction to B.O.P. and highlights its initial analytical validity assessment. B.O.P targets 87 genes that have been suggested, predicted, or clinically proven to be associated with breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer risk using Agilent Technologies Haloplex probes. The probes were designed for 100 base pair reads on an Illumina platform and target both coding and non-coding exons as well as 10 intronic base pairs flanking the intron-exon boundaries. The initial B.O.P screening involved 43 individuals from the Alabama Hereditary Cancer Cohort, and an average sequencing depth of 809X was obtained. Upon variant filtering and validation, true positives had an average sequencing depth of 659X and allele balance of 0.51. The average false positive sequencing depth was 34X and allele balance was 0.33. Although low sequencing depth was not always indicative of a false positive, high sequencing depths (>100X) signified a true positive. Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity of BRCA1/2 were calculated to be 100% and 92.3%, respectively. Overall, this screening enabled the establishment of criteria to alleviate future validation efforts and strongly supports the use of B.O.P. to further elucidate hereditary cancer susceptibility. Ultimately, continued B.O.P. screening will provide insights toward the genetic risk of and overlap between breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2967762265,"Chlamydial-induced cystitis in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is currently treated by antibiotics. However, while reducing the chlamydial load, this treatment can also lead to gastrointestinal complications and death. Development of alternative treatments, such as a therapeutic chlamydial vaccine, are hindered by the lack of detailed understanding of the innate immune response to chlamydial clearance and disease regression during antibiotic treatment. Through clinical, microbiological and transcriptomic approaches, disease regression, bacterial clearance and innate immune responses were mapped in koalas with signs of chlamydial-induced cystitis while receiving anti-chlamydial antibiotics. Significant reduction in the signs of cystitis were observed during and post antibiotic treatment. This was observed as a thinning of the bladder wall and complete reversal of urinary incontinence. Transcriptomic analysis before treatment, at the end of treatment and prior to release identified significant down-regulation of specific genes involved in 21 biological pathways. Of these, the chemokine receptor signalling and NOD-like receptor signalling pathways where identified as important markers of inflammation. Specific genes within these pathways (NCF1 and NOX2) were significantly down-regulated, suggesting a decrease in reactive oxygen species production. Through the monitoring of specific clinical and transcriptomic markers, these findings allow detailed profiling of the clinical response to therapeutic vaccination in koalas with current signs of disease. This also adds to our understanding of innate immune responses to chlamydial infections and indicates that chlamydial-induced cystitis in the koala is linked to the regulation of reactive oxygen pathways."

Several strategies are available to combat this epidemic, like outreach to Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender, Harm Reduction Community Meetings (HRCMs) for Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), and Information, Education and Communication (IEC) programs at Maternal & Child Health Posts (MCHPs). Reliable cost data are currently not present, hampering HIV/AIDS priority setting. The aim of this study thus is to assess the societal costs of outreach programs to MSM and transgender, HRCMs for IDUs and IEC at MCHPs in Bandung, Indonesia in 2016.The societal costs were collected in Bandung from April until May 2017. Health care costs were collected by interviewing stakeholders, using a micro-costing approach. Non-health care costs were determined by conducting surveys within the target groups of the interventions.The societal costs of the outreach program were US$ 347,199.03 in 2016 and US$ 73.72 per reached individual. Moreover, the cost of HRCM for IDUs were US$ 48,618.31 in 2016 and US$ 365.55 per community meeting. For the IEC program at MCHPs, US$ 337.13 was paid in 2016 and the cost per visitor were US$ 0.51.This study provides valuable insights in the costs of outreach to MSM and transgender, HRCMs for IDUs and IEC at MCHPs.

https://openalex.org/W2968429886,"Invasive lionfishes Pterois volitans and Pterois miles have spread throughout the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Greater Caribbean. Beyond these two invaders, additional species within the subfamily Pteroinae are regularly imported into the United States. We evaluated the trade of lionfishes as a surrogate measure for propagule pressure, an important component of invasion success. Proactive evaluation of marine ornamental fishes in trade is vital, particularly for those sharing characteristics with known invaders. We utilized one year of import records from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Law Enforcement Management Information System database and two domestic databases to capture the trade of all lionfishes in the US, the invasive complex in its invaded range in Florida, and two Hawaiian endemic lionfishes. Retail surveys were completed to assess lionfish availability across 10 coastal states. Compared to species diversity within the subfamily, the number of traded species was low and just two species were traded at moderate to high volume, including P. volitans and Dendrochirus zebra. At the retail level, fewer species are available to consumers. The trade in lionfishes is consolidated because most lionfishes originate from two Indo-Pacific countries and arrive through the port of Los Angeles. The volume and diversity of traded lionfishes presents some risk of introduction for lionfishes which are not established, and secondary introductions of the invasive P. volitans. In combination with rapid risk screening, this research can be applied to a proactive risk management framework to identify risky species prior to introduction and establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2967988509,"The nature of services for psychiatric disorders in public health systems has been understudied, particularly with regard to frequency, duration, and costs. The current study examines patterns of service reception and costs among Medicaid-covered youth newly diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or behavioral disturbance in a large data set of provider billing claims submitted between 2015–2016. Eligibility criteria included: 1) identification of an initial diagnosis of a single anxiety, unipolar mood, or specific behavioral disorder; 2) continuous Medicaid eligibility over the duration of the time period studied; and 3) under 18 years of age on the date of initial psychiatric diagnosis. The final cohort included 7,627 cases with a mean age of 10.65 (±4.36), of which 58.04% were male, 57.09% were Black, 38.97% were White, and 3.95% were of other ethnicities. Data indicated that 65.94% of the cohort received at least some follow-up services within a median 18 days of diagnosis. Of those, 54.27% received a combination of medical and psychosocial services, 32.01% received medical services only, and 13.72% received psychosocial services only. Overall median costs for direct treatment were $576.69, with wide discrepancies between the lowest (anxiety = $308.41) and highest (behavioral disturbance = $653.59) diagnostic categories. Across all categories the frequency and duration of psychosocial services were much lower than would be expected in comparison to data from a well-known effectiveness trial. Overall, follow-up to psychiatric diagnosis could be characterized as highly variable, underutilized, and emphasizing biomedical treatment. Understanding more about these patterns may facilitate systematic improvements and greater cost efficiency in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2968689200,"Structural diversity in α-helical membrane proteins (MP) arises from variations in helix-helix crossings and contacts that may bias amino acid usage. Here, we reveal systematic changes in transmembrane amino acid frequencies (f) as a function of the number of helices (n). For eukarya, breaks in f(n) trends of packing (Ala, Gly and Pro), polar, and hydrophobic residues identify different MP assembly principles for 2≤n≤7, 8≤n≤12 and n≥13. In bacteria, the first f break already occurs after n = 6 in correlation to an earlier n peak in MP size distribution and dominance of packing over polar interactions. In contrast to the later n brackets, the integration levels of helix bundles continuously increased in the first, most populous brackets indicating the formation of single structural units (domains). The larger first bracket of eukarya relates to a balance of polar and packing interactions that enlarges helix-helix combinatorial possibilities (MP diversity). Between the evolutionary old, packing and new, polar residues f anti-correlations extend over all biological taxa, broadly ordering them according to evolutionary history and allowing f estimates for the earliest forms of life. Next to evolutionary history, the amino acid composition of MP is determined by size (n), proteome diversity, and effective amino acid cost."
https://openalex.org/W2966966269,"Vector tile technology is developing rapidly and has received increasing attention in recent years. Compared to the raster tile, the vector tile has shown incomparable advantages, such as flexible map styles, suitability for high-resolution screens and ease of interaction. Recent studies on vector tiles have mostly focused on improving the efficiency on the server side and have overlooked the efficiency on the client side, which affects user experience. Parallel computing provides solutions to this issue. Parallel visualization of vector tiles is a typical example of embarrassing parallelism; thus, estimating the computing times of each tile accurately and decomposing the workload into multiple computing units evenly are key to the parallel visualization of vector tiles. This article adopts mainstream parallel computing and proposes an efficient tile-based parallel method for accelerating geographical feature visualization by building computational weight functions (CWFs) of geographical feature visualizations. The computing time of each vector tile is estimated by the CWF, and an effective workload decomposition strategy is proposed such that the efficiency of vector tile visualization is improved on the client side. Furthermore, a tile-based reconstruction scheme for geographical features is also proposed. Experiments show that the R-squared value of the estimated computing times of vector tiles is 0.914 and that the computational efficiency of the parallel visualization of vector tiles with the proposed workload decomposition strategy is 18.6% higher than that of common parallel visualization. Finally, users can obtain the entire set of features effectively and accurately based on the proposed reconstruction scheme."

We collected clinical data from 38 patients treated for APL under the International Consortium on Acute Leukemia (ICAL) protocol and laboratory data during induction therapy. We propose a mathematical model that represents the dynamics of leukocytes in peripheral blood and the effect of ICAL treatment on the disease's dynamics. We observe that our cohort presents demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes similar to previous clinical trials on APL. Over a follow-up period of 41.8 months, the relapse-free survival and overall survival at two years are both found to be 78.7%. For two selected patients, the model produces a good fit to the clinical data. Information such as the response to treatment and risk of relapse can be derived from the model, and this may assist in clinical practice and the design of clinical trials."

This is achieved in clinical settings, but in the general population weight loss appears associated with increased mortality, possibly related to the struggles with body weight control (BWC). We investigated whether attitudes to and experiences with BWC in combination with recent changes in body weight influenced long-term mortality among normal weight and overweight individuals. Population and methods The study population included 6,740 individuals attending the 3rd cycle in 1991–94 of the Copenhagen City Heart Study, providing information on BMI, educational level, health behaviours, well-being, weight half-a-year earlier, and answers to four BWC questions about caring for body weight, assumed benefit of weight loss, current and past slimming experiences. Participants reporting previous unintended weight loss (> 4 kg during one year) were excluded. Cox regression models estimated the associations of prior changes in BMI and responses to the BWC questions with approximately 22 years all-cause mortality with age as ‘time scale’. Participants with normal weight (BMI < 25.0 kg/m2) and overweight (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2) were analysed separately, and stratified by gender and educational level, health behaviours and well-being as co-variables. Results Compared with stable weight, weight loss was associated with significantly increased mortality in the normal weight group, but not in the overweight group, and weight gain was not significantly associated with mortality in either group. Participants with normal weight who claimed that it would be good for their health to lose weight or that they were currently trying to lose weight had significantly higher mortality than those denying it. There were no other significant associations with the responses to the BWC questions in either the normal weight or the overweight group. When combining the responses to the BWC questions with the weight changes, using the weight change as either a continuous or categorical variable, there were no significant interaction in their relation to mortality in either the normal weight or the overweight group. Conclusion Attitudes to and experiences with BWC did not notably modify the association of changes in body weight with mortality in either people with normal weight or people with overweight."
https://openalex.org/W2969184330,"A carbon-based layer was deposited by spraying on top of a ferroelectric layer grown by sol-gel on Si (001) substrate and its properties as electrode and absorber for pyroelectric detection were tested. It was found that the electric properties of the ferroelectric capacitor with top carbon-based sprayed electrode (CBSE) are comparable with those of the capacitors with standard top SrRuO3 (SRO)/Au electrode. Pyroelectric measurements show that the pyroelectric signal recorded on ferroelectric capacitors with top CBSE electrode is 2.5 times greater than for top SRO/Au electrode for low frequency range. The value of the pyroelectric coefficient was estimated to 9.73·10-4 C/m2K for CBSE electrodes and 3.36·10-4 C/m2K for SRO/Au respectively. The fabrication process of CBSE is of low cost, easy to implement and with high throughput making it attractive for manufacturing various devices like pyroelectric detector, thermal imaging, solar cells, etc."
https://openalex.org/W2968811797,"Base excision repair (BER) defects and concomitant oxidative DNA damage accumulation play a role in the etiology and progression of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, it is not known whether genetic variant(s) of specific BER genes contribute to reduced BER activity in LOAD patients and whether they are associated with risk, development and/or progression of LOAD. Therefore, we performed targeted next generation sequencing for three BER genes, uracil glycosylase (UNG), endonuclease VIII-like DNA glycosylase 1 (NEIL1) and polymerase β (POLβ) including promoter, exonic and intronic regions in peripheral blood samples and postmortem brain tissues (temporal cortex, TC and cerebellum, CE) from LOAD patients, high-pathology control and cognitively normal age-matched controls. In addition, the known LOAD risk factor, APOE was included in this study to test whether any BER gene variants associate with APOE variants, particularly APOE ε4. We show that UNG carry five significant variants (rs1610925, rs2268406, rs80001089, rs1018782 and rs1018783) in blood samples of Turkish LOAD patients compared to age-matched controls and one of them (UNG rs80001089) is also significant in TC from Brazilian LOAD patients (p<0.05). The significant variants present only in CE and TC from LOAD are UNG rs2569987 and POLβ rs1012381950, respectively. There is also significant epistatic relationship (p = 0.0410) between UNG rs80001089 and NEIL1 rs7182283 in TC from LOAD subjects. Our results suggest that significant BER gene variants may be associated with the risk of LOAD in non-APOE ε4 carriers. On the other hand, there are no significant UNG, NEIL1 and POLβ variants that could affect their protein level and function, suggesting that there may be other factors such as post-transcriptional or-translational modifications responsible for the reduced activities and protein levels of these genes in LOAD pathogenesis. Further studies with increased sample size are needed to confirm the relationship between BER variants and LOAD risk."
https://openalex.org/W2969026567,"Purpose Pharmacokinetic models facilitate assessment of properties of the micro-vascularization based on DCE-MRI data. However, accurate pharmacokinetic modeling in the liver is challenging since it has two vascular inputs and it is subject to large deformation and displacement due to respiration. Methods We propose an improved pharmacokinetic model for the liver that (1) analytically models the arrival-time of the contrast agent for both inputs separately; (2) implicitly compensates for signal fluctuations that can be modeled by varying applied flip-angle e.g. due to B1-inhomogeneity. Orton’s AIF model is used to analytically represent the vascular input functions. The inputs are independently embedded into the Sourbron model. B1-inhomogeneity-driven variations of flip-angles are accounted for to justify the voxel’s displacement with respect to a pre-contrast image. Results The new model was shown to yield lower root mean square error (RMSE) after fitting the model to all but a minority of voxels compared to Sourbron’s approach. Furthermore, it outperformed this existing model in the majority of voxels according to three model-selection criteria. Conclusion Our work primarily targeted to improve pharmacokinetic modeling for DCE-MRI of the liver. However, other types of pharmacokinetic models may also benefit from our approaches, since the techniques are generally applicable."
