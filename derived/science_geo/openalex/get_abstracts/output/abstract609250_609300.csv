https://openalex.org/W2802442632,"The organization of human brain networks can be measured by capturing correlated brain activity with fMRI. There is considerable interest in understanding how brain networks vary across individuals or neuropsychiatric populations or are altered during the performance of specific behaviors. However, the plausibility and validity of such measurements is dependent on the extent to which functional networks are stable over time or are state dependent. We analyzed data from nine high-quality, highly sampled individuals to parse the magnitude and anatomical distribution of network variability across subjects, sessions, and tasks. Critically, we find that functional networks are dominated by common organizational principles and stable individual features, with substantially more modest contributions from task-state and day-to-day variability. Sources of variation were differentially distributed across the brain and differentially linked to intrinsic and task-evoked sources. We conclude that functional networks are suited to measuring stable individual characteristics, suggesting utility in personalized medicine."

To minimize such perturbations, cells should be imaged in their native multicellular environments, under as gentle illumination as possible. However, achieving the spatiotemporal resolution needed to follow three-dimensional subcellular processes in detail under these conditions is challenging: Sample-induced aberrations degrade resolution and sensitivity, and high resolution usually requires intense excitation. Liu et al. combined noninvasive lattice light-sheet microscopy with aberration-correcting adaptive optics to study a variety of delicate subcellular events in vivo, including organelle remodeling during mitosis and growth cone dynamics during spinal cord development.

In all three populations, ancestry from the ""minor"" parental species is more common in regions of high recombination and where there is linkage to fewer putative targets of selection. The same patterns are apparent in a reanalysis of human and archaic admixture. These results support models in which ancestry from the minor parental species is more likely to persist when rapidly uncoupled from alleles that are deleterious in hybrids. Our analyses further indicate that selection on swordtail hybrids stems predominantly from deleterious combinations of epistatically interacting alleles."

While plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in metals imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-metal heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the lengthscale of one atom. This is achieved by far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric h-BN spacer between graphene and metal rods. A theoretical model which takes into account the non-local optical response of both graphene and metal is used to describe the results. These ultra-confined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enables a route to new regimes of ultra-strong light-matter interactions."

Solar cells made of such materials, however, typically have low efficiency. Yang et al. expanded the class of materials capable of exhibiting the BPV effect by making ordinarily centrosymmetric materials, such as SrTiO 3 and TiO 2 , lose their inversion symmetry. The authors accomplished this by applying a point force on the surface of the material. This induced a strain gradient and the loss of inversion symmetry, resulting in large photovoltaic currents under illumination.

Diamonds have very high hardness, but they do not deform elastically. This limits their usefulness for some applications. However, Banerjee et al. discovered that diamond nanoneedles can deform elastically after all (see the Perspective by LLorca). The key was in their small size (300 nm), which allowed for very smooth-surfaced, defect-free diamonds. The deformation was close to the theoretical limit for diamond, which opens up the potential for applications in microelectronics and drug delivery. Science , this issue p. 300 ; see also p. 264"

Building on the digenic protein-protein interaction network, Kuzmin et al. created a trigenic landscape of yeast by using a synthetic genetic array (see the Perspective by Walhout). Triple-mutant analyses indicated that the majority of genes with trigenic associations functioned within the same biological processes. These converged on networks identified in the digenic interaction landscape. Although the overall effects were weaker for trigenic than for digenic interactions, trigenic interactions were more likely to bridge biological processes in the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2747420241,"We aimed to evaluate a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for lung nodule classification focussing on (i) usefulness of the conventional CADx system (hand-crafted imaging feature + machine learning algorithm), (ii) comparison between support vector machine (SVM) and gradient tree boosting (XGBoost) as machine learning algorithms, and (iii) effectiveness of parameter optimization using Bayesian optimization and random search. Data on 99 lung nodules (62 lung cancers and 37 benign lung nodules) were included from public databases of CT images. A variant of the local binary pattern was used for calculating a feature vector. SVM or XGBoost was trained using the feature vector and its corresponding label. Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) was used as Bayesian optimization for parameters of SVM and XGBoost. Random search was done for comparison with TPE. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used for optimizing and evaluating the performance of our CADx system. Performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic analysis. AUC was calculated 10 times, and its average was obtained. The best averaged AUC of SVM and XGBoost was 0.850 and 0.896, respectively; both were obtained using TPE. XGBoost was generally superior to SVM. Optimal parameters for achieving high AUC were obtained with fewer numbers of trials when using TPE, compared with random search. Bayesian optimization of SVM and XGBoost parameters was more efficient than random search. Based on observer study, AUC values of two board-certified radiologists were 0.898 and 0.822. The results show that diagnostic accuracy of our CADx system was comparable to that of radiologists with respect to classifying lung nodules."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RAE in elite soccer players competing in the Italian championships, even considering the discriminations of younger and older Serie A players (in relation to the median age of the sample), and different positional roles (i.e., goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward) for each observed category. A total of 2051 players competing into the 2017-2018 Italian under-15 (n = 265), under-16 (n = 362), under-17 (n = 403), Primavera (n = 421) and Serie A (n = 600) championships were analysed. The birth-date distributions, grouped in four quartiles (i.e., January-March, Q1; April-June, Q2; July-September, Q3; October-December, Q4), were compared to a uniform distribution using Chi-squared analysis. The week of birth was analysed using Poisson regression. The results showed a large over-representation of players born in Q1 in all soccer player categories. However, the effect size of this trend resulted smaller as age increased. Individuals born in Q1 have about two-folds more chances to become a Serie A player compared to those born in Q4. The Poisson regression analysis showed that RAE was greater for defenders than for forwards among all categories. Therefore, a strongly biased selection emerged among elite soccer players competing in Italian championships, highlighting how young individuals born in the first three months have many more chances to become elite players compared to the others."

We demonstrate here that the Dunce (Dnc) phosphodiesterase, an important enzyme that degrades cAMP, acts as a molecular switch that controls LTM formation in Drosophila. We show that, during LTM formation, Dnc is inhibited in the SPN, a pair of newly characterized serotonergic neurons, which stimulates the cAMP/PKA pathway. As a consequence, the SPN activates downstream dopaminergic neurons, opening the gate for LTM formation in the olfactory memory center, the mushroom body. Strikingly, transient inhibition of Dnc in the SPN by RNAi was sufficient to induce LTM formation with a training protocol that normally generates only short-lived memory. Thus, Dnc activity in the SPN acts as a memory checkpoint to guarantee that only the most relevant learned experiences are consolidated into stable memory.

Thus, Dnc activity in the SPN acts as a memory checkpoint to guarantee that only the most relevant learned experiences are consolidated into stable memory. The brain constantly categorizes our environment and sorts out important information from “noise” or less relevant input (Petersen and Posner, 2012Petersen S.E. Posner M.I. The attention system of the human brain: 20 years after.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar). Accordingly, most stimuli are meaningless for the brain; some are processed and generate a memory that is short lived; and, finally, a small proportion of information stands out and is consolidated into a long-lasting memory that remains available for adaptive behavior. These discriminative mechanisms are largely involved in context-dependent decision making and are crucial for the fitness and survival of any organism. This implies a strong evolutionary reinforcement of mechanisms that link information selection and memory mechanisms in the brain. However, the neuronal correlates that evaluate a presented stimulus and the functional link to memory processes are largely unknown. During associative olfactory learning, an avoidance or attraction behavior to a previous neutral stimulus is generated by temporal pairing with a negative or positive unconditioned stimulus. A hallmark of memory storage across phyla is that spaced training, which signifies the facing of the same experience repeatedly with resting intervals, produces stronger and longer lasting memory than a single training (Cepeda et al., 2006Cepeda N.J. Pashler H. Vul E. Wixted J.T. Rohrer D. Distributed practice in verbal recall tasks: a review and quantitative synthesis.Psychol. Bull. 2006; 132: 354-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, Pinsker et al., 1973Pinsker H.M. Hening W.A. Carew T.J. Kandel E.R. Long-term sensitization of a defensive withdrawal reflex in Aplysia.Science. 1973; 182: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, temporal contiguity between the neutral stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus is not the only important feature in associative learning; the global context of the association is also crucial. Brain mechanisms to filter information might, therefore, influence associative memory processes more directly than previously recognized (Ungless, 2004Ungless M.A. Dopamine: the salient issue.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 702-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The importance of suppressor mechanisms in these processes has been suggested, representing so-called “memory checkpoints” that restrict consolidation to a given context (Abel et al., 1998Abel T. Martin K.C. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Memory suppressor genes: inhibitory constraints on the storage of long-term memory.Science. 1998; 279: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are enzymes that degrade cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger that propagates cellular activation in most neurons by modulating the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) (Berke and Wu, 2002Berke B. Wu C.-F.F. Regional calcium regulation within cultured Drosophila neurons: effects of altered cAMP metabolism by the learning mutations dunce and rutabaga.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4437-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDEs, therefore, represent a potential memory checkpoint. Indeed, PDE inhibitors have been repeatedly shown to improve memory in mammals (Barad et al., 1998Barad M. Bourtchouladze R. Winder D.G. Golan H. Kandel E. Rolipram, a type IV-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, facilitates the establishment of long-lasting long-term potentiation and improves memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) superfamily: a new target for the development of specific therapeutic agents.Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 366-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of how PDEs regulate the formation of memory remains to be discovered. Here, we used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to unravel dynamic features of memory formation and identify general concepts of how the brain sorts information and manifests consolidated long-term memory (LTM). The Drosophila brain features a much lower number of neurons than the brains of mammals while maintaining an important complexity and reproducibility of general memory processes. This has allowed the discovery of several fundamental cellular and molecular processes of memory formation due to the highly developed experimental approaches and powerful genetic tools in Drosophila (Heisenberg, 2003Heisenberg M. Mushroom body memoir: from maps to models.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, Keene and Waddell, 2007Keene A.C. Waddell S. Drosophila olfactory memory: single genes to complex neural circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For instance, using a classical aversive conditioning paradigm, flies can efficiently learn to avoid an odor that was previously paired with electric shocks, although the obtained memory decays quickly when an odor-shock pairing occurs during a single training cycle. Stable protein-synthesis-dependent LTM is exclusively formed when fruit flies are subjected to a specific conditioning pattern, during which the training cycle is experienced repeatedly and spaced by resting intervals (Tully et al., 1994Tully T. Preat T. Boynton S.C. Del Vecchio M. Genetic dissection of consolidated memory in Drosophila.Cell. 1994; 79: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the mushroom body (MB) is the olfactory learning and memory center and plays a crucial role for LTM formation (Pascual and Préat, 2001Pascual A. Préat T. Localization of long-term memory within the Drosophila mushroom body.Science. 2001; 294: 1115-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The MB consists of approximately 2,000 neurons per hemisphere, whose axons first bundle within the peduncle and then form 5 discrete lobular structures that show functional homologies to the striatum and hippocampus in mammals (Pagani et al., 2009Pagani M.R. Oishi K. Gelb B.D. Zhong Y.

Strausfeld N.J. Genealogical correspondence of mushroom bodies across invertebrate phyla.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 38-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms that integrate the spacing effect in the MB downstream of the associative process have been demonstrated (Pagani et al., 2009Pagani M.R. Oishi K. Gelb B.D. Zhong Y. The phosphatase SHP2 regulates the spacing effect for long-term memory induction.Cell. 2009; 139: 186-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but how is the spacing effect integrated upstream of the memory center? Context evaluation largely involves the dopaminergic system in mammals as well as in Drosophila (Morris et al., 2006Morris G. Nevet A. Arkadir D. Vaadia E. Bergman H. Midbrain dopamine neurons encode decisions for future action.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2007Zhang K. Guo J.Z. Peng Y. Xi W. Guo A. Dopamine-mushroom body circuit regulates saliency-based decision-making in Drosophila.Science. 2007; 316: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here, the MB is innervated by a complex but specifically compartmentalized network of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) that modulate MB intrinsic activity during associative learning and can, thus, control specific behavioral output (Aso et al., 2010Aso Y. Siwanowicz I. Bräcker L. Ito K. Kitamoto T. Tanimoto H. Specific dopaminergic neurons for the formation of labile aversive memory.Curr.

Biol. 2014; 24: 822-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, our team assigned the gating of LTM to specific DNs, including MP1, that are situated upstream of the MB peduncle and exert a significant increase in activity, both during and shortly after the repeated cycles of spaced conditioning (Plaçais et al., 2012Plaçais P.-Y. Trannoy S. Isabel G. Aso Y. Siwanowicz I. Belliart-Guérin G. Vernier P. Birman S. Tanimoto H. Preat T. Slow oscillations in two pairs of dopaminergic neurons gate long-term memory formation in Drosophila.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To date, the identity of regulatory input for the dopaminergic system remains largely elusive; consequently, the initial events that integrate the relevance of an association and trigger LTM are unknown. The dunce1 (dnc1) PDE loss-of-function mutant was the first memory mutant described in Drosophila and was instrumental in the discovery of the role of cAMP/PKA signaling in memory formation (Dudai et al., 1976Dudai Y. Jan Y.N. Byers D. Quinn W.G. Benzer S. dunce, a mutant of Drosophila deficient in learning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1976; 73: 1684-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Importantly, it restricts the level of cAMP at the presynapse, a function that is widely accepted to cause deficits in short-lived memory performances once deregulated in a dnc1 mutant (Davis and Dauwalder, 1991Davis R.L. Dauwalder B. The Drosophila dunce locus: learning and memory genes in the fly.Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This discrepancy with mammalian phenotypes of memory amelioration after PDE inhibition has hindered the use of Drosophila for determining the specific facilitative actions of PDEs on memory. Strikingly, we found here that the dnc1 mutation increases PKA activation, which triggers downstream plasticity changes and selectively facilitates LTM. Specifically, we characterized a new pair of serotonergic projection neurons (this pair is collectively abbreviated hereinafter as SPN) that are activated by lack of Dnc in Drosophila. The SPN is located in the gnathal ganglia (GNG) and projects to central brain compartments, where it surrounds the MB peduncle. We show that Dnc is normally inhibited in the SPN specifically upon spaced training. The resulting activation of the SPN triggers oscillatory activity in MP1 dopamine neurons, which controls LTM formation downstream in the MB. Therefore, we report that Dnc represents the default inhibition of neuronal activity by restraining the level of PKA activity, which plays a crucial role as a memory checkpoint in the SPN. By integrating molecular, circuit, and behavioral analyses in a simple invertebrate brain, this work provides a comprehensive mechanism of PDE input in the control of LTM formation. Although dnc1 mutants have impaired learning scores (Dudai et al., 1976Dudai Y. Jan Y.N. Byers D. Quinn W.G. Benzer S. dunce, a mutant of Drosophila deficient in learning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1976; 73: 1684-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A), they remarkably showed increased memory scores after a single training cycle, as compared to normal flies at 24 hr, the time point generally used to assess LTM (Figure 1A). Our first aim was to confirm that the high level of 24-hr memory observed in dnc1 indeed corresponds to LTM. Cycloheximide (cxm) treatment inhibits the de novo protein synthesis underlying LTM (Tully et al., 1994Tully T. Preat T. Boynton S.C. Del Vecchio M. Genetic dissection of consolidated memory in Drosophila.Cell. 1994; 79: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), resulting in its impairment. As expected, cxm treatment precluded the formation of LTM in wild-type flies after 5× spaced training cycles; interestingly, the elevated memory scores in dnc1 were also sensitive to cxm (Figure 1B). This demonstrates that a decrease in Dnc activity allows LTM formation after 1 cycle, whereas LTM is normally formed only after at least 5× spaced cycles. Next, we aimed to localize this facilitation effect using RNAi to inhibit Dnc expression in specific subsets of brain neurons. Since the MB encodes aversive LTM (Pascual and Préat, 2001Pascual A. Préat T. Localization of long-term memory within the Drosophila mushroom body.Science. 2001; 294: 1115-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2006Yu D. Akalal D.B.G. Davis R.L. Drosophila alpha/beta mushroom body neurons form a branch-specific, long-term cellular memory trace after spaced olfactory conditioning.Neuron. 2006; 52: 845-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we chose this structure as our first Dnc knockdown target. The MB neurons can be subdivided based on their axonal morphology into γ, α/β, and α′/β′ subtypes, of which the α/β neurons have repeatedly been shown to specifically support LTM (Pascual and Préat, 2001Pascual A. Préat T. Localization of long-term memory within the Drosophila mushroom body.Science. 2001; 294: 1115-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Bouzaiane et al., 2015Bouzaiane E. Trannoy S.

Two independent mushroom body output circuits retrieve the six discrete components of Drosophila aversive memory.Cell Rep. 2015; 11: 1280-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We addressed the role of MB neurons via MB promoter-driven Gal4 expression of UAS-dncRNAi. Surprisingly, no LTM facilitation could be observed when different subsets of MB neurons were targeted (Figure 1C). We extended our search to the antennal lobe (AL), a second-order olfactory center in the Drosophila brain conveying odor information that was previously suggested to have a role in Dnc-dependent memory formation (Scheunemann et al., 2012Scheunemann L. Jost E. Richlitzki A. Day J.P. Sebastian S. Thum A.S. Efetova M. Davies S.-A. Schwärzel M. Consolidated and labile odor memory are separately encoded within the Drosophila brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17163-17171Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, by targeting AL type 1 local interneurons with the widely used driver GH298-Gal4 (Keller and Vosshall, 2003Keller A. Vosshall L.B. Decoding olfaction in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we were able to recreate the facilitation effect of the dnc1 mutant (Figure 1C). However, Dnc inhibition in the same AL interneurons using a second driver, NP1227-Gal4 (Tanaka et al., 2009Tanaka N.K. Ito K. Stopfer M. Odor-evoked neural oscillations in Drosophila are mediated by widely branching interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8595-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), did not increase 24-hr memory (Figure 1C). To solve this discrepancy, we re-examined the expression pattern of GH298-Gal4 driving UAS-mcd8::GFP. This revealed labeling of a prominent neuron (SPN) with a large cell body in the GNG and wide arborizations, one of which sends its projection to the MB to surround the MB peduncle (Lin et al., 2012Lin S. Kao C.F. Yu H.H. Huang Y. Lee T. Lineage analysis of Drosophila lateral antennal lobe neurons reveals notch-dependent binary temporal fate decisions.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001425Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A; Video S1.1). Based on its proximity to the Drosophila memory center, we suspected that the SPN might be functionally linked to LTM. We identified a second Gal4 line from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC) collection (VT026326) that targets the SPN but none of the AL interneurons (Figure S1A; Video S1.2). We used the SPN Gal4 drivers GH298 and VT026326 and the thermo-inducible Gal80ts expressed under the tubulin promoter, which prevents Gal4 activity at low temperature during development (McGuire et al., 2003McGuire S.E.

Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila.Science. 2003; 302: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), to express UAS-dncRNAi in the SPN of adult flies. Inhibition of Dnc in the SPN facilitated LTM formation after a single-cycle training (Figure 1D). This suggests that the single paired SPN, and not the AL interneurons, was responsible for the LTM facilitation effect observed in GH298>UAS-dncRNAi flies (Figure 1C). The facilitation was also present when a second Dnc-targeting RNAi was expressed in the SPN of adult flies (Figure S1B). Furthermore, the memory performance of non-induced flies was similar to that of the genotypic controls (Figure S1C). Thus, Dnc inhibition is required in the adult SPN for LTM formation. In order to further confirm the neuronal specificity of facilitation in the SPN, we performed a genetic intersection. SPN expression was excluded from the GH298 expression pattern by cloning the promoter of the VT026326 driver in front of the sequence encoding the Gal80+ protein that constitutively inhibits Gal4 expression. No SPN labeling was observed in flies that combined VT026326-Gal80+ and GH298-Gal4 to drive UAS-mcd8::GFP, whereas the remaining GH298-Gal4 expression pattern was unaffected to the best of our assessment (Figure 1E; Video S1.3). In addition, the facilitation effect of the Dnc knockdown was abolished when Gal4 expression was turned off in the SPN using VT026326-Gal80+ (Figure 1F). This intersectional rescue strongly supports the idea that the function of Dnc during LTM formation is executed in the SPN. We next asked whether the level of active Dnc in the SPN could have either a permissive or a restrictive effect on LTM, and therefore, we overexpressed Dnc in the SPN of adult flies. The results indicate that expression of UAS-Dnc+ in the SPN inhibited LTM after a 5× spaced training protocol (Figure 1G). The non-induced control flies performed normally (Figure S1D). Flies with constitutive Dnc overexpression showed the same LTM defect (Figure S1E). However, flies that submitted to a 5× massed training protocol that only yields long-term anesthesia-resistant memory (LT-ARM), which is a consolidated memory phase that is less stable than LTM (Bouzaiane et al., 2015Bouzaiane E.

Preat T. Boynton S.C. Del Vecchio M. Genetic dissection of consolidated memory in Drosophila.Cell. 1994; 79: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), exhibited normal memory scores (Figure S1F). Overexpression of Dnc did not impair naive sensory responses to the training stimuli (Table S1). This indicates that Dnc overexpression in the SPN specifically inhibits LTM, likely via decreased cAMP/PKA signaling in the SPN, whereas decreased Dnc PDE activity facilitates LTM formation. Combined, these results identify Dnc as a major regulator of LTM formation in the SPN. To examine the individual properties of the SPN, we generated a split-Gal4 line that expresses uniquely within the SPN (Figure 2A; Video S2). Using Imaris 3D reconstruction, we individually traced the projections of the two bilateral neurons for a more thorough characterization (Figure 2A; Video S3). We determined SPN projection sites in defined neuropil regions of the Drosophila brain according to the classification by the Insect Brain Name Working Group (Ito et al., 2014Ito K. Shinomiya K. Ito M. Armstrong J.D. Boyan G. Hartenstein V. Harzsch S. Heisenberg M. Homberg U. Jenett A. et al.Insect Brain Name Working GroupA systematic nomenclature for the insect brain.Neuron. 2014; 81: 755-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Briefly, from the cell body located in the lateral part of the GNG (at its border) to the wedge (WED) and the saddle (SAD), we observed a prominent ipsilateral projection surrounding the MB peduncle, where it forms a circle at the superior clamp (SCL). Furthermore, the SPN projects contralaterally into the GNG and the SAD, crossing the brain close to the digestive tube (DT). The SPN also displays strong ipsilateral arborization in the anterior and posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum (VLP) and the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP), from where it contacts the lateral horn (LH). Subsequently, we sought to identify presynaptic terminals of the SPN in order to determine where it might perform its specific function during LTM. Staining of the SPN using the SPNsplit-Gal4>UASmcd8::GFP along with the pre-synaptic marker synaptotagmin (Zhang et al., 2002Zhang Y.Q. Rodesch C.K. Broadie K. Living synaptic vesicle marker: synaptotagmin-GFP.Genesis. 2002; 34: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) revealed presynaptic sites that are located (1) at the superior clamp surrounding the MB peduncle (P in Figure 2B) and the SLP, (2) in the VLP, and (3) throughout the GNG and SAD (Figure 2B). To determine whether SPN neurotransmission is directly implicated in LTM formation, we expressed the widely used thermo-sensitive dynamin allele shibirets (shits), which prevents synaptic transmission (Kitamoto, 2002Kitamoto T. Targeted expression of temperature-sensitive dynamin to study neural mechanisms of complex behavior in Drosophila.J. Neurogenet. 2002; 16: 205-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in the SPN using the split-GAL4 line. We found that flies trained for LTM, but in which SPN transmission was blocked for 3 hr immediately after the last cycle of the 5× spaced training protocol, had a strong 24-hr memory deficit (Figure 2C). Furthermore, the same blocking protocol after 5× massed conditioning did not affect LT-ARM scores (Figure 2D). We found the same memory defect for LTM using the two SPN Gal4 lines GH298 and VT026326 (Figure 2E), whereas LT-ARM performance was normal (Figure 2F). In addition, control LTM experiments conducted at the permissive temperature did not reveal any memory impairment (Figures S2A and S2B). This indicates that blocking the SPN during the consolidation phase impairs LTM but not LT-ARM. An intersectional rescue experiment using VT026326-Gal80+ was able to restore LTM memory capacities by turning off shits expression in the SPN (Figure S2C). These results reveal a role for neurotransmission from the SPN in LTM within the initial period of memory consolidation. The previous finding prompted us to identify the transmitter released by the SPN. We detected a strong overlap of serotonin antibody (anti-5HT) and GFP labeling of the SPN at the level of the SPN cell body (Figure 3A). Consistently, the anti-5HT signal was strongly reduced by knockdown of the 5HT synthesis-limiting enzyme tryptophan-hydroxylase (Trh) in the SPN via TrhRNAi1 (Figure 3A). To address the function of 5HT release by the SPN and its involvement in LTM formation, we expressed the UAS-TrhRNAi1 construct under the control of thermo-inducible versions of the two SPN Gal4 drivers, GH298 and VT026326. Reduced 5HT signaling in the adult SPN strongly impaired LTM after 5× spaced training (Figure 3B) but not LT-ARM after 5x massed training (Figure 3C). The same result was obtained with a second non-overlapping RNAi against Trh (Figures S3A and S3B). Non-induced flies did not display any LTM memory deficit (Figure S3C), and the Trh knockdown did not impair odor acuity or shock response of the flies (Table S1). These results indicate that serotonin expression is required specifically in the SPN for normal LTM. In a previous report, we were able to assign an LTM-gating mechanism to the dopaminergic MP1 neurons, which project onto the MB peduncle. This occurs through a characteristic pattern of slow calcium oscillation in MP1 neurons, which are prominent after 5× spaced conditioning but not after massed conditioning (Plaçais et al., 2012Plaçais P.-Y. Trannoy S. Isabel G. Aso Y. Siwanowicz I. Belliart-Guérin G. Vernier P. Birman S. Tanimoto H. Preat T. Slow oscillations in two pairs of dopaminergic neurons gate long-term memory formation in Drosophila.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The MP1 neuron projects specifically onto MB axons deep in the peduncle that correspond to α/β neurons, as well as onto the heel of γ neurons (Aso et al., 2010Aso Y. Siwanowicz I. Bräcker L. Ito K.

Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 711-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Our results for the SPN prompted us to investigate a possible connection of the SPN and MP1 at the level of the MB peduncle. To address this question, we first conducted a co-labeling experiment of both neurons by taking advantage of the two independent binary targeting systems in Drosophila, Gal4/UAS, and LexA/Aop (Yagi et al., 2010Yagi R. Mayer F. Basler K. Refined LexA transactivators and their use in combination with the Drosophila Gal4 system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16166-16171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to simultaneously express two different genetic reporters. To achieve this, we generated a VT026326-LexA line by cloning the VT026326 promoter in front of the LexA sequence. We used this line to express mCD8::GFP in the SPN, while we expressed UAS-RFP using NP0047-Gal4, a driver that has been used in multiple studies to target MP1 neurons (Tanaka et al., 2008Tanaka N.K. Tanimoto H. Ito K. Neuronal assemblies of the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 711-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This enabled us to observe the close proximity of the circular projection of the SPN and MP1 processes at the level of the MB peduncle (Figure 4A; Video S4). We then repeated this experiment using another combination of drivers—namely, 30E11-LexA (Plaçais et al., 2017Plaçais P.Y. de Tredern É. Scheunemann L. Trannoy S. Goguel V. Han K.A. Isabel G. Preat T. Upregulated energy metabolism in the Drosophila mushroom body is the trigger for long-term memory.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15510Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to express mCD8::GFP in MP1 and VT026326-Gal4 to drive UAS-tdTomato in the SPN. Once again, we observed overlapping labeling of the SPN and MP1 at the level of the MB peduncle (Figure S4A; Video S5). Next, we performed GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) (Feinberg et al., 2008Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

For this, two split-GFP constructs were expressed under the control of VT026326-Gal4 (SPN)>GFPsp11 and 30E11-LexA (MP1)>GFPsp1–10, respectively.

We trained human participants to categorize auditory stimuli from a large novel set of morphed monkey vocalizations. Using fMRI-rapid adaptation (fMRI-RA) and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, we gained evidence that categorization training results in two distinct sets of changes: sharpened tuning to monkey call features (without explicit category representation) in left auditory cortex and category selectivity for different types of calls in lateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, the sharpness of neural selectivity in left auditory cortex, as estimated with both fMRI-RA and MVPA, predicted the steepness of the categorical boundary, whereas categorical judgment correlated with release from adaptation in the left inferior frontal gyrus. These results support the theory that auditory category learning follows a two-stage model analogous to the visual domain, suggesting general principles of perceptual category learning in the human brain."

However, knowledge of the presence and abundance of suites of infectious agents in wild populations has been constrained by our ability to easily screen for them. Using salmon as a model, we contrasted seasonal pathogenic infectious agents in life history variants of juvenile Chinook salmon from the Fraser River system (N = 655), British Columbia (BC), through the application of a novel high-throughput quantitative PCR monitoring platform. This included freshwater hatchery origin fish and samples taken at sea between ocean entry in spring and over-winter residence in coastal waters. These variants currently display opposite trends in productivity, with yearling stocks generally in decline and sub-yearling stocks doing comparatively well. We detected the presence of 32 agents, 21 of which were at >1% prevalence. Variants carried a different infectious agent profile in terms of (1) diversity, (2) origin or transmission environment of infectious agents, and (3) prevalence and abundance of individual agents. Differences in profiles tended to reflect differential timing and residence patterns through freshwater, estuarine and marine habitats. Over all seasons, individual salmon carried an average of 3.7 agents. Diversity changed significantly, increasing upon saltwater entrance, increasing through the fall and decreasing slightly in winter. Diversity varied between life history types with yearling individuals carrying 1.3-times more agents on average. Shifts in prevalence and load over time were examined to identify agents with the greatest potential for impact at the stock level; those displaying concurrent decrease in prevalence and load truncation with time. Of those six that had similar patterns in both variants, five reached higher prevalence in yearling fish while only one reached higher prevalence in sub-yearling fish; this pattern was present for an additional five agents in yearling fish only."

https://openalex.org/W2801719699,"The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is one of the world’s most emblematic freshwater fish. Despite conservation and rehabilitation plans, populations of this species are dramatically declining due to human impacts such as habitat fragmentation, overfishing and water pollution. Owing to their large body size, anadromous adults were historically invulnerable to fish predation during their spawning period migration. This invulnerability has disappeared in Western Europe with the introduction of a new freshwater predator, the European catfish (Silurus glanis). Here we report how adults of Atlantic salmon are predated in the fishway of a large river of SW France, where the delayed and narrow passage created by the structure increases the probability of predator-prey encounter. We assessed predation risk by monitoring salmon and catfish in one fishway of the River Garonne, using video fish-counting from 1993 to 2016. We analysed the predation strategy of catfish using observations made with acoustic camera and RFID telemetry in 2016. Our results demonstrate a high predation rate (35%—14/39 ind.) on salmon inside the fishway during the 2016 spawning period migration. Our results suggest that a few specialized catfish individuals adapted their hunting behaviour to such prey, including their presence synchronized with that of salmon (i.e, more occurrences by the end of the day). Such results suggest that the spread of European catfish will potentially impact migration of anadromous species through anthropized systems."
https://openalex.org/W2799728076,"The structural diversity of terpenoids is limited by the isoprene rule which states that all primary terpene synthase products derive from methyl-branched building blocks with five carbon atoms. With this study we discover a broad spectrum of novel terpenoids with eleven carbon atoms as byproducts of bacterial 2-methylisoborneol or 2-methylenebornane synthases. Both enzymes use 2-methyl-GPP as substrate, which is synthesized from GPP by the action of a methyltransferase. We used E. coli strains that heterologously produce different C11-terpene synthases together with the GPP methyltransferase and the mevalonate pathway enzymes. With this de novo approach, 35 different C11-terpenes could be produced. In addition to eleven known compounds, it was possible to detect 24 novel C11-terpenes which have not yet been described as terpene synthase products. Four of them, 3,4-dimethylcumene, 2-methylborneol and the two diastereomers of 2-methylcitronellol could be identified. Furthermore, we showed that an E. coli strain expressing the GPP-methyltransferase can produce the C16-terpene 6-methylfarnesol which indicates the condensation of 2-methyl-GPP and IPP to 6-methyl-FPP by the E. coli FPP-synthase. Our study demonstrates the broad range of unusual terpenes accessible by expression of GPP-methyltransferases and C11-terpene synthases in E. coli and provides an extended mechanism for C11-terpene synthases."

The study was aimed to investigate whether COPD patients have an imbalance between EMPs to PCs compared to controls and to evaluate the effect of cigarette smoke on these circulating markers. Methods Circulating EMPs and PCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 nonsmokers, 20 smokers and 61 COPD patients with moderate to severe airflow obstruction. We compared total EMPs (CD31+CD42b-), apoptotic if they co-expressed Annexin-V+ or activated if they co-expressed CD62E+, circulating PCs (CD34+CD133+CD45+) and the EMPs/PCs ratio between groups. Results COPD patients presented increased levels of total and apoptotic circulating EMPs, and an increased EMPs/PCs ratio, compared with nonsmokers. Women had less circulating PCs than men through all groups and those with COPD showed lower levels of PCs than both control groups. In smokers, circulating EMPs and PCs did not differ from nonsmokers, being the EMPs/PCs ratio in an intermediate position between COPD and nonsmokers. Conclusions We conclude that COPD patients present an imbalance between endothelial damage and repair capacity that might explain the frequent concurrence of cardiovascular disorders. Factors related to the disease itself and gender, rather than cigarette smoking, may account for this imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W2802837568,"Self-avoidance allows sister dendrites from the same neuron to form non-redundant coverage of the sensory territory and is important for neural circuitry functions. Here, we report an unexpected, cell-autonomous role of the Wnt-secretory factor MIG-14/Wntless in mediating dendrite self-avoidance in the C. elegans multidendritic PVD neurons. Similar findings in Drosophila suggest that this novel function of Wntless is conserved. The mig-14 mutant shows defects in dendrite self-avoidance, and ectopic MIG-14 expression triggers dendrite repulsion. Functions of dendrite self-avoidance and Wnt secretion could be mapped to distinct MIG-14 domains, indicating that these two functions of MIG-14 are genetically separable, consistent with lack of self-avoidance defects in the Wnt mutants. We further demonstrate that MIG-14 engages Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-dependent actin assembly to regulate dendrite self-avoidance. Our work expands the repertoire of self-avoidance molecules and uncovers a previously unknown, Wnt-independent function of MIG-14/Wntless."

Covering the proximal entry tear is essential for successful treatment of Type B aortic dissection. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables real-time aortic diameter assessment, and is especially useful when computed tomography (CT) image quality is poor. IVUS, however, is not routinely utilized due to cost inefficiency. We investigated the impact of IVUS-assisted stent graft sizing on aortic remodeling in TEVAR. In this single-center retrospective study we evaluated patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing both CT and IVUS before TEVAR. We assessed the aortic diameter at the level of the left subclavian artery via both methods before stent implantation and analyzed due to which method the implanted stent graft was chosen, retrospectively. To determine the degrees of aortic remodeling involved, we evaluated true lumen and false lumen diameters, and total aortic remodeling in CT. We analyzed 45 patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing TEVAR. The mean ages were 66.9±10.0 years fo0072 IVUS (n = 20) and 62.3±14.2 years for CT-assisted TEVAR (n = 25; p = 0.226). The follow-up time for both groups did not differ between the two groups (IVUS: 22.9±23.1 months, CT: 25.6±23.0 months; p = 0.700). While both methods were associated with advantages regarding aortic remodeling, IVUS-assisted sizing yielded a greater increase in true lumen (30.4±6.2 vs. 25.6±5.3; p = 0.008) and reductions in false lumen (14.4±8.5 vs. 23.9±9.3; p = 0.001) and total aortic diameter (35.5±6.0 vs. 39.9±8.1; p = 0.045).

https://openalex.org/W2799919764,"Conformations adopted by long stretches of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) are of central interest in understanding the architecture of replication forks, R loops, and other structures generated during DNA metabolism in vivo This is particularly so if the ssDNA consists of short nucleotide repeats. Such studies have been hampered by the lack of defined substrates greater than ∼150 nt and the absence of high-resolution biophysical approaches. Here we describe the generation of very long ssDNA consisting of the mammalian telomeric repeat (5'-TTAGGG-3') n , as well as the interrogation of its structure by EM and single-molecule magnetic tweezers (smMT). This repeat is of particular interest because it contains a run of three contiguous guanine residues capable of forming G quartets as ssDNA. Fluorescent-dye exclusion assays confirmed that this G-strand ssDNA forms ubiquitous G-quadruplex folds. EM revealed thick bead-like filaments that condensed the DNA ∼12-fold. The bead-like structures were 5 and 8 nm in diameter and linked by thin filaments. The G-strand ssDNA displayed initial stability to smMT force extension that ultimately released in steps that were multiples ∼28 nm at forces between 6 and 12 pN, well below the >20 pN required to unravel G-quadruplexes. Most smMT steps were consistent with the disruption of the beads seen by EM. Binding by RAD51 distinctively altered the force extension properties of the G-strand ssDNA, suggesting a stochastic G-quadruplex-dependent condensation model that is discussed."

Attention is generally mediated by retinotopic visual neurons; therefore, specific neurons representing attended features change with each saccade.

Specifically, we looked for predictive changes in attentional modulation state or receptive field position that could stabilize attentional representations across saccades in area V4, known to be necessary for attention-dependent behavior. We recorded from neurons in monkeys performing a novel spatiotopic attention task, in which performance depended on accurate saccade compensation. Measurements of attentional modulation revealed a predictive attentional ""hand-off"" corresponding to a presaccadic transfer of attentional state from neurons inside the attentional focus before the saccade to those that will be inside the focus after the saccade. The predictive nature of the hand-off ensures that attentional brain maps are properly configured immediately after each saccade."

Experimental diets were supplemented with rapeseed oil, pork lard or palm oil at 60 g/kg. In the control diet, wheat starch was substituted for the fat source. The highest ileal digestibility of the fat and all FAs (except stearic acid) was observed in chickens fed lard. The content of fat in the breast meat of chickens was not significantly influenced by the fat supplements. The FA profiles of breast meat and abdominal fat reflected the FA composition of the diet. In the meat of chickens fed rapeseed oil, oleic acid was the predominant FA. Palmitic acid was the most abundant FA in the meat of chickens fed lard or palm oil. Oleic acid was the most abundant FA in the abdominal fat of all chickens. The highest mRNA expression of desaturases (Δ5-, Δ6- and Δ9-) was observed in chickens fed palm oil. The mRNA expression of hepatic FA synthase was higher in chickens fed palm oil or lard than in chickens fed rapeseed oil. The expression of HMG-CoA reductase was higher in chickens fed palm oil than in those fed rapeseed oil or lard. It can be concluded that rapeseed oil and lard are better sources of lipids than palm oil. These former two sources contain more digestible fatty acids and provide a lower concentration of SFAs in the meat and fat of chickens."

We collected a total of 29,975 mosquitoes of 19 species divided in 1680 pools. Of these, 298 (17.7%), representing 12 different mosquito species, were positive for trypanosomatid DNA. In total, seven trypanosomatid spp. were identified (three Trypanosoma, three Crithidia and one Herpetomonas species), with the highest parasite species diversity found in the mosquito host Coquillettidia richiardii. The most frequent parasite species belonged to the mammalian Trypanosoma theileri/cervi species complex (found in 105 pools; 6.3%). The avian species T. culicavium (found in 69 pools; 4.1%) was only detected in mosquitoes of the genus Culex, which corresponds to their preference for avian hosts. Monoxenous trypanosomatids of the genus Crithidia and Herpetomonas were found in 20 (1.3%) mosquito pools. One third (n = 98) of the trypanosomatid positive mosquito pools carried more than one parasite species.

Deficiency of human α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) causes Fabry disease (FD), a heritable, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3). Current management of FD involves enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). An activity-based probe (ABP) covalently labeling the catalytic nucleophile of α-Gal A has been previously designed to study α-galactosidases for use in FD therapy. Here, we report that this ABP labels proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf extracts, enabling the identification and biochemical characterization of an N. benthamiana α-galactosidase we name here A1.1 (gene accession ID GJZM-1660). The transiently overexpressed and purified enzyme was a monomer lacking N-glycans and was active toward 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-galactopyranoside substrate (Km = 0.17 mm) over a broad pH range. A1.1 structural analysis by X-ray crystallography revealed marked similarities with human α-Gal A, even including A1.1's ability to hydrolyze Gb3 and lyso-Gb3, which are not endogenous in plants. Of note, A1.1 uptake into FD fibroblasts reduced the elevated lyso-Gb3 levels in these cells, consistent with A1.1 delivery to lysosomes as revealed by confocal microscopy. The ease of production and the features of A1.1, such as stability over a broad pH range, combined with its capacity to degrade glycosphingolipid substrates, warrant further examination of its value as a potential therapeutic agent for ERT-based FD management."

The goal of this study was to investigate the estimation of parameters controlling maize anthesis date with the CERES-Maize model, based on 5,266 maize lines from 11 plantings at locations across the eastern United States. High performance computing was used to develop a database of 356 million simulated anthesis dates in response to four CERES-Maize model parameters. Although the resulting estimates showed high predictive value (R2 = 0.94), three issues presented serious challenges for use of GSP’s as traits. First (expressivity), the model was unable to express the observed data for 168 to 3,339 lines (depending on the combination of site-years), many of which ended up sharing the same parameter value irrespective of genetics. Second, for 2,254 lines, the model reproduced the data, but multiple parameter sets were equally effective (equifinality). Third, parameter values were highly dependent (p<10−6919) on the sets of environments used to estimate them (instability), calling in to question the assumption that they represent fundamental genetic traits. The issues of expressivity, equifinality and instability must be addressed before the genetic mapping of GSP’s becomes a robust means to help solve the genotype-to-phenotype problem in crops."

Here, we combined modeling-assisted protein modification and information from human disease variants with a minimal-size fusion tag, split-luciferase–based approach to probe assembly of the NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)-p22phox enzyme, an integral membrane complex with unresolved structure, which is required for electron transfer and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Integrated analyses of heterodimerization, trafficking, and catalytic activity identified determinants for the NOX4-p22phox interaction, such as heme incorporation into NOX4 and hot spot residues in transmembrane domains 1 and 4 in p22phox. Moreover, their effect on NOX4 maturation and ROS generation was analyzed. We propose that this reversible and quantitative protein–protein interaction technique with its small split-fragment approach will provide a protein engineering and discovery tool not only for NOX research, but also for other intricate membrane protein complexes, and may thereby facilitate new drug discovery strategies for managing NOX-associated diseases.

Current methods in unperturbed cellular environments rely mostly on antibodies, fluorescent tags, or fragment complementation. Pitfalls are often antibody specificity and sensitivity, tag-induced changes in protein localization and function, or the absence of dynamic quantification. Understanding and interfering with dimer formation of multipass receptors, transporters, or enzyme complexes containing numerous interhelical contacts may be feasible by reversible split-luciferase complementation assays (1Stynen B.

Assembly of multipass integral membrane enzymes or receptors by homo- or heterodimerization is governed by the folding and packing of their transmembrane segments, thereby enabling PPIs within the membrane, which directly participate in stabilization of the complex and signal transduction across lipid bilayers. Reactive oxygen species producing NADPH oxidases form membrane-bound complexes composed of 1–5 minimally required components. The ability to transfer electrons from NADPH across the membrane to molecular oxygen resides in several distinct features of the catalytic NOX domain but requires also in all NADPH oxidases (except for NOX5; NOX1–4 and DUOX1–2) heterodimerization with specific integral membrane proteins (p22phox, DUOXA1–2). Heterodimerization is required for NOX/DUOX stabilization and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and may direct intracellular trafficking (3Luxen S. Noack D. Frausto M. Davanture S. Torbett B.E. Knaus U.G. Heterodimerization controls localization of Duox-DuoxA NADPH oxidases in airway cells.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122 (19339556): 1238-124710.1242/jcs.044123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In vivo mechanistic analysis of heterodimerization is particularly difficult for NADPH oxidases, as the complex structure is unresolved, and enzyme activity is easily impaired by amino acid changes, insertions, or additions. If interference with the ability to heterodimerize or to disrupt the formed complex could be achieved, it might lead to a new class of NOX inhibitors. The NADPH oxidase NOX4, a primarily transcriptionally regulated, constitutively active enzyme that generates H2O2 (4Martyn K.D. Frederick L.M. von Loehneysen K. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Functional analysis of Nox4 reveals unique characteristics compared to other NADPH oxidases.Cell.

Heterodimer formation of NOX4 (6 transmembrane α-helices (TMHs)) with p22phox (4 TMHs) in the endoplasmic reticulum is thought to occur after incorporation of two bis-histidine–coordinated low-potential hemes, followed by dimer trafficking to the plasma membrane or, in some cell types, to intracellular membrane compartments. To date, NOX mutagenesis/chimera studies or rare human loss-of-function variants (CYBA (p22phox), CYBB (NOX2), and NOX1) provide the only information about particular residues or structural elements of the NOX1–4 heterodimers required for NOX activity. NOX4-dependent H2O2 generation is contingent on heterodimerization, NADPH/FAD binding, electron transfer across the membrane via heme to molecular oxygen, and intramolecular conversion of superoxide to H2O2 by an unidentified structure-induced mechanism. Reactive oxygen species generation and NADPH/oxygen consumption are the only quantifiable readouts for the catalytic activity of all NOX/DUOX enzymes, impeding molecular insight into unique contacts at PPI interfaces that could be exploited for selective NOX isoform targeting. Here, we describe dynamic quantification of NOX4-p22phox assembly in a cellular and functional context, leading to discovery of hot spot residues and interaction surfaces required for heterodimerization. Understanding NOX4 heterodimerization is hindered by lack of structural information. We and others have attached tags at the enzyme’s N or C termini.

Indeed, a C-terminal GFP fusion markedly reduced NOX4 expression and H2O2 generation (Fig. 1) independently of linker length or linker composition (not shown). Thus, quantitative and functional PPI analysis of NOX4-p22phox and other NOX isoform complexes will require reducing the size of fusion tags as recently accomplished by the reversible split-luciferase complementation assay NanoBiT® (SB-11aa, LB-157aa) (2Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A. Wood M.G. Eggers C.T. Encell L.P. Wood K.V.

By combining structure–function information and homology modeling of the NOX4-p22phox complex, SB/LB additions or sequence replacements were designed for NOX4 and p22phox, including variation of length and composition of linkers. A total of 31 SB/LB-containing NOX4 or p22phox constructs were co-transfected with their WT dimerization partner for expression and functional analysis (Fig. S1, A–F; not all fusions shown). The most promising pairs were combined (SB/LB) and retested for catalytic activity (Fig. S1, G and H). We then chose two H2O2-generating (SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2 and NOX4-SB5/p22-LB2) and a negative pair (NOX4-SB6/p22-LB2) for NanoLuc PPI detection (Fig. 2A). SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2 elicited a strong signal, whereas NOX4-SB5/p22-LB2 and NOX4-SB6/p22-LB2 did not generate luminescence (Fig. 2B). Shortening the linker between SB and NOX4 (SB2-NOX4/p22-LB2) moderately reduced luminescence, whereas deletion of the last 23 amino acid residues of p22phox, increasing p22-LB2 linker length, or changing linker composition was inconsequential (Fig. S2). Co-expression of functional SB/LB pairs increased their protein expression, catalytic activity, and cell-surface expression (Fig. 2, C–E), probably due to heterodimer stabilization. In conclusion, we identified several optimal SB/LB combinations (SB1/SB2-NOX4/p22-LB1, -LB2, and -172LB) that formed a functional NOX4 enzyme complex at the cell surface. SB incorporation into the second cytosolic loop (D-loop) of NOX4 (SB3 and SB4) was not tolerated (Fig. S1B), supporting D-loop involvement in heterodimerization (6von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Wood M.R. Friedman J.S. Knaus U.G. Structural insights into Nox4 and Nox2: motifs involved in function and cellular localization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30 (19995913): 961-97510.1128/MCB.01393-09Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Replacement of penultimate C-terminal NOX4 sequences with SB abolished H2O2 production (Fig. S1B), whereas insertion of SB between FAD2 and NADPH1 (SB5) permitted enzyme trafficking and catalytic activity. This indicates that the SB5-containing complex was properly formed but did not provide the appropriate distance for SB/LB interaction, as SB5 is localized on the opposite side in the folded model (Fig. 2F, SB5 surface red). This observation reveals the critical importance of a multipronged approach when designing and validating interaction pairs. Comparison of NOX4-SB5 with the adjacent NOX4-SB6 identified a novel and unique region in the NOX4 C terminus that can be structurally modified without altering enzyme activity. Docking of the NanoLuc structure (PDB entry 5IBO) to the SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2 model indicates an approximate distance of 40 Å between the NOX4 N terminus and the p22phox C terminus, necessitating long linkers to accommodate the shorter 25-Å distance between the SB and LB termini. The model suggests that C-terminal fusions, such as the combination NOX4-LB1/p22-SB1, will form a complex. This interaction was confirmed, albeit, as expected from the earlier GFP studies (Fig. 1), with markedly reduced catalytic activity, although protein expression and cell-surface localization were comparable with catalytically active SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2 (Fig. 2, G–J). In contrast to N-terminal GFP-NOX4 (7von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Mutational analysis reveals distinct features of the Nox4-p22 phox complex.J. Biol.

High-throughput screening for small molecule modulators targeting PPI interfaces can identify lead compounds with increased selectivity for disrupting signaling circuits (13Scott D.E. Bayly A.R.

Existing NOX inhibitors are pan-flavoenzyme inhibitors or radical scavengers or NOX inhibitors lacking isoform selectivity. We reported that complex formation between NOX4 and p22phox differs from other NOX isoforms (7von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Mutational analysis reveals distinct features of the Nox4-p22 phox complex.J. Biol.

In the case of constitutively active NOX4, enzyme activity could alter PPI readout by oxidation (overexpression output 30–100 nmol of H2O2/h/106 cells). However, the SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2 luminescence signal was not affected by released or exogenously supplemented H2O2 (Fig. 3). After miniaturization to 1536-well format, selected compounds currently used as NOX inhibitors were tested in the NOX4 PPI assay.

Some compounds reduced at high concentrations the luminescence signal of the NOX4/p22phox PPI but decreased then also the signal generated by an unrelated PPI pair or by the cell-free NanoLuc substrate control. Thus, certain compounds used as nonspecific NOX inhibitors (at up to 50 μm) caused a higher false positive hit rate in the NanoBiT assay than reported previously for a LOPAC1280 library (10 μm) (18Hall M.P.

Heterodimerization was also not affected in SB1-NOX4H222Q/C226V, a double mutation in the second extracellular loop (E-loop) (Fig. 4B), yet this mutant failed to translocate in the majority of cells (Fig. 4, E and F). In HEK293 cells, which retain the majority of NOX4 on intracellular membranes and cannot be used for trafficking analysis, single H222Q and C226V mutations generated intracellular superoxide instead of H2O2 (19Takac I.

We show here that replacing certain E-loop residues located close to TMH5 impairs trafficking of the assembled heterodimer, which could be due to reduced binding to ER chaperones, such as calnexin (20Prior K.K.

Mutation of histidines serving as heme ligands in TMH3 and TMH5 (H119L and H119L/H194L) rendered NOX4 catalytically inactive and reduced PPI significantly (Fig. 4, A–D). In accord, treatment of SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2–expressing cells with the heme synthesis inhibitor succinyl acetone reduced luminescence and H2O2 generation (not shown). These results indicate that NOX4 follows the NOX2 paradigm, where heme incorporation is a prerequisite for heterodimerization (21DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B. Yu L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M.

Nonstabilized NOX4 His-119 and His-119/194 mutants failed to translocate to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, E and F). Missense variants in CYBA (p22phox) cause the immunodeficiency disorder chronic granulomatous disease due to defective assembly of the multimeric NOX2 complex. In A220 chronic granulomatous disease patients, CYBA variants lead to loss of both p22phox and NOX2 protein, as heterodimerization is required for the stability of both proteins in neutrophils (22van den Berg J.M. van Koppen E.

These rare CYBA variants may affect all NOX family members that rely on p22phox as a dimerization partner (NOX1–4).

H2O2 production and heterodimerization were significantly reduced, and ∼50% of the SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2G24R complex was trapped in the ER in epithelial cells (Fig. 5, A–E). Mutant p22phox mice (Cybanmf333, p22phox Y121H) display a Nox2 and Nox3 loss-of-function phenotype (23Nakano Y. Longo-Guess C.M. Bergstrom D.E. Nauseef W.M. Jones S.M. Bánfi B.

Mutational analysis reveals distinct features of the Nox4-p22 phox complex.J. Biol.

SB-LB tagging slightly reduced luminescence and H2O2 production of SB1-NOX4/p22-LBY121H (20–25%), but the majority of NOX4 translocated to the cell surface (Fig. 5, A–E). Inducing a β turn in TMH4 by replacing Tyr-121 with proline (p22phox Y121P) is predicted to disrupt the complex. In accord, heterodimerization, catalytic activity, and cell-surface expression of SB1-NOX4/p22-LB2Y121P were markedly reduced. A close-up of the NOX4-p22phox interface shows that p22phox forms an extensive network of hydrophobic interactions with NOX4 via Leu–Leu and Leu–Val contacts. The clustering of numerous hydrophobic contacts at the heterodimer interface will create a leucine zipper-like structure. Owing to the position of Tyr-121 in the last p22phox TMH, a proline substitution will alter the helix structure by breaking hydrophobic contacts and the hydrogen bond between NOX4 Ile-182 and p22phox Thr-64 (Fig. 5F). Arg-90 in p22phox forms a hydrogen bond with the p22phox Gly-24 backbone residue and NOX4 Thr-163. Thus, mutation of Gly-24 to arginine will destabilize both the p22phox fold due to repulsive charge and the hydrophobic interaction network between p22phox and NOX4 (Fig. 5F). Hence, the p22phox TMH4 penultimate amino acid residues discriminate between NOX isoforms and affect selectively heterodimerization with p22phox, whereas changes in the p22phox Gly-24 region (TMH1) influence heterodimerization with NOX4, NOX2, and probably NOX1/3. NADPH oxidases constitute a prime drug target for the treatment of diseases associated with chronic superoxide/H2O2 overproduction, such as fibrotic, cardiovascular, or metabolic diseases (16Altenhöfer S. Radermacher K.A. Kleikers P.W. Wingler K. Schmidt H.H. Evolution of NADPH oxidase inhibitors: selectivity and mechanisms for target engagement.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2015; 23 (24383718): 406-42710.1089/ars.2013.5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Almost all currently available small molecule inhibitors are not NOX isoform–selective and will interfere with redox signaling in a nonspecific manner. Inhibitors of the NOX electron transport chain are usually nonspecific due to high identity or homology of the involved domains and amino acid residues, although a NOX2-selective, NADPH-competitive compound was described recently (24Hirano K. Chen W.S. Chueng A.L. Dunne A.A. Seredenina T. Filippova A. Ramachandran S. Bridges A. Chaudry L. Pettman G. Allan C. Duncan S. Lee K.C. Lim J. Ma M.T. et al.Discovery of GSK2795039, a novel small molecule NADPH oxidase 2 inhibitor.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2015; 23 (26135714): 358-37410.1089/ars.2014.6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therapeutic disruption of the NOX membrane protein complex could lead to isoform selective compounds but is difficult to achieve, as the structure of the complex remains unresolved. A partial structure of a NOX5 homolog expressed in the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermum stagnale has been reported (25Magnani F. Nenci S. Millana Fananas E. Ceccon M. Romero E. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Crystal structures and atomic model of NADPH oxidase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28607049): 6764-6769PubMed Google Scholar), but NOX5-type oxidases differ substantially from NOX1–4 and DUOX1–2 enzymes, as heterodimerization is not required. Using knowledge accumulated by NOX protein engineering, disease-associated missense mutations, and NOX complex modeling, we developed a NOX4/p22phox PPI assay that distinguished between catalytic versus structural alterations, identified two hot spots in p22phox (TMH1 and TMH4), and revealed NOX4 loop involvement (loops D and E) in complex formation and/or trafficking. Hence, this PPI assay will not only support a deeper understanding of the catalytic center of the NOX4 enzyme, but can also assist in functional analysis of human disease-associated variants. Development of this assay expands our repertoire for assessing protein–protein interactions, as until now immunoprecipitation of NOX or p22phox from detergent-containing extracts was the only means for analyzing complex formation. Immunoprecipitation depends on the antibody selectivity and affinity, is highly variable, and is not quantitative. By permitting quantitative monitoring of conformational dimerization, the PPI assay constitutes also a novel tool for multiplexed high-throughput screening to identify candidate NOX inhibitors targeting either complex assembly or complex disruption or inducing allosteric modulation. The minimal steric burden inherent in this reversible, sensitive PPI system conveys a distinct advantage for intricate complex assemblies with multiple sensitive structural features. Our preliminary test of this NOX4 PPI assay indicates that current compounds used to inhibit NADPH oxidases do not target NOX4-p22phox heterodimerization. The utility of this PPI for NOX4 inhibitor discovery can be improved by inducible stable incorporation of the PPI pair into NOX4/p22phox-deficient cells. Establishing similar assays for other NOX isoforms may reveal additional determinants for assembly, improve prediction of human disease variant effects, and further support development of NOX isoform–selective PPI drug candidates. Requiring only a minimal-size fusion tag on one of the protein interaction partners was critical for maintaining a catalytically active, properly assembled oxidase enzyme.

The properties of functionally isolated MUs were examined in vivo. Mitochondrial biogenesis was judged based on the changes in mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA), the content of the electron transport chain (ETC) proteins and PGC-1α in the MG. Moreover, the markers of mitochondria remodeling mitofusins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and dynamin-like protein (Opa1) were studied using qPCR. A proportion of FR MUs increased from 37.9% to 50.8% and a proportion of FF units decreased from 44.7% to 26.6% after 8 weeks of training. The increased fatigue resistance, shortened twitch duration, and increased ability to potentiate force were found as early as after 2 weeks of endurance training, predominantly in FR MUs. Moreover, just after 2 weeks of the training an enhancement of the mitochondrial network remodeling was present as judged by an increase in expression of Mfn1, Opa1 and an increase in PGC-1α in the slow part of MG. Interestingly, no signs of intensification of mitochondrial biogenesis assessed by ETC proteins content and mtDNA in slow and fast parts of gastrocnemius were found at this stage of the training. Nevertheless, after 8 weeks of training an increase in the ETC protein content was observed, but mainly in the slow part of gastrocnemius. Concluding, the functional changes in MUs' contractile properties leading to the enhancement of muscle performance accompanied by an activation of signalling that controls the muscle mitochondrial network reorganisation and mitochondrial biogenesis belong to an early muscle adaptive responses that precede an increase in mitochondrial ETC protein content."

https://openalex.org/W2800422266,"A tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant mechanism is responsible for the electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions and relaxations of Crotalus durissus terrificus corpora cavernosa. Here it was investigated whether this mechanism also occurs in corpora cavernosa and aortae of the non-venomous snake Pantherophis guttatus corpora cavernosa and aortae. Corpora cavernosa and aortic rings isolated from Pantherophis guttatus snake were mounted in organ bath system for isometric tension recording. EFS-induced contractions in both tissues were performed in the presence and absence of guanethidine (30 μM), phentolamine (10 μM) and tetrodotoxin (1 μM). In another set of experiments, the endothelium was removed from aortic rings and EFS-induced contractions were performed in the denuded rings. Electrical field stimulation-induced contractions were frequency-dependent in Pantherophis guttatus corpora cavernosa and aortic rings. The contractions were significantly reduced in the presence of guanethidine (30 μM) or phentolamine (10 μM). Pre-treatment with tetrodotoxin had no effect on the EFS-induced contractions of either corpora cavernosa or aortic rings. Surprisingly, the EFS-induced contractions of aortic rings denuded of endothelium were almost abolished. These results indicate that the TTX-resistant mechanism is present in EFS-induced contractions of Pantherophis guttatus corpora cavernosa and aortae. The experiments performed in the aorta indicate that the endothelium is the main source for the release of catecholamines induced by EFS."
https://openalex.org/W2801798967,"Severe hyperbilirubinemia, which may result in kernicterus, is seen more frequently in low and middle-income countries, such as Indonesia, than in high-income countries. In Indonesia midwives, general practitioners (GPs), and pediatricians are involved in the care of jaundiced newborn infants. It is unknown whether the high incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia in this country is related to a lack of awareness of existing hyperbilirubinemia guidelines issued by, for example, the World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or the Indonesian Health Ministry, or to a lack of adherence to such guidelines. The aim of this questionnaire study was to assess health professionals' awareness of existing guidelines and their adherence to these guidelines in daily practice. We handed out a ten-question questionnaire to midwives, GPs, and pediatricians that included questions about the professionals themselves as well as clinical questions. The midwives completed 291 questionnaires, the GPs 206, and the pediatricians 154, all of which we used for our analysis. Almost 30% of the midwives and 23% of the GPs were either unaware of any existing guidelines or they did not adhere to them. Only 54% of the midwives recognized the warning signs of severe hyperbilirubinemia correctly, compared to 68% of the GPs and 89% of the pediatricians. Twenty-eight percent of the midwives and 31% of the GPs indicated that their first follow-up visit was after 72 hours, while 90% of them discharged infants after less than 48 hours after birth. The awareness of and adherence to guidelines for preventing and treating hyperbilirubinemia is low amongst the midwives and GPs in Indonesia. This may be an important contributing factor in the high incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia in Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W2800514271,"An expert panel has offered some new solutions to an old problem in U.S. biomedical research: too many young scientists vying for scarce academic research jobs and stable funding. Although many of its recommendations echo past proposals that have largely failed to gain traction, a few—including one to limit postdoctoral researchers to receiving just 3 years of funding from their principal investigators (PIs), and another to create a new federal oversight council—are catalyzing heated debate. The problem with current funding practices, the panel says, is that they encourage some PIs to view postdocs primarily as labor and provide little career mentoring. As a result, postdocs can linger in relatively poorly paid positions for years. But the proposed 3-year postdoc cap has drawn fierce opposition, which some researchers worry could prematurely end careers."

https://openalex.org/W2799831741,"The occurrence of helping behavior is thought to be automatically triggered by reflexive reactions and promoted by intuitive decisions. Here, we studied whether reflexive reactions to an emergency situation are associated with later helping behavior in a different situation, a violent conflict. First, 29 male supporters of F.C. Barcelona performed a cued-reaction time task with a low and high cognitive load manipulation, to tap into reflexive and reflective processes respectively, during the observation of an emergency. Next, participants entered a bar in Virtual Reality and had a conversation with a virtual fellow supporter. During this conversation, a virtual Real Madrid supporter entered and started an aggressive argument with the fellow supporter that escalated into a physical fight. Verbal and physical interventions of the participant served as measures of helping behavior. Results showed that faster responses to an emergency situation during low, but not during high cognitive load, were associated with more interventions during the violent conflict. However, a tendency to describe the decision to act during the violent conflict as intuitive and reflex-like was related to more interventions. Further analyses revealed that a disposition to experience sympathy, other-oriented feelings during distressful situations, was related to self-reported intuitive decision-making, a reduced distance to the perpetrator, and higher in the intervening participants. Taken together, these results shed new light on helping behavior and are consistent with the notion of a motivational system in which the act of helping is dependent on a complex interplay between intuitive, reflexive and deliberate, reflective processes."
https://openalex.org/W2802681827,"Recombinant human arylsulfatase A (rhASA) is in clinical development for the treatment of patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Manufacturing process changes were introduced to improve robustness and efficiency, resulting in higher levels of mannose-6-phosphate and sialic acid in post-change (process B) compared with pre-change (process A) rhASA. A nonclinical comparability program was conducted to compare process A and process B rhASA. All doses were administered intrathecally. Pharmacodynamic comparability was evaluated in immunotolerant MLD mice, using immunohistochemical staining of lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1). Pharmacokinetic comparability was assessed in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys dosed once with 6.0 mg (equivalent to 100 mg/kg of brain weight) process A or process B rhASA. Biodistribution was compared by quantitative whole-body autoradiography in rats. Potential toxicity of process B rhASA was evaluated by repeated rhASA administration at doses of 18.6 mg in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys. The specific activities for process A and process B rhASA were 89 U/mg and 106 U/mg, respectively, which were both well within the target range for the assay. Pharmacodynamic assessments showed no statistically significant differences in LAMP-1 immunohistochemical staining in the spinal cord and in most of the brain areas assessed between process A and B rhASA-dosed mice. LAMP-1 staining was reduced with both process A and B rhASA compared with vehicle, supporting its activity. Concentration–time curves in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of cynomolgus monkeys were similar with process A and B rhASA. Process A and B rhASA were similar in terms of their pharmacokinetic parameters and biodistribution data. No process B rhASA-related toxicity was detected. In conclusion, manufacturing process changes did not affect the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic or safety profiles of process B rhASA relative to process A rhASA."
https://openalex.org/W2800930282,"Background Respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or rhinovirus are one of the major causes for respiratory tract infections causing common cold disease. Respiratory viral infections range from mild symptoms in adults to serious illness especially in the very young or elderly as well as patients suffering from lung diseases or being immunocompromised due to other reasons. Engystol (EGY-2) is a multicomponent, multitarget preparation consisting of Vincetoxicum hirundinaria and Sulfur in various dilutions. The study objective was to test the effect of EGY-2 on the innate immune response during the early onset of respiratory viral infection in vivo as exemplified in a mouse model of RSV-induced respiratory inflammation. Methods Naïve BALB/c mice were infected with 1x106 infectious units RSV A2 intranasally to cause a mild respiratory infection. EGY-2 was administered daily per oral gavage starting seven days prior to RSV infection at doses of 0.4 to 5.1 tablets/kg. Control groups received placebo treatment. Animals were sacrificed 1 to 3 days post infection (p.i.) to analyse the infection and induced immune response in the lung. Viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung homogenate was determined by TCID50 assay as well as immunofluorescence staining of BALF cells using anti-RSV antibody and microscopic analysis. The RSV induced immune response was assessed by evaluation of BALF differential cell count, BALF cytokine secretion and analysis of the phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages. Results EGY-2 significantly reduced the RSV induced neutrophil and early lymphocyte influx on day 1 p.i. in BALF. EGY-2 treatment significantly diminished the RSV induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, KC and TNF-α at day 1. EGY-2 treatment was not protective for RSV infection per se, as no alteration in the viral load in lung and BALF was detected. Enhanced numbers of phagocytic-active macrophages were observed in EGY-2 treated animals on day 1 and this macrophage population showed strongly enhanced phagocytic activity on day 1 and day 3. Conclusion The data suggest a beneficial immunomodulatory effect of EGY-2 during early onset of respiratory viral infection in vivo, mediated by stimulation of macrophage phagocytosis, resulting in a reduced innate inflammatory response in terms of neutrophil and early lymphocyte infiltration as well as reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion."

They contribute to sodium chloride reabsorption in Henle’s loop of the kidney and to potassium secretion into the endolymph by the stria vascularis of the inner ear.

Barttin mutations cause Bartter syndrome type IV, a salt-wasting nephropathy with sensorineural deafness. Here, studying ClC-K/barttin channels heterologously expressed in MDCK-II and HEK293T cells with confocal imaging and patch-clamp recordings, we demonstrate that the eight-amino-acids-long barttin N terminus is required for channel trafficking and activation. Deletion of the complete N terminus (Δ2–8 barttin) retained barttin and human hClC-Ka channels in intracellular compartments. Partial N-terminal deletions did not compromise subcellular hClC-Ka trafficking but drastically reduced current amplitudes. Sequence deletions encompassing Thr-6, Phe-7, or Arg-8 in barttin completely failed to activate hClC-Ka. Analyses of protein expression and whole-cell current noise revealed that inactive channels reside in the plasma membrane. Substituting the deleted N terminus with a polyalanine sequence was insufficient for recovering chloride currents, and single amino acid substitutions highlighted that the correct sequence is required for proper function. Fast and slow gate activation curves obtained from rat V166E rClC-K1/barttin channels indicated that mutant barttin fails to constitutively open the slow gate.

In the present study, we sought to evaluate the frequency and anatomical distribution of cerebral microbleeds (cMBs) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in VBD.From a MRI database 94 VBD patients were identified and analyzed with special emphasis on cMBs and ICH on T2*-weighted gradient echo images (GRE) in relation to the established diagnostic MRI criteria of VBD (diameter, height, and lateral position). cMBs/ICH location was categorized into anterior/posterior circulation. Clinical information like demographic details, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities were abstracted from the case records. An extensive modelling approach using generalized linear mixed-effects models was used.Overall, 79 (84.0%) patients (mean age 72.1±10.0 years, 74.7% male) with a standard stroke MRI protocol including T2*-weighted images were included in the analysis. cMBs were observed in 38/79 (48.1%) patients, ranging from 1 to 84 cMBs per patient. In the posterior circulation cMBs were observed more frequently (34/38 (89.5%)) in comparison to the anterior circulation (24/38 (63.2%)). cMBs were observed in the thalamus in 20/38 (52.6%), hippocampus in 1/38 (2.6%), occipital lobe in 18/38 (47.4%), pons in 6/38 (15.8%), medulla oblongata in 2/38 (5.2%), and cerebellum in 14/38 (36.8%) patients. ICH was observed in only 6/79 (7.6%) patients. There were significantly more cMBs in the posterior- (NCMBs-PC = 1.717, 95%CI: 1.336-2.208, p = 0.0315) than in the anterior circulation. Logistic regression model showed a significant positive effect of clinical symptoms such as ischemic, TIA and hemorrhagic stroke on the presence of cMBs (OR = 3.34, 95%CI [2.0-5.57], p = 0.0184; ndf = 78, AIC = 107.51). General linear model showed that clinical symptoms have a highly significant effect on the number of cMBs (N = 2.78, 95%CI [2.51-3.07], p<2*10-16; ndf = 78, AIC = 1218).cMBs and ICH may be observed in the anterior and posterior circulation in VBD but they occur more frequently in the posterior circulation. Most common anatomical locations of cMBs in VBD were the thalamus, occipital lobe and cerebellum. This posterior dominance of cMBs and ICH in VBD might reflect a specific underlying vascular pathology."

The study aims to understand the molecular profile of three candidate cell cycle regulatory genes, RBSP3, LIMD1 and CDC25A in the basal/ parabasal versus spinous layer of normal oral epithelium and during head and neck tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical expression and promoter methylation was used to determine the molecular signature in normal oral epithelium. The mechanism of alteration transmission of this profile during tumorigenesis was then explored through additional deletion and mutation in HPV/ tobacco etiological groups, followed byclinico-pathological correlation. In basal/parabasal layer, the molecular signature of the genes was low protein expression/ high promoter methylation of RBSP3, high expression/ low methylation of LIMD1 and high expression of CDC25A. Dysplastic epithelium maintained the signature of RBSP3 through high methylation/ additional deletion with loss of the signatures of LIMD1 and CDC25A via deletion/ additional methylation. Similarly, maintenance and / or loss of signature in invasive tumors was by recurrent deletion/ methylation. Thus, differential patterns of alteration of the genes might be pre-requisite for the development of dysplastic and invasive lesions. Etiological factors played a key role in promoting genetic alterations and determining prognosis. Tobacco negative HNSCC patients had significantly lower alterations of LIMD1 and CDC25A, along with better survival among tobacco negative/ HPV positive patients. Our data suggests the necessity for perturbation of normal molecular profile of RBSP3, LIMD1 and CDC25A in conjunction with etiological factors for head and neck tumorigenesis, implying their diagnostic and prognostic significance."

We introduce a contrast paradigm for studying reversals in choices—here between pairs of abstract paintings—implemented in both within-subject (Experiment 1; N = 320) and between-subject (Experiment 2; N = 384) designs. On each trial, participants chose between a pair of paintings. A critical pair of average-beauty paintings was presented before and after either a reversal or control block. In the reversal block, we made efforts to bias preference away from the chosen average-beauty painting (by pairing it with more-beautiful paintings) and toward the non-chosen average-beauty painting (by pairing it with less-beautiful paintings). Meta-analysis revealed more reversals after reversal blocks than after control blocks, though only when the biasing manipulations succeeded. A second meta-analysis revealed that reversals were generally more likely for participants who later misidentified their initial choice, demonstrating that memory for initial choices influences later choices. Thus, the contrast paradigm has utility both for inducing choice reversals and identifying their causes."

In this work, the mechanism underlining this positive regulation was probed by multiple approaches. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting assay (DIFA) identified a conserved 35-nt DNA segment in the orf21-orf22 intergenic region where the purified recombinant DepR binds to. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) promoter probe assays established that transcription of phasin gene orf22 increases in the depR deletion mutant of C. violaceum (CvΔdepR) compared to the wild-type strain. FK228 production in the orf22-overexpressed strain C. violaceum was reduced compared with the wild-type strain. DepR has two conserved cysteine residues C199 and C208 presumed to form a disulfide bridge upon sensing oxidative stress. C199X point mutations that locked DepR in a reduced conformation decreased the DNA-binding affinity of DepR; T232A or R278A mutation also had a negative impact on DNA binding of DepR. Complementation of CvΔdepR with any of those versions of depR carrying a single codon mutation was not able to restore FK228 production to the level of wild-type strain. All evidences collectively suggested that DepR positively regulates the biosynthesis of FK228 through indirect metabolic networking."
https://openalex.org/W2799442693,"Epithelia contribute to physical barriers that protect internal tissues from the external environment and also support organ structure. Accordingly, establishment and maintenance of epithelial architecture are essential for both embryonic development and adult physiology. Here, using gene knockout and knockdown techniques along with gene profiling, we show that extracellular signal–regulated kinase 3 (ERK3), a poorly characterized atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), regulates the epithelial architecture in vertebrates. We found that in Xenopus embryonic epidermal epithelia, ERK3 knockdown impairs adherens and tight-junction protein distribution, as well as tight-junction barrier function, resulting in epidermal breakdown. Moreover, in human epithelial breast cancer cells, inhibition of ERK3 expression induced thickened epithelia with aberrant adherens and tight junctions. Results from microarray analyses suggested that transcription factor AP-2α (TFAP2A), a transcriptional regulator important for epithelial gene expression, is involved in ERK3-dependent changes in gene expression. Of note, TFAP2A knockdown phenocopied ERK3 knockdown in both Xenopus embryos and human cells, and ERK3 was required for full activation of TFAP2A-dependent transcription. Our findings reveal that ERK3 regulates epithelial architecture, possibly together with TFAP2A."
