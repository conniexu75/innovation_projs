https://openalex.org/W2057776779,"Periodic movements of the olfactory organs, known as ""flicking,"" temporally enhance the response of the olfactory receptors of the spiny lobster to changes in stimulus concentration. This reflex provides the lobster with a physiological mechanism to compensate for the indiscrete temporal nature of chemical stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1991746792,"The California mussel Mytilus californianus records with high fidelity annual temperature variations of nearshore waters in the oxygen isotope composition of its shell. The onset and termination of upwelling events (and metabolic activity) are recorded in the associated carbon isotope signal, and the magnitude and timing of upwelling can be estimated. The method has implications for studying the history of upwelling and the life history of living and fossil mollusks and for analyzing shell midden deposits."

This protein is not detected in uninfected plants and bacteroids or in free-living Rhizobium and appears to be synthesized by the plant during the formation of root nodules."
https://openalex.org/W2088560702,"New ionization methods combined with powerful analyzers, detectors, and data systems have made mass spectrometry a versatile tool for molecular analysis. Samples consisting of nanogram quantities of hundreds of unique components are routinely analyzed. In favorable cases samples as small as 2.5 x 10(-14) gram and samples with masses of more than 3000 atomic mass units have been successfully examined."

Since the superconducting behavior of protactinium is affected by its 5f electron character, it is clear now that protactinium is a true actinide element."
https://openalex.org/W2039390431,"In an examination of the reliability of occultation observations of minor planet companions, redundant photoelectric observations have been made of possible occultation events. These observations indicate that spurious events may be easily misidentified as true occultations, and that caution must be exercised in interpreting such occurrences. Further analysis of observations of the 1973 Pallas occultation suggests that earlier results may be unreliable."

https://openalex.org/W1978145322,A survey of reported sightings of lake monster phenomena suggests that many of them may be attributable to atmospheric image distortion. The existence of the necessary conditions (surface temperature inversion and hence strong atmospheric refraction) can be inferred from most of the reports. Under such conditions familiar objects can easily take on unrecognizable form. Two photographs demonstrate the extent of the distortion that can occur.
