To understand its architecture, we examined the human respiratory chain megacomplex-I2III2IV2 (MCI2III2IV2) with 140 subunits and a subset of associated cofactors using cryo-electron microscopy. The MCI2III2IV2 forms a circular structure with the dimeric CIII located in the center, where it is surrounded by two copies each of CI and CIV. Two cytochrome c (Cyt.c) molecules are positioned to accept electrons on the surface of the c1 state CIII dimer. Analyses indicate that CII could insert into the gaps between CI and CIV to form a closed ring, which we termed the electron transport chain supercomplex. The structure not only reveals the precise assignment of individual subunits of human CI and CIII, but also enables future in-depth analysis of the electron transport chain as a whole.

Mitochondria produce the majority of the energy carrier molecule ATP and function as the “energy factory” in the vast majority of cell types in the human body. The respiratory chain complexes (RCCs), containing four multi-subunit complexes (complex I–IV; CI, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; CII, succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; CIII, cytochrome bc1 complex; and CIV, cytochrome c oxidase), are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and play important roles in energy conversion (Berrisford and Sazanov, 2009Berrisford J.M.

Among these complexes, CI is the entry point of electrons into RCCs and, together with CIII and CIV, couples electron transfer and proton translocation across mitochondrial inner membrane, leading to ATP synthesis by complex V (CV). In humans, dysfunctions of CI cause generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. More importantly, CI dysfunction impairs oxidative phosphorylation, reduces the membrane potential and ATP synthesis, and leads to impaired NAD+/NADH ratio. These defects perturb a large variety of metabolic processes and are implicated in a plethora of human diseases (Bakthavachalam and Shanmugam, 2017Bakthavachalam P. Shanmugam P.S.

The RCCs have historically been deemed as separate enzymes (Enríquez, 2016Enríquez J.A. Supramolecular organization of respiratory complexes.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2016; 78: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Schägger and Pfeiffer, 2000Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. Supercomplexes in the respiratory chains of yeast and mammalian mitochondria.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar initially identified a higher integration level of respiratory chain complexes in blue native page (BN-PAGE) gels. The first fully functional respirasome was isolated from mouse, confirming this initial observation in blue native gels (Acín-Pérez et al., 2008Acín-Pérez R. Fernández-Silva P. Peleato M.L. Pérez-Martos A. Enriquez J.A. Respiratory active mitochondrial supercomplexes.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Most recently, our group reported a near-atomic resolution structure of respirasome (SCI1III2IV1) from Sus scrofa (Gu et al., 2016Gu J. Wu M. Guo R. Yan K. Lei J. Gao N. Yang M. The architecture of the mammalian respirasome.Nature. 2016; 537: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2016Wu M. Gu J. Guo R. Huang Y. Yang M.

Fiedorczuk K. Sazanov L.A. The architecture of respiratory supercomplexes.Nature. 2016; 537: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Sousa et al., 2016Sousa J.S. Mills D.J. Vonck J. Kühlbrandt W. Functional asymmetry and electron flow in the bovine respirasome.eLife. 2016; 5https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21290Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies also suggested the existence of higher order oligomerization of respiratory chain complexes (Letts et al., 2016Letts J.A. Fiedorczuk K. Sazanov L.A. The architecture of respiratory supercomplexes.Nature. 2016; 537: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2016Wu M. Gu J. Guo R. Huang Y. Yang M.

Based on rapid-freeze, deep-etch research of mitochondrial inner membrane, Schägger’s group presented a model of respiratory strings based on the stoichiometry of CI–CIV. In their model, I2III4IV8 form circular structures linked by III2IV4 to form a helical string along the cristae surface (Wittig et al., 2006bWittig I. Carrozzo R. Santorelli F.M. Schägger H. Supercomplexes and subcomplexes of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Supporting this model, two groups later found megacomplex organization of CIII and CIV in yeast and bacteria (Heinemeyer et al., 2007Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. A structural model of the cytochrome C reductase/oxidase supercomplex from yeast mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12240-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Sousa et al., 2013Sousa P.M. Videira M.A. Santos F.A. Hood B.L. Conrads T.P. Melo A.M. The bc:caa3 supercomplexes from the Gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis respiratory chain: a megacomplex organization?.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 537: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the respiratory string model based solely on stoichiometry seems inaccurate in mammals, because the widely accepted plasticity model posits that not all CIIIs and CIVs are assembled into supercomplexes (Enríquez, 2016Enríquez J.A. Supramolecular organization of respiratory complexes.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2016; 78: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In 2009, Kouril’s group reported a megacomplex organization of I2III2 from potato mitochondria (Bultema et al., 2009Bultema J.B. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. Megacomplex organization of the oxidative phosphorylation system by structural analysis of respiratory supercomplexes from potato.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Particles larger than SCI1III2IV1 were also detected in both BN-PAGE and cryo-EM images in that study. In the present study, we report the highest resolution structure to date of human SCI1III2IV1 and determine the circular architecture of megacomplex I2III2IV2 (MCI2III2IV2). Based on this structural information and previous functional analyses, we hypothesize that CII is also a part of the megacomplex. The structure of CII can be fitted into the megacomplex to form the electron transport chain supercomplex (ETCS), which contains all electron transport chain components. In the ETCS, CI and CII can use the same Q-pool sealed by CI, CII, CIII, and CIV, providing the most effective electron-transport pathways. Furthermore, inclusion of CII into the megacomplex can well explain the reverse electron transfer from succinate to NADH (Lenaz et al., 2016Lenaz G. Tioli G. Falasca A.I. Genova M.L. Complex I function in mitochondrial supercomplexes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1857: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our structures represent the highest resolution structure to date of these huge human membrane supercomplexes. They reveal the precise arrangement of human respiratory chain complexes and further suggest that CI, CII, CIII, and CIV can function in a single mega-assembly. This information may facilitate the development of therapeutic applications for treating human diseases involving dysfunctional electron transport chain complexes. The mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes are the major and most intricate components of the energy production system in cells (Acín-Pérez et al., 2008Acín-Pérez R. Fernández-Silva P.

https://openalex.org/W2747333975,"Alterations in transcriptional regulators can orchestrate oncogenic gene expression programs in cancer. Here, we show that the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex, which is mutated in over 20% of human tumors, interacts with EWSR1, a member of a family of proteins with prion-like domains (PrLD) that are frequent partners in oncogenic fusions with transcription factors. In Ewing sarcoma, we find that the BAF complex is recruited by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein to tumor-specific enhancers and contributes to target gene activation. This process is a neomorphic property of EWS-FLI1 compared to wild-type FLI1 and depends on tyrosine residues that are necessary for phase transitions of the EWSR1 prion-like domain. Furthermore, fusion of short fragments of EWSR1 to FLI1 is sufficient to recapitulate BAF complex retargeting and EWS-FLI1 activities. Our studies thus demonstrate that the physical properties of prion-like domains can retarget critical chromatin regulatory complexes to establish and maintain oncogenic gene expression programs."

However, it is still unclear how ILCs are regulated in the duration of intestinal inflammation. Here, we identify a regulatory subpopulation of ILCs (called ILCregs) that exists in the gut and harbors a unique gene identity that is distinct from that of ILCs or regulatory T cells (Tregs). During inflammatory stimulation, ILCregs can be induced in the intestine and suppress the activation of ILC1s and ILC3s via secretion of IL-10, leading to protection against innate intestinal inflammation. Moreover, TGF-β1 is induced by ILCregs during the innate intestinal inflammation, and autocrine TGF-β1 sustains the maintenance and expansion of ILCregs. Therefore, ILCregs play an inhibitory role in the innate immune response, favoring the resolution of intestinal inflammation.

Therefore, ILCregs play an inhibitory role in the innate immune response, favoring the resolution of intestinal inflammation. The intestine represents a major gateway for potential pathogens, which also contains dietary antigens and an extensive and diverse microbial flora that need to be tolerated. Due to these requirements, the gut constitutes the largest lymphoid organ in the body, encompassing an extensive network of secondary lymphoid organs and is home to an enormous number of lymphocytes (Izcue et al., 2009Izcue A. Coombes J.L. Powrie F. Regulatory lymphocytes and intestinal inflammation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 313-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Intestinal immune responses take place in the epithelium, lamina propria, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The gut harbors several intestine-specific subpopulations specialized in antigen presentation, antimicrobial immunity, and maintenance of tolerance. Breakdown in the regulatory pathways leads to chronic intestinal inflammation (Kaser et al., 2010Kaser A. Zeissig S. Blumberg R.S. Inflammatory bowel disease.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 573-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). For example, dysregulation of mucosal T cell responses may cause a loss of tolerance, leading to harmful intestinal inflammation reminiscent of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Strober et al., 2002Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R.S. The immunology of mucosal models of inflammation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Moreover, the regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and self-tolerance (Asseman et al., 1999Asseman C. Mauze S. Leach M.W. Coffman R.L.

However, how the intestinal innate immune system is regulated during the intestinal inflammation remains elusive. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are located in mucosal surfaces to potentiate immune responses, sustain mucosal integrity and promote lymphoid organogenesis (Diefenbach et al., 2014Diefenbach A.

Group 1 (ILC1) cells are characterized by their capacity to secrete interferon γ (IFN-γ) responding to interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18 (Gordon et al., 2012Gordon S.M. Chaix J. Rupp L.J.

Group 2 (ILC2) cells generate type 2 T helper (Th2) cell cytokines, such as IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, in response to IL-25 and IL-33 stimulation (Brestoff et al., 2015Brestoff J.R. Kim B.S. Saenz S.A.

Group 3 (ILC3) cells produce IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-22 following stimulation with IL-1β and IL-23 (Buonocore et al., 2010Buonocore S. Ahern P.P. Uhlig H.H. Ivanov I.I. Littman D.R. Maloy K.J. Powrie F.

Given that ILCs produce substantial effector cytokines when stimulated, they play a critical role in the regulation of type 1, type 2, and type 3 (or Th17 cell) responses, controlling host protective immunity and intestinal homeostasis (Bedoui et al., 2016Bedoui S.

Intraepithelial ILC1s undergo expansion and produce large amounts of IFN-γ in the human Crohn’s disease. Blocking of ILC1 with anti-NK1.1 antibody in mice is able to attenuate colitis (Fuchs et al., 2013Fuchs A. Vermi W. Lee J.S. Lonardi S. Gilfillan S. Newberry R.D. Cella M. Colonna M.

In addition, ILC3s are implicated in the innate intestinal inflammation via secretion of IL-17 and IL-22. IL-17-producing ILC3s are responsible for the pathogenesis of Tbx21−/−Rag2−/− ulcerative colitis mice (Garrett et al., 2007Garrett W.S. Lord G.M. Punit S. Lugo-Villarino G. Mazmanian S.K. Ito S.

Depletion of ILC3s by anti-Thy1 antibody abrogates innate colitis (Buonocore et al., 2010Buonocore S. Ahern P.P. Uhlig H.H. Ivanov I.I. Littman D.R. Maloy K.J. Powrie F. Innate lymphoid cells drive interleukin-23-dependent innate intestinal pathology.Nature. 2010; 464: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role of ILC3s in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. However, it is unknown whether a regulatory subset of ILCs exists and how they function in the regulation of intestinal inflammation. Here, we identify a novel regulatory subpopulation of ILCs (called ILCregs) that exists in the gut and expands in the intestine following pathogenic stimulation. ILCregs exert an inhibitory role in the innate immune response against intestinal inflammation. Given that Treg cell-mediated suppression through secretion of their feature cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β (Izcue et al., 2009Izcue A. Coombes J.L. Powrie F.

Regulatory T cells: mechanisms of differentiation and function.Annu. Rev.

Expression of interleukin-10 in intestinal lymphocytes detected by an interleukin-10 reporter knockin tiger mouse.Immunity. 2006; 25: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We noticed that a unique subset of ILCs constitutively expressed IL-10 in the intestine (Figures 1A and S1A). These Lin−CD45+CD127+IL-10+ ILCs were mainly located in the lamina propria of the small intestine (sLP), and some of them in the small intestinal epithelium (sIE) and colon lamina propria (cLP) (Figure 1A). Lin−CD45+CD127+IL-10+ ILCs were small in size and had a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and scanty cytoplasm, which are all characteristics of lymphoid morphology (Figures 1B and 1C). Of note, Lin−CD45+CD127+IL-10+ ILCs were devoid of expression of CD4 and FoxP3 (Figure S1B), which are signature markers of Tregs (Sakaguchi et al., 2008Sakaguchi S. Yamaguchi T. Nomura T. Ono M. Regulatory T cells and immune tolerance.Cell. 2008; 133: 775-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar), indicating that the Lin−CD45+CD127+IL-10+ ILC subset was different from the Tregs subset. In addition, Lin−CD45+CD127+IL-10+ ILCs also expressed ILC markers, such as CD25 (IL-2Rα) and CD90 (Thy1). This population also highly expressed IL-2Rγ and Sca-1, but lacked ILC1 markers (NK1.1 and NKp46), ILC2 markers (ST2 and KLRG1), ILC3 markers (NKp46, CD4, and RORγt), or other leukocyte lineage markers (Gury-BenAri et al., 2016Gury-BenAri M.

Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. IL-10-producing ILCregs were further confirmed through imaging flow cytometry by using anti-IL-10 antibody (Figure 1E). Furthermore, ILCregs with co-expression of CD127 and IL-10 indeed existed in mouse small and large intestines by immunofluorescence staining (Figures 1F and S1D). These observations were further validated through immunohistochemical staining (Figure 1G). In addition, ILCregs also existed in the human intestine from biopsies (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1E). Collectively, the Lin−CD45+CD127+IL-10+ cells are a new ILC subset that exists in mouse and human intestines. We isolated ILCregs from mouse sLP and performed transcriptome microarray assays. Comparing existing transcriptome datasets of ILCs with natural killer (NK) cells (GEO: GSE37448) and Tregs (GEO: GSE68009) highlights that ILCregs do not show any significant gene profile similarity to known ILC subsets and Tregs (Figure 2A). Of note, ILCregs do express high levels of Il10 and several ILC feature markers, including Il7r (encoding CD127), Il2ra (encoding CD25), Il2rg, and Ly6a (encoding Sca-1), which is consistent with our previous observations (Figure 1D). ILCregs uniquely express transcription factors, such as Id3 and Sox4 (Figure 2A), and they also highly expressed Id2, which is required for development of ILCs (Diefenbach et al., 2014Diefenbach A. Colonna M. Koyasu S. Development, differentiation, and diversity of innate lymphoid cells.Immunity. 2014; 41: 354-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, Spits and Cupedo, 2012Spits H. Cupedo T. Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 647-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, ILCregs lack typical transcription factors of other ILCs and Tregs, such as Rorc (encoding RORγt), Tbx21 (encoding T-bet), Gata3, and Foxp3, respectively (Serafini et al., 2015Serafini N. Vosshenrich C.A. Di Santo J.P. Transcriptional regulation of innate lymphoid cell fate.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, ILCregs constitutively express Tgfbr1, Tgfbr2, Il2rb, and Il2rg (Figure 2A), suggesting they responded to TGF-β and IL-2 signaling. Principal component analysis further verified that ILCregs harbor a unique gene profile (Figure 2B). Similarly, human ILCregs show distinct gene profiles of transcription factors and cytokines compared to other ILCs (Figure 2C). Additionally, some feature cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), are also highly expressed in human ILCregs as well. High expression levels of TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, IL-2Rβ, and Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) in ILCregs were validated by flow cytometry (Figures S1F and S1G). Moreover, Il2rg- or Id2-deficient mice abrogated ILCregs (Figure S1H), which are common characters similar to other ILC subsets (Serafini et al., 2015Serafini N. Vosshenrich C.A. Di Santo J.P. Transcriptional regulation of innate lymphoid cell fate.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rag1−/− mice show a normal number of ILCregs compared to wild-type (WT) mice (Figure S1H), and ILCregs of Rag1−/− mice do not express immature T cell markers (data not shown), suggesting they develop independent of Rag. By contrast, Id2 deficiency failed to impact the development of Tregs (Figure S1I). To further determine whether ILCregs are derived from myeloid or T cells, we generated Rosa26-STOP-YFP;Lyz2-Cre;IL-10-GFP mice and Rosa26-STOP-YFP;CD4-Cre;IL-10-GFP mice. We found that ILCregs were indeed negative for YFP signals in the above two mouse strains, whereas their respective lineage positive cells virtually displayed YFP signals (Figures S2A and S2B), indicating that ILCregs are not derived from myeloid or T cells. Recently, integrin α4β7+Id2high CHILP (common helper-like innate lymphoid precursor) was identified as a common precursor for all helper-like ILCs, including LTi and ILC1-3 subsets (Klose et al., 2014Klose C.S.N. Flach M. Möhle L. Rogell L. Hoyler T. Ebert K. Fabiunke C. Pfeifer D. Sexl V. Fonseca-Pereira D. et al.Differentiation of type 1 ILCs from a common progenitor to all helper-like innate lymphoid cell lineages.Cell. 2014; 157: 340-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), whereas PLZF+ ILCP (common ILC precursor) is the precursor for ILC1-3s, only giving rise to ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s (Ishizuka et al., 2016Ishizuka I.E. Constantinides M.G. Gudjonson H. Bendelac A. The innate lymphoid cell precursor.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Next, we crossed Rosa26-STOP-YFP mice with different Cre mice to determine the precursor of ILCregs. We observed that only Rosa26-STOP-YFP;Id2-CreERT2 mice displayed YFP-positive ILCregs in the presence or absence of DSS treatment (Figures S2C and S2D). However, ILCregs in Rosa26-STOP-YFP;PLZF-Cre mice or Rosa26-STOP-YFP;RORγt-Cre mice were YFP negative (Figures S2C and S2D). These data suggest that ILCregs are derived from Id2-driven CHILPs, but not ILCPs or ILC3s. To further validate IL-10-producing ILCregs represented a distinct lineage as opposed to a further differentiation state of ILC1, ILC2, or ILC3 cells, we established Id2- CreERT2;RosaDTR, PLZF-Cre;RosaDTR, and RORγt-Cre;RosaDTR mice, followed by adoptive transfer assays. With diphtheria toxin (DT) treatment, Id2-CreERT2;RosaDTR mice abrogated ILCreg cells (Figure S2E), suggesting ILCregs were generated from the progenitor CHILP (Klose et al., 2014Klose C.S.N. Flach M. Möhle L. Rogell L. Hoyler T. Ebert K. Fabiunke C. Pfeifer D. Sexl V.

However, deletion of PLZF- or RORγt-expressing cells does not affect the development of ILCregs (Figure S2E), indicating that ILCregs do not differentiate from the progenitor of LTi, ILC1, ILC2, or ILC3 cells (Artis and Spits, 2015Artis D. Spits H. The biology of innate lymphoid cells.Nature. 2015; 517: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). To further verify the progenitor of ILCregs, we transferred CLP, αLP, CHILP, and ILCP progenitors into Rag1−/−Il2rg−/− mice for adoptive transfer assays. We noticed that CLP, αLP, and CHILP were able to produce ILCregs, whereas ILCPs could not generate ILCregs (Figure S2F). Depletion of CHILPs by DT treatment in adoptively reconstituted Rag1−/−Il2rg−/− mice abrogated generation of ILCregs (Figure S2G). Collectively, ILCregs are derived from CHILPs, but not ILCPs, which are a separate subset distinct from Tregs and other ILC lineages. Since ILCregs mainly reside in the intestine and develop independent of Rag, we next used innate intestinal inflammation models to monitor ILCreg functions. We treated Rag1−/− mice with several inflammatory stimuli, including DSS, anti-CD40 antibody, Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), and Citrobacter Rodentium (C. rodentium). We noticed that ILCregs could be induced in the intestines of Rag1−/− mice with these inflammatory stimuli (Figure 3A). Notably, ILCregs gradually expanded in the intestines during the process of inflammation (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3A), reaching a peak level at 8 days post-stimulation, which came up at peak inflammation (Figure S3B). By contrast, the number of ILC1s and ILC3s immediately increased at early stages post-stimulation and decreased soon afterward (Figure S3C), whereas the number of ILC2s did not change during the process of inflammation (Figure S3C). These data indicate that ILCregs can be induced by innate intestinal inflammation.Figure S3ILCregs Attenuate Innate Colitis, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Isotype control staining for anti-IL-10 (left panel) or anti-Ki67 antibody (right panel) by flow cytometry.(B) WT mice were treated with 3% DSS in drinking water for the indicated days or 150 μg anti-CD40 antibody (i.p.) on day 0, or infected by oral gavage of 5x104 c.f.u.

https://openalex.org/W2747183034,"CRISPR-Cas9 proteins function within bacterial immune systems to target and destroy invasive DNA and have been harnessed as a robust technology for genome editing. Small bacteriophage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) can inactivate Cas9, providing an efficient off switch for Cas9-based applications. Here, we show that two Acrs, AcrIIC1 and AcrIIC3, inhibit Cas9 by distinct strategies. AcrIIC1 is a broad-spectrum Cas9 inhibitor that prevents DNA cutting by multiple divergent Cas9 orthologs through direct binding to the conserved HNH catalytic domain of Cas9. A crystal structure of an AcrIIC1-Cas9 HNH domain complex shows how AcrIIC1 traps Cas9 in a DNA-bound but catalytically inactive state. By contrast, AcrIIC3 blocks activity of a single Cas9 ortholog and induces Cas9 dimerization while preventing binding to the target DNA. These two orthogonal mechanisms allow for separate control of Cas9 target binding and cleavage and suggest applications to allow DNA binding while preventing DNA cutting by Cas9."
https://openalex.org/W2747941681,"Apoptosis represents a key anti-cancer therapeutic effector mechanism. During apoptosis, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) typically kills cells even in the absence of caspase activity. Caspase activity can also have a variety of unwanted consequences that include DNA damage. We therefore investigated whether MOMP-induced caspase-independent cell death (CICD) might be a better way to kill cancer cells. We find that cells undergoing CICD display potent pro-inflammatory effects relative to apoptosis. Underlying this, MOMP was found to stimulate NF-κB activity through the downregulation of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Strikingly, engagement of CICD displays potent anti-tumorigenic effects, often promoting complete tumour regression in a manner dependent on intact immunity. Our data demonstrate that by activating NF-κB, MOMP can exert additional signalling functions besides triggering cell death. Moreover, they support a rationale for engaging caspase-independent cell death in cell-killing anti-cancer therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2746036157,"Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, is a traditional oriental medicine used to treat diarrhea and gastroenteritis. Recently, we reported that it could inhibit the growth of intestinal polyp in animals and in patients with the familial adenomatous polyposis by downregulating β-catenin signaling. However, the intracellular target mediating the effects of berberine remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that berberine inhibits β-catenin function via directly binding to a unique region comprising residues Gln275, Arg316 and Arg371 in nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), where berberine concomitantly binding to and synergistically activating RXRα with 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), a natural ligand binding to the classical ligand-binding pocket of RXRα. Berberine binding promotes RXRα interaction with nuclear β-catenin, leading to c-Cbl mediated degradation of β-catenin, and consequently inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, berberine suppresses the growth of human colon carcinoma xenograft in nude mice in an RXRα-dependent manner. Together, our study not only identifies RXRα as a direct protein target for berberine but also dissects their binding mode and validates that berberine indeed suppresses β-catenin signaling and cell growth in colon cancer via binding RXRα, which provide new strategies for the design of new RXRα-based antitumor agents and drug combinations."
https://openalex.org/W2746882347,"Stefan Mundlos, Darío Lupiáñez and colleagues investigate CNVs involving the regulatory landscape of IHH (Indian hedgehog), which cause craniosynostosis and synpolydactyly. Using genetic manipulation in mice, they show that Ihh is regulated by at least nine enhancers with individual tissue specificities and that duplications in this region can cause dose-dependent upregulation and also misexpression of Ihh. Copy number variations (CNVs) often include noncoding sequences and putative enhancers, but how these rearrangements induce disease is poorly understood. Here we investigate CNVs involving the regulatory landscape of IHH (encoding Indian hedgehog), which cause multiple, highly localized phenotypes including craniosynostosis and synpolydactyly1,2. We show through transgenic reporter and genome-editing studies in mice that Ihh is regulated by a constellation of at least nine enhancers with individual tissue specificities in the digit anlagen, growth plates, skull sutures and fingertips. Consecutive deletions, resulting in growth defects of the skull and long bones, showed that these enhancers function in an additive manner. Duplications, in contrast, caused not only dose-dependent upregulation but also misexpression of Ihh, leading to abnormal phalanges, fusion of sutures and syndactyly. Thus, precise spatiotemporal control of developmental gene expression is achieved by complex multipartite enhancer ensembles. Alterations in the composition of such clusters can result in gene misexpression and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2746116207,"NAD+ depletion is a common phenomenon in neurodegenerative pathologies. Excitotoxicity occurs in multiple neurologic disorders and NAD+ was shown to prevent neuronal degeneration in this process through mechanisms that remained to be determined. The activity of nicotinamide riboside (NR) in neuroprotective models and the recent description of extracellular conversion of NAD+ to NR prompted us to probe the effects of NAD+ and NR in protection against excitotoxicity. Here, we show that intracortical administration of NR but not NAD+ reduces brain damage induced by NMDA injection. Using cortical neurons, we found that provision of extracellular NR delays NMDA-induced axonal degeneration (AxD) much more strongly than extracellular NAD+ Moreover, the stronger effect of NR compared to NAD+ depends of axonal stress since in AxD induced by pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide salvage, both NAD+ and NR prevent neuronal death and AxD in a manner that depends on internalization of NR. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NR is a better neuroprotective agent than NAD+ in excitotoxicity-induced AxD and that axonal protection involves defending intracellular NAD+ homeostasis.-Vaur, P., Brugg, B., Mericskay, M., Li, Z., Schmidt, M.

Rapti et al., addressing this long-standing mystery, uncover key steps in forming the brain-like nerve ring of C. elegans. Glia initiate the structure, using Netrin to guide pioneer neurons, whose identity is characterized. Glia and pioneer neurons then together direct follower-axon guidance using redundant guidance factors. Brain assembly is hypothesized to begin when pioneer axons extend over non-neuronal cells, forming tracts guiding follower axons. Yet pioneer-neuron identities, their guidance substrates, and their interactions are not well understood. Here, using time-lapse embryonic imaging, genetics, protein-interaction, and functional studies, we uncover the early events of C. elegans brain assembly. We demonstrate that C. elegans glia are key for assembly initiation, guiding pioneer and follower axons using distinct signals. Pioneer sublateral neurons, with unique growth properties, anatomy, and innervation, cooperate with glia to mediate follower-axon guidance. We further identify a Chimaerin (CHIN-1)– Furin (KPC-1) double-mutant that severely disrupts assembly. CHIN-1 and KPC-1 function noncanonically, in glia and pioneer neurons, for guidance-cue trafficking. We exploit this bottleneck to define roles for glial Netrin and Semaphorin in pioneer- and follower-axon guidance, respectively, and for glial and pioneer-neuron Flamingo (CELSR) in follower-axon navigation. Taken together, our studies reveal previously undescribed glial roles in pioneer-axon guidance, suggesting conserved principles of brain assembly."

However, less is known about whether hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has effect on liver fibrosis. Here, we report that HBV leads to liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis through miR-30e targeting P4HA2. HBV transgenic mouse was treated by CCl4 to generate a model of liver fibrosis. A crucial enzyme catalyzing collagen formation, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit α2 (P4HA2) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting or quantitative reverse transcription–PCR analysis. The function of HBV-modulated P4HA2 in hepatoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo was analyzed by EdU, MTT, colony-forming assay and animal transplantation assay. HBV transgenic mice exhibited more collagen deposition in liver after intraperitoneal injection of CCl4. P4HA2 was dramatically augmented in liver samples of HBV transgenic mice, clinical liver cirrhosis and liver cancer patients. Mechanistically, HBx was capable of inducing P4HA2 through suppressing miR-30e, in which miR-30e could target P4HA2 mRNA 3' untranslated region in liver cancer cells. HBx inhibited the miR-30e expression through increasing methylation of CpG islands in its promoter mediated by EZH2-formed complexes. Functionally, HBx-elevated P4HA2 enhanced the collagen deposition in the liver in vivo and in vitro, leading to liver fibrosis and liver cancer progression. In conclusion, HBx promotes the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma through miR-30e targeting P4HA2 mRNA. We provide novel perspective on how HBx induces liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2747795314,"Angptl4 (Angiopoietin-like 4) is a circulating protein secreted by white and brown adipose tissues and the liver. Structurally, Angptl4 contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain (CCD) connected to a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (FLD) via a cleavable linker, and both full-length Angptl4 and its individual domains circulate in the bloodstream. Angptl4 inhibits extracellular lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and stimulates the lipolysis of triacylglycerol stored by adipocytes in the white adipose tissue (WAT). The former activity is furnished by the CCD, but the Angptl4 domain responsible for stimulating adipocyte lipolysis is unknown. We show here that the purified FLD of Angptl4 is sufficient to stimulate lipolysis in mouse primary adipocytes and that increasing circulating FLD levels in mice through adenovirus-mediated overexpression (Ad-FLD) not only induces WAT lipolysis in vivo but also reduces diet-induced obesity without affecting LPL activity. Intriguingly, reduced adiposity in Ad-FLD mice was associated with increased oxygen consumption, fat utilization, and the expression of thermogenic genes (Ucp1 and Ppargc1a) in subcutaneous WAT. Moreover, Ad-FLD mice exhibited increased glucose tolerance. Chronically enhancing WAT lipolysis could produce ectopic steatosis because of an overflow of lipids from the WAT to peripheral tissues; however, this did not occur when Ad-FLD mice were fed a high-fat diet. Rather, these mice had reductions in both circulating triacylglycerol levels and the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes in the liver and skeletal muscle. We conclude that separating the FLD from the CCD-mediated LPL-inhibitory activity of full-length Angptl4 reveals lipolytic and thermogenic properties with therapeutic relevance to obesity and diabetes."

Earlier studies have demonstrated that recognition of the ESX substrates by the cognate ESX machinery is mediated through a YXXXD/E secretion signal motif and a WXG motif, which is present in many ESX substrates, including PE–PPE proteins, WxG100 family proteins, and some Esp proteins. However, this signal motif does not define the specificity of secretion system (23Daleke M.H. Ummels R. Bawono P. Heringa J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Luirink J. Bitter W.

Recently, the crystal structure of the ESX-5–encoded chaperone EspG5 in complex with PE25–PPE41 was solved to reveal the molecular determinants of PPE secretion through specific binding with EspGs (25Korotkova N.

Current predictions suggest that ∼95% of PPE proteins in Mtb interact with EspG5 and are secreted by the ESX-5 secretion system. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that pe/ppe genes co-evolved with esx loci and underwent specific gene expansion (20Bottai D. Brosch R.

Biol. 2006; 6: 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For ESX-5, three duplicated gene clusters (ESX-5a, ESX-5b, and ESX-5c) are located distal to the ESX-5 region in the Mtb genome (28Shah S. Briken V. Modular organization of the ESX-5 secretion system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2016; 6: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the functions of these clusters, ESX-5a, which encodes two ESX proteins and PE8 and PPE15, is considered an accessory to the parental ESX-5 export apparatus and is responsible for the secretion of a subset of PE–PPE proteins (29Shah S. Cannon J.R. Fenselau C. Briken V. A duplicated ESAT-6 region of ESX-5 is involved in protein export and virulence of mycobacteria.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83: 4349-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Up-to-date structural data of the PE–PPE protein complex are scarce, mainly because of difficulties associated with PE–PPE protein expression and purification (8Strong M. Sawaya M.R. Wang S. Phillips M. Cascio D. Eisenberg D. Toward the structural genomics of complexes: crystal structure of a PE/PPE protein complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8060-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). For example, individually expressed PEs and PPEs are highly insoluble. The only available relevant crystallographic structure of a PE–PPE pair was initially published more than 10 years ago to describe PE25–PPE41 (8Strong M. Sawaya M.R. Wang S. Phillips M. Cascio D. Eisenberg D. Toward the structural genomics of complexes: crystal structure of a PE/PPE protein complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8060-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), However, the atomic details of other PE–PPE pairs are essential to a better understanding of the distinct protein repertoire required for Mtb infection and pathogenesis. Here, we report the molecular interaction of a novel PE–PPE pair, PE8–PPE15, which is located within ESX-5a and is phylogenetically distinct from PE25–PPE41. A structural comparison with EspG5–PPE41 reveals that the EspG5-binding interface on PPE15 is relatively conserved than EspG5–PPE41, suggesting that the EspG5–PPE15 structure could represent a typical model for EspG5–PPE interactions. Our structure also highlights the structural flexibility induced by the highly conserved prolines and glycines present in the four helix bundle of the PE–PPE complex. Using a homology model of three other PE–PPE pairs and mutagenesis analysis, we identify the molecular determinants of specific PE–PPE recognition. Previous bioinformatics analyses predicted the interaction of PE8 (Rv1040c) with PPE15 (Rv1039c) (6Riley R. Pellegrini M. Eisenberg D.

Here, our team used yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays to validate the direct interaction of these proteins. Because full-length PE8 and PPE15 are highly insoluble, truncated fragments were constructed to improve solubility and define the minimum binding regions (supplemental Fig. S1a). Our results showed that the N-terminal domains of PE8 (residues 1–99) and PPE15 (residues 1–194) are necessary for PE8–PPE15 complex formation. Subsequently, PE81–99 and PPE151–194 were co-expressed and co-purified with the intent to obtain a sufficient sample for structural analysis. However, the protein complex was prone to aggregation at high concentrations, and crystallization trials using this recombinant material failed to yield well-diffracting crystals. To improve the solubility and stability of the protein complex, we included EspG5, which has been reported as a specific chaperone for PE–PPE proteins (30Daleke M.H. van der Woude A.D. Parret A.H. Ummels R. de Groot A.M. Watson D. Piersma S.R. Jiménez C.R. Luirink J. Bitter W. Houben E.N. Specific chaperones for the type VII protein secretion pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 31939-31947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in the co-purification experiment. Because pe8 and ppe15 are located within the ESX-5a duplicated gene cluster, we hypothesized that EspG5 might interact with the PE8–PPE15 pair. We confirmed the binding of EspG5 to PE81–99–PPE151–194 using a pulldown assay (supplemental Fig. S1b) and further purified this ternary complex to a high level of homogeneity (Fig. 1a). The results of sedimentation velocity and static light scattering experiments yielded a molecular mass of 65–66 kDa for the EspG5–PE81–99–PPE151–194 complex, indicating that these three proteins exist in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1 (Fig. 1b and supplemental Fig. S2). The frictional ratio of 1.96, obtained through a sedimentation velocity analysis, also revealed that the protein complex forms an elongated shape in solution (Fig. 1b). The purified EspG5–PE81–99–PPE151–194 ternary complex was readily amenable to crystallization trials and yielded crystals that diffracted to a 2.9 Å resolution (Table 1). The structure was determined via molecular replacement as implemented in the program suite phenix.mr_rosetta, using the EspG5–PE25–PPE41 structure (PDB code 4W4L) as the search model. The electron density map was clearly defined throughout the structure, except for residues 85–99 in PE8 and residues 174–194 in PPE15, in line with a secondary structure prediction by Phyre2 (31Kelley L.A. Mezulis S. Yates C.M. Wass M.N. Sternberg M.J. The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar), suggesting that these regions are highly disordered. This disordered region of PE8 includes the YXXXD/E secretion motif. The final structure contained residues 7–299 of EspG5, residues 7–84 of PE8, and residues 1–173 of PPE15. The overall structure of EspG5–PE81–99–PPE151–194 is similar to the previously reported structure of EspG5–PE25–PPE41 (Fig. 1c) (25Korotkova N. Freire D. Phan T.H. Ummels R. Creekmore C.C. Evans T.J.

EspG5 interacts exclusively with helices α4 and α5 of PPE15 at the opposite end of the PE81–99–PPE151–194heterodimer, and no direct contact between EspG5 and PE81–99 was observed (Fig. 1, c and d). PE8 comprises two helices that interact with helices α1, α2, α3, and α5 of PPE15 to form a four-helix bundle. Structural comparisons between EspG5–PPE15 and EspG5–PPE41 and between PE8–PPE15 and PE25–PPE41 will be discussed in detail in later sections.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsEspG5–PE81–99–PPE151–194 (PDB code 5XFS)Data collection Space groupP212121 Cell dimensions a (Å)54.74 b (Å)69.96 c (Å)203.55 α (°)90 β (°)90 γ (°)90 Resolution (Å)29.60–2.90 (3.08–2.90)aThe values given in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.

Struct.

Major structural differences lie on a short helix α1, extended α1–α2 loop and helix α2 in the PE domain of EspB, and a short α6–α7 loop for EspG binding in the PPE domain of EspB. We also compared the YXXXD/E secretion motif located in the C terminus of PE domain and the WXG motif in the helix-turn-helix region of PPE domain in PE8–PPE15, PE25–PPE41, and EspB (supplemental Fig. S3b). In the PE25–PPE41 and EspB structures, the YXXXD/E motif and the WXG motif are in close proximity, allowing van der Waals contact between Tyr87PE25 and Trp56PPE41, and a hydrogen bond formation between Tyr78EspB and Trp181EspB. Interestingly, the electron density for the 87YXXXE91 motif in PE8 cannot be seen, and the side chain of Trp57 in the WXG motif of PPE15 is flipped away from the PE–PPE–binding interface. Although our current structure only contains the PE–PPE domain of PE8–PPE15, it is difficult to predict the orientation of the 87YXXXE91 motif, which is located in the linker region before the C-terminal 184 residues of the full-length PE8. It is likely that Tyr87PE8 is in a flexible state, and its interaction with Trp57PPE15, if it exists, is distinct from that in PE25–PPE41 and EspB. However, the functional significance of these variations in ESX secretion needs further investigation. A PDBsum (34Laskowski R.A. PDBsum: summaries and analyses of PDB structures.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) analysis of the crystal structure of EspG5–PE81–99–PPE151–194 showed that the contact surface between EspG5 and PPE15 measured ∼2654 Å, with an interface comprising 23 residues from EspG5 and 21 residues from PPE15. The interaction mainly involves helix α1′, the central β-sheet, the α1–α2 loop, and the β2–β3 loop of EspG5 and helices α4 and α5 of PPE15 (Fig. 2a). On PPE15, the main EspG5 contact regions are localized in helices α4 and α5, which contain residues 121–152. We further divided the binding interface of EspG5–PPE15 into three patches for comparison with the EspG5–PPE41 complex (Fig. 2, b and c). The first patch included residues Val121, Asn124, Thr130, and Trp144 from PPE15, which interact with the β2–β3 loop in EspG5. The molecular interactions in this patch are mediated by a hydrogen bond formation between Asn124PPE15 and Tyr96EspG5 and by hydrophobic contacts of Val121PPE15 with Val98EspG5 and Trp144PPE15 with Arg109EspG5. An identified intramolecular hydrogen bond between Thr130 and Asn124 in PPE15 likely stabilizes the helix-turn-helix tip of PPE15 (supplemental Fig. S4a). Residues in this interaction patch are highly conserved among the Mtb PPE proteins, including PPE41. The second interface patch is generated by the insertion of the helix-turn-helix tip of PPE15 into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the α1′-helix and central β-sheet of EspG5. Specifically, this patch comprises Val125, Leu126, Ile128, and Pro131 of PPE15 and Leu180, Leu216, Leu237, and Val241 of EspG5 (supplemental Fig. S4, b and c). Although the majority of PPE proteins adopt hydrophobic residues at residues equivalent to 125, 126, and 131 in PPE15, PPE41 contains a glutamine residue in the position equivalent to residue 128 in PPE15. Gln127 in PPE41 forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Gln256 and the main chain atoms of Val241 in EspG5, suggesting a relatively stronger interaction between PPE41 and EspG5. Nevertheless, interface patches 1 and 2 appear to be common among EspG5–PPE complexes. The third binding interface patch includes interactions between the α5 helix of PPE15 and residues from the α1–α2 loop of EspG5. Interestingly, a comparison of the interactions in EspG5–PPE15 and EspG5–PPE41 revealed different binding modes in this patch. Specifically, in PPE15, this patch is rich in hydrophobic residues such as Met134, Ala138, Ala141, Ala148, Leu149, and Tyr152 and contains only one salt bridge, Glu137PPE15::Arg34EspG5 (supplemental Fig. S4d). By contrast, PPE41 in this patch contains a stretch of charged residues, as well as four salt bridges: Asp140PPE41::Arg109EspG5, Asp144PPE41::Arg27EspG5, Glu148PPE41::Arg27EspG5, and Arg154PPE41::Asp42EspG5. A sequence conservation analysis (Fig. 2c) reveals that apart from residue 141, many PPE proteins, including PPE15, carry hydrophobic residues in patch 3. This strongly suggests that the atomic structure of EspG5–PPE15 determined herein represents a typical model for EspG5–PPE interactions. Because patch 3 accounts for almost 50% of the total interface area, the binding affinity of EspG5–PPE41 is likely stronger relative to that of other EspG5–PPE proteins. We further analyzed the binding kinetics of EspG5 to PE81–99–PPE151–194 and EspG5 to PE25–PPE41 using microscale thermophoresis (Fig. 2d). The calculated dissociation constants of EspG5/PE81–99–PPE151–194 is 132 nm, whereas that of EspG5/PE25–PPE41 is 51 nm, indicating that EspG5–PPE15 or most EspG5–PPE proteins have a slightly weaker binding affinity than EspG5–PPE41. Although PE81–99–PPE151–194 and PE25–PPE41 exhibit very similar folding characteristics, pronounced bending was observed in the four-helix bundle distal from the EspG5-binding area (Fig. 3a and supplemental Fig. S5). Specifically, the helical pairs α1 and α2 in PE8 and α2 and α3 in PPE15 are tilted by ∼26–29 and 20–23°, respectively, leading to dramatic shifts in the helical directions (Fig. 3b). In these four tilted helices, the kinks start at similar longitudinal positions and are facilitated by either a proline (Pro35PE8, Pro71PPE15) or a glycine residue (Gly59PE8, Gly39PPE15). In PE8 and PPE15, various highly conserved alanine residues are found proximal to the kinks, thus further promoting helical bending (Fig. 3c). It is noted that the α2 helix of PPE15 also contains two other highly conserved glycine residues (Gly22 and Gly33) that might also contribute to conformational changes. It is likely that the co-existing kinks in the helical pairs of PE8 and PPE15 is a cooperative effect that allows these two PE and PPE proteins to carry the same extent of helical bending for interaction. The presence of numerous highly conserved proline, glycine, and alanine residues in helices α1–α2 of PE and in helices α2–α3 of PPE proteins suggest that these helices may display different degrees of helical bending required for specific PE–PPE pair formation. As in PE25–PPE41, PE81–99–PPE151–194 complex formation is mediated by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Both complexes contain a hydrogen bond (Ser48 in the α2 helix of PE8 interacts with Tyr154 in the α5 helix of PPE15), and the interior of the four-helix bundle is lined with multiple hydrophobic contacts. However, distinct salt bridges and hydrogen bonds are found at the upper and lower areas of the PE81–99–PPE151–194 complex. We identified four sites in PE8–PPE15 interactions and further validated their importance using mutagenesis and pulldown assays (Fig. 4, a and b). These four sites include a salt bridge (Glu46PE8::Arg14PPE15) and three hydrogen bonds (Gln51PE8–Ser93PPE15, His73PE8–Tyr45PPE15, and Gln70PE8–Tyr72PPE15). Single alanine substitutions of the Arg14, Ser93, Tyr45, and Tyr72 residues in full-length PPE15 significantly red"

Though the signal-to-noise ratio is still inferior to electrophysiology, this proof of concept demonstrates the potential to exploit the fundamental advantages of magnetophysiology. Neuronal activity entails ionic flows across the cell membrane and along dendrites. This electrical activity can be measured extra-cellularly or intra-cellularly by microelectrodes (Kandel et al., 2000Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles of Neural Science.Fourth Edition. McGraw-Hill, Health Professions Division, 2000Google Scholar), which are either thin metallic micro-wires, or glass pipettes containing an ionic solution, to realize a conductive interface between the local brain tissue and the recording instrumentation. Intracellular recordings directly reveal the transmembrane voltage or current of an isolated neuron, but intracellular recordings in vivo are difficult in practice and often only brief measurements of single neurons are feasible. Extracellular recordings, on the other hand, measure the aggregate fluctuations in voltage arising from the net neuronal activity around the electrode’s tip, with respect to a reference electrode (Buzsáki et al., 2012Buzsáki G.

Microelectrodes inside the neuropil record action potentials and local field potentials (LFPs), electrocorticographic electrodes provide mesoscopic LFPs, and scalp electrodes deliver the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. Combining many electrodes into planar (Maynard et al., 1997Maynard E.M. Nordhausen C.T. Normann R.A.

Large-scale recording of neuronal ensembles.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The electric currents flowing through the active neuropil also give rise to a magnetic signature. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) (Cohen, 1968Cohen D.

This technique uses Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) cooled down to the temperature of liquid helium (4.2 K). The apparatus necessary for this cooling imposes a distance to the cortical surface of 3 to 5 cm in in vivo configurations. The spatial resolution is typically better than for EEG recordings, but even under optimal conditions still lies in the order of several mm3, with signal amplitudes in the femtotesla (10−15T) to picotesla (10−12T) range. Local magnetic recordings of neuronal activity could be a complementary technique to electrophysiology, because the magnetic signal provides interesting properties in addition to those realized by the electric signal. Contrary to electric fields, which strongly depend on the dielectric properties of the tissue between neuronal sources and the recording electrode, magnetic fields travel through tissue without distortion, because the respective permeability is essentially the same as free space (Barnes and Greenebaum, 2007Barnes F.S. Greenebaum B. Handbook of Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields. Biological and Medical Aspects of Electromagnetic Fields.Third Edition. CRC Press, 2007Google Scholar). Therefore, magnetic fields are only attenuated by the distance to the current source. Ionic flows and the corresponding magnetic fields are likely largest inside neurons. As those magnetic fields pass through the cell membrane without attenuation, extracellular magnetic field measurements might provide functionally intracellular measurements without impaling the neuron. Moreover, while electrophysiological recordings yield scalar values, local magnetic recordings yield information about both amplitude and direction of current sources. Thereby, they might allow the precise localization of the source of neuronal activity at a given moment in time in the 3D volume of the brain. Furthermore, electrodes always measure the electric potential relative to a reference electrode, and the position and type of reference can substantially influence the measured signal. Moreover, in multi-electrode recordings, all channels typically share the same reference, which poses a problem for analyses of functional connectivity, because the resulting signals are not independent. Magnetrodes, presented in this work, provide an elegant solution, because the recorded magnetic signals are reference-free, and therefore allow for an unbiased measure of connectivity and information flow throughout the brain. In addition, these magnetrodes can be used to perform magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Guitard et al., 2016Guitard P.A. Ayde R. Jasmin-Lebras G. Caruso L. Pannetier-Lecoeur M. Fermon C. Local nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with giant magnetic resistance-based sensors.Appl. Phys. Lett. 2016; 108: 212405Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In order to minimize tissue damages, magnetic probes for insertion into the brain require a needle shape and the miniaturization of the magnetic sensors, while maintaining a very high sensitivity at physiological temperature. Approaches to record the magnetic biological signal closer to the sources than MEG have been successfully realized by using small SQUIDs (Magnelind, 2006Magnelind, P. (2006).

However, limitations due to the millimeter size of the sensors or to its operating conditions never allowed penetration into the neuropil or recording at distances of merely tens of microns from active cells. Spin electronics (Baibich et al., 1988Baibich M.N. Broto J.M. Fert A. Nguyen Van Dau F. Petroff F. Etienne P. Creuzet G. Friederich A. Chazelas J.

The sensors have been electrically insulated by a dielectric bilayer of Si3N4/Al2O3. We refer to these probes as “magnetrodes,” for a magnetic equivalent of electrodes (see STAR Methods for details of manufacturing and characterization). GMR sensors are magnetic-field-dependent resistors. To measure magnetic field strength, we applied an input voltage to the GMR and recorded the output voltage (Figure S1). The GMR output voltage varies sigmoidally as a function of the in-plane component of the magnetic field (Figure 1B). The sensor is configured such that very weak magnetic fields, around zero, result in outputs constrained to the steep linear part of the curve, thereby maximizing the dynamic range in the region of interest. In the linear part, the slope is 1.8%/mT, corresponding to a sensitivity of 10 to 25 Voltout/(VoltinxTesla). The noise spectrum at a typical input voltage of 0.5 V leads to sensitivities of 7 nT/√Hz at 10 Hz, 2 nT/√Hz at 100 Hz and 370 pT/√Hz in the thermal noise regime above 1 kHz (Figure 1C). We performed in vivo recordings in primary visual cortex of anesthetized cats (see STAR Methods). Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the experimental setup. A magnetrode was inserted into the tissue to a depth of less than 1 mm from the cortical surface using micromanipulators under microscope inspection. The magnetrode was sensitive to fields orthogonal to the tip, that is, parallel to the cortical surface. A tungsten electrode was targeted to be less than 1 mm from the magnetrode, to simultaneously obtain an independent electric recording. Recordings were performed without shielding. To physiologically activate the recorded brain area, we presented a flash of light directly to one eye of the cat. The duration of light stimulation was either 100 ms or 500 ms, with a variable inter-stimulus interval of 0.9 to 1.5 s to avoid adaptation or entrainment. The stimulus was presented 1,000 times. The output signals from the tungsten electrode and the magnetrode were preprocessed and averaged with respect to stimulus onset, to calculate the event-related potential (ERP) for the electrode and the event-related field (ERF) for the magnetrode (see STAR Methods). We estimated the field strength that we could expect, when recording magnetic fields inside the neuropil. As a starting point, we used the well-established magnetic fields recorded with MEG. When MEG signals are recorded from human subjects presented with visual stimuli, ERFs can be obtained with typical amplitudes in the range of 50 fT (Salmelin et al., 1994Salmelin R. Hari R. Lounasmaa O.V. Sams M. Dynamics of brain activation during picture naming.Nature. 1994; 368: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For these MEG sensor-level field strengths, detailed models of the underlying sources estimate dipole strengths in the range of 10 nA∗m (Hämäläinen et al., 1993Hämäläinen M. Hari R. Ilmoniemi R.J.

Contributions of principal neocortical neurons to magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography signals.J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We constructed a model of an ensemble of neurons, which can produce such dipole strength, to then calculate the field strengths expected for magnetrode measurements very near or inside this neuronal ensemble. We simulated a square array of 10,000 aligned neurons with a mean center-to-center separation of 5 μm. In each neuron, a current was simulated, such that the ensemble of neurons appeared as a dipole of 10 nA∗m, when recorded from a large distance. The corresponding difference in electric potentials was simulated to occur over a distance of 200 μm. This distance was estimated from current-source density measurements in cat visual cortex in response to visual stimuli (Mitzdorf, 1985Mitzdorf U. Current source-density method and application in cat cerebral cortex: investigation of evoked potentials and EEG phenomena.Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 37-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The currents in the neuronal ensemble gave rise to a magnetic signal of 50 fT at a distance of 6 cm, 800 fT at 1.5 cm, 126 pT at 1 mm, 1.3 nT at 100 μm, and 2.3 nT inside the neuronal ensemble. Thus, these simulations predict that magnetic field measurements within or in close proximity to the activated neurons will give ERFs in the range of a few nano-Tesla. When magnetrodes are introduced into the neuropil, they might face direct capacitive coupling to electric currents flowing in the neuropil. Therefore, we developed a measurement scheme that suppressed this capacitive coupling. In this scheme, the GMR sensors were fed with alternating current (AC, Figure S2) with frequencies in the range of 20–80 kHz, and the sensor output was demodulated separately for components that were in-phase with the AC modulation and those that were out-of-phase. The currents fed to the GMR during the AC measurement scheme are not expected to directly influence neurons in the vicinity of the magnetrode. We estimated, for a typical AC current, the resulting magnetic and electric field intensities induced in the neuropil, and they were several orders of magnitude below thresholds for neuronal stimulation (see STAR Methods). We used two phantoms, one to generate purely magnetic fields, and another one to generate purely electric fields. When the input to the GMR was a time-varying magnetic field, the GMR output reflected this almost purely on the in-phase component (Figure 3A). By contrast, when the input to the GMR was a time-varying electric field, the GMR output reflected this primarily at higher frequencies and then primarily in the out-of-phase component (Figure 3B). Electric fields also induced a small in-phase component, presumably due to a mixing in the silicon substrate. The phantom measurements provided GMR in-phase and out-of-phase outputs for all physiologically relevant frequencies of electric or magnetic field input. Thereby, they provided a transfer function for electric fields and a transfer function for magnetic fields. In order to estimate contamination from electric field in vivo, we used the ERP recorded in one session (cat 2B) and convolved it with the transfer function estimated for electric fields in the phantom measurements. This provided an estimate of the GMR output that would be expected if the input were purely an electric field with the waveform of an ERP (Figure 4A). In this case, the GMR out-of-phase component (green line) was larger than the in-phase component (red line). Subsequently, we convolved the same ERP waveform with the transfer function for magnetic fields. This provided an estimate of the GMR output that would be expected if the input were purely a magnetic field with the waveform of an ERP (Figure 4B). In this case, the in-phase component (red line) was substantially larger than the out-of-phase component (green line). We used the ERP waveform for both simulations, to aid direct comparison and to avoid circularity, when we compare, in the next step, the simulated GMR outputs to the experimentally observed GMR output. The observed GMR output (Figure 4C) showed a substantially larger in-phase component (red line) than out-of-phase component (green line). This pattern corresponds to the pattern estimated for magnetic field input (Figure 4B), which suggests that the GMR output is mainly determined by the neuronally generated magnetic fields. The magnetic field input is primarily reflected by the in-phase component of the GMR output. Therefore, in the following, we refer to the in-phase component of the GMR output as ERFs, and we compare them to the ERPs recorded simultaneously through the tungsten electrode. Figure 5A shows the ERF and Figure 5B the simultaneously recorded ERP for the recording in the first animal (cat 1) with a visual stimulus duration of 100 ms. Figure 5C shows a magnification of the data with the ERF (red) and ERP (green) scaled and superimposed to facilitate comparison. The ERF showed a magnetic response starting 20 ms after stimulus onset, corresponding to the conduction delay between the retina and the primary visual cortex. The ERF was characterized by a strong negative component at 36 ms and a positive peak around 61 ms. The peak-to-peak amplitude was 2.5 nT. The onset of the ERP was comparable to the magnetic one, with a trough at slightly shorter latency and a peak at similar latency as the magnetic signal. Figure 5D shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between ERF and ERP as a function of time lag, with positive lag values indicating that the ERF lagged the ERP. The correlation function peaked at a value of approximately 0.55, for a lag of approximately 2 ms. The side peaks and troughs are due to the partially rhythmic nature of the ERP and ERF. Similar results were obtained in two separate recordings from another animal (cat 2A and cat 2B). Figures 5E–5H shows the results for one recording site and a visual stimulus duration of 100 ms. Figures 5I–5L present the data from another recording site later in the experiment, with a visual stimulus duration of 500 ms. With the longer stimulus duration, the on and off responses were clearly separated, as evident in the magnetic and electric recordings. The signal amplitude of the magnetic (and of the electric) recordings was larger in cat 2, with peak-to-peak amplitudes of approximately 10 nT. Similar to cat 1, the electric signal had a shorter latency than the magnetic signal, but in cat 2 the difference was only a few milliseconds. The cross-correlation functions between the ERFs and ERPs of cat 2 showed peak values around 0.85 at a lag of 2–3 ms. To further characterize the magnetic responses, we determined two metrics of signal quality. In a first approach, we calculated a simple metric of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), based on the mean squared ERF or ERP (see STAR Methods for details). When this SNR was determined for ERFs based on averaging all 1,000 trials, it reached values between 12 and 17 (Figure 6A). When ERFs were based on averaging increasing numbers of trials, they reached significance at 229, 103, and 95 trials, for recording sessions cat 1, cat 2A, and cat 2B, respectively (Figure 6B; bootstrap test, see STAR Methods). For ERPs, it reached maximal values between 30 and 36 and was significant for single trials (Figure 6C). While the SNR metric is simple, it is not very sensitive. Therefore, in a second approach, we quantified how many trials had to be averaged for the ERF or ERP to assume its final shape. We first selected a random half of all trials to calculate a template shape. We then averaged increasing numbers of the remaining trials and calculated the correlation between the resulting shapes and the template shape. When the correlation was determined for ERFs based on averaging all remaining 500 trials, it reached values between 0.92 and 0.97. The correlation reached significance for 31, 18, and 16 trials, for recording sessions cat 1, cat 2A, and cat 2B, respectively (Figure 6E; bootstrap test, see STAR Methods). For ERPs, it reached maximal values of 0.99 and was significant for single trials (Figure 6F). In summary, we have shown that magnetrodes based on spin electronics can be used to record in vivo magnetic signals originating from neuronal activity. This was possible, because GMR sensors combine a small size of a few tens of microns with sufficient magnetic field sensitivity. Magnetic field recordings inside the tissue offer unique opportunities, because they are reference free, they measure the direction of magnetic fields and thereby of the underlying (intracellular) current flows, and because these magnetic fields are not smeared by intervening neuropil. In vivo magnetic field measurements might contribute to a better understanding of the commonly recorded extracranial MEG signal. There are also efforts to record neuronally generated magnetic fields by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Bandettini et al., 2005Bandettini P.A. Petridou N. Bodurka J. Direct detection of neuronal activity with MRI: Fantasy, possibility, or reality?.Appl. Magn. Reson. 2005; 29: 65-88Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Körber et al., 2013Körber R. Nieminen J.O. Höfner N. Jazbinšek V. Scheer H.J. Kim K. Burghoff M. An advanced phantom study assessing the feasibility of neuronal current imaging by ultra-low-field NMR.J. Magn. Reson. 2013; 237: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and our magnetrode recordings provide ground-truth measurements for this. We would like to highlight the potential utility of GMR-based sensing of neuronal activity for recordings from untethered implanted devices. Implanted recording probes play an important role in many neurotechnological scenarios. Untethered probes are particularly intriguing, as they avoid connection wires and corresponding limitations (Seo et al., 2016Seo D. Neely R.M. Shen K. Singhal U. Alon E. Rabaey J.M. Carmena J.M. Maharbiz M.M. Wireless recording in the peripheral nervous system with ultrasonic neural dust.Neuron. 2016; 91: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Yet, for untethered probes to be maximally useful, they need to be tiny, and this results in a fundamental problem for electrical recordings. Electrical recordings require two electrochemical interfaces with sufficient distance, such that the electrical potential difference does not become vanishingly small. The necessary distance restricts the size to which untethered devices based on electric recordings can be reduced. Magnetic field recordings do not suffer from this problem, because they require merely a singular GMR. Thus, magnetrode-based untethered recordings, while challenging, might provide a unique combination of recording and transmitting modalities for future neurotechnology. We revealed visually evoked magnetic fields by averaging over multiple stimulus repetitions. This was possible, because the underlying postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are long lasting compared to their temporal jitter across trials. Thereby, PSPs temporally superimpose in the cross-trial average. This holds not only for PSPs of one postsynaptic neuron, but for PSPs of many neurons in the vicinity of the magnetrode. Thus, the ERF became detectable due to effective summation of the PSP-related magnetic fields across neurons and across trials. ERFs in the different recording sites reached significance after averaging 16–31 trials (Figure 6E). Thus, moderate improvements in sensitivity and shielding will likely enable detection of ERFs on single trials. If the detection of single-trial ERFs will succeed, also the detection of magnetic fields corresponding to single action potentials (APs) appears realistic. AP amplitudes, when recorded with electrodes close to the cell body, substantially exceed ERP amplitudes. This is likely due to the fact that each AP reflects massive transmembrane currents that move the transmembrane voltage across the cell body from −60 mV to +30 mV. Whether these strong currents generate detectable magnetic fields crucially depends on their spatial symmetry and temporal simultaneity. If all involved currents flew simultaneously and with spherical symmetry, they would generate no detectable magnetic field. However, it is known that APs emerge in the axon hillock and retrogradely invade the cell body and sometimes the dendrites (McCormick et al., 2007McCormick D.A. Shu Y. Yu Y. Neurophysiology: Hodgkin and Huxley model–still standing?.Nature. 2007; 445 (E1-2; discussion E2-3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Stuart et al., 1997Stuart G. Spruston N. Sakmann B. Häusser M. Action potential initiation and backpropagation in neurons of the mammalian CNS.Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 125-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Thus, APs are likely magnetically visible. Single extracellular metal microelectrodes typically record spikes from merely a handful of neurons, because insulating cell membranes isolate them from the hundreds of neurons in their immediate vicinity (Buzsáki, 2004Buzsáki G. Large-scale recording of neuronal ensembles.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Magnetic fields corresponding to action potentials, that is “action fields” or AFs, should travel from neurons to the magnetrode without attenuation. This might enable AF recordings from tens or even hundreds of neurons from the vicinity of the magnetrode. The separation of spikes originating from these many neurons would be a challenge. Electrophysiological recordings allow separation of a handful of spikes, based on the relatively stereotypical spike waveform of a given neuron and the fact that millisecond-precise spike coincidences of neighboring neurons occur with a very low probability of 0.01–0.001 (Jia et al., 2013Jia X.

Smith M.A. Stimulus dependence of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex of the macaque.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3661-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Magnetic recordings would be able to benefit from the same factors, and in addition from the vectorial nature of magnetic sources and the corresponding vectorial sensitivity of the sensors. Sensors specific for the three spatial dimensions could be combined on a single magnetrode to estimate the 3D position of each neuronal source relative to the magnetrode. Importantly, the magnetrode as presented here, without further modifications or improvements, can provide useful ERF measurements even in an unshielded environment after averaging over merely 16–31 stimulus repetitions. These values are similar to the number of 30 stimulus repetitions, which has been estimated as the minimum to obtain a consistent visually evoked ERP from human EEG recordings (Thigpen et al., 2017Thigpen N.N.

We recently showed that CML LSCs depend on Tcf1 and Lef1 factors for self-renewal. Using a connectivity map, we identified prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) as a small molecule that partly elicited the gene expression changes in LSCs caused by Tcf1/Lef1 deficiency. Although it has little impact on normal hematopoiesis, we found that PGE1 treatment impaired the persistence and activity of LSCs in a pre-clinical murine CML model and a xenograft model of transplanted CML patient CD34+ stem/progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PGE1 acted on the EP4 receptor and repressed Fosb and Fos AP-1 factors in a β-catenin-independent manner. Misoprostol, an FDA-approved EP4 agonist, conferred similar protection against CML. These findings suggest that activation of this PGE1-EP4 pathway specifically targets CML LSCs and that the combination of PGE1/misoprostol with conventional tyrosine-kinase inhibitors could provide effective therapy for CML."

https://openalex.org/W2745643605,"Glycosylation changes associated with cellular transformation can facilitate the growth and progression of tumors. Previously we discovered that the gene Mgat3 encoding the glycosyltransferase GnT-III is elevated in epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs) and leads to the production of abnormal truncated N-linked glycan structures instead of the typical bisected forms. In this study, we are interested in discovering how these abnormal glycans impact the growth and progression of ovarian cancer. We have discovered using stable shRNA gene suppression that GnT-III expression controls the expansion of side-population cells, also known as cancer stem cells. More specifically, we found that GnT-III expression regulates the levels and activation of the heavily glycosylated Notch receptor involved in normal and malignant development. Suppression of GnT-III in EOC cell lines and primary tumor-derived cells resulted in an inhibition of Notch signaling that was more potent than pharmacologic blockage of Notch activation via γ-secretase inhibition. The inhibition resulted from the redirection of the Notch receptor to the lysosome, a novel mechanism. These findings demonstrate a new role for bisecting glycosylation in the control of Notch transport and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting GnT-III as a treatment for controlling EOC growth and recurrence. Glycosylation changes associated with cellular transformation can facilitate the growth and progression of tumors. Previously we discovered that the gene Mgat3 encoding the glycosyltransferase GnT-III is elevated in epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs) and leads to the production of abnormal truncated N-linked glycan structures instead of the typical bisected forms. In this study, we are interested in discovering how these abnormal glycans impact the growth and progression of ovarian cancer. We have discovered using stable shRNA gene suppression that GnT-III expression controls the expansion of side-population cells, also known as cancer stem cells. More specifically, we found that GnT-III expression regulates the levels and activation of the heavily glycosylated Notch receptor involved in normal and malignant development. Suppression of GnT-III in EOC cell lines and primary tumor-derived cells resulted in an inhibition of Notch signaling that was more potent than pharmacologic blockage of Notch activation via γ-secretase inhibition. The inhibition resulted from the redirection of the Notch receptor to the lysosome, a novel mechanism. These findings demonstrate a new role for bisecting glycosylation in the control of Notch transport and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting GnT-III as a treatment for controlling EOC growth and recurrence. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) 3The abbreviations used are: EOCepithelial ovarian carcinomaE-PHAphaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutininCSCcancer stem cellSPside-populationNICDNotch intracellular domainOSoverall survivalPFSprogression-free survival. is the second most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States and is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women with over 14,000 deaths reported each year (1Siegel R.

Among the histological subtypes of EOC, serous ovarian cancer is the most prevalent subtype and accounts for the majority of deaths (2McCluggage W.G.

Although the war on cancer has led to improved survival rates for certain cancers, survival rates for ovarian cancer patients have not shown much improvement over a 30-year period (1Siegel R. Ma J.

Over 80% of the cell membrane is composed of glycoconjugates such as glycolipids and glycoproteins. Previously, we discovered that a specific glycosyltransferase known as GnT-III is up-regulated in the two most prevalent subtypes of EOC, serous and endometrioid (3Abbott K.L. Nairn A.V. Hall E.M.

GnT-III transfers a β1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine to the mannosyl core of N-linked glycans to produce a structure commonly referred to as a bisecting glycan (5Narasimhan S. Control of glycoprotein synthesis. UDP-GlcNAc:glycopeptide β 4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, an enzyme in hen oviduct which adds GlcNAc in β1–4 linkage to the β-linked mannose of the trimannosyl core of N-glycosyl oligosaccharides.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). The presence of bisecting glycans affects the overall conformation of the growing N-linked glycan in the Golgi and often suppresses further branching (6Schachter H. Biosynthetic controls that determine the branching and microheterogeneity of protein-bound oligosaccharides.Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We isolated N-linked glycans from membrane proteins that were enriched using the lectin E-PHA from primary serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinoma tissues and discovered a very unusual bisecting glycan structure that is not only missing further branching, it is also missing galactose capping and sialic acid extensions (4Allam H. Aoki K. Benigno B.B. McDonald J.F. Mackintosh S.G. Tiemeyer M. Abbott K.L.

Proteome Res. 2015; 14: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). The role of GnT-III expression and bisecting glycosylation has been variable in the literature. In breast cancer where the glycosyltransferase GnT-V dominates, the expression of GnT-III suppresses tumor burden. In fact, loss of heterozygosity in the chromosomal region where GnT-III is located, 22q13.1, correlates with breast cancer (7Iida A. Kurose K. Isobe R. Akiyama F. Sakamoto G. Yoshimoto M. Kasumi F.

However, in leukemia, GnT-III levels and bisecting glycans are increased and associated with blast crisis (9Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Nishiura T. Nakao H. Kanayama Y. Matuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. High expression of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: β-d mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) in chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis.Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell type and overall levels of different branching glycosyltransferases may play roles in determining the overall bisecting glycan structure and functional outcomes. In this study, we are assessing for the first time the role of GnT-III expression and bisecting glycosylation on the growth and progression of EOC. We report that GnT-III expression significantly increases ovarian cancer growth and metastasis and increases the expansion of the ovarian cancer stem cell (CSC) population. Furthermore, glycosylation mediated by GnT-III increases Notch receptor levels and activity. We find that suppression of GnT-III results in a relocation of Notch receptor to the lysosome, resulting in reduced Notch receptor levels and an impairment of γ-secretase–mediated activation. Our data provide insights into a novel molecular mechanism to inhibit the Notch pathway in EOC and cancers with elevated GnT-III expression. We have previously discovered that the glycosyltransferase known as GnT-III is elevated in primary ovarian carcinoma tissues leading to increased bisecting glycosylation on glycoproteins (3Abbott K.L. Nairn A.V. Hall E.M. Horton M.B. McDonald J.F. Moremen K.W. Dinulescu D.M. Pierce M.

Proteome Res. 2015; 14: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We find that Mgat3 transcript levels are elevated in 8 of 10 high grade ovarian carcinoma tumors relative to non-malignant ovary and non-malignant fallopian tube tissues (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1). Our previous glycoproteomic study led to the discovery that a number of proteins with bisecting glycosylation had potential roles in the Notch pathway (4Allam H. Aoki K. Benigno B.B. McDonald J.F. Mackintosh S.G. Tiemeyer M. Abbott K.L. Glycomic analysis of membrane glycoproteins with bisecting glycosylation from ovarian cancer tissues reveals novel structures and functions.J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have analyzed the levels of Notch receptors and find that 9 of the 10 high grade ovarian carcinoma tissues have elevated levels of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 compared with non-malignant ovarian tissue and fallopian tube tissue (Fig. 1B). We have used the multidimensional cancer genome browser cBioportal to analyze trends in mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence between NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and Mgat3 in the TCGA Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma database (10Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma.Nature. 2011; 474: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (5418) Google Scholar, 11Cerami E.

The prognostic value of GnT-III levels were evaluated in high grade serous and endometrioid ovarian carcinomas (Fig. 1, D and E). Survival data for patients indicate that patients with high GnT-III levels had significantly reduced overall survival (Fig. 1D) and progression-free survival (Fig. 1E) compared with patients with low GnT-III levels. The distribution of Mgat3 levels across patients is included in a bee-swarm plot (supplemental Fig. S1) Our previous glycoproteomic study suggests that glycoproteins that receive bisecting glycans in ovarian cancer participate in stem cell signaling pathways (4Allam H. Aoki K. Benigno B.B. McDonald J.F. Mackintosh S.G. Tiemeyer M. Abbott K.L.

Side-population (SP) cells have been demonstrated to be a source of CSCs and progenitor cells in several malignancies including ovarian cancer (12Zhang S. Balch C. Chan M.W. Lai H.C. Matei D.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11154-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). SP cells are isolated based on their ability to efflux the Hoechst 33342 fluorescent dye. To determine the effect of bisecting glycosylation on the SP cells, we measured the SP in OVCAR3 cells with stable expression of control (scrambled) short hairpin RNA (control shRNA) or short hairpin RNA targeting GnT-III (GnT-III shRNA). Stable suppression of GnT-III and rescue of this phenotype have been previously described (4Allam H. Aoki K. Benigno B.B. McDonald J.F. Mackintosh S.G. Tiemeyer M. Abbott K.L. Glycomic analysis of membrane glycoproteins with bisecting glycosylation from ovarian cancer tissues reveals novel structures and functions.J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In FACS experiments, we consistently observe (n = 3) a significant reduction in the percentage of SP cells in OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells (Fig. 2A) (0.52%) versus OVCAR3 control shRNA cells (1.54%). Previous studies have shown that ovarian cancer cell lines including OVCAR3 have sphere-forming and self-renewal ability when grown in stem cell-selective medium (14Wang L. Mezencev R. Bowen N.J. Matyunina L.V. McDonald J.F. Isolation and characterization of stem-like cells from a human ovarian cancer cell line.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2012; 363: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of GnT-III expression on sphere formation, we established stable expression of control and GnT-III shRNA in a patient-derived ovarian cancer cell line known as OVCA26. OVCA26 cells express significant levels of ALDH1 and CD133, two markers associated with cancer stem cell populations. OVCAR3 and OVCA26 cells expressing control shRNA demonstrate greater (p < 0.001) sphere-forming ability compared with GnT-III shRNA cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, GnT-III shRNA-expressing cells cluster together in irregularly shaped cell clumps compared with control shRNA cells. Serial passaging of the cells revealed that control cells maintain sphere-forming ability over multiple passages, whereas the number of cell aggregates formed in GnT-III shRNA cells were reduced in number and density after passage 3 (Fig. 2, C and D). The difference in spheroid densities can be observed as early as 24 h for OVCA26 and OVCAR3 GnT-III ShRNA cells (Fig. 2D). Based on these data, we investigated the molecular profile of the spheroids, focusing on genes important for stem cell renewal and expansion. The expression levels of Oct-4, Nanog, ABCB1, and Sox-2 were significantly decreased in OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells compared with OVCAR3 control shRNA cells (Fig. 2E). Similar results were obtained with OVCA26 cells (Fig. 2F). A xenograft model was used to examine the effect of GnT-III expression and bisecting glycosylation on tumor growth. OVCAR3 control shRNA cells displayed robust tumor initiation compared with OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells. Tumor growth was noticed in 6 of 6 animals at 8 weeks following injection of control cells, whereas only 3 of 6 mice injected with an equal number of GnT-III shRNA cells had tumors at 8 weeks (Fig. 3A, representative tumors). Control cell tumors were more invasive following i.p. injections (Fig. 3B, white arrows identify multiple masses in the peritoneum and mesentery), whereas GnT-III shRNA tumors were less vascularized (Fig. 3, A and D compare vessel number in control shRNA tumor (middle) with GnT-III shRNA tumor (right)) and never invaded surrounding tissues. The i.p. injections of control shRNA cells resulted in the development of bloody ascites in 3 of 4 mice with tumor latencies of 70–90 days (supplemental Fig. S2A), whereas the same number of GnT-III shRNA cells never resulted in bloody ascites (supplemental Fig. S3A). We also observed a significant increase in ovarian masses and metastasis (Fig. 3E) in control shRNA cells compared with GnT-III shRNA cells (p < 0.05) (supplemental Figs. S2B and 3B, respectively). Several of the glycoproteins that were previously identified in our glycoproteomic study have roles in the Notch signaling pathway (4Allam H. Aoki K. Benigno B.B. McDonald J.F. Mackintosh S.G. Tiemeyer M. Abbott K.L. Glycomic analysis of membrane glycoproteins with bisecting glycosylation from ovarian cancer tissues reveals novel structures and functions.J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Notch receptors have been shown to be important regulators of the ovarian CSC population (15McAuliffe S.M. Morgan S.L. Wyant G.A. Tran L.T. Muto K.W. Chen Y.S. Chin K.T. Partridge J.C. Poole B.B. Cheng K.H. Daggett Jr., J. Cullen K. Kantoff E. Hasselbatt K. Berkowitz J. et al.Targeting Notch, a key pathway for ovarian cancer stem cells, sensitizes tumors to platinum therapy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: E2939-E2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of GnT-III expression on Notch signaling, we measured the levels of Notch receptors and downstream effectors of Notch using RNA extracted from spheroids of OVCAR3 and OVCA26 stable cell lines. Control shRNA levels were set to 1.0 for comparison. We observed a significant reduction in the levels of Notch 1 and Notch 3 in the RNA from spheroids of both OVCAR3 and OVCA26 GnT-III shRNA cells compared with control cells (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively) (Fig. 4, A and B). The levels of downstream effectors of the Notch signaling pathway HES-1 and Hey-1 were also significantly reduced in both OVCAR3 and OVCA26 GnT-III shRNA cells compared with control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4, A and B). To confirm that the reduction in transcript levels in spheroids corresponds to protein reduction, an antibody to the 120-kDa Notch 1 transmembrane domain of the S1-cleaved heterodimeric Notch 1 detected Notch 1 in OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells at 40% the level of control cells (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, we find a reduction in the levels of activated Notch 1 measured using an antibody that recognizes the cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Fig. 4C). The γ-secretase cleavage of Notch to release the NICD is an essential step in the activation of Notch signaling. To determine whether there is any effect of GnT-III expression and bisecting glycosylation on γ-secretase cleavage, the cells were treated with γ-secretase inhibitor IX (GSI-IX). Exposure of cells to EDTA stimulates detachment of the Notch extracellular domain, rendering the residual transmembrane fragment a substrate for γ-secretase cleavage and Notch activation (16van Tetering G. van Diest P. Verlaan I. van der Wall E. Kopan R. Vooijs M. Metalloprotease ADAM10 is required for Notch1 site 2 cleavage.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31018-31027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with EDTA prior to returning them to regular medium for incubation with or without GSI-IX. Control OVCAR3 shRNA cells treated with EDTA show an increase in activated Notch 1 NICD (Fig. 4F, compare lanes 1 and 2), as expected. GnT-III shRNA cells also show an increase over basal when treated with EDTA (Fig. 4F, compare lanes 5 and 6). OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells without any treatment show an inhibition of activated Notch 1 greater than that of control cells treated with GSI-IX (Fig. 4F, compare lanes 3 and 5). Treatment of OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells with GSI-IX results in further inhibition of activated Notch 1 when compared with control cells (Fig. 4F, compare lanes 3 and 7). These results indicate that GnT-III expression promotes Notch receptor cleavage. Autophagy has been shown to regulate the Notch pathway in normal physiology and disease (17Wu X. Fleming A. Ricketts T. Pavel M. Virgin H. Menzies F.M. Rubinsztein D.C. Autophagy regulates Notch degradation and modulates stem cell development and neurogenesis.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10533Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore we performed immunocytochemistry to determine the localization of Notch 1 in OVCAR3 cells. Notch 1 is observed in intracellular vesicles and the nucleus in control shRNA OVCAR3 cells and does not co-localize with LAMP1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; Fig. 5A). However, in GnT-III shRNA OVCAR3 cells, Notch 1 is primarily localized with the late endosome/lysosome marker LAMP1, indicating that a larger percentage of Notch 1 is in this fraction (Fig. 5A, white arrows). To further confirm these findings, we treated cells with chloroquine to raise the pH of this cellular compartment and inhibit lysosomal enzymes (18Steinman R.M. Mellman I.S. Muller W.A. Cohn Z.A. Endocytosis and the recycling of plasma membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). We found no effect on Notch 1 levels in control cells treated with chloroquine, whereas GnT-III shRNA cells show a significant increase in Notch 1 levels when lysosomal enzymes are inhibited (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Notch 1 is localized outside of the late endosome/lysosome compartment in control OVCAR3 cells, and inhibition of GnT-III causes a relocation of Notch 1 to the late endosome/lysosome. We previously conducted a glycoproteomic analysis of membrane proteins isolated from primary ovarian cancer tumor tissues (4Allam H. Aoki K. Benigno B.B. McDonald J.F. Mackintosh S.G. Tiemeyer M. Abbott K.L. Glycomic analysis of membrane glycoproteins with bisecting glycosylation from ovarian cancer tissues reveals novel structures and functions.J. Proteome Res. 2015; 14: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study Notch was not identified as a substrate for GnT-III glycosylation. These results may have been influenced by the high levels of O-linked glycans on Notch peptides that would suppress ionization efficiency in the mass spectrometer. In this study, we can confirm that Notch 1 reacts with the lectin E-PHA, indicating the presence of bisecting glycans (Fig. 5C). OVCAR3 control shRNA and GnT-III shRNA cells were transfected with Myc-tagged mNotch 1. Notch 1/6× Myc was captured using beads covalently coupled with Myc antibody. We observe several Notch 1/6× Myc bands, including the full-length Notch 1 and the S1 cleaved Notch 1 with a predicted molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (19Nye J.S. Kopan R. Axel R. An activated Notch suppresses neurogenesis and myogenesis but not gliogenesis in mammalian cells.Development. 1994; 120: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C). There are additional lower molecular mass bands that may be due to proteolysis. All of these bands are present in both the control and the GnT-III shRNA lanes at approximately the same levels, confirming equivalent transfection and expression of mNotch 1/6× Myc fusion proteins (Fig. 5C, blot to the left). The 6× Myc-tagged Notch 1 bands are E-PHA–positive in the control shRNA lane with complete absence or significant reduction in the GnT-III shRNA lane (Fig. 5C, blot to the right). The reduction in reactivity of these bands with the lectin E-PHA in the GnT-III shRNA lane confirms the presence of bisecting glycans on mNotch 1/6× Myc fusion proteins. Research over the past few years has focused on the identification of glycan changes specific for ovarian cancer. The next step is to investigate the functional impact of these glycosylation changes for ovarian cancer progression. In this manuscript, we have examined the influence of a specific form of N-linked glycosylation that is abnormally elevated in ovarian cancer and report novel mechanisms that GnT-III–mediated glycosylation exerts on ovarian cancer progression. Disease recurrence and chemoresistance are major clinical issues facing clinicians and ovarian cancer patients that have been linked to CSC levels. Our data indicate that GnT-III expression levels have a significant impact on patient survival (Fig. 1). Furthermore, GnT-III expression promotes the CSC population and the expression of required stemness genes (Fig. 2). Suppression of GnT-III dramatically reduced ovarian tumor growth and metastasis in a xenograft model (Fig. 3 and supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). These findings suggest that bisecting glycosylation is a significant factor promoting the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancers. The Notch signaling pathway is important for the activation and maintenance of stem cell progenitors in normal tissue development that can be abnormally activated in ovarian cancers. Recent studies support a role for the Notch pathway in ovarian cancer progression and chemoresistance (15McAuliffe S.M. Morgan S.L. Wyant G.A. Tran L.T. Muto K.W. Chen Y.S. Chin K.T. Partridge J.C.

Molecular phenotyping of human ovarian cancer stem cells unravels the mechanisms for repair and chemoresistance.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We report, for the first time, that bisecting glycans increase Notch receptor levels and activity (Fig. 4). The influence of GnT-III expression on Notch signaling involves increased Notch receptor levels, increased levels of NICD, and enhanced γ-secretase cleavage (Fig. 4). We find that the use of GSI with GnT-III suppression resulted in additional inhibition, indicating that targeting GnT-III expression may be a new mechanism to inhibit Notch signaling in ovarian cancer that may augment GSI therapy. The effects of GnT-III expression levels on γ-secretase activity in ovarian cancer are novel and have not previously been reported. The mechanism for γ-secretase activation by GnT-III may be linked to control of Notch receptor trafficking. There is a precedent for bisecting glycosylation in the control of protein localization in the cell. A recent study found that mice deficient for GnT-III in an Alzheimer's model show a change in intracellular localization of the protein BACE1. BACE1 with bisecting glycosylation is localized to early endosomes, whereas BACE1 in mice lacking GnT-III was localized to the late endosome/lysosome (21Kizuka Y. Kitazume S. Fujinawa R. Saito T.

The significance of N-linked glycosylation present on the Notch receptor has not been extensively studied in human cancers. It has been show that Notch has occupied N-linked glycosylation in CHO cells (22Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S.

Notch 1 and Notch 3 signaling are active in ovarian cancer (15McAuliffe S.M. Morgan S.L. Wyant G.A. Tran L.T. Muto K.W. Chen Y.S. Chin K.T. Partridge J.C. Poole B.B. Cheng K.H. Daggett Jr., J.

Oncol. 2010; 117: 130-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results confirm a role for N-linked bisecting glycosylation in the activation of Notch 1. Our finding that inhibition of GnT-III blocks Notch activation suggests that targeting GnT-III or blocking bisecting glycosylation sites on Notch receptor may lead to new therapeutics for ovarian cancer. The impact of N-linked glycosylation on O-fucose glycosylation of Notch is not known. The N-linked sites within Notch are located in close proximity to O-fucose modified sites. O-Fucose glycosylation of Notch EGF repeats has been shown to create a code to either inhibit or activate Notch ligand-dependent activation (24Kakuda S. Haltiwanger R.S. Deciphering the fringe-mediated notch code: identification of activating and inhibiting sites allowing discrimination between ligands.Dev. Cell. 2017; 40: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It will be important in the future to determine how the bisecting glycan structures on Notch in ovarian cancer alter this O-fucose code. Overall, the evaluation of GnT-III expression levels could have clinical utility for identifying patients that would benefit from Notch inhibitor therapies. Tumor samples from patients with ovarian cancer were obtained from the ovarian cancer patient repository of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) (supplemental Table S1). All specimens were collected under a university institutional review board–approved protocol, and written consent from each donor was obtained. The EOC cell lines OVCAR3 and the primary patient cell line OVCA26 were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini Bioproducts, West Sacramento, CA) and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The OVCA26 patient-derived cell line was produced under an approved institutional review board protocol by Dr. Martin Cannon at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Lentiviral transduction to establish stable GnT-III suppression was performed as described previously (4Allam H.

For analysis, patients with stage IV serous and endometrioid ovarian cancer were divided into two groups according to higher and lower MGAT3 expression levels (specifics on the cutoffs are included in the figure legend). The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were then compared between the two groups. Log rank p values and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were then calculated. Samples (50 μl of packed cells) were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After DNase treatment, RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) with random hexamers and oligo(dT). Primers were validated with respect to primer efficiency and single product detection. The primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table S2. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 C1000 instrument using RT SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad). Relative expression of target genes was calculated using the comparative cycle threshold method with genes normalized to RPL4. Ovarian cancer cells were plated in chamber slides or on ultralow adhesion plates at 50% confluence prior to immunofluorescence staining. The cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde, 1× PBS and blocked in 1× PBS, 1% BSA prior to incubation with primary antibodies, anti-Notch 1 antibody (Abcam), or anti LAMP-1 antibody (Abcam) in 1× PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h. Alexa Fluor 488– or 594–conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 30 min in 1× PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20 for 30 min prior to counterstain with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and mounting in Vectashield. All procedures were performed following the guidelines adopted by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Female immunodeficient mice were obtained from Jackson Labs (NSG, NOD scid γ/8 weeks old). Five million OVCAR3 control or OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells in PBS were inoculated subcutaneously into the right and left flank, respectively, of each mouse (n = 6). Five million OVCAR3 control or OVCAR3 GnT-III shRNA cells were injected intraperitoneal (n = 6 mice/cell line). The mice were monitored daily for 8 weeks prior to necropsy and tumor extraction. Tumor volume in mg is calculated using the following formula: volume = (length × width2/2). Control or GnT-III shRNA cells were transfected with mNotch 1/6× Myc pCS2+ plasmid (gift from Robert Haltiwanger) (28Rampal R. Arboleda-Velasquez J.F. Nita-Lazar A. Kosik K.S. Haltiwanger R.S.

However, iPSCs generated from aged donors (A-iPSCs) exhibit higher genomic instability, defects in apoptosis and a blunted DNA damage response compared with iPSCs generated from younger donors. We demonstrated that A-iPSCs exhibit excessive glutathione-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity, which blocks the DNA damage response and apoptosis and permits survival of cells with genomic instability. We found that the pluripotency factor ZSCAN10 is poorly expressed in A-iPSCs and addition of ZSCAN10 to the four Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC) during A-iPSC reprogramming normalizes ROS-glutathione homeostasis and the DNA damage response, and recovers genomic stability. Correcting the genomic instability of A-iPSCs will ultimately enhance our ability to produce histocompatible functional tissues from older patients' own cells that are safe for transplantation."

SLC6 transporters are examples of secondary active transporters that utilize the electrochemical gradient of sodium to drive cellular uptake of substrates. SERT, DAT, and NET work in relay with vesicular monoamine transporters to ensure efficient recycling of neurotransmitters from the extra-neuronal space (i.e. the synapse) into the synaptic vesicles. This effectively terminates signaling by the released neurotransmitter and replenishes synaptic stores (1Kristensen A.S. Andersen J. Jørgensen T.N. Sørensen L. Eriksen J. Loland C.J. Strømgaard K. Gether U. SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters: structure, function, and regulation.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63: 585-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Monoaminergic neurons reside in the mesencephalon or rhombencephalon and project diffusely into many other brain areas including the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia by elaborating dense axonal arborizations (2Descarries L. Watkins K.C. Lapierre Y. Noradrenergic axon terminals in the cerebral cortex of rat. III. Topometric ultrastructural analysis.Brain Res. 1977; 133: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Lidov H.G. Grzanna R. Molliver M.E.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Hence, monoamines function as neuromodulators and impinge on the wired transmission exerted for instance by glutamatergic projections. Volume transmission elicited by monoamines can be tuned by changing the activity of the monoamine transporters. Accordingly, SERT, DAT, and NET are prime targets for both therapeutically relevant and illicit drugs. Because the transporters are closely related, they share inhibitors and substrates. The illicit market provides lucrative incentives to explore the chemical space in the vicinity of the known ligands. This results in a very rich pharmacology of DAT, NET, and SERT (5Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Amphetamines, new psychoactive drugs and the monoamine transporter cycle.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2015; 36: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Exogenous ligands, which bind to monoamine transporters, are classified as inhibitors if they block neurotransmitter reuptake through the transporter (e.g. cocaine, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/SSRIs) or as substrates/releasers; amphetamine-like releasers induce efflux of the endogenous monoamine because they are taken up into the cell via the transporter but they switch the transporter from the cyclical forward transport mode into the exchange mode (5Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Amphetamines, new psychoactive drugs and the monoamine transporter cycle.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2015; 36: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the mechanism of action, both releasers and inhibitors increase extracellular neurotransmitter levels and, hence, signaling via the cognate receptors. In the case of the dopamine transporter, the reinforcing and rewarding characteristic of these drugs lead to substance addiction. Consequently, any exogenous ligand that acts either as an inhibitor of, or as a releaser on DAT is predicted to have addictive properties. However, the discovery of atypical inhibitors and partial releasers has challenged this notion (6Schmitt K.C. Rothman R.B. Reith M.E. Non-classical pharmacology of the dopamine transporter: atypical inhibitors, allosteric modulators and partial substrates.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2013; 346: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Atypical inhibitors of DAT such as vanoxerine, modafinil, and benztropine have been shown to have far less reinforcing and psychostimulant effects than cocaine in people (7Schmitt K.C. Zhen J.

Similarly compounds have also been discovered that were classified as “partial substrates” because they induce neurotransmitter efflux with lower efficacy when compared with D-amphetamine (9Rothman R.B.

Understanding the pharmacology of such atypical ligands has an appealing application in the treatment of addiction disorders. In addition, they may be useful to correct the folding defect of transporter mutants by virtue of their pharmacochaperoning action (11Chiba P. Freissmuth M. Stockner T. Defining the blanks: pharmacochaperoning of SLC6 transporters and ABC transporters.Pharmacol. Res. 2014; 83: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The folding trajectory of membrane proteins, in general, and of SLC6 transporters, in particular, is poorly understood, but it is clear that conformations are being visited that can be stabilized by ligands. This is exemplified by the plant alkaloid ibogaine and its derivative noribogaine, which are shown to trap SERT in the inward-facing conformation (12Jacobs M.T. Zhang Y.W. Campbell S.D. Rudnick G.

In contrast, neither inhibitors such as imipramine nor substrates/releasers such as p-chloroamphetamine rescue folding-deficient versions of SERT (14El-Kasaby A. Just H. Malle E. Stolt-Bergner P.C.

Based on these observations, we surmised that partial releasers ought to act as pharmacochaperones provided that they stabilize the transporter in a conformation conducive to folding. We tested this conjecture by analyzing the actions of “partial releasers” (9Rothman R.B. Partilla J.S. Baumann M.H. Lightfoot-Siordia C. Blough B.E. Studies of the biogenic amine transporters. 14.

This approach identified PAL1045 as a candidate pharmacochaperone, an action that was confirmed using a folding-deficient mutant of SERT. The PAL series of amphetamine-related compounds was previously examined for their ability to induce reverse transport. We selected three naphthylpropane-2-amines from this list because they differed in their ability to release substrate (9Rothman R.B. Partilla J.S. Baumann M.H. Lightfoot-Siordia C. Blough B.E. Studies of the biogenic amine transporters. 14. Identification of low-efficacy “partial” substrates for the biogenic amine transporters.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2012; 341: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and because they represent a series of congeners, i.e. PAL1046 and PAL1045 are the methylated and ethylated derivatives of PAL287 (Fig. 1A). PAL1045 was classified as a partial releaser, i.e. saturating concentrations of PAL1045 caused less substrate efflux than the full releaser D-amphetamine (9Rothman R.B. Partilla J.S. Baumann M.H. Lightfoot-Siordia C. Blough B.E. Studies of the biogenic amine transporters. 14. Identification of low-efficacy “partial” substrates for the biogenic amine transporters.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2012; 341: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Partial release can be explained by assuming that ineffective releasers lock the transporter in intermediate conformations during the transport cycle. This kinetic trap may impede efficient reverse transport. This hypothesis predicts that partial releasers bind with high affinity to SERT. Accordingly, we compared the potency of the three compounds to displace [3H]imipramine binding to membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing the human SERT with their potency to inhibit uptake of [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) by these cells (Fig. 1B). The affinity of the reference compound p-chloroamphetamine was comparable in the two assays (open circles in Fig. 1, B and C, Table 1). In contrast, PAL287, PAL1045, and PAL1046 were substantially more potent in inhibiting [3H]imipramine binding (Fig. 1B) than cellular substrate uptake (Fig. 1C; Table 1). The most pronounced shift was observed with PAL1045, which was ∼500-fold more potent in displacing [3H]imipramine binding than in inhibiting substrate uptake (Table 1). With PAL287 and PAL1046, the ratios were smaller but still substantial, i.e. ∼6- and 26-fold, respectively (Table 1). Binding experiments were done under equilibrium conditions. In contrast, the reaction time was only 1 min in the uptake assay. We verified that the low apparent affinity observed in the uptake assay was not due to the short incubation time by preincubating cells with the compounds for 20 min before the addition of [3H]5-HT (Fig. 1D). However, this preincubation did not enhance the inhibitory potency of any of the compounds (cf. Fig. 1. C and D). Thus, the discrepancy between binding and uptake experiments presumably arises from the different assay conditions; during cellular uptake the transporter is allowed to cycle in the forward transport mode or to seesaw through the substrate-exchange mode in a manner driven by the ionic gradients. In contrast, no ionic gradient is imposed on SERT in the binding assay. Thus, the transporter can accumulate in a state in which it binds a given ligand with high affinity.Table 1Affinity estimates for PAL287, PAL1045, PAL1046, and the reference compound p-chloroamphetamineIC50 (uptake inhibition)Ki (binding inhibition)kon (peak current relaxation rate)koff (peak current recovery rate)KD,kin (koff/kon)nMnM106 m−1 s−1s−1nMp-Chloroamphetamine6042 (5504-6633)4880 (3382-5665)0.74 (0.67-0.80)3.53 (3.05-4.00)4786PAL2871686 (1582-1798)144 (134-175)5.45 (3.81-7.10)0.12 (0.10-0.14)22.1PAL10454212 (3782-4691)4 (3-5)4.67 (2.70-6.65)0.026 (0.023-0.029)5.5PAL10461796 (1692-1907)34 (29-40)5.51 (4.29-6.73)0.13 (0.11-0.14)22.9 Open table in a new tab Electrophysiological recordings allow for probing the transport cycle of SERT; the substrate-induced current through the transporter is composed of two components: (i) an initial peak current (cf. the left hand current trace in Fig. 2A), which reflects the substrate-induced translocation of Na+ and thus monitors the transition from the outward to the inward-facing state (21Hasenhuetl P.S. Freissmuth M. Sandtner W. Electrogenic binding of intracellular cations defines a kinetic decision point in the transport cycle of the human serotonin transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25864-25876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); (ii) peak current followed by a sustained current, which persists as long as the cell is exposed to substrate (left hand current trace in Fig. 2A). This steady-state current corresponds to a Na+-conducting state, which is visited by the K+-bound inward-facing conformation during the rate-limiting return step. Hence, it is a read-out for completion of the transport cycle (18Schicker K. Uzelac Z. Gesmonde J. Bulling S. Stockner T. Freissmuth M. Boehm S. Rudnick G. Sitte H.H. Sandtner W. Unifying concept of serotonin transporter-associated currents.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 438-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the sustained current can be used to assess if a compound drives SERT into the forward transport mode; that is, if it is a substrate. It is evident from the representative traces shown in Fig. 2A that the steady-state currents elicited by PAL1045, PAL287, and PAL1046 were smaller than those elicited by 5-HT or p-chloroamphetamine (pCA). In addition, upon washout the steady-state current did not decay, but increased transiently. This is indicative of rapid intracellular accumulation of the compounds by diffusion during the superfusion and back diffusion during washout (20Hasenhuetl P.S. Schicker K. Koenig X. Li Y. Sarker S. Stockner T. Sucic S. Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Sandtner W. Ligand selectivity among the dopamine and serotonin transporters specified by the forward binding reaction.Mol.

The conservative view: is it necessary to implant a stent into the dopamine transporter?.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 172: 4775-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reduced the extracellular pH to 5.5 to force protonation of the compounds and to thus suppress cell entry by diffusion. Under these conditions, the steady-state current elicited by PAL1045, PAL287, and PAL1046 was substantially larger than at pH 7.4 (cf. Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, upon washout, the current either did not increase (PAL1045 in Fig. 2B), or the increase was modest, when compared with recordings done at pH 7.4 (cf. PAL287 and PAL1046 in Fig. 2, A and B). Finally, if the inhibitor cocaine was washed in, the current decay was rapid and uniform regardless of whether 5-HT, PAL287, PAL1045, PAL1046, or pCA was examined (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, at pH 7.4, the concentration-response curve for PAL1045, PAL287, and PAL1046 was bell-shaped (Fig. 2D), but at pH 5.5 we observed a saturation hyperbola (Fig. 2E); Km values were 0.11 ± 0.05, 0.27 ± 0.04, and 0.12 ± 0.03 μm for PAL287, PAL1045, and PAL1046, respectively, and the maximum steady-state currents were between 55 and 72% that seen in the presence of saturating 5-HT concentrations. The Km of the reference compound p-chloroamphetamine was 1.34 ± 0.16 μm, and the maximum current elicited by saturating concentrations was 102 ± 4% that elicited by 10 μm serotonin. The drop in pH also had only a modest effect on the Km of serotonin when assessed by measuring the steady-state current (Fig. 2F) or cellular uptake (data not shown). Thus, the observations showed that PAL287, PAL1045, and PAL1046 were substrates of SERT but that they were transported less effectively than the natural substrate 5-HT or p-chloroamphetamine. This is consistent with their high affinity binding to one of the conformational intermediates in the transport cycle. The apparent affinities of PAL287, PAL1045, and PAL1046 differed substantially depending on whether they were examined for their ability to block substrate uptake (Fig. 1C) or inhibitor binding (Fig. 1B) or to serve as substrates (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the variation in affinity estimates was less pronounced for the reference compound p-chloroamphetamine. We examined the affinity of the naphthylpropan-2-amines to the outward-facing conformation of SERT by recording peak currents. The peak current results from the binding of substrate and co-substrate ions and the ensuing translocation of the charge through the membrane electric field, which is associated with the conformational transition from the outward- to the inward-facing conformation. The relaxation of this current reflects the charge movement (23Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Glutamate translocation of the neu-ronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 occurs within milliseconds.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); it is the first derivative of the position of the charge over time. Initially, the current is at a maximum, because all charges are on one side of the membrane electric field. When all charges have moved, the current subsides (it relaxes to 0). Hence, the relaxation rate comprises two reactions; that is, the apparent binding rate kapp of substrate (co-substrate Na+ is already present) and the charge movement proper. At low substrate concentrations the apparent association rate kapp is rate-limiting. At higher concentrations, the conformational transition required for charge movement became rate-limiting (see the reaction scheme in Fig. 3). The peak current can be studied in isolation by eliminating K+ from the intracellular solution because K+-binding to the inward-facing conformation of SERT is required for induction of the steady-state current (21Hasenhuetl P.S. Freissmuth M. Sandtner W. Electrogenic binding of intracellular cations defines a kinetic decision point in the transport cycle of the human serotonin transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25864-25876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the absence of intracellular Na+, SERT cannot enter into the exchange mode. Thus, under the experimental conditions employed in Fig. 3, the rate of peak current relaxation (kpr) reflects the rate of substrate binding (kapp,S) and the rate of the conformational transition (kt), i.e. 1/kpr = 1/kapp,S + 1/kt. It is evident that at low substrate concentrations, the apparent association rate of substrate is limiting for kpr: τ decreased with increasing concentrations of the substrate applied until at high substrate concentration the conformational transition of SERT rather than substrate-binding dictates kpr (Fig. 3, A and B). For 5-HT, PAL287, PAL1045, and PAL1046, we did not find any appreciable difference in the relation between their concentration and the observed peak current relaxation rate. Accordingly, we deduced comparable association rate constants (kon) of ∼5 × 106 × m−1 s−1 for 5-HT, PAL287, PAL1045, and PAL1046 from the linear relation between ligand concentration and apparent rate (in a second order reaction) by extracting it from the first derivative at 0 ligand concentration of the exponential function shown in Fig. 3B (see also Table 1). Surprisingly, p-chloroamphetamine bound much more slowly than all other compounds such that the peak current relaxation rate was dictated by its apparent rate of association up to 100 μm (□ in Fig. 3B and Table 1). Dissociation rates were determined by recording peak current recovery under conditions where the forward transport mode was suppressed by the presence of high internal Na+ (140 mm). This condition also precludes substrate dissociation from the inward-facing conformation of SERT and forces SERT to operate in the substrate exchange mode (18Schicker K. Uzelac Z. Gesmonde J. Bulling S. Stockner T. Freissmuth M. Boehm S. Rudnick G. Sitte H.H. Sandtner W. Unifying concept of serotonin transporter-associated currents.J. Biol.

Chem. 2016; 291: 25864-25876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); after the initial conformational transition to the inward-facing state, the substrate-bound transporter oscillated between inward- and outward-facing conformation and released the bound substrate as a consequence of increasing superfusion intervals (see reaction scheme in Fig. 4). As a consequence of the dissociation, the number of unliganded SERT molecules increased over time. Hence, the peak current amplitude, which can be gauged by applying a pulse of 5-HT at a saturating concentration, is predicted to recover to its original value over time; a representative time course is shown in Fig. 4A, where the first (left hand) peak current was elicited by 100 μm 5-HT, the second pulse by 30 μm PAL-1045 (for 200 ms), and the subsequent currents by repeated challenges with 5-HT, whereas the cell was continuously superfused with buffer. It is evident from Fig. 4A that the recovery of the full-sized peak current required 128 s. A comparison of p-chloroamphetamine with the three naphthylpropane-2-amines revealed that the peak current recovered fast after p-chloroamphetamine (○ in Fig. 4B). The recovery was ∼18-fold slower for PAL-1046 (▵ in Fig. 4B) and for PAL-287 (□) in Fig. 4B) resulting in half-lives of ∼5.5 s (Table 1). The dissociation of PAL1045 (▿ in Fig. 4B) was even slower and proceeded with a half-life of ∼27 s (Table 1). The association and dissociation rate constants obtained from the experiments depicted in Figure 3, Figure 4 allowed for the calculation of KD estimates. These were in reasonable agreement with the affinity estimates obtained from the binding experiments (Table 1). It is obviously not possible to determine the apparent affinity of a compound to SERT in the total absence of Na+ by the available electrophysiological means because without Na+ there is no current to be recorded. However, the Na+ dependence of binding can be inferred from the effects seen in the presence of low Na+ concentrations. In the presence of 10 mm external Na+, the recorded currents were large enough to allow for an analysis of the rate of peak current recovery according to the protocol outlined in Fig. 4. We used this approach to examine the effect of lowering external Na+ on the dissociation rate of PAL287, PAL1045, and PAL1046 (original traces and triangles in Fig. 5B and D–F, respectively). In addition, we also recorded the rate of peak-current recovery after elimination of internal Na+ and compared the time course of recovery to that seen in the presence of high internal Na+ concentrations (squares and circles in Fig. 5, D–F, respectively). In the absence of internal Na+, the transporter can also release the compound on the intracellular side before its return to the outward-facing state. It is evident that the changes in Na+ concentrations had no appreciable effect on the peak cu"
https://openalex.org/W2749286950,"ATP7B is a copper-transporting P1B-type ATPase (Cu-ATPase) with an essential role in human physiology. Mutations in ATP7B cause the potentially fatal Wilson disease, and changes in ATP7B expression are observed in several cancers. Despite its physiologic importance, the biochemical information about ATP7B remains limited because of a complex multidomain organization of the protein. By analogy with the better characterized prokaryotic Cu-ATPases, ATP7B is assumed to be a single-chain monomer. We show that in eukaryotic cells, human ATP7B forms dimers that can be purified following solubilization. Deletion of the four N-terminal metal-binding domains, characteristic for human ATP7B, does not disrupt dimerization, i.e. the dimer interface is formed by the domains that are conserved among Cu-ATPases. Unlike the full-length ATP7B, which is targeted to the trans-Golgi network, 1–4ΔMBD-7B is targeted primarily to vesicles. This result and the analysis of differentially tagged ATP7B variants indicate that the dimeric structure is retained during ATP7B trafficking between the intracellular compartments. Purified dimeric species of 1–4ΔMBD-7B were characterized by a negative stain electron microscopy in the presence of ADP/MgCl2. Single-particle analysis yielded a low-resolution 3D model that provides the first insight into an overall architecture of a human Cu-ATPase, positions of the main domains, and a dimer interface."
https://openalex.org/W2747634890,"Cantu syndrome (CS) is a condition characterized by a range of anatomical defects, including cardiomegaly, hyperflexibility of the joints, hypertrichosis, and craniofacial dysmorphology. CS is associated with multiple missense mutations in the genes encoding the regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) subunits of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel as well as two mutations (V65M and C176S) in the Kir6.1 (KCNJ8) subunit. Previous analysis of leucine and alanine substitutions at the Val-65-equivalent site (Val-64) in Kir6.2 indicated no major effects on channel function. In this study, we characterized the effects of both valine-to-methionine and valine-to-leucine substitutions at this position in both Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 using ion flux and patch clamp techniques. We report that methionine substitution, but not leucine substitution, results in increased open state stability and hence significantly reduced ATP sensitivity and a marked increase of channel activity in the intact cell irrespective of the identity of the coassembled SUR subunit. Sulfonylurea inhibitors, such as glibenclamide, are potential therapies for CS. However, as a consequence of the increased open state stability, both Kir6.1(V65M) and Kir6.2(V64M) mutations essentially abolish high-affinity sensitivity to the KATP blocker glibenclamide in both intact cells and excised patches. This raises the possibility that, at least for some CS mutations, sulfonylurea therapy may not prove to be successful and highlights the need for detailed pharmacogenomic analyses of CS mutations."

ATP hydrolysis causes a rearrangement of the MukBEF complex, loosening the contacts between MukF and one MukB head domain in the MukB dimer (11Woo J.S. Lim J.H. Shin H.C. Suh M.K. Ku B. Lee K.H.

These observations suggest that MukF and MukE may be involved in the loading of MukB to DNA rather than in DNA condensation per se. How these SMC complexes act to cohese and condense DNA has been under active investigation for some time. The eukaryotic cohesin and condensin both trap DNA helices topologically within the tripartite protein complex (1Uhlmann F. SMC complexes: from DNA to chromosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recent studies also reported the same mechanism held true for the B. subtilis SMC protein (12Wilhelm L. Burmann F. Minnen A.

SMC condensin entraps chromosomal DNA by an ATP hydrolysis dependent loading mechanism in Bacillus subtilis.Elife. 2015; 4: e06659Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and MukB (13Niki H. Yano K. In vitro topological loading of bacterial condensin MukB on DNA, preferentially single-stranded DNA rather than double-stranded DNA.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 29469Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several models have been elaborated as to how this topological trapping of DNA can lead to chromosome condensation (1Uhlmann F. SMC complexes: from DNA to chromosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We have investigated the mechanism of DNA condensation by MukB. We found that unlike either the eukaryotic or B. subtilis condensins, MukB did not entrap DNA topologically. As shown previously (14Cui Y. Petrushenko Z.M. Rybenkov V.V. MukB acts as a macromolecular clamp in DNA condensation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), DNA condensation was a stepwise process. We identified two topological alterations. First, the protein forms and sequesters negative supercoils and then forms larger loops that are mediated by hinge–hinge interactions between MukB dimers. These large loops of DNA could be supercoiled by DNA gyrase. MukB alone was sufficient to organize these topological alterations in the DNA that led to condensation; neither MukEF nor ATP was required. We asked whether we could detect direct alteration of DNA topology by MukB in the absence of a topoisomerase. Because agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA rings is very sensitive to DNA topology (15Michieletto D. Marenduzzo D. Orlandini E. Topological patterns in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of DNA knots.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: E5471-E5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we used this technique as the basis of our assay. The substrate was an 11-kbp dsDNA plasmid that had been relaxed by the introduction of a single nick in one of the DNA strands. Remarkably, under conditions previously established for examining MukB binding to DNA (4Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. DNA reshaping by MukB. Right-handed knotting, left-handed supercoiling.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rybenkov V.V. Antagonistic interactions of kleisins and DNA with bacterial condensin MukB.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34208-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), protein-DNA complexes formed at low concentrations of MukB moved faster during electrophoresis than the nicked DNA (Fig. 1A). As the concentration of MukB was increased, the mobility of the protein-DNA complex became retarded compared with that of the DNA alone (Fig. 1A). We refer to the protein-DNA complexes formed at 31 and 63 nm MukB as the fast-moving complexes (FMcx) and those formed at 125 and 250 nm MukB as the slow-moving complexes (SMcx). It is important to note that these reaction mixtures contained only MukB and the relaxed DNA. There was neither topoisomerase, ATP, nor MukEF present. The fact that the FMcx had a greater mobility in the gel than that of the DNA alone suggested that the DNA must be condensed. We investigated the nature of this condensation using a number of biochemical assays, as well as scanning force microscopy (SFM). Because MukB stabilizes negative supercoils (4Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. DNA reshaping by MukB. Right-handed knotting, left-handed supercoiling.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and supercoiling of the DNA increases its electrophoretic mobility, we asked whether MukB was inducing supercoils in the nicked DNA. The MukB-DNA complex was incubated with E. coli DNA ligase, which uses NAD as a cofactor rather than ATP (16Lehman I.R. DNA ligase: structure, mechanism, and function.Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), to seal the nick. After deproteinization, DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through an agarose gel containing chloroquine (Fig. 1B). Chloroquine unwinds the DNA helix, and thus in a relaxed, closed circular DNA (the product of sealing the nick) it will induce positive supercoils, and the mobility of the DNA will increase (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). DNA sealed in the presence of MukB contained negative supercoils, as indicated by the ladder of topoisomers with retarded mobility compared with that of the relaxed DNA alone (Fig. 1B, compare lane 2 to lanes 4–6). To determine whether these negative supercoils were merely stabilized by MukB or actually protected by it, we exposed the protein-DNA complexes to two different type I topoisomerases that relax negative supercoils: E. coli topoisomerase I, which acts on single-stranded DNA (17Liu L.F. Depew R.E. Wang J.C. Knotted single-stranded DNA rings: a novel topological isomer of circular single-stranded DNA formed by treatment with Escherichia coli omega protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and vaccinia virus topoisomerase, which acts on dsDNA (18Shuman S. Prescott J. Specific DNA cleavage and binding by vaccinia virus DNA topoisomerase I.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the SMcx and FMcx were examined (Fig. 1C). In neither case did the topoisomerase reduce the mobility of the protein-DNA complex, arguing that the supercoils were unavailable to be relaxed. We conclude that the supercoils could not be relaxed because the helical crossover that forms them was completely protected by binding to MukB. Controls showing that the amount of topoisomerase used was sufficient to relax all the supercoiled DNA are shown in Fig. 1C (right panel). Thus, it seemed likely that the FMcx was probably dominated by the formation of protected supercoils. The addition of more MukB to the reaction causes the mobility of the complex to slow. This effect could simply be because of the accretion of additional mass to the complex via the binding of more MukB. However, we wondered whether the effect could also be attributed to another distinct layer of topology imposed by the increasing amounts of bound MukB. To probe this possibility, we compared the mobility of the protein-DNA complexes in gels that either did or did not contain chloroquine (Fig. 1D). As expected, the mobility of the FMcx was reduced compared with the nicked DNA in the chloroquine-containing gel (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1–3 in each panel). This effect is because chloroquine is a small molecule and can unwind even the MukB-protected supercoils, confirming that this FMcx is dominated by negative supercoiling. Remarkably, the presence of chloroquine in the gel caused the SMcx to now move faster than the nicked DNA (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 4 and 5 in each panel). This inversion of DNA mobility can only be explained by the presence of relaxed loops in the SMcx that become positively supercoiled in the presence of chloroquine. In order for these loops to exist, they must be stabilized by MukB. To confirm our interpretation, we reasoned that these loops should be stable enough to be supercoiled by the action of DNA gyrase (19Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. DNA gyrase: an enzyme that introduces superhelical turns into DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). We therefore designed an experimental scheme so that gyrase would only be acting when the DNA was still nicked and thus not topologically constrained by virtue of the continuity of both DNA strands. MukB protein-DNA complexes were formed and then incubated with DNA gyrase and ATP (19Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. DNA gyrase: an enzyme that introduces superhelical turns into DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Novobiocin was then added to inactivate gyrase (20Gellert M. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Novobiocin and coumermycin inhibit DNA supercoiling catalyzed by DNA gyrase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 4474-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) followed by DNA ligase to seal the DNA and lock in any changes in DNA topology. After deproteinization, the DNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in either the absence or presence of chloroquine (Fig. 2, A, top and bottom panels, respectively, and B). As before (Fig. 1B), the presence of MukB alone caused the accumulation of negative supercoils (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2–6). However, the addition of DNA gyrase to SMcxs clearly caused the accumulation of additional supercoils (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lane 6 to lane 9). Controls demonstrating the inhibition of DNA gyrase by novobiocin are shown in Fig. 8C (lanes 11 and 12).Figure 8MukB KE,RE variant is defective in the induction of negative supercoils and stabilizing loops in the DNA.

The order of addition of components is outlined at the top of the gel. B, MukB; N, novobiocin; G, DNA gyrase; L, DNA ligase.

Nishino T. Marko J.F. The SMC1-SMC3 cohesin heterodimer structures DNA through supercoiling-dependent loop formation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 6149-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we asked whether we could detect topological loop stabilization when MukB was bound to linear DNA (Fig. 2C). This proved to be the case. MukB-linear DNA complexes formed at 125 and 250 nm MukB clearly displayed increased mobility in gels containing chloroquine compared with those that did not (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 4 and 5 and 9 and 10 in the presence and absence of chloroquine). We conclude that at higher concentrations MukB was stabilizing topologically isolated loops in dsDNA. These observations are consistent with the results of single molecule analyses of the effect of MukB binding on the length of DNA that were interpreted as indicating MukB-mediated loop formation (14Cui Y. Petrushenko Z.M. Rybenkov V.V. MukB acts as a macromolecular clamp in DNA condensation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MukB-DNA complexes were examined using SFM. As the MukB concentration increased, the protein-DNA complexes presented increasingly aggregated masses with unbound DNA extruding from the central mass (Fig. 3A). The extent of exposed DNA in the protein-DNA complex decreased as the concentration of MukB increased, suggesting that the SFM images corresponded to that of progressively condensed DNA. To assess this possibility, we used as a measure of DNA condensation the length of dsDNA not present in the aggregated mass. Unconstrained plasmid DNA was 3430 ± 174 nm long. As the concentration of MukB increased from 15 to 60 nm, the length of exposed DNA decreased (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the SFM images report on the structure of the same MukB-DNA complex that has an electrophoretic mobility greater than that of the nicked DNA alone (the FMcx). Therefore, under these conditions the DNA becomes condensed. Such aggregation of MukB-DNA complexes is consistent with cooperative binding of MukB to the DNA (14Cui Y. Petrushenko Z.M. Rybenkov V.V. MukB acts as a macromolecular clamp in DNA condensation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was not possible to examine MukB-DNA complexes formed at higher concentrations of MukB with the SFM because these appeared as highly aggregated forms. At low concentrations of MukB, individual MukB molecules bound to the DNA could be observed (Fig. 4). Head and hinge domains could not be distinguished per se; however, we know that MukB is a V-shaped molecule with the hinge domain at the apex and the head domains on the opposite ends (22Matoba K. Yamazoe M. Mayanagi K. Morikawa K. Hiraga S. Comparison of MukB homodimer versus MukBEF complex molecular architectures by electron microscopy reveals a higher-order multimerization.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bound MukB molecules could be divided into three classes (Fig. 4): bound by the head domain; bound by the hinge domain; and bound by both the head and hinge domains. Anchoring of DNA loops by bound MukB was also observed. MukB binding via the hinge domain was unexpected because it had been reported previously that the isolated hinge domain did not bind DNA (23Ku B. Lim J.H. Shin H.C. Shin S.Y. Oh B.H. Crystal structure of the MukB hinge domain with coiled-coil stretches and its functional implications.Proteins. 2010; 78: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Li Y. Schoeffler A.J. Berger J.M. Oakley M.G. The crystal structure of the hinge domain of the Escherichia coli structural maintenance of chromosomes protein MukB.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binding of isolated MukB hinge to DNA was confirmed as described below. Individual MukB molecules could often be observed protruding from the aggregated mass in the SFM images (Fig. 5). In many instances, it seemed like the hinge domain was in the root of the aggregate with the head domains, occasionally bound to DNA, protruding (see arrows in Fig. 5). This possible feature of the aggregation, MukB protection of negative supercoils and formation of topologically stable loops, and hinge domain binding of DNA suggested a model for how MukB condenses DNA (Fig. 6, A–C). We propose that MukB initially binds DNA such that a negative supercoil is protected by interactions with the DNA-binding domains on the head domains and the hinge domain (Fig. 6A). In this fashion, extraneous topoisomerases might not be able to relax the supercoil, whereas chloroquine would be able to bind the DNA and untwist it. As more MukB binds the DNA, interactions between the hinge domains of MukB dimers become more likely leading to the formation of loops (Fig. 6B). These loops are topologically isolated and can be supercoiled by DNA gyrase (Fig. 6C). Aspects of this model are similar to models proposed recently describing the action of the yeast condensin (21Sun M. Nishino T. Marko J.F. The SMC1-SMC3 cohesin heterodimer structures DNA through supercoiling-dependent loop formation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 6149-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), MukB (25Rybenkov V.V.

Commun. 2016; 7: 10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using single molecule analyses of the effect of MukB on the length of DNA with one end tethered to a glass slide and the other held in magnetic tweezers, Cui et al. (14Cui Y. Petrushenko Z.M. Rybenkov V.V. MukB acts as a macromolecular clamp in DNA condensation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) proposed a stepwise condensation of DNA and inferred from their results that one aspect of the condensation would be the formation of loops in the DNA.Figure 6Model for MukB condensation of DNA. A, MukB protects a negative supercoil when bound to DNA. We propose that DNA binding by both the head domain and hinge domain is necessary for efficient negative supercoiling. The disposition of the DNA on the MukB hinge should not be taken literally. Whereas the amino acid residues mutated in the KE,RE variant are on the top of the hinge, we do not know precisely how DNA is bound to the hinge. One presumes that the DNA binds in such a manner that it does not interfere with MukB oligomerization via hinge–hinge interactions. B, MukB can form stable, topologically isolated loops in the DNA via hinge–hinge interactions between dimers. C, progressive DNA condensation by MukB is driven by the formation of topological loops in the DNA that can be further negatively supercoiled by DNA gyrase. D, effect of MukEF and ATP on MukB-DNA complexes. The indicated concentrations of MukB or the MukBEF complex in the presence or absence of ATP were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were then analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1A. Note that twice the concentration of MukBEF was required to observe similar DNA-binding activity compared with MukB alone. E, MukB does not trap DNA topologically. The indicated concentrations of MukB-HA, MukF, and MukEF, either in the presence or absence of ATP, were incubated with an equal mixture of nicked and linear DNA for 5 min at 37 °C. Panel i, anti-HA antibody attached to magnetic beads was then added and immediately thereafter NaCl was added to 0.5 m, the beads were washed in 0.75 m NaCl after pulldown, and the bound DNA was released by proteinase K digestion and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Panel ii shows the same experiment except that 0.5 m NaCl was added immediately before addition of the antibody beads. F, MukB does not trap DNA topologically. Tailed, nicked plasmid DNA attached to magnetic beads was incubated with the indicated concentrations of MukB, MukF, and MukEF either in the presence or absence of ATP in standard reaction buffer (low salt) for 5 min at 37 °C. The beads were then pulled down and resuspended in buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The beads were pulled down again, and the samples were resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading dye. After heating to 95 °C, the proteins released were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

SMC complexes: from DNA to chromosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), we addressed this issue directly. First, we asked whether MukF or MuKEF and ATP had an effect on MukB DNA condensation. MukEF appeared to stabilize the FMcx somewhat, but it also inhibited MukB binding overall. The mobility of the SMcx was unaffected, and ATP had little effect on either complex with or without MukEF being present (Fig. 6D). Thus, MukB alone is sufficient for DNA condensation, as has been demonstrated previously (14Cui Y. Petrushenko Z.M. Rybenkov V.V. MukB acts as a macromolecular clamp in DNA condensation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Second, we used the assay developed by Uhlmann's laboratory for topological trapping (27Murayama Y. Uhlmann F. Biochemical reconstitution of topological DNA binding by the cohesin ring.Nature. 2014; 505: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here, MukB-HA bound to a mixture of circular and linear DNA is captured by anti-HA antibodies bound to beads in the presence of 500 mm NaCl and washed with 750 mm NaCl. Persistence of the circular, but not linear, DNA after the high salt wash argues that the DNA had been bound topologically by the protein. Our initial result appeared to support a similar conclusion (Fig. 6E, panel i). Consistent with previous studies, the presence of MukEF and ATP decreased MukB DNA binding (9Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rybenkov V.V. Antagonistic interactions of kleisins and DNA with bacterial condensin MukB.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34208-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Cui Y. Petrushenko Z.M. Rybenkov V.V. MukB acts as a macromolecular clamp in DNA condensation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we were concerned that this result could be artifactual, dependent on the antibodies bound to the beads providing the topological seal that prevented dissociation of the circular DNA. This proved to be the case. If the high salt was added immediately before binding of MukB by the antibodies, no DNA was retained, neither circular nor linear (Fig. 6E, panel ii). Finally, we used an additional assay. Here, we bound tailed, nicked circular DNA to a magnetic bead, then bound MukB to the DNA in the presence or absence of MukEF and ATP, pulled down the beads to isolate the bound DNA, washed the beads with 500 mm NaCl, and then pulled them down again. After high salt washing, no MukB remained bound to the DNA (Fig. 6F). We conclude that MukB does not trap DNA topologically as proposed for the eukaryotic SMC proteins, lending support to our model for MukB binding. This is consistent with the observation that MukB can stably bind linear DNA (9Petrus"

To explore the physiological importance of Nisch, here we generated Nisch loss-of-function mutant mice and analyzed their metabolic phenotype. Nisch-mutant embryos exhibited delayed development, characterized by small size and attenuated weight gain. We uncovered the reason for this phenotype by showing that Nisch binds to and inhibits the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates energy homeostasis by suppressing anabolic and activating catabolic processes. The Nisch mutations enhanced AMPK activation and inhibited mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as in muscle and liver tissues of mutant mice. Nisch-mutant mice also exhibited increased rates of glucose oxidation with increased energy expenditure, despite reduced overall food intake. Moreover, the Nisch-mutant mice had reduced expression of liver markers of gluconeogenesis associated with increased glucose tolerance. As a result, these mice displayed decreased growth and body weight. Taken together, our results indicate that Nisch is an important AMPK inhibitor and a critical regulator of energy homeostasis, including lipid and glucose metabolism.

Our laboratory previously identified Nischarin, a novel protein that binds preferentially to the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α5 (1Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Nischarin, a novel protein that interacts with the integrin α5 subunit and inhibits cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Nischarin gene (nisch) was subsequently mapped to chromosome 3p21, a metastasis-suppressor locus that is frequently lost in several types of cancer (2Maziveyi M. Alahari S.K. Breast cancer tumor suppressors: a special emphasis on novel protein Nischarin.Cancer Res. 2015; 75: 4252-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, we have shown that overexpression of Nischarin inhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis (3Baranwal S. Wang Y. Rathinam R. Lee J. Jin L. McGoey R. Pylayeva Y. Giancotti F. Blobe G.C. Alahari S.K. Molecular characterization of the tumor-suppressive function of Nischarin in breast cancer.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2011; 103: 1513-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Specifically, Nischarin inhibits Rac-induced migration and invasion in breast and colon epithelial cells by inhibiting PAK1 and LIMK1 (4Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L.

A membrane proximal region of the integrin α5 subunit is important for its interaction with Nischarin.Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, Nischarin's tumor suppressor activity stems from its ability to regulate cytoskeletal signaling. Furthermore, we found that the LKB1 tumor suppressor interacts with the N terminus of Nischarin and, specifically, that amino acids 416–624 of Nischarin are crucial for this interaction (7Jain P. Baranwal S. Dong S. Struckhoff A.P. Worthylake R.A. Alahari S.K. Integrin-binding protein Nischarin interacts with tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) to regulate cell migration of breast epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15495-15509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other known binding partners include Rac1, Rab14, Rab9, and IRS1, -2, -3, and -4 (2Maziveyi M. Alahari S.K. Breast cancer tumor suppressors: a special emphasis on novel protein Nischarin.Cancer Res. 2015; 75: 4252-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To facilitate the interaction with these numerous binding partners, Nischarin contains multiple domains involved in protein–protein interactions, including a Phox domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a coiled-coil domain, an integrin-binding domain, a proline-rich domain, and the C-terminal region. Given its association with numerous proteins, we suspect Nischarin functions as a scaffolding protein chiefly involved in mediating extracellular to intracellular signaling.

Shaw R.J. The LKB1-AMPK pathway: metabolism and growth control in tumour suppression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Following a decrease in cell energy substrates, AMPK stimulates ATP-generating catabolic pathways, including glycolysis and uptake of glucose and fatty acids. Furthermore, activated AMPK suppresses ATP-consuming pathways such as lipogenesis and protein synthesis. Under conditions of energy stress, ATP levels fall, leading to rising levels of AMP, which binds to the γ-regulatory subunit AMPK and activates the enzyme allosterically (8Shackelford D.B. Shaw R.J. The LKB1-AMPK pathway: metabolism and growth control in tumour suppression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). In addition to directly regulating activity of key metabolic enzymes, AMPK also induces gene expression pathways that function to promote catabolic cell processes while inhibiting anabolic ones (9Suzuki T. Bridges D. Nakada D. Skiniotis G. Morrison S.J. Lin J.D. Saltiel A.R. Inoki K. Inhibition of AMPK catabolic action by GSK3.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because Nisch interacts with LKB1, we sought to determine to what extent Nisch affects AMPK signaling.

To further understand Nischarin's function and the nature of its protein interactions, we produced Nischarin-mutant mice by deleting the crucial LRR region. The resulting Nischarin mutant animals were characteristically small in size, leading us to hypothesize that Nischarin regulates pathways involved in growth and metabolism. Here, we show that Nischarin interacts with AMPK in vivo and thereby regulates its activity. Specifically, our findings revealed that mutating Nischarin resulted in findings indicative of greater overall AMPK activity, including increased glucose tolerance and suppression of lipogenic gene expression. More than 60,000 proteins from viruses to eukaryotes contain leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). LRRs have diverse functions; however, chief among them is the facilitation of protein–protein interaction (10de Wit J. Hong W. Luo L. Ghosh A.

U.S.A. 2010; 108 (Suppl. 1): 4631-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The length of LRR motifs is variable, ranging from 20–43 residues. All LRR units contain a highly conserved segment, consisting of LXXLXLXXNXL or LXXLXLXXCXXL, in which L represents Leu, Ile, Val, or Phe, N indicates Asn, Thr, Ser, or Cys, and C is usually Cys, Ser, or Asn. According to the length and consensus sequences of six LRRs in Nischarin, the 22-amino acid-long Nischarin LRRs most likely belongs to SDS22-like subfamily. To investigate the potential role of the Nischarin LRR domain in a physiological context, we generated Nischarin-mutant mice in association with the inGenious Targeting Laboratory (Stony Brook, NY). The targeting vector is designed to delete exons 7–10 (encoding 224–395 amino acids containing five LRRs) with insertion of a neo-cassette floxed by FRT and loxP sequences in intron 6 and another into intron 10 of the endogenous Nischarin locus (supplemental Fig. 1A). Appropriate homologous recombination in 129Sv/Ev embryonic stem (ES) cells was confirmed by Southern blotting (supplemental Fig. 1B). Successfully targeted ES cells were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Resulting chimeras were mated to wild-type C57BL/6 mice to generate F1 heterozygous offspring. Successful germ line transmission of the targeted allele (Tg) was confirmed by PCR using Lox1 and SDL2 (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). We crossed these F1 mice (NcTg) with C57BL/6 CMV-Flp mice to remove the neo-cassette (Nccond) (Δneo). We then backcrossed the Nccond mice to C57BL/6 mice six times to generate F5 Nccond mice (∼97% of C57BL/6 genetic background). To obtain whole-body Nischarin-mutant mice, we bred these F5 Nccond mice with C57BL/6 CMV-cre mice to generate Nischarin-mutant (NcΔe7–10) allele. The resulting Nischarin-mutant (NcΔe7–10) allele produced a truncated Nischarin protein lacking the LRR domain (Fig. 5A). Nischarin homozygous NcΔe7–10/Δe7–10 (mutant/mutant) mice were fertile and were born in the expected Mendelian ratio. As described below, mutant mice were reduced in size compared with wild-type animals (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we decided to examine the size of the embryos. We bred Nischarin heterozygous Nc+/Δe7–10 (Het) × heterozygous Nc+/Δe7–10 (Het). The embryos were extracted from gravid females 18.5 days after conception. As shown, the embryos of mutant mice are smaller than their wild-type counterparts (supplemental Fig. 2). Vertical/longitudinal sections were prepared and stained with H&E. Some distinguished differences in the brain, spine, and gut areas among wild-type and homozygous of 18.5-day embryos were noted (supplemental Fig. 3, A–C). These differences include reduced brain mass with abnormal organization of both the cerebrum and cerebellum and absence of the oral and nasal cavities (supplemental Fig. 3, B and C). Also, the gastrointestinal tract failed to completely form in the mutant embryos. Because the size of the animals varied significantly, we measured body weight over a period of 11 weeks (every 3 days during the first 21 days of the lactation period and every week after weaning for an additional 8 weeks). The body weight of male Nischarin Het mice at birth was slightly lower than that of wild-type mice and generally remained low for several weeks before eventually catching up to the wild-type mice at around week 10 (Fig. 1, A–C). In the mutant mice, however, the body weight at parturition was lower than that of either the wild-type or the Het mice and remained below normal throughout the entire life span of the animals. Both the male and female Nischarin-mutant mice exhibited dramatic growth retardation compared with wild-type mice for their entire life. However, the body weight of female Het mice did not show any significant difference from that of the wild-type mice (data not shown). We monitored the wild-type and Nischarin mutant C57BL/6 male mice for over 2 years, during which time the mutant mice remained consistently undersized. Mutant mice showed a significant decrease in body weight at 3, 10, and 15 months of age compared with WT mice (Fig. 2, A–D, and supplemental Fig. 4, A and B). In seeking to account for this, we speculated that a defect in metabolism was a likely source of the growth retardation in the mice. To examine this possibility, we chose to focus on the AMPK-signaling pathway, because it has previously been reported that disruption of LKB1–AMPK–mTOR signaling results in a reduction in mouse body weight, analogous to our observations (14Shan T. Xiong Y. Kuang S. Deletion of Lkb1 in adult mice results in body weight reduction and lethality.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 36561Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Zhang S. Readinger J.A. DuBois W.

The decreased body weight in the mutant animals corresponded with a reduction in food intake by the animals (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, blood glucose levels in 3-month-old Nischarin-mutant mice were decreased compared with control (Fig. 3C). To test the physiological effects of Nischarin gene deficiency, we examined fasting blood glucose level of wild-type and mutant mice at various time points after i.p. administration of glucose. Mutant animals exhibited improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 3, D and E). We similarly examined insulin tolerance. Consistent with glucose tolerance data, Nisch-mutant mice were initially insulin-sensitive but gradually became insensitive after 30 min (Fig. 3F).Figure 3Nischarin LRR mutation alters metabolism in mice.

Results are indicated as the percentage of initial blood glucose levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given our preliminary findings suggesting that AMPK function is altered in response to the Nischarin mutation status, we hypothesized that AMPK and Nischarin proteins interact. Because the AMPK α subunit is the major catalytic subunit mediating its function, we tested the interaction between AMPK and the LRR domains of Nischarin. Six LRR domains exist in Nischarin, which we deleted to make Nischarin-mutant mice (Fig. 4A). FLAG-AMPK and Myc-Nischarin were co-expressed in HEK-293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B). In addition, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and immunoblotted with anti-Myc (supplemental Fig. 5A). In either fashion, the interaction between Nischarin and AMPK was detected (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 5A). Also, both proteins co-localized within cells (supplemental Fig. 5B). We chose PC12 cells to demonstrate endogenous interaction, as they express a good amount of both AMPK and Nischarin protein. We were able to show the interaction of these endogenous proteins in PC12 cells by Western blotting (Fig. 4, D and E). To further validate this interaction in a physiological setting, we tested the interaction in the mouse liver and adipose tissue, which are key players in body metabolism. Once again, endogenous Nisch and AMPK proteins were found to interact in liver (Fig. 4C) and adipose tissue lysates (data not shown). As expected, we did not detect any endogenous Nisch and AMPK protein interaction in Nischarin mutant liver lysates (supplemental Fig. 5C). These data suggest that Nischarin interacts with AMPK. To study this interaction more closely, we prepared a construct that lacks the LRR domain and examined the effect on phosphorylation of AMPK. Deletion of the LRR domain from Nischarin resulted in an increase in AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4F, left panel), suggesting that Nischarin binding to AMPK inhibits its activation. Furthermore, LRR-deleted Nischarin exhibited weak binding to AMPK (Fig. 4F, right panel) suggesting that LRR domain is essential for Nischarin binding as well as inhibiting AMPK. To further examine the function of Nischarin, we generated wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous Nischarin mutant MEFs at the 13.5-embryonic day as described previously (16Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M. Valentin-Vega Y.A. Terzian T. Caldwell L.C. Strong L.C. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Gain of function of a p53 hot spot mutation in a mouse model of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.Cell. 2004; 119: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Mutant MEFs exhibited the same size as the wild-type MEFs based on our FACS analysis, and no changes in cell proliferation were detected (supplemental Fig. 6, data not shown). Consistent with cell proliferation data, there were no major differences in the cell cycle profiles (supplemental Fig. 7). As described above, Nischarin-mutant mice are smaller than their wild-type counterparts. One likely source of the growth defect could be the disruption of normal metabolism (17Soukas A.A. Kane E.A. Carr C.E. Melo J.A. Ruvkun G. Rictor/TORC2 regulates fat metabolism, feeding, growth, and life span in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 496-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As discussed previously, AMPK is a key metabolic sensor of cellular energy homeostasis (8Shackelford D.B. Shaw R.J. The LKB1-AMPK pathway: metabolism and growth control in tumour suppression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). In addition to being regulated by the cellular ATP:AMP ratio, however, AMPK activity is also controlled by phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by several regulatory kinases. LKB1, for example, is a major upstream serine/threonine kinase regulator of AMPK (8Shackelford D.B. Shaw R.J. The LKB1-AMPK pathway: metabolism and growth control in tumour suppression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Nischarin interacts with LKB1 through its integrin-binding domain (7Jain P. Baranwal S. Dong S. Struckhoff A.P. Worthylake R.A. Alahari S.K. Integrin-binding protein Nischarin interacts with tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) to regulate cell migration of breast epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15495-15509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, our current findings suggest that Nischarin interacts with AMPK through its LRR domain, resulting in inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Therefore, we explored to what extent Nischarin affects AMPK signaling. We found that Nischarin overexpression resulted in lower AMPK activity in HEK 293T cells (supplemental Fig. 5D). In contrast, Nischarin knockdown resulted in higher AMPK activity in PC12 cells (supplemental Fig. 5E). Mutant MEFs (+/− and −/−) showed higher AMPK activity as evidenced by the presence of higher levels of Thr-172-phosphorylated AMPK compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, Ser-79 phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a critical AMPK downstream substrate (8Shackelford D.B. Shaw R.J. The LKB1-AMPK pathway: metabolism and growth control in tumour suppression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), was also higher in mutant MEFs (Fig. 5A). We also assessed the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-signaling pathway, which is suppressed in response to AMPK activation. Specifically, we examined S6 and phospho-S6 (Ser-235), two well characterized mTOR signaling components (8Shackelford D.B. Shaw R.J. The LKB1-AMPK pathway: metabolism and growth control in tumour suppression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Consistent with the higher AMPK activity in mutant MEFs, we observed lower mTOR activity in mutant MEFs, as evidenced by lower levels of phosphorylated Ser-235 of S6 (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that Nischarin plays an important role in AMPK–mTOR signaling pathways. Given AMPK's crucial importance in glucose metabolism (18Liao Y. Takashima S. Maeda N. Ouchi N. Komamura K. Shimomura I. Hori M. Matsuzawa Y. Funahashi T. Kitakaze M. Exacerbation of heart failure in adiponectin-deficient mice due to impaired regulation of AMPK and glucose metabolism.Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of glucose deprivation and serum starvation using the wild-type and mutant MEFs. We wished to examine the effects of stress on AMPK signaling in wild-type and mutant MEFs to determine whether AMPK signaling responds in a similar fashion as when altered using AMPK-acting compounds. Following the starvation, we observed an increase in AMPK activity in WT but not in mutant MEFs for reasons that remain unclear. Consistent with this, we did not observe any changes in downstream effectors of AMPK (Fig. 5, C and D). AICAR is an AMP analog that activates AMPK (19Bergeron R. Russell 3rd, R.R. Young L.H. Ren J.M. Marcucci M. Lee A. Shulman G.I. Effect of AMPK activation on muscle glucose metabolism in conscious rats.Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E938-E944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant MEFs were more sensitive to treatment with 2 mm AICAR than wild-type MEFs, as evidenced by the greater induction of phospho-AMPK (Fig. 5, E and F). Consistent with this finding, phosphorylated ACC levels also displayed a more robust increase in the mutant MEFs, whereas phosphorylated S6 (S-235) levels were correspondingly decreased (Fig. 5, E and F). We also inhibited AMPK activity in MEFs using compound C, a direct AMPK inhibitor (20Liu X. Chhipa R.R. Nakano I. Dasgupta B. The AMPK inhibitor compound C is a potent AMPK-independent antiglioma agent.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2014; 13: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Once again, the Nisch-mutant MEFs demonstrated greater sensitivity than the non-mutant MEFs, as evidenced by a decrease in phospho-ACC and by increase in phospho-S6 (Fig. 5, G and H). These data suggest that mutant MEFs were more sensitive to AMPK activators and inhibitors than the wild-type MEFs. We wished to further investigate the role of Nischarin in vivo, particularly in tissues crucial for metabolic homeostasis, including liver and skeletal muscle. In mammals, AMPK signals in the hypothalamus, liver, and skeletal muscle regulate food intake, glucose uptake, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation (21Viollet B. Horman S. Leclerc J. Lantier L. Foretz M. Billaud M. Giri S. Andreelli F. AMPK inhibition in health and disease.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 276-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that growth defects in Nischarin-mutant mice could likely be due to the disturbance in normal metabolism following AMPK activation. Consistent with the results in MEFs, Nischarin mutation in the liver of 1-month-old mice increased AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172 (Fig. 6, A and C). The higher AMPK activity was also accompanied by an increased Ser-79 phosphorylation of ACC and decreased Ser-235 phosphorylation of S6 in liver (Fig. 6, A and C). Overnight fasting resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK in wild-type liver (Fig. 6A) without an increase in the phosphorylation of ACC and S6 in wild-type liver. Although overnight fasting did not change the phosphorylation of AMPK in the liver of Nischarin-mutant mice, the phosphorylation of ACC was abolished, and mTOR signaling was stimulated (Fig. 6A). We next investigated AMPK activation in skeletal muscle of Nischarin-mutant mice. In 1-month-old male mice, Nischarin mutation resulted in an increase of AMPK activity in the skeletal muscle, which was accompanied by an increased phosphorylation of ACC and decreased phosphorylation of S6 (Fig. 6, B and D). We did not observe a significant effect of overnight fasting on the AMPK signaling in skeletal muscle of wild-type mice. However, overnight fasting resulted in a significant increase on the phosphorylation of AMPK in the skeletal muscle of Nischarin-mutant mice (Fig. 6B). Similar results were also observed in the liver and skeletal muscle of 3-month-old male mice (data not shown). To explore the consequence of increased AMPK activation in muscle and liver, we quantified the expression levels of critical lipogenic genes by qRT-PCR. Activation of AMPK promotes inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC. It has also been shown that fatty-acid synthase (FAS) expression is reduced in response to AMPK activation. Consistent with these reports, Nischarin mutation reduced FAS (Fig. 7, A and C). Activation of AMPK has previously been shown to alter the function of lipogenic genes, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1c) and the carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP) (22Li Y.

Horikawa Y. ChREBP: a glucose-activated transcription factor involved in the development of metabolic syndrome.Endocr. J. 2008; 55: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The expression of SREBP1c and ChREBP mRNA was reduced in Nischarin mutant liver and muscle tissues (Fig. 7, B and D). In short, Nischarin-mutated tissues showed reduced gene expression of lipogenic enzymes. We also examined the expression of several critical gluconeogenic genes, including glucose-6-phosphatase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC1α), in mouse liver and skeletal muscle. Glc-6-Pase hydrolyzes glucose 6-phosphate, yielding a phosphate group and a free molecule of glucose, which can then be exported from the cell. Consistent with previous observations that activation of AMPK (e.g. using metformin, an AMPK-activating drug) leads to suppression of Glc-6-Pase (24Ota S. Horigome K. Ishii T. Nakai M. Hayashi K. Kawamura T. Kishino A. Taiji M. Kimura T. Metformin suppresses glucose-6-phosphatase expression by a complex I inhibition and AMPK activation-independent mechanism.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The mechanisms underlying the cellular context–dependent R-point decision remain poorly understood. We found that the R-point was dysregulated in Runx3−/−mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which formed tumors in nude mice. Ectopic expression of Runx3 restored the R-point and abolished the tumorigenicity of Runx3−/−MEFs and K-Ras–activated Runx3−/−MEFs (Runx3−/−;K-RasG12D/+). During the R-point, Runx3 transiently formed a complex with pRb and Brd2 and induced Cdkn1a (p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1; p21), a key regulator of the R-point transition. Cyclin D–CDK4/6 promoted dissociation of the pRb–Runx3–Brd2 complex, thus turning off p21 expression. However, cells harboring oncogenic K-Ras maintained the pRb–Runx3–Brd2 complex and p21 expression even after introduction of Cyclin D1. Thus, Runx3 plays a critical role in R-point regulation and defense against cellular transformation."

Our results reveal a new function of O-glycosylation in the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. The kidney acts as an ultrafiltration unit to remove toxins and waste products from the body. Filtration in the kidney occurs via the glomerulus, which consists of a specialized capillary bed and support cells. The vascular cells of the glomerulus are fenestrated, flattened endothelial cells and are surrounded by podocytes, specialized support cells that envelop the glomerular capillaries by extending foot processes that interdigitate with foot process from adjacent podocytes (1Brinkkoetter P.T.

Glomerulosclerosis, which presents with proteinuria in over 70% of cases, is a major clinical problem because scarred glomeruli cannot be repaired; many patients experience progressive glomerulosclerosis and eventual kidney failure. Therefore, it is imperative to identify factors that perturb the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and participate in the etiology of glomerulosclerosis. Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by addition of a GalNAc to serine or threonine residues on a peptide backbone (3Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1999: 1-26Google Scholar). Core 1–derived O-glycans (O-glycans), a major form of O-glycans, are formed by addition of a galactose to the GalNAc by core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1galt1) (4Ju T. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M.

The core 1 structures can be further extended and modified to form sialylated complex O-glycans (3Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1999: 1-26Google Scholar). O-glycans are highly expressed in different components of the glomerular filtration barrier, with unclear functions (5Liu Z.-H.

In this study, we found that mice with deficiency of O-glycans exhibit spontaneous proteinuria and rapidly progressing glomerulosclerosis. Lack of O-glycosylation results in defective podocalyxin signaling function. These results reveal new function of O-glycans in homeostasis of the glomerulus. To determine whether O-glycans play a significant role in kidney function, we generated mice with a doxycycline-inducible global deficiency of core 1 O-glycans (iC1galt1−/−), which were generated by first crossing C1galt1f/f mice with Rosa26-rtTA;tetO-Cre Tg mice, and then treated C1galt1f/f;Rosa26-rtTA;tetO-Cre Tg mice with doxycycline postnatally from day 1 for 4 months (8Pan Y.

Podoplanin requires sialylated O-glycans for stable expression on lymphatic endothelial cells and for interaction with platelets.Blood. 2014; 124: 3656-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We confirmed the C1galt1 deletion by immunohistochemical staining for Tn antigen, which is exposed in the absence of core 1 O-glycans. As expected, wild-type controls did not exhibit Tn signals within the glomerular capillary tuft, podocytes covering the tuft, parietal epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule, tubules, or the interstitial blood vessels. In contrast, iC1galt1−/− mice exhibited significant Tn expression in all of these locations (Fig. 1, A and B). iC1galt1−/− mice had significant proteinuria at the time of sacrifice (∼4 months old) (Fig. 1, B and C). Gross analysis revealed that iC1galt1−/− mice showed contracted, paler, and corrugated kidneys (Fig. 1D). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, which highlights irregularities of the glomerular architecture, showed that iC1galt1−/− mice had adhesion formation between the glomerular capillary tufts and Bowman's capsule, obliteration of glomerular capillaries with hyalinosis, and severe intra- and periglomerular immune cell infiltrations (Fig. 1E) relative to WT controls. Masson trichrome staining (MTS) further demonstrated glomerular scarring, tubular atrophy, proteinaceous casts, and interstitial fibrosis in iC1galt1−/− mice (Fig. 1F). To corroborate our finding, we sought to investigate whether spontaneous glomerulosclerosis occurs in adult mice with deficiency of C1galt1. Global deletion of C1galt1 in adult mice was achieved by administration of doxycycline to 6-week-old C1galt1f/f;Rosa26-rtTA;tetO-Cre Tg mice for 2 weeks. The kidneys of iC1galt1−/− mice expressed Tn antigen in endothelial cells of glomerular capillaries and interstitial blood vessels as well as in podocytes and tubular epithelial cells. Spontaneous albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and broad capsular adhesions were observed in these mice by 8 weeks post-induction (Fig. 2, A–C) (9Tian X. Kim J.J. Monkley S.M. Gotoh N. Nandez R.

These results demonstrated that O-glycans play a major role in maintaining the glomerular filtration function in healthy adult mice. To investigate how a lack of O-glycans leads to abnormal kidney architecture and function, we determined renal defects at early time points after induced deletion of O-glycans. 6-week-old C1galt1f/f;Rosa26-rtTA;tetO-Cre Tg mice and WT littermates were fed food containing doxycycline for 2 weeks. Minimal irregularities of glomerular filtration or architecture were observed in these mice another 2 weeks after doxycycline-induced deletion of C1galt1 (Fig. 3, A and B). However, we found that the ultrastructures of the podocyte–endothelium interface were strikingly different in iC1galt1−/− mice compared with age-matched controls. Early effects of loss of O-glycans were collapse of the space between foot processes and secondary processes and thickening of the glomerular basement membranes, whereas WT littermates displayed podocyte foot process interdigitations (Fig. 3, C and D). These results support the theory that changes in podocyte foot processes in the absence of O-glycans are a prerequisite for development of the renal phenotype. Podocyte foot processes associate with many O-glycosylated sialoproteins such as podoplanin and podocalyxin (10Matsui K. Breitender-Geleff S. Soleiman A. Kowalski H. Kerjaschki D.

However, we found that postnatal global deletion of podoplanin only resulted in mild renal disease by 4 months post-induction (Fig. 4). This led us to focus on another O-glycoprotein, podocalyxin, which is expressed predominately at secondary foot processes of podocytes (14Kerjaschki D. Sharkey D.J. Farquhar M.G.

Med. 2001; 194: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which is compatible with the phenotypes we observed in mice lacking O-glycans. We examined the effect of reduced O-glycosylation on podocalyxin expression and function. Podocalyxin displayed a slower electrophoretic mobility but comparable expression in kidneys from iC1galt1−/− mice compared with WT littermate controls (Fig. 5, A and B). Immunoprecipitated podocalyxin from iC1galt1−/− mice displayed a concomitant increase in VVL staining (binding to Tn antigen) but decreased MALII and SNA staining (binding to sialylated glycans) by Western blotting, suggestive of a dramatic decrease in sialylated O-glycans on podocalyxin (Fig. 5B). In vitro evidence demonstrated that deletion of O-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain of podocalyxin affects its apical targeting. Podocalyxin and its cytoplasmic binding partner NHERF participate in the formation of an apical scaffold (16Meder D. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Füllekrug J.

Given these findings, one plausible mechanism is that O-glycans are required for the correct distribution and signaling function of podocalyxin at the apical surface of podocytes. Intriguingly, we found that loss of O-glycosylation decreased both co-immunoprecipitation of podocalyxin by NHERF2 and co-localization of podocalyxin and pEzrin along the apical plasma membrane of podocytes (Fig. 5, C and D). These data suggest that loss of the podocalyxin interaction with NHERF2/pEzrin is a potential effector mechanism of renal dysfunction following loss of O-glycans.Figure 5Sialoproteins such as podocalyxin are targets of O-glycosylation in glomerulosclerosis.

The spectrum of podocytopathies: a unifying view of glomerular diseases.Kidney Int. 2007; 71: 1205-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). To evaluate a possible role for podocyte O-glycans in maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier, we determined whether a podocyte-specific deletion of C1galt mimics the renal defects in iC1galt1−/− mice. We generated adult mice with an inducible podocyte-specific deletion of C1galt1 by crossing C1galtf/f mice with podocin-iCreER(T2) mice, which express tamoxifen-inducible Cre in podocytes (22Wang J. Wang Y. Long J. Chang B.H. Wilson M.H. Overbeek P. Danesh F.R. Tamoxifen-inducible podocyte-specific iCre recombinase transgenic mouse provides a simple approach for modulation of podocytes in vivo.Genesis. 2010; 48: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that C1galtf/f;podocin-iCreER(T2) mice treated with tamoxifen postnatally from day 21 for 6 months developed albuminuria spontaneously. The kidneys of tamoxifen-treated mice were analyzed in further detail by PAS and MTS, which revealed gross histological changes, beginning with severely distorted and sclerosed glomeruli, compared with littermate controls (Fig. 6). These findings indicate that O-glycans on podocytes play an essential role in glomerular filtration barrier maintenance. O-glycans are highly expressed on glomerular capillary endothelial cells, their supporting podocytes, and tubular cells in the kidney. We found that global loss of O-glycans in adult iC1galt1−/− mice results in spontaneous proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Further analysis indicates that O-glycosylation of podocytes is essential to protect the integrity of the glomerulus. In particular, O-glycosylation is important for podocalyxin to interact with NHERF2/pEzrin, which contribute to glomerular filtration barrier maintenance. Postnatal Tn exposure because of C1galt1 deficiency may elicit an immune response (23Ju T. Otto V.I. Cummings R.D. The Tn antigen-structural simplicity and biological complexity.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 1770-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which may lead to kidney glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. However, we found that crossing our adult iC1galt1−/− with Rag1−/− mice, which lack T cells and B cells (24Picarella D.E. Kratz A. Li C.B. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A.

Sialylation commonly occurs on O-glycans. Our iC1galt1−/− mice show reduced sialylation. Previously reports show that the morphologic alterations of podocytes are associated with a reduction in the sialic acid content of podocalyxin in puromycin aminonucleoside–treated rats (26Kerjaschki D. Vernillo A.T. Farquhar M.G. Reduced sialylation of podocalyxin - the major sialoprotein of the rat-kidney glomerulus - in aminonucleoside nephrosis.Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 118: 343-349PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takeda T. McQuistan T. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Loss of glomerular foot processes is associated with uncoupling of podocalyxin from the actin cytoskeleton.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and systemic administration of a sugar analog that eliminates sialylation causes profound kidney dysfunction (28Macauley M.S. Arlian B.M. Rillahan C.D. Pang P.C. Bortell N. Marcondes M.C. Haslam S.M. Dell A. Paulson J.C. Systemic blockade of sialylation in mice with a global inhibitor of sialyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 35149-35158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Together, these data support that loss of sialylation may alter the function of podocalyxin. The mouse genetic approach we used in this study results in prolonged impairment of sialomucins and, thus, convincingly validates the importance of sialomucins in the kidney. The readouts, changes in the distribution of podocalyxin, and changes in podocalyxin signaling are logical outcomes of the loss of C1galt1 function by cells that make podocalyxin. Most of the data are derived from mice with inducible global deletion of C1galt1. Even though the proteinuria/glomerulosclerosis phenotype is largely reproduced in mice with podocyte-specific deletion of C1galt1, indirect contributions of deficiency of O-glycans in cell types other than podocytes might also contribute to these abnormalities. Future studies are needed to address this issue. In humans, podocalyxin expression in glomeruli by immunohistochemical evaluation is found to be reduced or lost in FSGS (29Gebeshuber C.A. Kornauth C. Dong L. Sierig R. Seibler J. Reiss M. Tauber S. Bilban M. Wang S. Kain R. Böhmig G.A. Moeller M.J. Gröne H.J. Englert C. Martinez J. Kerjaschki D. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is induced by microRNA-193a and its downregulation of WT1.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that adult mice with loss of C1galt1 exhibited reduced podocalyxin levels. However, podocalyxin levels appeared to be normal in mice with earlier stages of renal disease following deletion of C1galt1 (30Guo J.K. Menke A.L. Gubler M.C. Clarke A.R. Harrison D. Hammes A. Hastie N.D. Schedl A. WT1 is a key regulator of podocyte function: reduced expression levels cause crescentic glomerulonephritis and mesangial sclerosis.Hum. Mol.

Samuel K. et al.Acute multiple organ failure in adult mice deleted for the developmental regulator Wt1.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002404Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced levels of podocalyxin in glomeruli might be caused by loss of podocytes. On the other hand, excretion of podocalyxin in the urine demonstrates a prognostic value for proteinuria development and kidney function in FSGS (32Hara M. Yanagihara T. Kihara I. Higashi K. Fujimoto K. Kajita T. Apical cell membranes are shed into urine from injured podocytes: a novel phenomenon of podocyte injury.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Given that O-glycosylation functions as an essential regulatory mechanism of podocalyxin expression and function, further studies of how O-glycans regulates podocalyxin function will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis, and an ability to detect aberrant O-glycosylation will shed new light on the prognosis of glomerulosclerosis. We previously reported mice in which C1galt1 was flanked by loxP sites (C1galt1f/f mice) (12Fu J. Gerhardt H. McDaniel J.M. Xia B. Liu X. Ivanciu L. Ny A. Hermans K. Silasi-Mansat R. McGee S. Nye E.

Invest. 2008; 118: 3725-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We also reported mice with doxycycline-inducible global deficiency of C1galt1 (iC1galt1−/−), which were generated by crossing C1galt1f/f mice with Rosa26-rtTA, tetO-Cre Tg mice (8Pan Y. Yago T. Fu J.

To induce postnatal deletion of C1galt1, mice were fed food containing doxycycline starting from postnatal days 1 to 4 months of age. Adult deletion was accomplished by feeding 6-week-old mice for 2 weeks. Wild-type littermates treated with the same regimen were used as controls. Tamoxifen-inducible podocyte-specific C1galt1 knock-out mice were obtained by crossing C1galt1f/f mice with podocin-iCreER(T2) mice that express Cre recombinase specifically in the podocytes (22Wang J.

Deletion of C1galt1 in C1galt1f/f; podocin-iCreER(T2) adult mice was accomplished by administrating tamoxifen (1 mg per day) for 5 consecutive days beginning at P21 and then once a week thereafter. We previously reported a strategy to generate mice with global inducible deletion of podoplanin (PDPNf/f;CagCre mice) (13Herzog B.H. Fu J. Wilson S.J. Hess P.R. Sen A. McDaniel J.M. Pan Y. Sheng M.

Lupu F. et al.Podoplanin maintains high endothelial venule integrity by interacting with platelet CLEC-2.Nature. 2013; 502: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, Pdpnf/f mice were crossed with CAG-Cre-ERT2 Tg mice. To induce postnatal deletion of podoplanin, tamoxifen (20 μg per day) was administered orally from P1–5. WT littermates (Pdpnf/w;CagCre or Pdpnf/f) treated with the same regimen were used as controls. All vertebrate procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. Urine samples were collected from knock-out mice and littermate controls, briefly centrifuged, diluted, and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Albuminuria was assessed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Urine albumin levels were measured qualitatively and in duplicate using an albumin ELISA quantitation kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Exocell), and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Urine creatinine was measured in duplicate for each sample with a modified Jaffe reaction at an absorbance of 500 nm (Bio-Rad microplate reader). Mouse kidney tissues were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. All sections (3 μm in thickness) were stained with H&E, PAS (Thermo Scientific) or MTS (Sigma) according to the standard procedures or the instructions of the manufacturer. For transmission EM, kidneys were fixed in Karnovsky fixative containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1% cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by post-fixation with 1% osmium tetraoxide in cacodylate buffer for 90 min at 4 °C and mordanting with 1% tannic acid in cacodylate buffer. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Hitachi H-7600 transmission electron microscope located in the Imaging Core Facility of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. We followed histological scoring methods described previously (9Tian X. Kim J.J. Monkley S.M. Gotoh N. Nandez R. Soda K. Inoue K. Balkin D.M. Hassan H. Son S.H. Lee Y. Moeckel G. Calderwood D.A.

For IHC staining, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and alcohol series. After inactivation of endogenous peroxidase with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and blocking with normal blocking serum, the sections were incubated with glycosylation-independent goat anti-podocalyxin antibody (R&D Systems) or biotinylated mAb against Tn antigen (mouse IgM, clone Ca3638) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivity was visualized using a peroxidase diaminobenzidine kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were then washed, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted, and photomicrographs were obtained. For IF staining, sections were blocked as described above and then incubated with primary antibody against CD31 (clone MEC13.3, Pharmingen, after treatment with 0.1% trypsin), podocalyxin (R&D Systems), CD45 (clone I3/2.3, Abcam), phosphorylated EzrinThr-567 (pEzrin, Cell Signaling Technology), or biotinylated mAb against Tn antigen (mouse IgM, clone Ca3638) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the respective secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent labels (Alexa Flour 594 or 488, 1:500, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed in PBS, stained with DAPI, and mounted, and immunofluorescence images were obtained using an Olympus fluorescence microscope equipped with Slidebook 5.0 analysis software. For immunoprecipitation, kidney cortices were lysed with RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 4 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were renatured using 9 volumes of ice-cold RIPA buffer and then prepared for immunoprecipitation as follows. Cell lysates were precleared with protein A+G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with antibodies against podocalyxin (R&D Systems) or NHERF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C. For negative controls, an equal concentration of goat IgG was added instead of specific antibodies. Precipitated proteins were eluted from beads using 2% SDS in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and diluted 1:20 with RIPA buffer, followed by Western blotting. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–15% acrylamide), followed by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocking with 5% milk (w/v). Primary antibodies against VVL, MALII, or SNA (Vector Laboratories) were incubated at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation at room temperature with the respective horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiography. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.

Rotation occurs in 120° power strokes separated by dwells when F1 synthesizes or hydrolyzes ATP. F0 and F1 complexes connect via a central rotor stalk and a peripheral stator stalk. A major unresolved question is the mechanism in which the interaction between subunit-a and rotating subunit-c–ring in the F0 motor uses the flux of H+ across the membrane to induce clockwise rotation against the force of counterclockwise rotation driven by the F1-ATPase. In single-molecule measurements of F0F1 embedded in lipid bilayer nanodiscs, we observed that the ability of the F0 motor to form transient dwells increases with decreasing pH. Transient dwells can halt counterclockwise rotation powered by the F1-ATPase in steps equivalent to the rotation of single c-subunits in the c-ring of F0, and can push the common axle shared by the two motors clockwise by as much as one c-subunit. Because the F0 proton half-channels that access the periplasm and the cytoplasm are exposed to the same pH, these data are consistent with the conclusion that the periplasmic half-channel is more easily protonated in a manner that halts ATPase-driven rotation by blocking ATPase-dependent proton pumping.

The F-ATP synthases, located in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, are members of a family of rotary molecular motors that also include archaeal A-ATP synthases, bacterial A/V-like ATP synthases, and eukaryotic vacuolar V-ATPases (1Spetzler D.

The F-ATP synthases are composed of two opposed rotary motors known as the membrane-embedded F0, and the extrinsic membrane protein complex F1 (Fig. 1). These motors are connected by a central stalk that serves as the rotor and a peripheral stalk that is a component of the stator (2Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E.

The rotor consists of the γ-subunit that protrudes from the center of the (αβ)3-ring, the ϵ-subunit, and the ring of c-subunits of F0.

The two half-channels are separated by aArg210 that effectively deprotonates cAsp61 as each successive c-subunit rotates into close proximity of its resonance-stabilized positive charge (19Lightowlers R.N.

This equates to 500–750 μs per proton translocated during the rotational stepping of single c-subunits in E. coli that has a c10-ring. The ability to observe single c-subunit stepping of the c-ring on this time scale was first achieved in single-molecule experiments by monitoring ATPase-driven rotation using a gold nanorod attached to the c-ring of F0F1 embedded in lipid bilayer nanodiscs (n-F0F1) (23Ishmukhametov R.

Although some power strokes rotated CCW in continuous 120° events, many were periodically interrupted by “transient dwells.” These dwells occurred at an average interval of ∼36°, consistent with single c-subunit stepping of the c10-ring of E. coli F0F1. The duration of transient dwells ranged from 50 to175 μs. Although somewhat shorter than the duration of c-subunit stepping anticipated during ATP synthesis, transient dwells are observed in the presence of high ATP concentrations that optimize ATP hydrolysis in lieu of synthesis. The fraction of power strokes that contain transient dwells can be increased to the point at which they are present in all power strokes of most data sets (∼80% average occurrence in all power strokes) through the use of viscosity-dependent drag to decrease the angular velocity of the F1-ATPase power stroke. Mutations in subunit-a and subunit-c have been identified that affect the ability to form transient dwells (18Martin J. Hudson J. Hornung T. Frasch W.D. F0-driven rotation in the ATP synthase direction against the force of F1 ATPase in the F0F1 ATP synthase.J. Biol.

Direct observation of stepped proteolipid ring rotation in E. coli F0F1 ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3911-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that these dwells result when subunit-a forms a “leash” with the c-ring that limits CCW rotation to a maximum of ∼36° while engaged. Subunit-a was not only observed to halt CCW rotation of the c-ring in n-F0F1 but, in >70% of all transient dwells, was also able to push the rotor CW against ATPase-dependent rotation powered by F1 (18Martin J. Hudson J. Hornung T. Frasch W.D. F0-driven rotation in the ATP synthase direction against the force of F1 ATPase in the F0F1 ATP synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 10717-10728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The extent of CW rotation in the ATP synthesis direction averaged 11°, but could be as much as ∼36°, which is equivalent to rotation of the c-ring by one c-subunit relative to subunit-a. Using proteoliposomes in which the F1 complex of F0F1 is on the outside, high rates of ATP synthesis require transmembrane proton gradients with a ΔpH = 3. This is typically achieved by equilibrating the pH inside the liposome to 5.5 and then rapidly shifting the outside pH to 8.5 (6Turina P. Samoray D. Gräber P. H+/ATP ratio of proton transport-coupled ATP synthesis and hydrolysis catalysed by CF0F1-liposomes.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Fischer S. Etzold C. Turina P. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Gräber P. ATP synthesis catalyzed by the ATP synthase of Escherichia coli reconstituted into liposomes.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus far, single-molecule rotation studies of F0F1 embedded in nanodiscs have been examined only at pH 8.0. We now present a single-molecule study of the pH dependence of transient dwell formation by n-F0F1. The occurrence of transient dwells increased inversely with pH over the pH range of 5.0 to 7.0. Transient dwells formed at low pH at intervals of ∼36° lasted an average of 118–158 μs and were able to push the c-ring CW against the force of ATPase-dependent CCW rotation by as much as one c-subunit. These results show that even though both F0 half-channels were exposed to the same pH, the periplasmic half-channel that serves as the ATP synthase proton import channel is more easily protonated in a manner that halted ATPase-driven rotation by blocking ATPase-dependent proton pumping. Rotation of the c-ring of single n-F0F1 molecules was monitored as a function of time by changes in the intensity of polarized red light scattered from a 80 × 40-nm gold nanorod attached to the c-ring (Fig. 2). For each molecule examined, multiple 5-s data sets of ATP hydrolysis-powered rotation were acquired in the presence of 1 mm Mg-ATP at a data acquisition rate of 100 kHz. At this saturating substrate concentration, E. coli F1 produces power strokes that rotate 120° CCW on a time scale of ∼300 μs, which are separated by catalytic dwells with a duration of a few milliseconds (5Spetzler D. Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Day L.J. Martin J. Frasch W.D. Single molecule measurements of F1-ATPase reveal an interdependence between the power stroke and the dwell duration.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7979-7985Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Spetzler D. York J. Daniel D. Fromme R. Lowry D. Frasch W. Microsecond time scale rotation measurements of single F1-ATPase molecules.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3117-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The intensity of polarized red light that is scattered from the long axis of the nanorod oscillates in a sinusoidal manner as the nanorod rotates relative to the direction of the polarizing filter in the light path of the microscope, which is captured by a single photon detector (25Hornung T. Martin J. Spetzler D. Ishmukhametov R. Frasch W.D. Microsecond resolution of single-molecule rotation catalyzed by molecular motors.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 778: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Examples of n-F0F1 power strokes that contain or lack transient dwells at pH 5.0 are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. Prior to data collection of each molecule, the polarizing filter was rotated to minimize the scattered light intensity from one of the three catalytic dwells. During the subsequent power stroke, the light intensity increased through a maximum as the nanorod rotated CCW 90°. Each data set acquired contained ∼300 power strokes that fit to these criteria, and were analyzed for the presence of transient dwells. In the absence of transient dwells, the power stroke rotated CCW continuously at angular velocities that were comparable with that of purified F1-ATPase (26Martin J.L. Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Ahmad Z. Frasch W.D. Anatomy of F1-ATPase powered rotation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 3715-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transient dwells that stopped the CCW rotation driven by the F1-ATPase, and those that rotated the c-ring CW against the force of the F1 power stroke at pH 5.0, are indicated as green and red data, respectively (Fig. 3A). The average periodicity of transient dwells as a function of pH is shown in Fig. 4A. At pH 5.0, transient dwells occurred an average of every 35.3 ± 0.3 (S.E.). This periodicity did not change significantly between pH 5.0 and 9.0, and is consistent with a mechanism in which transient dwells result from stepping by single c-subunits in the c10-ring of E. coli F0F1. The duration of transient dwells was ∼118 μs at pH 5.0 and at pH 9.0, but increased with pH to a maximum value of ∼158 μs at pH 8.0 (Fig. 4B), which amounted to a change of ∼25% over the pH range examined. In the absence of transient dwells, power strokes rotated the first 90° from the catalytic dwell at pH 5.0 in ∼250 μs, which was comparable with power strokes of soluble E. coli F1-ATPase (5Spetzler D. Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Day L.J. Martin J. Frasch W.D. Single molecule measurements of F1-ATPase reveal an interdependence between the power stroke and the dwell duration.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7979-7985Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Spetzler D. York J. Daniel D. Fromme R. Lowry D. Frasch W. Microsecond time scale rotation measurements of single F1-ATPase molecules.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3117-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When transient dwells were present, the increase in the time required to rotate 90° resulted from the duration of the transient dwells. Fig. 5 shows the average percent of transient dwells formed per data set during n-F0F1 power strokes as a function of pH, where each data set contained about 300 power strokes. At pH 9.0, about 23% of the power strokes contained transient dwells, and transient dwell formation did not change significantly from this value between pH 9.0 and pH 7.5. However, the occurrence of transient dwells increased with decreasing pH between pH 7.5 and pH 5.0 to an average of ∼48% at pH 5.0. The fit of these data to the Henderson-Hasselbach relationship suggested that protonation of a group with a pK of 6.3 was necessary to form a transient dwell. However, it is clear that the average changes in transient dwell formation between pH 6.0 and 7.5 did not fit particularly well to the dependence on the protonation of a single group. The distributions of single-molecule rotation data sets of n-F0F1 power strokes at each pH as a function of the percentage of transitions in each data set that contain transient dwells are shown in Fig. 6A (gray bars). The percentage of transient dwells formed per data set that each contained ∼300 power strokes was determined, and the data sets were binned into groups for each 10% occurrence of transient dwells formed. Although the percentage of transient dwells formed per data set shown in Fig. 5 was taken from the averages of these distributions, it is clear that these data did not fit to a normal distribution over the pH range examined. In several data sets at pH values between 5.0 and 6.0, transient dwells formed in 90–100% of the power strokes. The E. coli F0F1 structure determined by cryo-EM was observed to exist in three states that differed in the rotary positions of the central stalk relative to the peripheral stalk by 120° (11Sobti M. Smits C. Wong A.S. Ishmukhametov R. Stock D. Sandin S. Stewart A.G. Cryo-EM structures of the autoinhibited E. coli ATP synthase in three rotational states.eLife. 2016; 5: e21598Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the distributions of transient dwells observed in Fig. 6A could result in differences of the three structural states, three Gaussian curves for which the probability of forming transient dwells was low (blue line), medium (red line), and high (green line) were generated. The sum of the three Gaussians (black line) were fit to the measured distribution at each pH (gray bars). The average values of transient dwells formed represented by each of the three Gaussian curves increased inversely with pH (Fig. 7). The Gaussian fit with the highest probability of forming transient dwells (green) increased to the greatest extent, and had an average value of 70% transient dwell formation per data set at pH 5.0. The distributions of the extent to which subunit-a was able to force the c-ring to rotate CW against the ATPase-driven CCW power stroke during the transient dwell as a function of pH are shown in Fig. 6B. The maximal extent of these “backsteps” in the CW direction was about 36°, equivalent to the rotation of the c10-ring by one c-subunit. The distributions of the extent of the backsteps was plotted as a difference from that of pH 5.5 for which the extent of the backstep was lowest (Fig. 6C). The average changes in the extent of the backstep as a function of pH were insignificant, ranging from ∼11° at pH 5.5 to a maximum of about 13° at pH 7.0. The percentage of transient dwells that contained backsteps varied only by ∼13% as a function of pH from a minimum to a maximum of 67 to 80% at pH 5.0 and 7.0, respectively (Fig. 8). The results presented here show that the occurrence of transient dwells increases as the pH of the medium becomes more acidic. Subunit-a is the stator component in the F0 complex that contains both half-channels for proton translocation across the membrane (27Fillingame R.H. Steed P.R. Half channels mediating H+ transport and the mechanism of gating in the F0 sector of Escherichia coli F0F1 ATP synthase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1837: 1062-1068Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). High rates of ATP synthesis are achieved in inverted membrane vesicles of E. coli when the periplasmic and cytoplasmic half-channels are exposed to pH 5.5 and 8.5, respectively (6Turina P. Samoray D. Gräber P. H+/ATP ratio of proton transport-coupled ATP synthesis and hydrolysis catalysed by CF0F1-liposomes.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Fischer S. Etzold C. Turina P. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Gräber P. ATP synthesis catalyzed by the ATP synthase of Escherichia coli reconstituted into liposomes.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a result of this non-equilibrium gradient, protons enter F0 through the periplasmic half-channel (the ATP synthase input channel) to induce CW rotation of the c-ring. Conversely, ATPase-driven proton pumping occurs as the result of protons entering F0 from the cytoplasm as the result of CCW rotation induced by ATP hydrolysis in F1. Transient dwells result from the ability of subunit-a to interact with subunit-c in a manner that stops ATPase-dependent CCW rotation of the c-ring, and results in CW rotation in the ATP synthesis direction ∼ 80% of the time (Fig. 8). Modification of cAsp61 in the c-ring by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) effectively inhibits ATPase activity of F0F1 embedded in nanodiscs (23Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Spetzler D. Frasch W.D. Direct observation of stepped proteolipid ring rotation in E. coli F0F1 ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3911-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that this ATPase-dependent rotation is linked to proton pumping across the lipid bilayer. A major difference between a membrane and a nanodisc is that in the latter, which was used in the single-molecule experiments here, both half-channels are exposed to the same pH. The rate of F1-ATPase activity measured in ensemble assays decreases with pH between pH 7.5 and 6.5 by ∼2-fold (28Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Tryptophan-free Escherichia coli F1-ATPase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), during which the increase in transient dwells is the greatest (Fig. 5). However, it is noteworthy that the rate-limiting step that determines ATPase activity occurs during the catalytic dwell, and not angular velocity of the power stroke (26Martin J.L. Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Ahmad Z. Frasch W.D. Anatomy of F1-ATPase powered rotation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 3715-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which can contribute to the formation of transient dwells (23Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Spetzler D. Frasch W.D. Direct observation of stepped proteolipid ring rotation in E. coli F0F1 ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3911-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, although the potential contribution of the pH dependence to the angular velocity of the F1-ATPase cannot be ruled out, these data strongly suggest that the periplasmic half-channel is more easily protonated than is the cytoplasmic half-channel. This preferential protonation of the periplasmic half-channel halts ATPase-driven rotation, and thereby blocks ATPase-dependent proton pumping. Residues that contribute to proton translocation include aAsn214, aGlu219, aHis245, and aGln252 in the periplasmic half-channel, and aGlu196 in the cytoplasmic half-channel (15Cain B.D. Simoni R.D.

Several additional residues are likely to have a role, especially in the cytoplasmic half-channel that is currently less well defined. When ATP synthase is driven by a high non-equilibrium pH gradient (ΔpH = 3), the periplasmic half-channel is exposed to a proton concentration 1000-fold higher than is the cytoplasmic channel. At such a high concentration, the groups in the former half-channel will be rapidly reprotonated after each donation of a proton to cAsp61, which induces CW rotation of the c-ring, and minimizes the probability that the c-ring will subsequently rotate CCW. In response to CW rotation, a protonated cAsp61 moves into proximity of aGlu196 in the cytoplasmic half-channel. Presumably, the proton concentration is less than the pK of aGlu196, and the sum of the other groups that participate in this half-channel such that dissociation of the proton into the cytoplasm is favored. The concentration of protons required to protonate each half-channel is likely to depend on the number of groups that can be protonated, their aggregate accessibility to the adjacent aqueous phase, and their pKs, which depend on the hydrophobicity of their environments. The results presented here show that the ability to protonate the half-channels differs. Mutational studies are required to determine the relative contributions of subunit-a residues. These differences in the two half-channels have likely evolved to favor proton flux in the ATP synthase direction to minimize a futile cycle when the system has reached a steady state chemical gradient of ATP to ADP and Pi. In such a futile cycle, an ATP synthesized by proton flow would be immediately hydrolyzed to pump the protons in the opposite direction with no net gain in the storage of energy in the form of ATP. Without a bias that favors protonation of the ATP synthase half-channel, the magnitude of the chemical gradient that can be sustained will be diminished. Single particle cryo-EM structures of F0F1 in the autoinhibited form (11Sobti M. Smits C. Wong A.S. Ishmukhametov R. Stock D. Sandin S. Stewart A.G. Cryo-EM structures of the autoinhibited E. coli ATP synthase in three rotational states.eLife. 2016; 5: e21598Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) revealed three states (Fig. 9). The autoinhibited form of the ATP synthase from E. coli results when the C-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of the ϵ-subunit has become inserted into the core of the (αβ)3-ring along the shaft of the γ-subunit in a manner that prevents rotation (29Cingolani G. Duncan T.M. Structure of the ATP synthase catalytic complex F1 from Escherichia coli in an autoinhibited conformation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The three structural states of this F0F1 structure are distinguished by the rotary positions of central stalk subunits γ and ϵ relative to the peripheral stalk that are separated by 120°, which is equivalent to the rotary positions of the drive shaft between ATPase-driven power strokes. It is noteworthy that single-molecule FRET measurements made where the donor and acceptor are attached to the central and peripheral stalks show a sequential low, medium, and high FRET signal when F0F1 embedded in proteoliposomes are actively synthesizing ATP in response to a proton gradient (3Diez M. Zimmermann B. Börsch M. König M. Schweinberger E. Steigmiller S. Reuter R. Felekyan S. Kudryavtsev V. Seidel C.A. Gräber P. Proton-powered subunit rotation in single membrane-bound F0F1-ATP synthase.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The correlation between these FRET signals with the relative positions of the central and peripheral stalks in the three states of the E. coli cryo-EM structure suggests that the rotary positions of the γ and ϵ-subunits in these three states resemble that of the functional protein complex during each of the three F1-ATPase catalytic dwells. The data presented at each pH in Fig. 6A represent the sum of data sets typically from ∼50 molecules of F0F1. The occurrence of transient dwells was analyzed for each molecule examined only from the power stroke in which the scattered light intensity of the nanorod progressed from a minimum through a maximum (Fig. 2), and not from the other two power strokes that complete a 360° rotation. For any given molecule, there is an equal probability that the power stroke analyzed corresponds to the rotation from one of the three structural states defined by the relative position of the two stalks. Thus, for every 51 F0F1 molecules analyzed for transient dwells, it is likely that the power strokes specific to each of the three different structural states will have been sampled by 17 molecules. This conclusion is supported by the observations that the distributions of transient dwell occurrence at any of the pH values examined do not fit to a single normal distribution, but that good fits to the data were achieved by fitting the distributions to the sum of three Gaussians (Fig. 6A). The average values derived from each Gaussian dependence changed by a comparable extent as a function of pH (Fig. 7), which implies that the Gaussian curves represent molecules in which the probability of forming a transient dwell is low (blue), medium (red), or high (green). This suggests that the ATPase-driven power stroke that follows each of the three structural F0F1 states derived from cryo-EM has a low, medium, or high probability of forming transient dwells. In the absence of knowledge of the correlation between the ability to form transient dwells and the structural state of the power stroke examined, it is not possible at this time to know how the probability to form transient dwells in any one structural state changes with pH. It is noteworthy that because the ATPase rotates in 120° power strokes, the c-ring will rotate 4 × 36° for one of the power strokes, but 3 × 36° for the other two. Thus, it is possible that the probability of observing transient dwells is more likely for molecules aligned to step by four c-subunits per power stroke, although it does not explain the differences in the molecules with a low and medium probability of forming transient dwells. The three states of E. coli F0F1 determined by cryo-EM (Fig. 9) differ not only by the relative position of the central and peripheral stalks, but also by the conformation of subunit-a, and its position on the c-ring. These differences include the positions of subunit-a residues aAsn214, aArg210, and aGlu196 involved in proton translocation relative to the cAsp61 residues on each c-subunit. In addition, the three structural states of E. coli F0F1 differ in the position of the subunit-a 310-helix II and its subsequent loop relative to the c-ring. It is noteworthy that similar conformational changes were proposed in the grab and push mechanism to explain the basis of transient dwell formation, and the ability of subunit-a to push the c-ring CW against the force of ATPase-dependent rotation (18Martin J. Hudson J. Hornung T. Frasch W.D. F0-driven rotation in the ATP synthase direction against the force of F1 ATPase in the F0F1 ATP synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 10717-10728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cryo-EM structures of E. coli F0F1 are in the autoinhibited state in which the C terminus of the ϵ-subunit has adopted a conformation that prevents rotation. Thus, it is not possible at this time to determine whether subunit-a has been trapped in different functional conformations that represent sequential steps in the grab and push mechanism or whether these conformational differences predispose a given rotational state of the complex to have a low, medium, or high probability of forming transient dwells. Detergent-solubilized F0F1 samples were expressed from the pNY1-Ase plasmid construct that contained a Cys inserted at the second position of subunit-c (c2▿Cys) as described previously by Ishmukhametov et al.

Briefly, light scattered from a single nanorod on the microscope slide (as shown in Fig. 2) was aligned with a pinhole, which then passed through a band-pass filter to eliminate all but red light, a polarizing filter, and a lens that focused the light on a single photon counter. Prior to data acquisition, the polarizing filter was rotated and light intensity changes were monitored at a frame rate equivalent to ∼55 frames per second. At this slow frame rate, the observed changes in light intensity primarily represented the three rotational positions of the nanorod defined by the catalytic dwells of the F1-ATPase that are separated by 120°. Attachment of the nanorod to an actively rotating n-F0F1 complex was confirmed by the change in the dynamic range of the changes in scattered light intensity as a function of the rotational position of the polarizing filter as described by Spetzler et al. (24Spetzler D. York J. Daniel D. Fromme R. Lowry D. Frasch W.

The filter was then rotated to align one of the catalytic dwells with a minimum of scattered light intensity. Rotation data were then acquired at 100 kHz in 5-s data sets. Power strokes that rotated the nanorod from a minimum through a maximum in scattered light intensity, which is equivalent to a 90° transition in position, were analyzed for the presence of transient dwells using custom software developed in MATLAB R2013b as described by Martin et al.

https://openalex.org/W2750252812,"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies and Chandipura viruses belong to the Rhabdovirus family. VSV is a common laboratory virus to study viral evolution and host immune responses to viral infection, and recombinant VSV-based vectors have been widely used for viral oncolysis, vaccination, and gene therapy. Although the tropism of VSV is broad, and its envelope glycoprotein G is often used for pseudotyping other viruses, the host cellular components involved in VSV infection remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the host protein leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein–coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4) is essential for VSV and VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus (VSVG-LV) to infect susceptible cells. Accordingly, Lgr4-deficient mice had dramatically decreased VSV levels in the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, Lgr4 knockdown in RAW 264.7 cells also significantly suppressed VSV infection, and Lgr4 overexpression in RAW 264.7 cells enhanced VSV infection. Interestingly, only VSV infection relied on Lgr4, whereas infections with Newcastle disease virus, influenza A virus (A/WSN/33), and herpes simplex virus were unaffected by Lgr4 status. Of note, assays of virus entry, cell ELISA, immunoprecipitation, and surface plasmon resonance indicated that VSV bound susceptible cells via the Lgr4 extracellular domain. Pretreating cells with an Lgr4 antibody, soluble LGR4 extracellular domain, or R-spondin 1 blocked VSV infection by competitively inhibiting VSV binding to Lgr4. Taken together, the identification of Lgr4 as a VSV-specific host factor provides important insights into understanding VSV entry and its pathogenesis and lays the foundation for VSV-based gene therapy and viral oncolytic therapeutics.

As a common laboratory virus used to study the properties of rhabdoviridae viruses, viral evolution, and host immune responses to virus, VSV has been extensively studied and characterized (2Lichty B.D.

In common with the other members of the Rhabdovirus family, the entry of VSV is facilitated exclusively by the envelope glycoprotein G (VSV-G), which is widely used for pseudotyping other viruses (4Roche S.

Glycoprotein G plays a critical role during the initial steps of the infectious cycle through binding with specific receptors and then mediating viral and endosomal membrane fusion (14Albertini A.A. Baquero E. Ferlin A. Gaudin Y. Molecular and cellular aspects of rhabdovirus entry.Viruses. 2012; 4: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The attachment of VSV to the cell surface was initially thought to be facilitated by interacting with the lipid phosphatidylserine (15Coil D.A. Miller A.D. Phosphatidylserine is not the cell surface receptor for vesicular stomatitis virus.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10920-10926Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the majority of VSV particles were endocytosed in a clathrin-based, dynamin-2-dependent manner (16Johannsdottir H.K. Mancini R. Kartenbeck J. Amato L. Helenius A.

Studies have suggested that the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone gp96 is also essential for VSV infection (18Bloor S. Maelfait J. Krumbach R. Beyaert R. Randow F. Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone gp96 is essential for infection with vesicular stomatitis virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6970-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Subsequently, low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and its family members were proposed to be cell surface receptors for VSV (19Finkelshtein D. Werman A. Novick D. Barak S. Rubinstein M. LDL receptor and its family members serve as the cellular receptors for vesicular stomatitis virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As the largest cell membrane receptor family, more than 1000 members of the human genome were identified as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which play an irreplaceable role in signal recognition and transduction (21Kroeze W.K. Sheffler D.J. Roth B.L. G-protein-coupled receptors at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4867-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, more and more GPCRs were found to be involved in facilitating viral propagation and thereby contributing to viral pathogenesis. For example, CXC-chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and CC-chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5) are the most famous cell-fusion cofactors for HIV infection (22Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D.

HIV-1 entry cofactor: functional cDNA cloning of a seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor.Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many members of the herpesvirus family hijack GPCRs and associated signaling from their cellular host through encoding viral GPCRs (24Sodhi A. Montaner S. Gutkind J.S. Viral hijacking of G-protein-coupled-receptor signalling networks.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 998-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, some antagonists to histamine receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and adrenergic receptor can effectively block replication of both infectious Ebola virus and Marburg virus, and newly developed CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonists have already shown clinical promise as HIV-entry inhibitors, indicating a broad antiviral activity of the GPCR antagonists (25Cheng H. Lear-Rooney C.M. Johansen L. Varhegyi E. Chen Z.W. Olinger G.G. Rong L. Inhibition of Ebola and Marburg virus entry by G protein-coupled receptor antagonists.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 9932-9938Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Lgr4, also known as Gpr48 (G-protein-coupled receptor 48), is a member of the glycoprotein hormone receptor subfamily. The extracellular domain (ECD) of LGR4 exhibits a twisted horseshoe-like structure composed of 17 leucine-rich repeats at the N-terminal domain, which has been recognized as the binding site for R-spondins, ligands that enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling (26Xu K.

Curiously, almost all Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors have a domain consisting of multiple leucine-rich repeats, which is believed to be involved in ligand binding. Similar structural patterns suggested a potential role of Lgr4 in innate immune responses. Our previous study has shown that Lgr4 negatively regulates TLR2/4-associated pattern recognition and innate immunity (29Du B. Luo W. Li R. Tan B. Han H. Lu X. Li D. Qian M. Zhang D. Zhao Y. Liu M.

Lgr4 regulates mammary gland development and stem cell activity through the pluripotency transcription factor Sox2.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 1921-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but Lgr4 function in virus infection has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that Lgr4 serves as a VSV-specific entry factor through binding with viral glycoprotein. Consequently, VSV infection could be restrained by pretreating cells with Lgr4 antibody, soluble LGR4 ECD, and R-spondin 1 suggesting the great potential of Lgr4 as a promising antiviral drug target for VSV infection. To investigate the significance of Lgr4 in viral infection, we intranasally infected Lgr4+/+ and Lgr4−/− mice with VSV (1 × 106 pfu) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, the distribution of VSV in Lgr4-deficient olfactory bulbs was reduced significantly compared with wild-type mice through intranasal infection. It suggested that Lgr4 plays a nonredundant role in the VSV infection mouse model. To further determine whether Lgr4 mediated VSV infection of host cells, we challenged mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and RAW 264.7 cells with VSV in a dose-dependent manner to induce cell death and cytopathic effects. VSV-induced cell death (Fig. 1B) was significantly reduced in Lgr4-deficient MEF cells compared with wild-type cells. We observed similar results following Lgr4 knockdown in mouse macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1C). To confirm whether Lgr4 enhances VSV infection, we measured cell-associated VSV by quantitative RT-PCR of VSV RNA. Accordingly, the VSV RNA level was also significantly inhibited in Lgr4-deficient (Fig. 1D) and Lgr4-knockdown (Fig. 1E) cells. On the contrary, the VSV RNA level was increased dramatically when we overexpressed LGR4 in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1F). The RNA and protein expression of Lgr4 on both knockdown and overexpression cells are shown in Fig. 1, G and H, respectively. Therefore, Lgr4 plays an important role in rendering mice and cells susceptible to VSV infection. To explore the role of Lgr4 in antiviral immunity, we detected the expression of type I interferon and phagocytosis in Lgr4-deficient and Lgr4-knockdown cells. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the expression of Lgr4 is little changed following VSV infection suggesting that Lgr4 is not a virus-induced or IFN-induced gene. Furthermore, the interferon response was intact in Lgr4-deficient peritoneal macrophages exposed to poly(I:C) (Fig. 2C). However, the VSV-induced expression of IFN-β was dramatically reduced in Lgr4-deficient (Fig. 2D) or Lgr4-knockdown (Fig. 2E) cells, which is consistent with decreased intracellular VSV in these cells. To further examine whether Lgr4 signaling might directly potentiate IFN production, we activated peritoneal macrophages with R-spondin 1 (an endogenous ligand to Lgr4). As shown in Fig. 2F, the RNA expression of IFN-β was little changed by R-spondin 1 in both VSV-infected or uninfected cells, suggesting a negligible role of Lgr4 in IFN production. Macrophage-mediated endocytosis of particles was also little changed in Lgr4 knockdown cells (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, we also examined the expression of a known VSV receptor, Ldlr. The expression of Ldlr was little changed in Lgr4−/− MEFs (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these results indicate that Lgr4 facilitated VSV infectivity but is dispensable for innate antiviral immune responses and Ldlr expression. Binding and internalization into host cells are the initial steps in virus infection. To investigate the specificity of the role of Lgr4 in virus infection, we challenged wild-type and Lgr4-deficient peritoneal macrophages with different kinds of virus such as influenza virus (A/WSN/33, ssRNA virus), Newcastle disease virus (NDV, ssRNA virus), and Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, dsDNA virus). To our surprise, only VSV infection was reduced in Lgr4-deficient cells; infection with WSN, NDV, and HSV-1 were all unaffected by Lgr4 (Fig. 3A). We also used fluorescence microscopy and FACS to detect NDV infection in Lgr4 wild-type and knock-out MEF cells. No significant difference in NDV infection was observed due to loss of Lgr4 (Fig. 3B). As a commonly used envelope protein in pseudotyped lentivirus, VSV-G is widely used in packaging lentivirus to infect a broad array of species and cell types. To examine Lgr4 specificity in viral vector tropism, we packaged lentivirus with either VSV-G (VSVG-LV) or MLV Env-glycoproteins (MLV-LV), which differs from VSVG-LV only in its coat protein, to infect MEFs. Then we transduced VSVG-LV and MLV-LV into Lgr4+/+ and Lgr4−/− MEFs. As shown in Fig. 3C, only VSVG-LV transduced GFP expression was reduced in Lgr4-deficient MEF cells. In contrast, the GFP fluorescence intensity induced by MLV-LV was changed little. VSVG-LV fluorescence intensity was also decreased in Lgr4-knockdown RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, overexpression of Lgr4 in RAW 264.7 cells significantly increased the GFP fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3E). These data confirmed that Lgr4 specifically increased VSV-G-mediated infection. To explore the stage of VSV infection influenced by Lgr4, we infected wild-type and Lgr4-deficient peritoneal macrophages cells with VSV in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 4A, VSV RNA was reduced substantially in Lgr4-deficient cells at time points between 2 and 8 h post-infection. Similarly, although VSV RNA in peritoneal macrophages increased as m.o.i. was raised, the viral load in Lgr4-deficient cells was obviously lower than that of wild-type cells at any given dose (Fig. 4B). To further confirm that the entry of VSV was influenced by Lgr4, we challenged wild-type and Lgr4-deficient MEF cells with VSV for a very short time and the attached virus was detected by immunofluorescence. Compared with wild-type MEF cells, Lgr4-deficient MEF cells internalized significantly less VSV at both 0.5 and 1 h (Fig. 4C). Following receptor binding, most incoming VSV were present in pits and vesicles with electron-dense coats, implying a dominant role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (37Superti F. Seganti L. Ruggeri F.M. Tinari A. Donelli G. Orsi N. Entry pathway of vesicular stomatitis virus into different host cells.J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because Lgr4 loss did not affect NDV/HSV/WSN infection (Fig. 3A), Lgr4 is unlikely to play a role in global endocytosis; however, to examine whether it may function specifically in VSV endocytosis, we tested whether Lgr4 deficiency affects VSV infection in cells with impaired endocytosis. It has been shown that Pitstop2 specifically inhibits the association between the terminal domain of clathrin and amphiphysin (38von Kleist L. Stahlschmidt W. Bulut H. Gromova K. Puchkov D. Robertson M.J. MacGregor K.A. Tomlin N. Pechstein A. Chau N. Chircop M. Sakoff J. von Kries J.P. Saenger W. Kräusslich H.G. et al.Role of the clathrin terminal domain in regulating coated pit dynamics revealed by small molecule inhibition.Cell. 2011; 146: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). So we used Pitstop2 to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis in VSV infection to explore the role of Lgr4 in VSV endocytosis. Consistent with a previous study (39Sun X. Yau V.K. Briggs B.J. Whittaker G.R. Role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis during vesicular stomatitis virus entry into host cells.Virology. 2005; 338: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we found that VSV infection in MEFs was significantly inhibited by Pitstop2 (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, because Lgr4 deficiency significantly reduced VSV infection even in MEFs where endocytosis was blocked by Pitstop2 treatment, it is likely that Lgr4 functions at a different stage of VSV infection than endocytosis. Taken together, these results implied that Lgr4 has a major role in very early stages of VSV infection, such as viral attachment. To illustrate the potential interactions between Lgr4 and VSV, cell ELISA was performed to detect the VSV attachment to Lgr4 wild-type and deficient cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, the attachment of VSV on the cell membrane was reduced in Lgr4-deficient cells, which is consistent with our previous data. To determine whether Lgr4 and VSV-G are associated in a complex, we expressed FLAG-tagged LGR4 extracellular domain (LGR4-ECD-FLAG) and GFP-tagged VSV-G extracellular domain (VSVG-ECD-GFP) in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG mAb revealed that LGR4 ECD was in a complex with VSV-G (Fig. 5B). Likewise, purified LGR4-ECD-His (purified from Drosophila Schneider2 (S2) cell supernatant) could bind specifically to VSV but not NDV in vitro (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we immobilized either VSV-G or MLV Env-glycoprotein pseudotyped virus on Biacore sensor chips and analyzed their binding with LGR4-ECD-His, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5D, VSVG-LV bound to LGR4 ECD in a dose-dependent manner (KD = 6.905 × 10−8 m). However, MLV-LV did not bind with LGR4-ECD-His even at 714 nm. When we immobilized LGR4 ECD-His to a Biacore sensor chip and analyzed the binding with VSV, the LGR4 ECD-His bound to VSV in a dose-dependent manner as well (Fig. 5E). Thus, these data further confirmed the interaction between Lgr4 and VSV-G. To further confirm that VSV infects cells through binding Lgr4, we examined whether the binding of VSV to host cells was blocked by soluble LGR4 ECD, Lgr4 ligand Rspodin1, and an Lgr4-specific antibody. We used NDV as a control virus. Pretreating VSV and NDV with soluble LGR4 ECD decreased VSV infection in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on NDV (Fig. 6A). When we pretreated the cells with Rspodin1 to bind with endogenous Lgr4, only VSV infection was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Similar data were also observed in Lgr4 antibody-pretreated cells (Fig. 6C). Accordingly, VSV but not NDV-induced cell death was also diminished by the Lgr4 antibody when compared with control IgG (Fig. 6D). Then we pretreated MDA-MB-231 cells with soluble LGR4 ECD to detect the influence of LGR4 on VSV infection in human cells. As shown in Fig. 6E, VSV infection of MDA-MB-231 cells was decreased by LGR4 ECD in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that LGR4 is also involved in VSV infection of human cells. Therefore, blocking endogenous Lgr4 could be a potential way to prevent VSV infection. Rhabdoviruses have a characteristic rigid bullet shape with a flat base and a round tip. Similar to other rhabdoviruses, the condensed nucleocapsid of VSV is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing the viral glycoprotein G that constitutes the spikes that protrude from the viral surface. The envelope of VSV plays a critical role in its infectious cycle through recognizing receptors on the host cell surface and mediating the fusion between viral and cell membranes. Previous studies have suggested that LDLR, gangliosides, and gp96 are all essential for infection with VSV, but the knowledge about the host factors in VSV infection is still far from complete. In this paper, we identified the G-protein-coupled receptor Lgr4 as a VSV-specific entry factor through Lgr4 interaction with viral particles, which extended the understanding of host components involved in VSV infection. Furthermore, the soluble LGR4 ECD, Rspodin1, and LGR4 antibody could inhibit VSV infection through competition with Lgr4, showing great potential for treating vesicular stomatitis as well as influencing the targeting of VSV-based gene therapy and viral oncolytic vectors. Lgr4 is widely expressed in multiple organs, including lung, skin, brain, bone, and immune cells. Interestingly, the reported VSV receptor LDLR is ubiquitously expressed in both liver and peripheral tissue for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in mammals, tissues that do not seem relevant during VSV infection (40Chen Y. Ruan X.Z. Li Q. Huang A. Moorhead J.F. Powis S.H. Varghese Z.

Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F680-F687Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that Lgr4 negatively regulates TLR2/4-associated pattern recognition and innate immunity in bacterial infection. Our study here demonstrates the function of Lgr4 as a co-receptor to promote VSV entry in viral infection, likely through direct binding of VSV-G. However, we still observed limited VSV infection of cells lacking Lgr4, clearly indicating that other viral receptors can partially substitute for the role of Lgr4 in VSV entry. Identifying and characterizing these additional viral receptors remains a key objective for further research. The identification of key host components involved in virus infection is of significant clinical important in preventing and treating viral infectious diseases. In addition, recombinant VSV and VSV-G-pseudotyped viral vectors have been widely used for viral oncolysis, vaccination, and gene therapy. Our work suggests that the infection efficacy of such vectors can be regulated by modulating the expression of Lgr4. Interestingly, Lgr4 is highly expressed in lung, breast, and colorectal cancer cells (31Gong X. Yi J. Carmon K.S. Crumbley C.A. Xiong W. Thomas A. Fan X. Guo S. An Z. Chang J.T. Liu Q.J.

https://openalex.org/W2750577074,"Calcineurin, the conserved Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase and target of immunosuppressants, plays important roles in the circulatory, nervous, and immune systems. Calcineurin activity strictly depends on Ca2+ and Ca2+-bound calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to relieve autoinhibition of the catalytic subunit (CNA) by its C terminus. The C terminus contains two regulatory domains, the autoinhibitory domain (AID) and calmodulin-binding domain (CBD), which block the catalytic center and a conserved substrate-binding groove, respectively. However, this mechanism cannot apply to CNAβ1, an atypical CNA isoform generated by alternative 3′-end processing, whose divergent C terminus shares the CBD common to all isoforms, but lacks the AID. We present the first biochemical characterization of CNAβ1, which is ubiquitously expressed and conserved in vertebrates. We identify a distinct C-terminal autoinhibitory four-residue sequence in CNAβ1, 462LAVP465, which competitively inhibits substrate dephosphorylation. In vitro and cell-based assays revealed that the CNAβ1-containing holoenzyme, CNβ1, is autoinhibited at a single site by either of two inhibitory regions, CBD and LAVP, which block substrate access to the substrate-binding groove. We found that the autoinhibitory segment (AIS), located within the CBD, is progressively removed by Ca2+ and Ca2+/CaM, whereas LAVP remains engaged. This regulatory strategy conferred higher basal and Ca2+-dependent activity to CNβ1, decreasing its dependence on CaM, but also limited maximal enzyme activity through persistence of LAVP-mediated autoinhibiton during Ca2+/CaM stimulation. These regulatory properties may underlie observed differences between the biological activities of CNβ1 and canonical CNβ2. Our insights lay the groundwork for further studies of CNβ1, whose physiological substrates are currently unknown.

Calcineurin is a key signaling enzyme in eukaryotic cells, from yeast, where it regulates survival during environmental stress (1Cyert M.S. Calcineurin signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: how yeast go crazy in response to stress.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), to mammals, where it plays well-established roles in synaptic plasticity (2Mansuy I.M. Calcineurin in memory and bidirectional plasticity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1195-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), heart development (3Schulz R.A. Yutzey K.E.

Mertz P. Calcineurin: form and function.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Signaling by calcineurin through its best characterized substrates, the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, is critical for T-cell activation, and for this reason the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A are in wide clinical use as immunosuppressants (5Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Calcineurin is a common target of cyclophilin-cyclosporin A and FKBP-FK506 complexes.Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3608) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, a heterodimer of catalytic (CNA) and regulatory (CNB) subunits, is ubiquitously expressed in humans, but encoded by several genes whose expression is tissue-dependent. In mammals, three genes encode isoforms of CNA (α, β, and γ), which are highly homologous, differing mostly at their N and C termini, and display a domain architecture and activation mechanism that are conserved throughout eukaryotes (4Rusnak F. Mertz P. Calcineurin: form and function.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). An exception is CNAβ1, a transcript variant of the CNAβ gene that, due to alternative 3′ processing, lacks the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain (AID) present in all other forms of calcineurin (Fig. 1A) (6Guerini D. Klee C.B. Cloning of human calcineurin A: evidence for two isozymes and identification of a polyproline structural domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Calcineurin utilizes evolutionarily conserved surfaces to recognize substrates containing short linear motifs (SLiMs), conserved peptides found in disordered regions (8Roy J. Cyert M.S.

Signal. 2015; 13: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Calcineurin relies on SLiM interaction at docking surfaces distinct from the catalytic center to achieve substrate specificity, rather than recognition of a phosphosite motif (11Donella-Deana A. Krinks M.H. Ruzzene M. Klee C. Pinna L.A. Dephosphorylation of phosphopeptides by calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B).Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One such surface along β sheet β14 of CNA binds SLiMs with the consensus sequence PXIXIT (8Roy J. Cyert M.S. Cracking the phosphatase code: docking interactions determine substrate specificity.Sci.

This docking site anchors substrates as well as scaffolds and regulators. A second surface, formed at the interface between CNA and its obligate regulatory subunit CNB, is available only in the Ca2+/CaM-activated enzyme and binds SLiMs with the consensus sequence LXVP (13Rodríguez A.

Investigating the human calcineurin interaction network using the πΦLxVP SLiM.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 38920Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This interaction is required for dephosphorylation, and is blocked by inhibitors, including the immunosuppressant-immunophilin complexes, FK506-FKBP and cyclosporin A-cyclophilin, as well as the viral protein, A238L (15Grigoriu S. Bond R. Cossio P. Chen J.A. Ly N. Hummer G. Page R. Cyert M.S. Peti W. The molecular mechanism of substrate engagement and immunosuppressant inhibition of calcineurin.PLos Biol. 2013; 11: e1001492Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a sequence within the regulatory domain of CNA termed the autoinhibitory segment (AIS) contributes to autoinhibition by occupying the LXVP-docking groove in the unstimulated enzyme (16Li S.-J. Wang J. Ma L. Lu C. Wang J. Wu J.-W. Wang Z.-X. Cooperative autoinhibition and multi-level activation mechanisms of calcineurin.Cell Res. 2016; 10.1038/cr.2016.14Google Scholar). Thus, recognition of LXVP SLiMs is an essential step in substrate interaction with and dephosphorylation by calcineurin. Calcineurin is activated by a well-documented mechanism that is shared between fungal and animal kingdoms, because of the high degree of sequence and structural conservation among homologs. As shown in Fig. 1A, CNA contains an N-terminal catalytic domain followed by a regulatory domain consisting of a CNB-binding helix (BBH), CaM-binding domain (CBD), which includes the AIS mentioned above, and the C-terminal AID. When cellular Ca2+ levels are low, the inactive enzyme adopts a closed conformation that shields substrate access to the active site. Upon cellular stimulation that gives rise to elevated Ca2+ levels, Ca2+ binding to CNB and to CaM results in a series of conformational changes that release the regulatory domain and reveal both the LXVP substrate-binding pocket and the catalytic center, allowing substrate dephosphorylation (16Li S.-J.

In contrast to the well-studied cytosolic CNAβ2 isoform, the non-canonical CNAβ1 variant lacks the C-terminal AID and instead contains unique sequences that share no homology with AID (Fig. 1, A and C). This alternative C terminus confers distinct protein-protein interactions and contains a membrane localization sequence that targets CNAβ1 to the Golgi apparatus (21Gómez-Salinero J.M.

Calcineurin splicing variant calcineurin Aβ1 improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction without inducing hypertrophy.Circulation. 2011; 123: 2838-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CNAβ1 has been reported to perform functions distinct from canonical calcineurin isoforms. In mouse, CNAβ1 is highly expressed in regenerating muscle tissue and stem cells, is cardioprotective rather than pro-hypertrophic, and regulates signaling pathways that are unaffected by CNAβ2 (7Lara-Pezzi E.

Res. 2014; 102: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the biochemical properties of this interesting isozyme, referred to here as CNβ1, have not been studied. Because it lacks the AID, CNβ1 was originally thought to be constitutively active. However, the failure of CNAβ1 overexpression to yield cardiac hypertrophy, an outcome observed for expression of constitutively active calcineurin, challenged the idea that CNβ1 activity was unregulated (22Felkin L.E.

A calcineurin-dependent transcriptional pathway for cardiac hypertrophy.Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Additionally, unlike CNβ2, CNβ1 does not dephosphorylate NFAT or impact NFAT-responsive gene expression (22Felkin L.E. Narita T. Germack R. Shintani Y. Takahashi K. Sarathchandra P. López-Olañeta M.M. Gómez-Salinero J.M. Suzuki K. Barton P.J. Rosenthal N. Lara-Pezzi E. Calcineurin splicing variant calcineurin Aβ1 improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction without inducing hypertrophy.Circulation. 2011; 123: 2838-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In fact, although dozens of substrates of calcineurin have been identified, which, if any, are dephosphorylated by CNβ1 is unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanism of CNβ1 activation. Using in vitro and cell-based assays, we identify a conserved substrate-like LXVP SLiM within the CNAβ1 C terminus, and demonstrate that it behaves as a pseudosubstrate to block substrate recognition. Thus, the atypical domain structure of CNAβ1 gives rise to Ca2+/CaM-dependent regulation of CNβ1 phosphatase activity through a non-canonical mechanism that confers unique functional characteristics to this isoform. CNAβ1 and CNAβ2 were the first calcineurin catalytic subunits to be cloned, and were identified as variant isoforms present in human brain mRNA (6Guerini D. Klee C.B. Cloning of human calcineurin A: evidence for two isozymes and identification of a polyproline structural domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 9183-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Differential 3′ processing, carried out in part by the splicing and polyadenylation factor muscle-blind-like 1, produces the shorter CNAβ1 transcript, which lacks exons 13 and 14 found in CNAβ2 (21Gómez-Salinero J.M. López-Olañeta M.M. Ortiz-Sánchez P. Larrasa-Alonso J. Gatto A. Felkin L.E. Barton P.J. Navarro-Lérida I. Ángel Del Pozo M. García-Pavía P. Sundararaman B. Giovinazo G. Yeo G.W. Lara-Pezzi E.

Biol. 2016; 23: 1372-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to the brain, CNAβ1 transcripts are present in mouse heart, testis, and spleen (7Lara-Pezzi E. Winn N. Paul A. McCullagh K. Slominsky E. Santini M.P. Mourkioti F. Sarathchandra P. Fukushima S. Suzuki K. Rosenthal N. A naturally occurring calcineurin variant inhibits FoxO activity and enhances skeletal muscle regeneration.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but neither the tissue distribution of this transcript nor its abundance relative to canonical CNAα and CNAβ2 isoforms has been systematically studied. Therefore, we analyzed RNAseq datasets from a panel of adult human tissues (25Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Oksvold P. Kampf C. Djureinovic D. Odeberg J. Habuka M. Tahmasebpoor S. Danielsson A. Edlund K. Asplund A. Sjöstedt E. Lundberg E. Szigyarto C. A.-K. et al.Analysis of the human tissue-specific expression by genome-wide integration of transcriptomics and antibody-based proteomics.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2014; 13: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar) and determined the relative levels of CNAα, CNAβ2, and CNAβ1 mRNA. These analyses revealed that the CNAβ1 transcript was present in all tissues examined at a consistently low level, in contrast to CNAα and CNAβ2, whose expression levels were more variable between tissues (Fig. 1B). Thus CNAβ1 protein is likely found throughout the body, and may not predominate, but could contribute distinctly to calcineurin-dependent regulation of cellular processes. We sought to compare the biochemical properties of CNAβ1- or CNAβ2-containing isozymes in vivo, but were challenged by the lack of known substrates for CNβ1 in human cells. Therefore, we took advantage of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where calcineurin promotes survival during exposure to metal ions and other types of environmental stress, in part by dephosphorylating and activating the Crz1 transcription factor (1Cyert M.S.

Yeast calcineurin regulates nuclear localization of the Crz1p transcription factor through dephosphorylation.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because mechanisms of calcineurin substrate recognition are highly conserved (8Roy J. Cyert M.S. Cracking the phosphatase code: docking interactions determine substrate specificity.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: re9Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we reasoned that human calcineurin would likely dephosphorylate yeast substrates, and thus provide a method to compare, directly, the activity of CNβ2 and CNβ1 in a simple in vivo system. In the absence of stress, calcineurin-deficient yeast (cna1Δ cna2Δ cnb1Δ) transformed with human CNB (hCNB) and either CNAβ2 or an empty vector grew identically (Fig. 2A). Under stress conditions neither of these strains survived, suggesting failure of CNAβ2 to function in yeast. However, expression of a constitutively active form of human CNAβ, which lacks the CBD and C-terminal regulatory sequences, did complement the growth defects of yeast calcineurin mutants when co-expressed with hCNB (data not shown). Therefore, we considered whether endogenous yeast CaM, which is only 59% identical to human calmodulin (29Davis T.N. Urdea M.S. Masiarz F.R. Thorner J. Isolation of the yeast calmodulin gene: calmodulin is an essential protein.Cell. 1986; 47: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), might be unable to activate human calcineurin. Indeed, co-expression of CNAβ2 and hCNB with sea urchin CaM (sCaM), which is 93% identical to human CaM, supported yeast growth under stress conditions (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, when CNAβ1 was co-expressed with hCNB, cells displayed modest growth under stress in the absence of sCaM (Fig. 2A). Growth of CNAβ1-expressing cells improved upon co-expression of sCaM, but was less robust than that of CNAβ2-expressing cells, despite the identical CBD sequences and similar expression levels for both isoforms (Fig. 2B). Both isozymes were sensitive to FK506, as yeast expressing either CNAβ1 or CNAβ2 failed to grow under stress conditions in the presence of this inhibitor (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that CNAβ1- and CNAβ2-containing isozymes both dephosphorylate yeast substrates, but may differ in their maximal activity and dependence on CaM. In light of these findings, we examined the distinct C termini of CNAβ1 and CNAβ2 for possible regulatory sequences. The CNAβ1 C terminus shares no homology with the AID, but does contain a 4-residue sequence, 462LAVP465, which is well-conserved across vertebrate CNAβ1 homologs, and contains the core residues found in LXVP motifs, which mediate substrate binding to calcineurin (Fig. 1C) (8Roy J.

We hypothesized that this LAVP sequence might block substrate access to the conserved hydrophobic substrate-docking groove of CNβ1, and thus inhibit its activity. To compare the regulatory properties of the different CNAβ C termini directly, we synthesized peptides derived from these sequences or from the calcineurin substrate NFATc1 (Table 1) and added them in trans to CNβtrunc, a heterodimer composed of hCNB with a truncated catalytic subunit (residues 1–400), which lacks all sequences C-terminal to the BBH, and is thus constitutively active. Notably, both the catalytic center and substrate-binding pocket are exposed in this form. The activity of this recombinant, purified human CNβtrunc was assessed in vitro using two different substrates, para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and RII phosphopeptide, which probe the availability of the catalytic center and substrate-docking site, respectively (Fig. 3, A and C).Table 1Sequences of peptides used in trans-inhibition assaysPeptideSequenceβ2-AIDITSFEEAKGLDRINERMPPRKDAVQNFATc1-LAVPwtDQYLAVPQHPYQWAKNFATc1-LAVPmutDQYAAAAQHPYQWAKβ1-LAVPwtVMQLAVPQMDWGTPHβ1-LAVPmutVMQAAAAQMDWGTPHβ1-DWGTmutVMQLAVPQMAWAAPH Open table in a new tab First, we analyzed calcineurin activity toward pNPP, a small molecule that interacts only with the catalytic center of the phosphatase and whose hydrolysis is blocked by inhibitors such as inorganic phosphate or the AID, which directly occlude the active site (30Martin B.L.

Type III protein secretion systems in bacterial pathogens of animals and plants.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T3SS directly injects host-modulating effector proteins in order to alter host cell activities for the benefit of the pathogen. The T3SS is a macromolecular machine comprising four key parts. A cytoplasmic sorting platform dictates the hierarchy of effector protein secretion and is powered by an imbedded ATPase. It is associated with a basal body that spans the entire bacterial envelope (inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane). External components of the apparatus include a hollow needle filament that bridges the pathogen and host and a needle tip complex (TC) that controls secretion status and assembles a translocon pore within the host cell membrane (2Diepold A. Wagner S. Assembly of the bacterial type III secretion machinery.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38: 802-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Control of effector protein secretion by the TC occurs in response to environmental stimuli (3Ménard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C.

Components of the T3SS are well conserved with regard to their overall structure, architecture, and function despite relatively low levels of sequence identity across divergent pathogens. The TC is an example of structural conservation, and these can be clustered into seven phylogenetic families, of which three are common in human pathogens: the Ipa family (Shigella, Salmonella, and Burkholderia), LcrV/Yop (Yersinia and Pseudomonas), and Esp (Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Bordetella) (8Cornelis G.R. The type III secretion injectisome.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The steps involved in TC assembly and secretion activation have been studied extensively for the enteric pathogen Shigella flexneri, causative agent of shigellosis (bacillary dysentery). The Shigella tip protein, IpaD, assembles at the distal end of the needle as a pentameric ring (9Espina M. Olive A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R.

By controlling recruitment and maintenance of IpaB, the TC regulates the timing of translocon pore formation, which occurs quickly upon contact with the host cell membrane. Contact with the host membrane then triggers the recruitment of a second hydrophobic translocator protein (IpaC) to the TC with concomitant translocon pore formation and induction of effector protein secretion into the host cell to promote pathogen entry (12Epler C.R. Dickenson N.E. Olive A.J. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Liposomes recruit IpaC to the Shigella flexneri type III secretion apparatus needle as a final step in secretion induction.Infect.

A stabilizing central coiled-coil (a common motif within external T3SS components; Ref. 13Gazi A.D. Charova S.N. Panopoulos N.J. Kokkinidis M.

These structural features are generally retained in the tip proteins across the three TC families, with a few notable exceptions including a genetically separate chaperone (in place of the N-terminal α-helical domain of IpaD) for the LcrV family (14Johnson S.

In contrast to the abundance of high-resolution structural information on monomeric tip proteins, most information regarding the in situ multimeric TC has primarily been limited to low-resolution electron microscopy approaches. This has resulted in the generation of incongruent TC models with respect to stoichiometry, orientation, and protein composition (6Cheung M. Shen D.K. Makino F. Kato T. Roehrich A.D.

To further our understanding of the function of the T3SS TC complex and to explore the possibility of generating a novel therapeutic, we generated a panel of single-chain camelid antibodies against Shigella IpaD. Camelid species produce a class of heavy chain-only antibodies that require only a single-VH domain (VHH) to recognize cognate antigens. These VHHs can be expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli and possess high conformational stability. VHHs typically recognize conformational epitopes and can be valuable reagents to track conformational changes and probe for structure-function relationships (17Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 775-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Our collection of VHHs included several that are capable of inhibiting the virulence properties of S. flexneri as well as the ability to bind directly to the surface of the pathogen. We then identified these structural epitopes by solving the co-crystal structures of IpaD in complex with four different VHHs that displayed differing degrees of pathogen neutralization. This has allowed us to identify potential functional importance of structural epitopes, especially within the IpaD distal domain, with respect to the domain structure of IpaD within the TC from S. flexneri. A VHH-display phage library representing the heavy chain-only antibody repertoire of a single alpaca repeatedly immunized with purified recombinant IpaD from S. flexneri was prepared and subjected to multiple rounds of panning (see “Experimental procedures”). This allowed for the identification of 12 phagemids encoding unique VHHs with strong IpaD-binding activity when displayed by phage. After DNA sequencing of eight selected VHHs (Fig. 1A), seven were selected for expression as recombinant VHH proteins in E. coli, and these were then used for further characterization (see below). To determine the binding epitopes on IpaD for the VHHs and to identify superior binding candidates for subsequent study, two experimental methods were employed (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Initial identification of binding regions within IpaD recognized by the different VHHs was completed using IpaD deletion fragments in an immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). The crystal structure of the IpaD monomer was previously determined (14Johnson S. Roversi P. Espina M. Olive A. Deane J.E. Birket S. Field T. Picking W.D. Blocker A.J. Galyov E.E. Picking W.L.

Chem. 2007; 282: 4035-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and found to have three predominant structural features (Fig. 2A). These include a core central coiled-coil (residues 131–177 and 273–332) flanked by an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain previously suggested to have a self-chaperoning role (residues 1–130) and a globular distal domain comprised of mixed α/β components (residues 178–272). Purified full-length (FL), Δ1–130, and Δdistal-domain IpaD proteins were used to probe for binding within each VHH cluster (Fig. 2B). As expected, all selected VHHs were capable of binding to IpaDFL; however, they were also capable of binding to IpaDΔ1–130, indicating there were no paratopes binding within the N-terminal domain for any identified VHH. Intriguingly, none of the VHHs were capable of binding to IpaDΔdistal-domain (Fig. 2B), indicating that this region is required for an interaction to occur.Table 1Summary of IpaD-VHH binding data and interface informationVHHNeutralization of hemolysisaIpaD-specific VHHs were tested for the ability to inhibit contact-mediated hemolysis by S. flexneri.

Open table in a new tab Competition ELISAs were then performed with recombinant VHHs differentially encoding either c-Myc or E-tag epitopes (supplemental Fig. S1). From these experiments it appeared that there were 3 unique competition groups present within the 7 selected recombinant VHHs: bin 1) JMK-E3, JMK-F11, JPS-G3, and 20ipaD; bin 2) JMK-H2; bin 3) JMK-H5 and JMK-G3 (Fig. 2C). Partial competition with JMK-H2 was observed with VHHs from bin 1, especially JMK-F11 and 20ipaD. Based on this finding, whereas JMK-H2 could be considered part of a separate bin, here it is categorized as being in bin 2 with some overlap with bin 1 (Table 1). S. flexneri formation of translocon pores in target cell membranes requires a functional TC protein (IpaD) and functional translocator proteins (IpaB and IpaC), and this activity is routinely determined using a contact-mediated hemolysis assay. The ability of each IpaD-specific VHH to inhibit contact-mediated hemolysis was measured to determine whether any were capable of neutralizing a known virulence trait (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Four VHHs (20ipaD, JPS-G3, JMK-F11, and JMK-E3) were capable of significantly decreasing hemolytic activity between 30 and 50% when compared with wild-type S. flexneri in multiple studies. For comparison, rabbit anti-IpaD IgG has been shown to neutralize S. flexneri contact-hemolysis activity by >75% (9Espina M. Olive A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V.

Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast to the VHHs described herein, the anti-IpaD sera appears to exclusively recognize epitopes within the N-terminal domain (residues 1–130) (9Espina M. Olive A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. IpaD localizes to the tip of the type III secretion system needle of Shigella flexneri.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that both the N-terminal and distal domains contribute to productive assembly of an active T3SS translocon pore. Surprisingly, despite also requiring the presence of the IpaD distal domain, the other three IpaD-specific VHHs were essentially incapable of altering hemolysis. At this time it is unclear whether this results from structural epitopes that either are buried in the IpaD pentamer within the TC or are not important to proper T3SS function. It was previously demonstrated that heterodimers created by covalent linkage of two inhibitory VHH monomers to create bi-specific antibodies typically leads to agents with increased affinity and neutralization properties (18Tremblay J.M.

The Shigella T3SS TC is generally believed to be composed of five molecules of IpaD for the vast majority of the injectisomes on a given bacterium (6Cheung M. Shen D.K. Makino F. Kato T.

This suggests that there are potentially multiple VHH-binding sites available, which means that physically linking VHHs together could increase binding affinity and neutralization potency. Therefore, three VHH heterodimers were designed, each having a flexible peptide spacer (GGGGS)3 and consisting of two monomer VHHs with varying efficacies. Two of the VHH heterodimers included a potent inhibitor VHH, 20ipaD or JPS-G3, linked to a non-neutralizing VHH, JMK-G3, that binds a non-overlapping epitope, whereas the third heterodimer consisted of both neutralizing VHHs, 20ipaD and JPS-G3. The combination of two neutralizing VHHs was predicted to provide increased inhibition potency compared with each monomeric component. Inhibition of Shigella contact-mediated hemolysis by the linked VHHs was then evaluated for each of the VHH heterodimers in a similar manner as the individual VHHs. Strikingly, the 20ipaD/JPS-G3 heterodimer consistently reduced hemolytic activity by >80% (Fig. 3 and Table 1), indicating that physical linkage of two inhibitory VHHs resulted in increased potency over either monomeric component. Heterodimers involving JMK-G3, a non-inhibitory VHH, were capable of inhibiting hemolysis by 60% (20ipaD/JMK-G3) and 50% (JPS-G3/JMK-G3). This is ∼10% more than each monomeric inhibitory VHH alone (p values < 0.06 for both heterodimers). Taken together, the data suggest that binding to IpaD at multiple sites, whether within a single polypeptide or in the context of the TC pentamer, leads to increased inhibition of Shigella T3SS activity. Alternatively, because a dimer consisting of a neutralizing and non-neutralizing VHH also showed enhanced inhibition of contact-hemolysis, the increased mass caused by the binding of the dimers at a single site might also contribute to increased inhibitory activity. Binding kinetics for the IpaD-specific VHHs were analyzed using biolayer interferometry analysis to determine the relationship between functional attributes and dissociation constants (KD). Intriguingly, despite clear differences in the ability to inhibit Shigella pathogenesis, the binding affinities of each VHH are quite similar (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2), with all VHHs exhibiting sub-20 nm dissociation constants. Nearly all of the VHHs had similar kon rates (between 1–5 × 105 m−1 s−1). Further insight into the relationship between binding affinity and inhibitory virulence is apparent when comparing koff rates across VHHs with similar KD values. For example, the VHHs with the highest inhibitory capability (20ipaD, JPS-G3, and JMK-E3) all have KD values between 1 and 10 nm and relatively similar kon rates (∼3 × 105 m−1 s−1); however, the koff rates between these three VHHs vary by nearly 15-fold, with 20ipaD displaying the slowest off-rate and highest inhibition of contact-hemolysis activity. It is also clear that the KD and koff rates are not the only mediators of inhibitory activity because the VHHs with no detectable ability to prevent Shigella-mediated hemolysis have binding kinetics in the same range as the neutralizing VHHs. Thus, these data indicate that differences in the ability to interact with S. flexneri are most likely reflective of unique structural epitopes that are surface-exposed within the TC rather than the affinity of the interaction. To identify the regions of IpaD that are targets for antibody neutralization of virulence and that must, therefore, be exposed within the TC in situ, we determined crystal structures of IpaD in complex with four VHHs (Table 2). Three of the VHHs (JMK-E3, JPS-G3, and 20ipaD) displayed varying levels of neutralization, ranging from 30 to 50% inhibition, whereas the other VHH (JMK-H2) had essentially no effect on virulence. All four VHHs were capable of binding to recombinant IpaD with low nm affinity (Table 1). These four VHHs adopted the classical immunoglobulin fold with complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 1–3 located on one end of the β-sheet (Fig. 1B). Variability within the length of CDR3 ranged from nine (JPS-G3) to 21 (JMK-H2) amino acids. The VHHs with the longest CDR3 region (JMK-H2 and 20ipaD) encoded an additional disulfide bond between CDR2 and CDR3. The structure of IpaD within each of the four complexes (Fig. 4A) was essentially unchanged from previously determined apo-forms (PDB IDs 2J0O (14Johnson S. Roversi P. Espina M. Olive A. Deane J.E.

However, the CAPA receptors in the silkworm (Bombyx mori) insect model are unknown. Here, we cloned cDNAs of two putative CAPA peptide receptor genes, BNGR-A27 and -A25, from the brain of B. mori larvae. We found that the predicted BNGR-A27 ORF encodes 450 amino acids and that one BNGR-A25 splice variant encodes a full-length isoform (BNGR-A25L) of 418 amino acid residues and another a short isoform (BNGR-A25S) of 341 amino acids with a truncated C-terminal tail. Functional assays indicated that both BNGR-A25L and -A27 are activated by the PVK neuropeptides Bom-CAPA-PVK-1 and -PVK-2, leading to a significant increase in cAMP-response element–controlled luciferase activity and Ca2+ mobilization in a Gq inhibitor–sensitive manner. In contrast, BNGR-A25S was not significantly activated in response to the PVK peptides. Moreover, Bom-CAPA-PVK-1 directly bound to BNGR-A25L and -A27, but not BNGR-A25S. Of note, CAPA-PVK–mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and receptor internalization confirmed that BNGR-A25L and -A27 are two canonical receptors for Bombyx CAPA-PVKs.

https://openalex.org/W2748311950,"Gene 33 (Mig6, ERRFI1) is an adaptor protein with multiple cellular functions. We recently linked Gene 33 to the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that ectopic expression of Gene 33 triggers DDR in an ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM)-dependent fashion and through pathways dependent or not dependent on ABL proto-oncogene 1 non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Abl). We observed the clear presence of Gene 33 in the nucleus and chromatin fractions of the cell. We also found that the nuclear localization of Gene 33 is regulated by its 14-3-3-binding domain and that the chromatin localization of Gene 33 is partially dependent on its ErbB-binding domain. Our data further indicated that Gene 33 may regulate the targeting of c-Abl to chromatin. Moreover, we observed a clear association of Gene 33 with histone H2AX and that ectopic expression of Gene 33 promotes the interaction between ATM and histone H2AX without triggering DNA damage. In summary, our results reveal nuclear functions of Gene 33 that regulate DDR. The nuclear localization of Gene 33 also provides a spatial explanation of the previously reported regulation of apoptosis by Gene 33 via the c-Abl/p73 pathway. On the basis of these findings and our previous studies, we propose that Gene 33 is a proximal regulator of DDR that promotes DNA repair."

A crystal structure shows that the HMP-1·HMP-2 complex forms a five-helical bundle structure distinct from the structure of the mammalian α-catenin·β-catenin complex. Deletion analysis based on the crystal structure shows that the first helix of HMP-1 is necessary for binding HMP-2 avidly in vitro and for efficient recruitment of HMP-1 to adherens junctions in embryos. HMP-2 Ser-47 and Tyr-69 flank its binding interface with HMP-1, and we show that phosphomimetic mutations at these two sites decrease binding affinity of HMP-1 to HMP-2 by 40–100-fold in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2747285102,"Male exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with seminal defects and with congenital anomalies and childhood cancers in offspring. In mice, paternal exposure to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) causes molecular defects in germ cells and phenotypic effects in their offspring. Here we used an ex vivo testicular explant model and in vivo exposure to determine the concentration at which CSC impairs spermatogenesis and offspring development. We explanted testis tissue at postnatal day (P)5.5 and cultured it until P11.5. Assessment of growth parameters by analyzing expression of cell-specific markers revealed that the explant system maintained structural and functional integrity. We exposed the P5.5 to -11.5 explants to various concentrations (40-160 μg/ml) of CSC and confirmed that nicotine in the CSC was metabolized to cotinine. We assessed various growth and differentiation parameters, as well as testosterone production, and observed that many spermatogenesis features were impaired at 160 μg/ml CSC. The same parameters were impaired by a similar CSC concentration in vivo. Finally, females mated to males that were exposed to 160 μg/ml CSC neonatally had increased rates of pup resorption. We conclude that male exposure to CSC impairs offspring development and that the concentration at which CSC impairs spermatogenesis is similar in vivo and ex vivo. Given that the concentrations of CSC we used contained similar doses of nicotine as human smokers are exposed to, we argue that our model mimics human male reproductive effects of smoking.—Esakky, P., Hansen, D.

https://openalex.org/W2747885924,"Upon activation by the Gq family of Gα subunits, Gβγ subunits, and some Rho family GTPases, phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) isoforms hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. PLC-β isoforms also function as GTPase-activating proteins, potentiating Gq deactivation. To elucidate the mechanism of this mutual regulation, we measured the thermodynamics and kinetics of PLC-β3 binding to Gαq. FRET and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, two physically distinct methods, both yielded Kd values of about 200 nm for PLC-β3–Gαq binding. This Kd is 50–100 times greater than the EC50 for Gαq-mediated PLC-β3 activation and for the Gαq GTPase-activating protein activity of PLC-β. The measured Kd was not altered either by the presence of phospholipid vesicles, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and Ca2+, or by the identity of the fluorescent labels. FRET-based kinetic measurements were also consistent with a Kd of 200 nm. We determined that PLC-β3 hysteresis, whereby PLC-β3 remains active for some time following either Gαq–PLC-β3 dissociation or PLC-β3–potentiated Gαq deactivation, is not sufficient to explain the observed discrepancy between EC50 and Kd. These results indicate that the mechanism by which Gαq and PLC-β3 mutually regulate each other is far more complex than a simple, two-state allosteric model and instead is probably kinetically determined."

GPCRs are both the largest family of transmembrane proteins and the target of ∼50% of all therapeutics on the market, making studies of their structure and function essential for deciphering cell signaling mechanisms and informing drug design. However, GPCRs are also integral membrane proteins and contain several flexible regions, making structural studies enormously challenging. In addition, their function depends on their signaling partners, the heterotrimeric G proteins, meaning that the most informative structures would be of GPCR–G protein complexes. Early attempts to gain structural information on GPCR–G protein complexes demanded new methods to express and purify sufficient quantities of the receptors, the identification of detergents appropriate for purification and crystallization, and inhibition of complex dynamics to create homogenous structural information. The groundbreaking and elegant solutions to meet these challenges led to the first X-ray crystallographic GPCR–G protein structure of the class A GPCR β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) with the G protein GS, first reported in 2011 by Kobilka, Sunahara, Skiniotis, Steyaert, and co-workers (1.Rasmussen S.G.

Of note, the β2AR, CTR, and GLP-1R complex structures with GS were all stabilized by the use of a camelid antibody Nb35, which binds with high affinity to the interface of two G protein subunits: Gβ and the Ras-like domain of GαS. The use of these modified constructs and additional biomolecules, although critical for obtaining these first structural insights, left open the question of whether they stabilized only one of a possible subset of native conformations. Additionally, the inability of newer structures to visualize all domains of the G protein made it difficult to develop general principles regarding GPCR–G protein coupling. The new strategies and analysis from Gao et al. (6.Gao Y. Westfield G. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Skiniotis G. Ramachandran S. Isolation and structure–function characterization of a signaling-active rhodopsin–G protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 14280-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are different from previous X-ray and cryoEM studies in several ways. First, the authors isolated native bovine rhodopsin and the obligate heterodimer β1γ1 complex from photoreceptors, which they paired with a chimeric GαT subunit. Second, the authors induced formation of the GPCR–G protein complex via light activation in bovine rod outer segment membranes prior to any solubilization or purification of the receptor complex. Third, the authors identified a new detergent that stabilized the system sufficiently to allow purification of the intact complex, in contrast to previous studies that isolated the components separately and then formed the complex in vitro. Finally, the small angle X-ray scattering and negative-stained EM used to create a model of the rhodopsin–GT complex (Fig. 1) were carried out without the use of the stabilizing camelid antibody. Therefore, this structure likely represents a close approximation of the GPCR–G protein activation complex formed in its native lipid environment. The structural model by Gao et al. (6.Gao Y. Westfield G. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Skiniotis G. Ramachandran S. Isolation and structure–function characterization of a signaling-active rhodopsin–G protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 14280-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) provides new information relevant to two outstanding questions: One concerns the large movement of the Gα helical domain, thought to be necessary for release of GDP from the deeply buried active site. This movement is one of the unique features of the GPCR–G protein complex that was first revealed in spectroscopic experiments of Gαi activation by rhodopsin (7.Van Eps N. Preininger A.M. Alexander N. Kaya A.I. Meier S. Meiler J. Hamm H.E. Hubbell W.L. Interaction of a G protein with an activated receptor opens the interdomain interface in the α subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 9420-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and then visualized upon crystallization of β2AR–GS (1.Rasmussen S.G. DeVree B.T. Zou Y. Kruse A.C. Chung K.Y. Kobilka T.S. Thian F.S. Chae P.S. Pardon E. Calinski D. Mathiesen J.M. Shah S.T. Lyons J.A. Caffrey M. Gellman S.H. Steyaert J. Skiniotis G. Weis W.I. Sunahara R.K. Kobilka B.K. Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-GS protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). However, the degree of this interdomain opening, when it can be observed, varies for different complexes from relatively small movements or rotations up to a maximum of a 127 ° rotation in the crystal structure of β2AR–GS. CryoEM studies of the β2AR–GS complex and low resolution images of the CTR–GS complex further indicate the helical domain can occupy multiple conformations and has a high degree of mobility (4.Liang Y.L. Khoshouei M. Radjainia M. Zhang Y. Glukhova A. Tarrasch J. Thal D.M. Furness S.G.B. Christopoulos G. Coudrat T. Danev R. Baumeister W. Miller L.J. Christopoulos A. Kobilka B.K. Wootten D.

(6.Gao Y. Westfield G. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Skiniotis G. Ramachandran S. Isolation and structure–function characterization of a signaling-active rhodopsin–G protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 14280-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) provide additional support for the existence of an ensemble of open positions, observing variable orientations for the helical domain of GT between that of the fully closed state in the inactive GDP-bound heterotrimer and the open and nucleotide-free state observed for β2AR–GS (6.Gao Y. Westfield G. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Skiniotis G. Ramachandran S. Isolation and structure–function characterization of a signaling-active rhodopsin–G protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 14280-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is possible that the fully open G protein is a rare state that is stabilized by the Nb35 nanobody within the confines of a crystal lattice. More likely, it may simply represent the most open state of a range of conformations that are sampled by the Gα helical domain during receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange. The data from Gao et al. (6.Gao Y. Westfield G. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Skiniotis G. Ramachandran S. Isolation and structure–function characterization of a signaling-active rhodopsin–G protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 14280-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) also shed light on another issue, that of the stoichiometry between GPCR and G protein. All of the GPCR–GS complexes solved to date have a 1:1 stoichiometry of GPCR:G protein (1.Rasmussen S.G. DeVree B.T. Zou Y. Kruse A.C. Chung K.Y. Kobilka T.S. Thian F.S. Chae P.S. Pardon E.

However, early low resolution structures of the rhodopsin–GT complex indicated a 2:1 stoichiometry, suggesting the dimeric receptor was the minimal functional unit for GT activation (3.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Crystal structure of rhodopsin: A G protein-coupled receptor.Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). This idea was challenged by later reconstitutions of G proteins with either β2AR or rhodopsin (9.Whorton M.R. Bokoch M.P. Rasmussen S.G. Huang B. Zare R.N. Kobilka B. Sunahara R.K. A monomeric G protein-coupled receptor isolated in a high-density lipoprotein particle efficiently activates its G protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Gao et al. (6.Gao Y. Westfield G. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Skiniotis G. Ramachandran S. Isolation and structure–function characterization of a signaling-active rhodopsin–G protein complex.J. Biol.

There are now >40 structures for different GPCRs available in a variety of ligand-bound states. These display remarkable structural similarity on the cytoplasmic side, including seemingly preserved G protein activation mechanisms, while providing similarly remarkable diversity in their extracellular binding sites. This new work from Cerione and colleagues (6.Gao Y. Westfield G. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Skiniotis G. Ramachandran S.

The author thanks Yang Gao for creating the figure."
