Around explants this pattern of wrinkling closely resembles the ""center effects"" long observed in plasma clots and traditionally attributed to dehydration shrinkage."

https://openalex.org/W1984353845,"A 130,000 dalton protein (130K protein), isolated from smooth muscle and having an as yet unknown function, has been studied through the use of microinjection of the protein covalently labeled with the fluorescent dye fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) into living cultured mammalian cells. The distribution of the 130K protein has also been investigated by several different methods including double label fluorescence microscopy of cells microinjected with FITC-130K protein and subsequently stained for 130K protein, actin or fibronectin by indirect immunofluorescence with rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC)-labeled antibodies. Visualization of fluorescence in living fibroblasts 2–4 hr after microinjection of FITC-130K protein showed two major distributions of the fluorescent protein. One of these appeared as bright focal patches on the lower surface of the cells, and was similar to the distribution recently found by Geiger, 1979 Geiger B. A 130K protein from chicken gizzard: its localization at the termini of microfilament bundles in cultured chicken cells. Cell. 1979; 18: 193-205 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar using immunofluorescent localization. Double label fluorescent microscopy of cells injected with FITC-130K protein and stained for actin 2 hr later by indirect immunofluorescence (RITC-antibodies) demonstrated that this focal distribution was at the ends of actin microfilament bundles. A second major distribution observed for the injected protein had a streaky or fibrillar appearance more commonly (but not always) located beneath the upper surface of the cell. Using antibodies against fibronectin and double label fluorescence microscopy, this second distribution of the injected protein was shown to correlate closely with the distribution of surface fibronectin on these cells. Where the fibronectin extended beyond a cell, the 130K protein remained strictly cellular and often appeared concentrated as if in an anchorage point. These findings suggest a possible role for the 130K protein in the organization of actin filaments at membrane attachment sites, and demonstrate that proteins of unknown function can be studied by the microinjection of their fluorescently labeled conjugates into living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032824523,Recombinant DNA procedures and the yeast transformation technique were used to insert the yeast gene LEU 2 (coding for β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase) into the tandem array of ribosomal DNA genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These insertions were shown by genetic and physical techniques to be unstable in meiosis. The meiotic instability was found to be the result of a high level of unequal recombination between ribosomal DNA gene clusters located on sister chromatids.
https://openalex.org/W1600437556,"The protein accumulated in the cell envelope of Escherichia coli treated with globomycin was identified as the precursor of the outer membrane lipoprotein. The prolipoprotein was almost exclusively localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. The prolipoprotein could be immunoprecipitated with antilipoprotein immunoglobulin and could be chased to the lipoprotein in both in vivo and in vitro. Globomycin inhibited the chase. The prolipoprotein contained glycerol and fatty acid residues, whereas no free sulfhydryl group was detected in it. From these results, it is concluded that the prolipoprotein possesses a glyceride which is covalently bound to the cysteine residue in the peptide as the lipoprotein does and that the removal of signal peptide takes place after the modification. The inhibition of bacterial growth with increasing concentrations of globomycin was accompanied by a gradual increase in the accumulation of the prolipoprotein. Furthermore, growth of the lipoprotein-negative mutant was highly resistant to globomycin. These results strongly indicate that the accumulation of the prolipoprotein in the cytoplasmic membrane causes the death of cells."

https://openalex.org/W2004572268,"11S and 18S fractions of yeast mitochondrial RNAs, isolated by electrophoresis through agarose gels, have been found by electron microscopy to contain approximately 50% circular molecules. Circles in the 11S fraction have a contour length of 0.36 +/- 0.02 micron, which is approximately equal to the length of the majority of linear molecules also present. Circles in the 18S fraction have an average length of 0.78 +/- 0.11 micron. The size distribution is broader than for the 11S fraction, and we cannot exclude the possibility that more than one size class may be present. The 11S circular RNA forms circular R loops and RNA-DNA hybrids with DNA fragments of the oxi 3 region of mtDNA, which contains the structural gene for subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase. As judged from the electron micrographs, the complete RNA participates in hybrid formation and the sequences coding for it appear to be continuous. Both 11S and 18S circles withstand treatment with DNAase and pronase. They are not eliminated by treatment with 1 M glyoxal in 50% formamide for 1 hr at 50 degrees C. We conclude that they are covalently closed. The function of the circular RNAs is unknown. They may be active as mRNAs, storage forms, or arise in a cut-and-splice process which generates mRNAs from longer transcripts."

In this communication, it is demonstrated that these mutants lack beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II. The deficiencies in cis-vaccenate synthesis and synthase II are shown to be due to a lesion in the same gene, fabF. Lesions in the fabF gene are found to affect growth only when the strain also carries a lesion in the fabB gene, the structural gene for beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I."
https://openalex.org/W1964451180,"The M species (medium sized) dsRNA (1.1–1.4 × 106 daltons) isolated from a toxin-producing yeast killer strain (K+R+) and three related, defective interfering (suppressive) S species dsRNAs of the yeast killer-associated cytoplasmic multicomponent viral-like particle system were analyzed by in vitro translation in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system. Heat-denatured M species dsRNA programmed the synthesis of two major polypeptides, M-P1 (32,000 daltons) and M-P2 (30,000 daltons). M-P1 has been shown by the criteria of proteolytic peptide mapping and cross-antigenicity to contain the 12,000 dalton polypeptide corresponding to the in vivo produced killer toxin, thus establishing that it is the M species dsRNA which carries the toxin gene. An M species dsRNA obtained from a neutral strain (K−R+) also programmed the in vitro synthesis of a polypeptide identical in molecular weight to M-P1, thus indicating that the cytoplasmic determinant of the mutant neutral phenotype is either a simple point mutation in the dsRNA toxin gene or a mutation in a dsRNA gene which is required for functional toxin production. In vitro translation of each of the three different suppressive S dsRNAs resulted in the production of a polypeptide (S-P1) of approximately 8000 daltons instead of the 32,000 dalton M-P1 polypeptide programmed by M dsRNA. This result is consistent with the heteroduplex analysis of these dsRNAs by Fried and Fink, 1978 Fried H.M. Fink G.R. Electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis of “killer” double-stranded RNA species from yeast. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.

Mitochondrial RNAs were analyzed by the technique of Alwine et al., 1977 Alwine J.C. Kemp D.J. Stark G.R. Method for detection of specific RNAs in agarose gels by transfer to diazobenzyloxymethyl-paper and hybridization with DNA probes. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 74. 1977: 5350-5354 Google Scholar using DNA fragments containing parts of the cytochrome b gene and by electron microscopy. Only high molecular weight, not fully processed transcripts are observed in intron mutants when a carboxy terminal exon probe and an amino proximal intron probe are used, whereas exon mutants contain 2.7 kb mRNA which does not hybridize to the intron probe. The 8.6, 8.1 and 7.1 kb species accumulate in box8, box3 and box10 mutants, respectively. The processing of the first two species is also marked by the sequential appearance of 0.8 and 0.9 kb stable intron RNAs, respectively (“1 kb RNAs”). The interruption of mRNA processing by intron mutations thus allowed the deduction of a pathway for the maturation of cytochrome b mRNA in which introns are sequentially spliced with more than one step for at least some of them. The 1 kb RNAs were also observed in three rho− petites which complement box3 mutations. They were not found in two noncomplementing petites even though these also contain the wild-type box3 allele and produce mtRNA transcripts. The 1 kb RNAs map inside the amino proximal intron that extends from box4 to box1, but outside the segment encompassing box3 mutations. The 1 kb RNA fraction consists of circular RNA molecules 0.275 ± 0.013 μm long and linear molecules 0.238 ± 0.028 μm long. Larger transcripts were also observed in these petites, indicating that petites are capable of transcript processing. These results point out that the normal sequence of nucleotides in an intron and its flanking sites is necessary but insufficient for the correct splice to occur. Other sequences quite remote from it are also important. The onset and progression of splicing most probably involves a temporal succession of specific three-dimensional structures that can be recognized by the enzymic machinery. Mutations that deform these structures and corrections by RNA complementation may be a powerful tool for a better understanding of the phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W1999718090,"The dose-response relationship between cortisol and the accumulation of the two milk proteins, casein and α-lactalbumin, was studied in organ culture of mammary gland from midpregnant mice. The accumulation of casein was low in culture with insulin but was enhanced by the further addition of prolactin. Further increases in casein were effected by the addition of cortisol in increasing concentrations up to 3 × 10−6 M, which was optimal for the accumulation of this protein. The content of α-lactalbumin in explants was similarly low in culture with insulin alone, but, in contrast, was increased to a maximal level by the addition of insulin and prolactin. The addition of cortisol up to 3 × 10−8 M with insulin and prolactin did not further increase the level of α-lactalbumin; in fact, at concentrations above 3 × 10−7 M the steroid caused progressive inhibition of the accumulation of this protein in cultured explants. Studies of the appearance of casein and α-lactalbumin in incubation medium during organ culture revealed the presence of substantial amounts of these milk proteins. During the first 2 days of culture with insulin, prolactin and 3 × 10−6 M cortisol, the amount of α-lactalbumin in culture medium was almost equal to the level found in tissue, whereas in the presence of 3 × 10−8 M cortisol, or in the absence of exogenous steroid, over 70% of total α-lactalbumin was retained in tissue. The observed difference in the amount of α-lactalbumin in culture medium can, however, only partially account for the inhibitory effect of high doses of cortisol on the accumulation of α-lactalbumin in cultured mammary explants. In contrast to α-lactalbumin, the relative amount of casein in culture medium containing insulin and prolactin was smaller—19% of total casein synthesized—and was further reduced to 16% and 11% of the total in the presence of 3 × 10−8 M and 3 × 10−6 M cortisol, respectively. The above results indicate that cortisol exerts dose-dependent differential actions on the accumulation of casein and α-lactalbumin in mouse mammary epithelium in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1543366590,"Membranous sialyltransferase complexes from Escherichia coli K-235 catalyze the synthesis of surface polymers containing alpha-2,8-ketosidically linked polysialic acid. Undecaprenyl phosphate functions as an intermediate carrier of sialic acid (NeuNAc) residues between cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuNAc) and an endogenous acceptor (Troy, F.A., and McCloskey, M.A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem 254, 7377-7387). In vitro pulse-chase experiments now confirm that polymer elongation occurs by the addition of sialyl residues to the nonreducing termini of growing nascent chains. Sequential periodate oxidation and borohydride reduction of radiolabeled polysialic acid was used to quantitatively convert the terminal, nonreducing sialic acid to the 7-carbon analogue, 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-L-arabino-2-heptulosonic acid (NeuNAc7). After complete hydrolysis of the polymers by neuraminidase, the ratio between NeuNAc and NeuNAc7 was used to determine the average degree of polymerization (D.P.). The membrane preparations used as a source of enzyme contained endogenous sialyl polymers that averaged 165 residues in length. During the first phase of in vitro synthesis, lasting about 90 min, 40 to 45 sialyl residues were transferred onto these endogenous acceptors. Subsequent in vitro incorporation increased at a slower, constant rate for at least 16 h. During this second phase of synthesis, the D.P. of newly synthesized chains remained relatively constant while the number of nonreducing terminal end groups, a measure of the number of new sialyl chains, increased. These results establish that individual polymer chains are rapidly elongated in vitro to a defined length of about 200 sialyl residues, then terminated and new chains started. The mechanism signaling chain termination, translocation of the sialyltransferase to a new acceptor, and chain reinitiation remains to be determined. Endogenous and enzymatically synthesized sialyl polymers were solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified to apparent homogeneity. Sialic acid accounted for approximately 93% of the mass of these polymers which had no free reducing terminal sialic acid. This position of the molecule is presumably occupied by an as yet unidentified component which links the sialyl polymer to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2167048995,"The reactions of the Escherichia coli D-galactosebinding protein with the ligands D-galactose and Dglucose have been examined by stopped flow rapid mixing techniques. The change in tryptophan fluorescence that occurs with galactose binding is described by a rapid, second order process; no additional phases of fluorescence change were observed. The resultant time courses were fitted to a simple equilibrium model and the rate constants for galactose binding were calculated to be k,, = 3.3 x lo’ M“ s-l and koa = 4.6 s-l in 10 nm Tris-HC1, pH 7.4 at 20°C. In addition, the dissociation rate constants for glucose (1.4 s-’) and galactose (4.5 s-’) were determined directly from displacement reactions at high concentrations of the complimentary sugar. In both cases, the time courses were exponential in form and consistent with the first order release of sugar from a single binding site. We have also utilized a novel kinetic approach to determine the association rate constant for glucose binding (3 to 4 % lo7 M-’ s-’). For all of these experiments, the data are consistent with a simple mechanism of sugar binding to a single site on the galactose-binding protein. We have also established that purified galactose-binding protein contains an approximately stoichiometric amount of bound glucose which can be readily removed by dialysis against 2 M guanidine HC1. The presence of bound glucose may account for the heterogeneous galactose equilibrium binding curves which have been reported in the past by other investigators."

This activity was inhibited by phosphoramidon, 1,10-phenanthroline, and a number of synthetic inhibitors of thermolysin indicating that the enzyme is a zinc metallopeptidase. Endopeptidase activity was not inhibited by the serine protease inhibitors elastatinal, antipain, leupeptin, N-carbobenzyloxy-L-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, L-tosylamido-2-lysyethyl chloromethyl ketone, L-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, phenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride, or low levels of chymostatin. The endopeptidase had a pH optimum between 7.0 and 7.5. The enzyme also hydrolyzed Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-AMC and Suc-Ala-Gly-Ala-AMC in an analogous way to yield Ala-AMC. Thermolysis hydrolyzed Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-AMC in an analogous way to the endopeptidase. However, thermolysin did not hydrolyze Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-AMC or Suc-Ala-Gly-Ala-AMC, demonstrating that its substrate specificity differs from the endopeptidase."

Cells were labeled with [3H]leucine and [35S]methionine using either a pulse-chase or a continuous labeling method. Proteins were fractionated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and their stabilities relative to total protein were determined from the 3H/35S ratios. Forty-seven proteins appeared to be unstable and were probably either degraded or modified to electrophoretically distinct forms. The apparent half-lives of these proteins calculated from the pulse-chase data varied from 2.0 to 23 h. Twenty-seven proteins appeared to be products of post-translational modifications. One hundred fourteen proteins appeared to be stable. The molar ratios of leucyl and methionyl residues in individual proteins and in total protein were calculated by comparing their 3H/35S ratios to that of a protein with known amino acid composition. These values varied from 1.7 to 12. The half-lives of the unstable proteins did not exhibit a correlation with protein molecular weights, isoelectric points, or leucine/methionine ratios. It may be significant, however, that 6 of the 10 most unstable proteins had low leucine/methionine ratios whereas only 11% of all proteins tested had similarly low ratios."

The purified mutant enzyme shows both methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase activities, but lacks formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity. The biochemical characterization of the mutant protein described in this paper is consistent with genetic data which indicate that the 1050 mutation is a point mutation at the ade3 locus of chromosome VII of S. cerevisiae. The molecular weight of the native mutant protein (Mr = 227,000 by exclusion chromatography), as well as the number and size of its subunits are exactly the same as those of the trifunctional wild type enzyme. In addition, both proteins have the same sedimentation behavior in a glycerol density gradient (s20,w = 9.4 S), and their activities and structures are equally affected by exposure to mild tryptic degradation. ATP protects both enzymes from tryptic degradation, but NADP+ does not. Some of the kinetic properties of the activities of both enzymes were also determined and were essentially similar. Although both enzymes require the presence of metals for maximal synthetase and dehydrogenase activities, metals are not necessary to maintain their structures intact."

The matrix-bound subunits obtained after dissociation of the immobilized dimer were shown to be catalytically inactive by three different criteria: 1) The level of phosphatase activity in the matrix-bound subunit population ,was dependent on the extent of cyanogen bromide activation of the support. 2) After cross-linking reversibly immobilized subunit preparations, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of protein released from the Sepharose demonstrated the presence of sufficient amounts of dimeric structures to account for the phosphatase activity in these populations. 3) The protein in the matrix-bound subunits was more susceptible to proteolytic digestion than that in the matrix-bound dimer, while the catalytic activity in both immobilized derivatives remained constant. These results indicate that the subunits of alkaline phosphatase are catalytically inactive, and that the low levels of phosphatase activity observed are due to the presence of trace amounts of contaminating dimers. Titration of matrix-bound ‘261-labeled subunits with soluble nascent ‘311-labeled subunits restored 60% of the original phosphatase activity. The isotope ratio of I3’I- to “%protein reached a final value of 1.06 and provided a very sensitive indication of the extent of dimerization throughout the titration. When the immobilized apodimer and apomonomer were titrated with ssZnz+, the matrix-bound monomer bound 0.9 eq of Zn2+ while the matrix-bound dimer bound 4.1 eq of Zn2+; the Zn2+ binding sites in both immobilized derivatives had dissociation constants of 2 X M or lower. The preparation and characterization of immobilized subunits of alkaline phosphatase under solvent conditions optimal for renaturation should provide a valuable approach for studying the role of subunit interactions in this enzyme. Moreover, the techniques used in this investigation are generally applicable for the characterization of other immobilized enzyme derivatives. Although many proteins form oligomeric structures, the importance of subunit interactions for enzymatic function, regulation, or conformational stability has not yet been established.

At temperatures below -30 degrees C, the reaction produced biphasic changes in the protein fluorescence. The slow phase caused a 15 to 20% quenching of protein fluorescence, reached a maximum at 50 to 100 micro M NADH, and had an energy of activation of 27.3 kcal/mol. The fast phase appeared to be linearly dependent upon NADH concentration, produced a 45 to 50% quenching of the protein fluorescence, and had an energy of activation of 19.6 kcal/mol. The results are interpreted in terms of a three-step binding reaction, corresponding to initial complexation followed by conformational changes."
