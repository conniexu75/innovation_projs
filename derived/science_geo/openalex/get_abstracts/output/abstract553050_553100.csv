https://openalex.org/W2277268914,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of odontogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) on hydrogel scaffolds derived from bone extracellular matrix (bECM) in comparison to those seeded on collagen I (Col-I), one of the main components of dental pulp ECM.DPSCs isolated from human third molars were characterized for surface marker expression and odontogenic potential prior to seeding into bECM or Col-I hydrogel scaffolds. The cells were then seeded onto bECM and Col-I hydrogel scaffolds and cultured under basal conditions or with odontogenic and growth factor (GF) supplements. DPSCs cultivated on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) with and without supplements were used as controls. Gene expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1) and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and mineral deposition was observed by Von Kossa staining.When DPSCs were cultured on bECM hydrogels, the mRNA expression levels of DSPP, DMP-1 and MEPE genes were significantly upregulated with respect to those cultured on Col-I scaffolds or TCPS in the absence of extra odontogenic inducers. In addition, more mineral deposition was observed on bECM hydrogel scaffolds as demonstrated by Von Kossa staining. Moreover, DSPP, DMP-1 and MEPE mRNA expressions of DPSCs cultured on bECM hydrogels were further upregulated by the addition of GFs or osteo/odontogenic medium compared to Col-I treated cells in the same culture conditions.These results demonstrate the potential of the bECM hydrogel scaffolds to stimulate odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs."

The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the effects of three independent variables each with three treatments. They included extraction temperatures (30, 40 and 50°C), ultrasonic power levels (30, 50 and 70%) and extraction times (10, 20 and 30 min). The optimal conditions for extractions of total phenolics from pumpkins were inferred to be a temperature of 41.45°C, a power of 44.60% and a time of 25.67 min. However, an extraction temperature of 40.99°C, power of 56.01% and time of 25.71 min was optimal for recovery of free radical scavenging activity (measured by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reduction). The optimal conditions for peach extracts were an extraction temperature of 41.53°C, power of 43.99% and time of 27.86 min for total phenolics. However, an extraction temperature of 41.60°C, power of 44.88% and time of 27.49 min was optimal for free radical scavenging activity (judged by from DPPH reduction). Further, the UAE processes were significantly better than solvent extractions without ultrasound. By electron microscopy it was concluded that ultrasonic processing caused damage in cells for all treated samples (pumpkin, peach). However, the FTIR spectra did not show any significant changes in chemical structures caused by either ultrasonic processing or solvent extraction."

Thus, better knowledge and specific targeting of the pathways that lead to these noxious species may result in valuable therapeutic strategies. We characterized some effects of the molecular chaperone clusterin, providing new and more detailed evidence of its potential neuroprotective effects. Using a classical thioflavin T assay, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of the aggregation process. The global analysis of time courses under different conditions demonstrated that clusterin has no effect on the elongation rate but mainly interferes with the nucleation processes (both primary and secondary), reducing the number of nuclei available for further fibril growth. Then, using a recently developed immunoassay based on surface plasmon resonance, we obtained direct evidence of a high-affinity (KD = 1 nm) interaction of clusterin with biologically relevant Aβ1–42 oligomers, selectively captured on the sensor chip. Moreover, with the same technology, we observed that substoichiometric concentrations of clusterin prevent oligomer interaction with the antibody 4G8, suggesting that the chaperone shields hydrophobic residues exposed on the oligomeric assemblies. Finally, we found that preincubation with clusterin antagonizes the toxic effects of Aβ1–42 oligomers, as evaluated in a recently developed in vivo model in Caenorhabditis elegans. These data substantiate the interaction of clusterin with biologically active regions exposed on nuclei/oligomers of Aβ1–42, providing a molecular basis for the neuroprotective effects of the chaperone.

https://openalex.org/W2278050465,"The Nrf2 (NFE2L2) cell defense pathway protects against oxidative stress and disorders including cancer and neurodegeneration. Although activated modestly by oxidative stress alone, robust activation of the Nrf2 defense mechanism requires the additional presence of co-factors that facilitate electron exchange. Various molecules exhibit this co-factor function, including sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables. However, natural co-factors that are potent and widely available from dietary sources have not been identified previously. The objectives of this study were to investigate support of the Nrf2 cell defense pathway by the alkyl catechols: 4-methylcatechol, 4-vinylcatechol, and 4-ethylcatechol. These small electrochemicals are naturally available from numerous sources but have not received attention. Findings reported here illustrate that these compounds are indeed potent co-factors for activation of the Nrf2 pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Each strongly supports expression of Nrf2 target genes in a variety of human cell types; and, in addition, 4-ethylcatechol is orally active in mice. Furthermore, findings reported here identify important and previously unrecognized sources of these compounds, arising from biotransformation of common plant compounds by lactobacilli that express phenolic acid decarboxylase. Thus, for example, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus collinoides, which are consumed from a diet rich in traditionally fermented foods and beverages, convert common phenolic acids found in fruits and vegetables to 4-vinylcatechol and/or 4-ethylcatechol. In addition, all of the alkyl catechols are found in wood smoke that was used widely for food preservation. Thus, the potentially numerous sources of alkyl catechols in traditional foods suggest that these co-factors were common in ancient diets. However, with radical changes in food preservation, alkyl catechols have been lost from modern foods. The absence of alkyl catechols from the modern Western diet suggests serious negative consequences for Nrf2 cell defense, resulting in reduced protection against multiple chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2284570161,"During the last decade, the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has been steadily increasing in neurosurgery. The study's main objectives were to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 5-ALA when used in clinical practice setting on high-grade gliomas' patients.National, multicenter and prospective observational study.authorized conditions of use of 5-ALA.contraindication to 5-ALA, inoperable or partial resected tumors, pregnancy and children. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and safety data were collected. Effectiveness was assessed using complete resection of the tumor, and progression-free and overall survival probabilities.Between May 2010 and September 2014, 85 patients treated with 5-ALA were included, and 77 were suitable for the effectiveness analysis. Complete resection was achieved in 41 patients (54%). Surgeons considered suboptimal the fluorescence of 5-ALA in 40% of the patients assessed. The median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months. The progression-free survival probability at 6 months was 58%. The median duration overall survival was 14.2 months. Progression tumor risk factors were grade of glioma, age and resection degree; and death risk factors were grade of glioma and gender. No severe adverse effects were reported. At one month after surgery, new or increased neurological morbidity was 6.5%. Hepatic enzymes were frequently increased within the first month after surgery; however, they subsequently normalized, and this was found to have no clinical significance.In clinical practice, the 5-ALA showed a good safety profile, but the benefits related to 5-ALA have not been yet clearly shown. The improved differentiation expected by fluorescence between normal and tumor cerebral tissue was suboptimal in a relevant number of patients; in addition, the expected higher degree of resection was lower than in clinical trials as well as incomplete resection was not identified as a prognostic factor risk for death. Because optimal fluorescence was correlated to higher complete resection rate, further research is needed to identify patients (or tumors) with more surgery benefits when using the 5-ALA."
https://openalex.org/W2284585588,"Reactive oxygen or nitrogen species are generated in the plant cell during the extreme stress condition, which produces toxic compounds after reacting with the organic molecules. The glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzymes play a significant role to detoxify these toxins and help in excretion or sequestration of them. In the present study, we have cloned 1023 bp long promoter region of tau class GST from an extreme halophyte Salicornia brachiata and functionally characterized using the transgenic approach in tobacco. Computational analysis revealed the presence of abiotic stress responsive cis-elements like ABRE, MYB, MYC, GATA, GT1 etc., phytohormones, pathogen and wound responsive motifs. Three 5’-deletion constructs of 730 (GP2), 509 (GP3) and 348 bp (GP4) were made from 1023 (GP1) promoter fragment and used for tobacco transformation. The single event transgenic plants showed notable GUS reporter protein expression in the leaf tissues of control as well as treated plants. The expression level of the GUS gradually decreases from GP1 to GP4 in leaf tissues, whereas the highest level of expression was detected with the GP2 construct in root and stem under control condition. The GUS expression was found higher in leaves and stems of salinity or osmotic stress treated transgenic plants than that of the control plants, but, lower in roots. An efficient expression level of GUS in transgenic plants suggests that this promoter can be used for both constitutive as well as stress inducible expression of gene(s). And this property, make it as a potential candidate to be used as an alternative promoter for crop genetic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2274175710,"Despite the old adage not to 'judge a book by its cover', facial cues often guide first impressions and these first impressions guide our decisions. Literature suggests there are valid facial cues that assist us in assessing someone's health or intelligence, but such cues are overshadowed by an 'attractiveness halo' whereby desirable attributions are preferentially ascribed to attractive people. The impact of the attractiveness halo effect on perceptions of academic performance in the classroom is concerning as this has shown to influence students' future performance. We investigated the limiting effects of the attractiveness halo on perceptions of actual academic performance in faces of 100 university students. Given the ambiguity and various perspectives on the definition of intelligence and the growing consensus on the importance of conscientiousness over intelligence in predicting actual academic performance, we also investigated whether perceived conscientiousness was a more accurate predictor of academic performance than perceived intelligence. Perceived conscientiousness was found to be a better predictor of actual academic performance when compared to perceived intelligence and perceived academic performance, and accuracy was improved when controlling for the influence of attractiveness on judgments. These findings emphasize the misleading effect of attractiveness on the accuracy of first impressions of competence, which can have serious consequences in areas such as education and hiring. The findings also have implications for future research investigating impression accuracy based on facial stimuli."

Key results of ordinal and binary logistic regression analyses indicated that, after controlling for demographic factors, (1) adults with a high school diploma use more text-based health information sources while adults without a high school diploma use more oral sources, (2) using the Internet as a source of health information is more strongly related to reporting excellent/very good health status than having a high school diploma, (3) those without a high school diploma who use the Internet report the largest increase in health status over any other health information source, and (4) for those with learning disability or vision problem, a high facility in reading English is an important predictor of whether the Internet is used as a health information source. The Internet appears to play a key role in both enhancing health status and enabling use of preventive measures for those with and without a high school diploma; although, individuals without a high school diploma who use the Internet for health information derive substantial benefit in health status."
https://openalex.org/W2419045660,"Matricellular proteins mediate pleiotropic effects during tissue injury and repair. CCN1 is a matricellular protein that has been implicated in angiogenesis, inflammation, and wound repair. In this study, we identified CCN1 as a gene that is differentially up-regulated in alveolar mesenchymal cells of human subjects with rapidly progressive idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Elevated levels of CCN1 mRNA were confirmed in lung tissues of IPF subjects undergoing lung transplantation, and CCN1 protein was predominantly localized to fibroblastic foci. CCN1 expression in ex vivo IPF lung fibroblasts correlated with gene expression of the extracellular matrix proteins, collagen (Col)1a1, Col1a2, and fibronectin as well as the myofibroblast marker, α-smooth muscle actin. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of CCN1 down-regulated the constitutive expression of these profibrotic genes in IPF fibroblasts. TGF-β1, a known mediator of tissue fibrogenesis, induces gene and protein expression of CCN1 via a mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3)-dependent mechanism. Importantly, endogenous CCN1 potentiates TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 activation and induction of profibrotic genes, supporting a positive feedback loop leading to myofibroblast activation. In vivo RNAi-mediated silencing of CCN1 attenuates fibrogenic responses to bleomycin-induced lung injury. These studies support previously unrecognized, cooperative interaction between the CCN1 matricellular protein and canonical TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling that promotes lung fibrosis.-Kurundkar, A. R., Kurundkar, D., Rangarajan, S., Locy, M. L., Zhou, Y., Liu, R.-M., Zmijewski, J., Thannickal, V. J. The matricellular protein CCN1 enhances TGF-β1/SMAD3-dependent profibrotic signaling in fibroblasts and contributes to fibrogenic responses to lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2345977595,"High tidal volume mechanical ventilation and the resultant excessive mechanical forces experienced by lung vascular endothelium are known to lead to increased vascular endothelial leak, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. One reported mechanotransduction pathway of increased endothelial cell (EC) permeability caused by high magnitude cyclic stretch (18% CS) involves CS-induced activation of the focal adhesion associated signalosome, which triggers Rho GTPase signaling. This study identified an alternative pathway of CS-induced EC permeability. We show here that high magnitude cyclic stretch (18% CS) rapidly activates VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling by dissociating VEGFR2 from VE-cadherin at the cell junctions. This results in VEGFR2 activation, Src-dependent VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation, and internalization leading to increased endothelial permeability. This process is also accompanied by CS-induced phosphorylation and internalization of PECAM1. Importantly, CS-induced endothelial barrier disruption was attenuated by VEGFR2 inhibition. 18% CS-induced EC permeability was linked to dissociation of cell junction scaffold afadin from the adherens junctions. Forced expression of recombinant afadin in pulmonary endothelium attenuated CS-induced VEGFR2 and VE-cadherin phosphorylation, preserved adherens junction integrity and VEGFR2·VE-cadherin complex, and suppressed CS-induced EC permeability. This study shows for the first time a mechanism whereby VEGFR2 activation mediates EC permeability induced by pathologically relevant cyclic stretch. In this mechanism, CS induces dissociation of the VE-cadherin·VEGFR2 complex localized at the adherens juctions, causing activation of VEGFR2, VEGFR2-mediated Src-dependent phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, disassembly of adherens junctions, and EC barrier failure.

https://openalex.org/W2280626006,"Reports concerning the effect of endurance exercise on the anabolic response to strength training have been contradictory. This study re-investigated this issue, focusing on training effects on indicators of protein synthesis and degradation. Two groups of male subjects performed 7 weeks of resistance exercise alone (R; n = 7) or in combination with preceding endurance exercise, including both continuous and interval cycling (ER; n = 9). Muscle biopsies were taken before and after the training period. Similar increases in leg-press 1 repetition maximum (30%; P<0.05) were observed in both groups, whereas maximal oxygen uptake was elevated (8%; P<0.05) only in the ER group. The ER training enlarged the areas of both type I and type II fibers, whereas the R protocol increased only the type II fibers. The mean fiber area increased by 28% (P<0.05) in the ER group, whereas no significant increase was observed in the R group. Moreover, expression of Akt and mTOR protein was enhanced in the ER group, whereas only the level of mTOR was elevated following R training. Training-induced alterations in the levels of both Akt and mTOR protein were correlated to changes in type I fiber area (r = 0.55-0.61, P<0.05), as well as mean fiber area (r = 0.55-0.61, P<0.05), reflecting the important role played by these proteins in connection with muscle hypertrophy. Both training regimes reduced the level of MAFbx protein (P<0.05) and tended to elevate that of MuRF-1. The present findings indicate that the larger hypertrophy observed in the ER group is due more to pronounced stimulation of anabolic rather than inhibition of catabolic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2281787360,"Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) share clinical features, genetic risk factors and neuroimaging abnormalities. There is evidence of disrupted connectivity in resting state networks in patients with SZ and BD and their unaffected relatives. Resting state networks are known to undergo reorganization during youth coinciding with the period of increased incidence for both disorders. We therefore focused on characterizing resting state network connectivity in youth at familial risk for SZ or BD to identify alterations arising during this period. We measured resting-state functional connectivity in a sample of 106 youth, aged 7–19 years, comprising offspring of patients with SZ (N = 27), offspring of patients with BD (N = 39) and offspring of community control parents (N = 40). We used Independent Component Analysis to assess functional connectivity within the default mode, executive control, salience and basal ganglia networks and define their relationship to grey matter volume, clinical and cognitive measures. There was no difference in connectivity within any of the networks examined between offspring of patients with BD and offspring of community controls. In contrast, offspring of patients with SZ showed reduced connectivity within the left basal ganglia network compared to control offspring, and they showed a positive correlation between connectivity in this network and grey matter volume in the left caudate. Our findings suggest that dysconnectivity in the basal ganglia network is a robust correlate of familial risk for SZ and can be detected during childhood and adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2281471080,"The cysteine protease cathepsin C (CatC) activates granule-associated proinflammatory serine proteases in hematopoietic precursor cells. Its early inhibition in the bone marrow is regarded as a new therapeutic strategy for treating proteolysis-driven chronic inflammatory diseases, but its complete inhibition is elusive in vivo. Controlling the activity of CatC may be achieved by directly inhibiting its activity with a specific inhibitor or/and by preventing its maturation. We have investigated immunochemically and kinetically the occurrence of CatC and its proform in human hematopoietic precursor cells and in differentiated mature immune cells in lung secretions. The maturation of proCatC obeys a multistep mechanism that can be entirely managed by CatS in neutrophilic precursor cells. CatS inhibition by a cell-permeable inhibitor abrogated the release of the heavy and light chains from proCatC and blocked ∼80% of CatC activity. Under these conditions the activity of neutrophil serine proteases, however, was not abolished in precursor cell cultures. In patients with neutrophilic lung inflammation, mature CatC is found in large amounts in sputa. It is secreted by activated neutrophils as confirmed through lipopolysaccharide administration in a nonhuman primate model. CatS inhibitors currently in clinical trials are expected to decrease the activity of neutrophilic CatC without affecting those of elastase-like serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2280501026,"The administration of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) beneficially modulates gastrointestinal functions and may enhance the metabolism of polyphenols. However, different polyphenolic components in the diet may have different influences on the activities of the digestive enzymes and microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a 4-week study of forty-eight male Wistar rats was conducted to investigate the physiological response of the rat cecal environment to diets without and with FOS that contained two different strawberry polyphenolic extracts, specifically EP (polyphenolic profile 60, 35, 5, and 0% ellagitannins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, anthocyanins, respectively) and EPA (polyphenolic profile: 50, 35, 6, and 9%, respectively). When combined with FOS, both extracts beneficially enhanced the acidification of the cecal digesta (P≤0.05 vs the groups without extracts), but the dietary combination of EPA and FOS elicited the greatest reduction in putrefactive short-chain fatty acid production and the lowest fecal β-glucuronidase activity in the cecum (P≤0.05 vs group EP). Moreover, the addition of dietary FOS elevated the metabolism of the examined strawberry extracts in the cecum and thereby increased the concentrations of the metabolites in the cecal digesta and urine (P≤0.05 vs the group with cellulose). Overall, both strawberry extracts modulated the effects of FOS in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the combination with EPA extract that contained anthocyanins exhibited greater beneficial effects in the lower gut environment than the EP extract."
https://openalex.org/W2281279142,"Although zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) has been identified as a key factor in the regulation of breast cancer differentiation and metastasis, its potential role in modulating tumor angiogenesis has not been fully examined. Here, we present the novel finding that conditioned medium derived from ZEB1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increased the capillary tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas ZEB1 knockdown by RNA interference had the opposite effect. ZEB1 caused marked upregulation of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) at both mRNA and protein levels. Pre-incubation of HUVECs with anti-VEGFA neutralized antibody attenuated ZEB1-mediated tube formation of HUVECs. In breast cancer tissues, expression of ZEB1 was positively correlated with those of VEGFA and CD31. At the molecular level, ZEB1 activated VEGFA transcription by increasing SP1 recruitment to its promoter, which was mediated via the activation of PI3K and p38 pathways. Using a nude mouse xenograft model, we demonstrated that elevated expression of ZEB1 promotes in vivo tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in breast cancer. Collectively, we found that ZEB1-expressing breast cancer cells increase VEGFA production and thus stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis via a paracrine mechanism."

Many endophytic fungi are known to produce a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with potential energy applications, which have been described as ""mycodiesel"". Many of these mycodiesel hydrocarbons are terpenes, a chemically diverse class of compounds produced by many plants, fungi, and bacteria. Due to their high energy densities, terpenes, such as pinene and bisabolene, are actively being investigated as potential ""drop-in"" biofuels for replacing diesel and aviation fuel. In this study, we rapidly discovered and characterized 26 terpene synthases (TPSs) derived from four endophytic fungi known to produce mycodiesel hydrocarbons. The TPS genes were expressed in an E. coli strain harboring a heterologous mevalonate pathway designed to enhance terpene production, and their product profiles were determined using Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME) and GC-MS. Out of the 26 TPS’s profiled, 12 TPS’s were functional, with the majority of them exhibiting both monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2286107515,"The ecological impacts of alien species invasion are a major threat to global biodiversity. The increasing number of invasion events by alien species and the high cost and difficulty of eradicating invasive species once established require the development of new methods and tools for predicting the most susceptible areas to invasion. Invasive pollinators pose serious threats to biodiversity and human activity due to their close relationship with many plants (including crop species) and high potential competitiveness for resources with native pollinators. Although at an early stage of expansion, the bumblebee species Bombus terrestris is becoming a representative case of pollinator invasion at a global scale, particularly given its high velocity of invasive spread and the increasing number of reports of its impacts on native bees and crops in many countries. We present here a methodological framework of habitat suitability modeling that integrates new approaches for detecting habitats that are susceptible to Bombus terrestris invasion at a global scale. Our approach did not include reported invaded locations in the modeling procedure; instead, those locations were used exclusively to evaluate the accuracy of the models in predicting suitability over regions already invaded. Moreover, a new and more intuitive approach was developed to select the models and evaluate different algorithms based on their performance and predictive convergence. Finally, we present a comprehensive global map of susceptibility to Bombus terrestris invasion that highlights priority areas for monitoring."

CARD11 activity is controlled by an inhibitory domain (ID), which participates in intramolecular interactions and prevents cofactor binding prior to receptor triggering. Oncogenic CARD11 mutations associated with the activated B cell-like subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma somehow perturb ID-mediated autoinhibition to confer CARD11 with the dysregulated spontaneous signaling to NF-κB that is required for the proliferation and survival of the lymphoma. Here, we investigate how the four repressive elements (REs) we have discovered in the CARD11 ID function to inhibit CARD11 activity with cooperativity and redundancy. We find that each RE contributes to the maintenance of the closed inactive state of CARD11 that predominates in the absence of receptor engagement. Each RE also contributes to the prevention of Bcl10 binding in the basal unstimulated state. RE1, RE2, and RE3 participate in intramolecular interactions with other CARD11 domains and share domain targets for binding. Remarkably, diffuse large B cell lymphoma-associated gain-of-function mutations in the caspase recruitment domain, LATCH, or coiled coil can perturb intramolecular interactions mediated by multiple REs, suggesting how single amino acid oncogenic CARD11 mutations can perturb or bypass the action of redundant inhibitory REs to achieve the level of hyperactive CARD11 signaling required to support lymphoma growth.

Previous studies have shown that these single amino acid mutations hyperactivate CARD11 signaling activity by interfering with autoinhibition by the ID (26.Lamason R.L. McCully R.R. Lew S.M.

Oncogenic CARD11 mutations in the CARD, LATCH, and coiled coil disrupt intramolecular binding of the ID and lead to the spontaneous recruitment of Bcl10 to CARD11 in the absence of signal-induced ID neutralization, which promotes the dysregulated activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB (26.Lamason R.L. McCully R.R. Lew S.M. Pomerantz J.L.

In the accompanying paper (28.Jattani R.P. Tritapoe J.M. Pomerantz J.L. Cooperative control of caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11) signaling by an unusual array of redundant repressive elements.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 8324-8336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we resolved this apparent paradox by defining the existence of four repressive elements (REs) in the CARD11 ID that function cooperatively with redundancy to autoinhibit CARD11 prior to receptor engagement. The redundant properties of the REs make single amino acid mutations in the ID unable to activate CARD11 signaling activity to the extent that point mutations in the CARD, LATCH, and coiled coil can achieve. Here, we investigate which of the four REs participate in inhibitory interactions with other CARD11 domains, map their intramolecular targets, and address whether the REs control signaling cofactor binding and, if so, whether they do so cooperatively. Finally, we investigate how DLBCL-associated oncogenic mutations affect RE function in a manner that can result in the observed robust dysregulated CARD11-mediated signaling to NF-κB. HEK293T and human Jurkat T cell lines were cultured as described previously (29.Lamason R.L. Kupfer A. Pomerantz J.L.

The ΔIDΔLATCH construct deletes residues 116–149 and 441–671; we note that the LATCH has been previously defined to occupy residues 112–130 (27.Chan W. Schaffer T.B. Pomerantz J.L.

Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5668-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To generate pEBB-FLAG-GST-ID, a DNA fragment of CARD11 corresponding to amino acids 441–671 was cloned into pEBB in-frame with an N-terminal FLAG tag and GST derived from pEBG (11.McCully R.R.

To generate FLAG-GST-RE multimers, the full-length ID in pEBB-FLAG-GST-ID was replaced with four copies of the DNA encoding RE1, RE2, RE3, or RE4 corresponding to CARD11 residues 441–493, 586–599, 600–610, or 617–641, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (27.Chan W. Schaffer T.B. Pomerantz J.L.

Biol. 2013; 33: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), except for the following. Cells were cotransfected with 4–700 ng of expression vector for each CARD11 variant and 110–400 ng of FLAG-Bcl10, 600 ng of FLAG-TRAF6, 1300 ng of FLAG-IKKγ, or 1350 ng of FLAG-Casp-8 C360S. At 40–42 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (IPLB), incubated on ice for 10 min, scraped off, and centrifuged at 17,970 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Eleven microliters or 21 μl of lysate was reserved for Western blot analysis and 440 μl or 420 μl of the remaining lysate was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma F7425). Input and immunoprecipitation elutions were resolved by immunoblot as described previously (27.Chan W. Schaffer T.B. Pomerantz J.L.

Cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in 2 ml of media in 6-well plates 22–23 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 500–1600 ng of FLAG-GST variants and 50–900 ng of CARD11 variants. In each experiment, additional pcDNA3 and pEBB vectors were transfected such that each well was transfected with equal amounts of pcDNA3 vector and pEBB vector and totaled 2 μg of DNA. Media were changed 22–24.5 h post-transfection and harvested as described previously (11.McCully R.R. Pomerantz J.L.

Cells were lysed in 500 μl of IPLB and precleared twice for 30 min with a 10-μl bed volume of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) with 4 °C rotation. From the precleared lysate, 2 or 3% of lysate was reserved for input. 440 μl of precleared lysate was incubated with a 10-μl bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were washed and analyzed as described previously (11.McCully R.R. Pomerantz J.L.

Western blotting was completed using anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-40) and anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-459) antibodies. Results shown are representative of two or three assays that were performed. To stably express Myc-tagged CARD11 variants in Jurkat T cells, cDNAs were cloned into the pCLIP3A vector; retroviruses were packaged, and Jurkat T cells were infected as described previously (27.Chan W. Schaffer T.B. Pomerantz J.L. A quantitative signaling screen identifies CARD11 mutations in the CARD and LATCH domains that induce Bcl10 ubiquitination and human lymphoma cell survival.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Infected cells were selected and maintained in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. For some constructs, to obtain Jurkat T cells with equivalent expression levels of CARD11 variants, cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution and expanded. Control Jurkat T cells or Jurkat T cells stably expressing Myc-tagged CARD11 variants were resuspended to a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml and treated with or without 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Sigma) and 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C as follows. For Bcl10 immunoprecipitations, 7.5 × 107 cells were untreated or stimulated for 15 min. To test IKKα immunoprecipitations, 1 × 108 cells were untreated or stimulated for 15 min. To assess TRAF6 immunoprecipitations, 9 × 107 cells were untreated or stimulated for 10 min. Caspase-8 immunoprecipitations were assessed with 9 × 107 cells untreated or stimulated for 12 min. After stimulation, cells were incubated in an ice-water bath for 10 min, spun at 423 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and lysed in 1.3 ml of IPLB with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340) or IPLB containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340), 2.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Cells were incubated with lysis buffer for 15 min on ice, and cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C. Cell lysates were precleared twice with a 14-μl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma P9424) or protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. One percent of the precleared lysate was saved for analysis by Western blotting, and the remaining fraction was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Bcl10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-5273), anti-IKKα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7606), anti-TRAF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-8409), or anti-caspase-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-6136) antibody overnight at 4 °C with rotation. A 14-μl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose that had been blocked with 1% insulin (Sigma I9278) was added to each sample and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The resulting immunocomplex was washed with IPLB four times for 5 min at 4 °C with rotation. The samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Myc (Cell Signaling 2278), anti-Bcl10 (Sigma sc-5611), anti-IKKα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7218), anti-TRAF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7221), or anti-caspase-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7890) antibodies.

Previous work demonstrated that under basal unstimulated conditions, the ID as a whole maintains CARD11 in a closed inactive state in part by participating in intramolecular interactions that involve the CARD and coiled coil and prevent the association of CARD11 with the signaling cofactors Bcl10, TRAF6, caspase-8, and IKKγ (11.McCully R.R. Pomerantz J.L. The protein kinase C-responsive inhibitory domain of CARD11 functions in NF-κB activation to regulate the association of multiple signaling cofactors that differentially depend on Bcl10 and MALT1 for association.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5668-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To probe the contribution of the four REs to the maintenance of the closed inactive state of CARD11, we assessed the ability of a GST-ID fusion to associate with wild-type CARD11, the ΔID, and variants of full-length CARD11 containing all combinations of mutated REs after coexpression in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2). For ease of representation, the presence of a mutated RE in a construct is indicated by lowercase letters (e.g. re1), and the presence of a wild-type RE is indicated by capital letters (e.g. RE1). As shown previously (11.McCully R.R. Pomerantz J.L. The protein kinase C-responsive inhibitory domain of CARD11 functions in NF-κB activation to regulate the association of multiple signaling cofactors that differentially depend on Bcl10 and MALT1 for association.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5668-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the GST-ID robustly associated with the ΔID but did not associate with wild-type CARD11, presumably because the ID present in cis prevented the association of the GST-ID in trans (Fig. 2A). Mutation of all four REs in the re1 re2 re3 re4 quadruple RE mutant allowed the GST-ID to associate, indicating that one or more of the REs are required for ID-mediated intramolecular interactions (Fig. 2A). The mutation of any single RE was insufficient to allow robust GST-ID binding, as compared with that observed with the re1 re2 re3 re4 quadruple RE mutant (Fig. 2A), although the mutation of either RE1 or RE4 resulted in detectable binding that was higher than that observed with wild-type CARD11. The combined mutation of any two REs resulted in GST-ID binding that was greater than that observed with single RE mutants (Fig. 2B), while three of four triple RE mutants displayed binding to the GST-ID that was equivalent to that observed with the re1 re2 re3 re4 quadruple RE mutant (Fig. 2C). Thus, any combination of three wild-type REs in cis was efficient at preventing GST-ID binding in trans (Fig. 2A) and could do so to a greater extent than any combination of two wild-type REs (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that all four REs contribute cooperatively to intramolecular interactions with other domains in CARD11 and that there is not a specific single RE or subset of REs that controls these intramolecular interactions. The ID has previously been shown to regulate the association of CARD11 with Bcl10 (11.McCully R.R. Pomerantz J.L. The protein kinase C-responsive inhibitory domain of CARD11 functions in NF-κB activation to regulate the association of multiple signaling cofactors that differentially depend on Bcl10 and MALT1 for association.Mol.

Myoblasts play an important role in maintaining muscle mass through regenerative processes, which are impaired during aging. Vitamin E potentially ameliorates age-related phenotypes. Hence, this study aimed to determine the effects of the tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) and α-tocopherol (ATF) in protecting myoblasts from replicative senescence and promoting myogenic differentiation. Primary human myoblasts were cultured into young and senescent stages and were then treated with TRF or ATF for 24 h, followed by an analysis of cell proliferation, senescence biomarkers, cellular morphology and differentiation. Our data showed that replicative senescence impaired the normal regenerative processes of myoblasts, resulting in changes in cellular morphology, cell proliferation, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) expression, myogenic differentiation and myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) expression. Treatment with both TRF and ATF was beneficial to senescent myoblasts in reclaiming the morphology of young cells, improved cell viability and decreased SA-β-gal expression. However, only TRF treatment increased BrdU incorporation in senescent myoblasts, as well as promoted myogenic differentiation through the modulation of MRFs at the mRNA and protein levels. MYOD1 and MYOG gene expression and myogenin protein expression were modulated in the early phases of myogenic differentiation. In conclusion, the tocotrienol-rich fraction is superior to α-tocopherol in ameliorating replicative senescence-related aberration and promoting differentiation via modulation of MRFs expression, indicating vitamin E potential in modulating replicative senescence of myoblasts."

Here we show that NMDARs control the activity of the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) by consecutively recruiting two related brefeldin A-resistant Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors, BRAG1 and BRAG2, in a GluN2 subunit-dependent manner. In young cortical cultures, GluN2B and BRAG1 tonically activated Arf6. In mature cultures, Arf6 was activated through GluN2A and BRAG2 upon NMDA treatment, whereas the tonic Arf6 activation was not detectable any longer. This shift in Arf6 regulation and the associated drop in Arf6 activity were reversed by a knockdown of BRAG2. Given their sequential recruitment during development, we examined whether BRAG1 and BRAG2 influence synaptic currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons using patch clamp recordings in acute slices from mice at different ages. The number of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) miniature events was reduced by depletion of BRAG1 but not by depletion of BRAG2 during the first 2 weeks after birth. In contrast, depletion of BRAG2 during postnatal weeks 4 and 5 reduced the number of AMPAR miniature events and compromised the quantal sizes of both AMPAR and NMDAR currents evoked at Schaffer collateral synapses. We conclude that both Arf6 activation through GluN2B-BRAG1 during early development and the transition from BRAG1- to BRAG2-dependent Arf6 signaling induced by the GluN2 subunit switch are critical for the development of mature glutamatergic synapses.

Antibodies to Arf6 (ab49931, Abcam), BRAG1 (sc-168198, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; HPA003973, Sigma-Aldrich), FLAG (F1804 and F7425, Sigma-Aldrich), GFP (ab13970, Abcam), GluA2 (MAB397, Millipore), GluN1 (11711, Synaptic Systems), GluN2A (07-632, Millipore), GluN2B (sc-9057, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA (HA.11, Covance), Homer1b/c (ab97593, Abcam), PSD-95 (MAB1596, Millipore), α-tubulin (T9026, Sigma-Aldrich), βIII-tubulin (TUJ1, Covance), and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT 1) (135304, Synaptic Systems) were purchased. The antibody to BRAG2 used for immunoblots was described previously (13.Scholz R. Berberich S. Rathgeber L. Kolleker A. Köhr G. Kornau H.C.

The antibody to BRAG2 used for immunocytochemistry (BRAG2 IC) was generated at BioGenes (Germany) by immunization of a rabbit with a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing a 187-amino acid fragment of murine BRAG2 (aa GPEK–RPEP). The resulting antiserum was first cleaned by incubation with a matrix containing GST fused to a 189-amino acid fragment of murine BRAG1 (aa EYEK–CRDF) and then affinity-purified on a matrix containing the protein used for immunization. Media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies unless otherwise stated. Primary cortical neurons were prepared from rat embryos at embryonic day 18 (E18). Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from E18 rat and E16.5 mouse embryos. Cortices and hippocampi were isolated in Hanks' balanced salt solution, dissociated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington), and triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. The cell suspension was washed twice in growth medium (Neurobasal® medium, B-27® serum-free supplement, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 2 mm GlutaMAX) and plated on poly-dl-ornithine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated plates or coverslips. Cortical neurons were plated at a density of 700,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and 350,000/per well in 12-well plates, whereas hippocampal neurons were plated on 12-mm coverslips placed in 24-well plates at 75,000 cells/well. Half of the medium was exchanged on day in vitro 2 (DIV2), DIV4, DIV9, and then once a week. HEK293, HEK-BRAG1, and HEK-BRAG2 cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM (4.5 mg/ml glucose, GlutaMAXTM, pyruvate) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biochrom), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Medium for HEK-BRAG1 and -BRAG2 cells was complemented with 150 μg/ml hygromycin. HEK-BRAG2 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes for transfections. HEK293FT cells used for lentivirus production were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM (4.5 mg/ml glucose, l-glutamine), 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 500 μg/ml geneticin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. All cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation and harvested 48–72 h after transfection. Cells transfected for NMDAR expression were kept in medium containing 50 μm MgCl2 to prevent Ca2+-mediated toxicity. An HEK293 cell line expressing a 1154-amino acid isoform of BRAG1 (HEK-BRAG1) was generated following the same protocol as for HEK-BRAG2 (13.Scholz R. Berberich S. Rathgeber L. Kolleker A. Köhr G.

GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). For in vitro interaction studies, membrane-free extracts of transfected HEK293 cells (PBS, 1% TritonTM X-100, 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4) were precleared by incubation with a mixture of unloaded and GST-coupled glutathione beads and then incubated with beads coupled to the recombinant proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. To determine cellular Arf6 activities, an Arf6GTP-specific pulldown assay (28.Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. Activation of ARF6 by ARNO stimulates epithelial cell migration through downstream activation of both Rac1 and phospholipase D.J.

AMPA receptor signaling through BRAG2 and Arf6 critical for long-term synaptic depression.Neuron. 2010; 66: 768-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were starved for 1 h in ECS (140 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 33 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and then stimulated with 1 mm l-glutamate (Applichem) for 5 min in ECS. To test the importance of calcium influx, HEK293 cells were starved in ECS containing 1.3 mm CaCl2 for 1 h, washed with ECS without CaCl2, and then stimulated with 1 mm l-glutamate in ECS with or without 1.3 mm CaCl2. Primary cortical cultures were infected at DIV2 or DIV15. They were treated at DIV6–8 or DIV20–22 (referred to as DIV7 and DIV21 in the figures) with 100 μm d-AP5 (Tocris), 100 μm (+)-MK-801 maleate (Tocris), 3 μm ifenprodil (+)-tartrate salt (Sigma-Aldrich), 300 nm ZnCl2 (Applichem), and/or 100 μm NMDA (Biotrend) in conditioned medium as indicated. Arf6 activity was quantified by comparing background-corrected signal intensity densities of Arf6 pulldown (pd) and Arf6 total (t) bands on immunoblots. Band intensities were measured on the blot imager Fusion FX7 (Vilber Lourmat). Intensity values were obtained by Bio1D (Vilber Lourmat) and calculated with Microsoft Excel as pd/t ratios or effect percentages. GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows was used for graphs and statistical analysis. Results were expressed as means of active Arf6 ratios (pd/t) ±S.E. from at least three independent experiments and six independent values. In the case that test groups were compared in pairs of treated and untreated samples, activity ratios are shown as effect percentages compared with the untreated control. Statistical significance was evaluated by two-tailed unpaired or paired t tests as indicated. Differences were considered significant (*) at p values of less than 0.05. HEK-BRAG1 and -BRAG2 cells were plated on poly-dl-ornithine hydrobromide-coated coverslips and transfected either for expression of Arf6-HA, GluN1, GluN2A, or GluN2B or for expression of Arf6, GluN1, and HA-GluN2A or HA-GluN2B. 24 h later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, blocked in 1% BSA, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in 1% BSA. HEK-BRAG1 cells were stained with antibodies to BRAG1 (HPA003973; 1:100) and HA (1:1,000); HEK-BRAG2 cells were stained with antibodies to BRAG2 (IC; 1:500) and HA (1:1,000). Secondary Alexa Fluor fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were applied 1:1,000 for 1 h at room temperature, and the cells were mounted with Mowiol 4-88 (Sigma-Aldrich).

This is especially unfortunate as these environments hold great potential for this population for purposes such as safe orientation, education, and entertainment. Previous tools have increased accessibility but there is still a long way to go. Visual-to-audio Sensory-Substitution-Devices (SSDs) can increase accessibility generically by sonifying on-screen content regardless of the specific environment and offer increased accessibility without the use of expensive dedicated peripherals like electrode/vibrator arrays. Using SSDs virtually utilizes similar skills as when using them in the real world, enabling both training on the device and training on environments virtually before real-world visits. This could enable more complex, standardized and autonomous SSD training and new insights into multisensory interaction and the visually-deprived brain. However, whether congenitally blind users, who have never experienced virtual environments, will be able to use this information for successful perception and interaction within them is currently unclear.We tested this using the EyeMusic SSD, which conveys whole-scene visual information, to perform virtual tasks otherwise impossible without vision. Congenitally blind users had to navigate virtual environments and find doors, differentiate between them based on their features (Experiment1:task1) and surroundings (Experiment1:task2) and walk through them; these tasks were accomplished with a 95% and 97% success rate, respectively. We further explored the reactions of congenitally blind users during their first interaction with a more complex virtual environment than in the previous tasks-walking down a virtual street, recognizing different features of houses and trees, navigating to cross-walks, etc. Users reacted enthusiastically and reported feeling immersed within the environment. They highlighted the potential usefulness of such environments for understanding what visual scenes are supposed to look like and their potential for complex training and suggested many future environments they wished to experience."

Methods In a six-year period, 49 patients with primary retroperitoneal paragangliomas (PG) underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery in a single center. Medical records were reviewed, and collected the following data, which were clinical characteristics, perioperative data (operative time, estimated blood loss, intraoperative hemodynamic changes, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and open conversions), and follow-up data (recurrence or distant metastases). Results All PGs were removed with negative tumor margin confirmed by postoperative histopathology. The operative time of RLPG was 101.59±31.12 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 169.78±176.70ml. Intraoperative hypertensive and hypotensive episodes occurred in 25 cases and 27 cases, respectively. Two open conversions occurred. Two intraoperative complications occurred but were successfully managed endoscopically. Postoperative complications were minor and unremarkable. No local recurrence or distant metastasis were observed during the follow-up period. Conclusions Our experience indicates the feasibility and safety of resection of PGs in a relatively large study population."
https://openalex.org/W2275175777,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were recently identified as liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells. HSCs are activated after liver injury and involved in pivotal processes, such as liver development, immunoregulation, regeneration, and also fibrogenesis. To date, several studies have reported candidate pathways that regulate the plasticity of HSCs during physiological and pathophysiological processes. Here we analyzed the expression changes and activity of the RAS family GTPases and thereby investigated the signaling networks of quiescent HSCs versus activated HSCs. For the first time, we report that embryonic stem cell-expressed RAS (ERAS) is specifically expressed in quiescent HSCs and down-regulated during HSC activation via promoter DNA methylation. Notably, in quiescent HSCs, the high level of ERAS protein correlates with the activation of AKT, STAT3, mTORC2, and HIPPO signaling pathways and inactivation of FOXO1 and YAP. Our data strongly indicate that in quiescent HSCs, ERAS targets AKT via two distinct pathways driven by PI3Kα/δ and mTORC2, whereas in activated HSCs, RAS signaling shifts to RAF-MEK-ERK. Thus, in contrast to the reported role of ERAS in tumor cells associated with cell proliferation, our findings indicate that ERAS is important to maintain quiescence in HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2286105838,"Organophosphates (OP) are one of the major treatments used against the salmon louse (Lepeophtherius salmonis) in Norwegian salmonid aquaculture. The use of OP since the late 1970s has resulted in widespread resistant parasites. Recently, we reported a single mutation (Phe362Tyr) in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as the major mechanism behind resistance in salmon louse towards OP. The present study was carried out to validate this mechanism at the field level. A total of 6658 salmon louse samples were enrolled from 56 different fish farms across the Norwegian coast, from Vest Agder in the south to Finnmark in the north. All the samples were genotyped using a TaqMan probe assay for the Phe362Tyr mutation. A strong association was observed between areas with frequent use of the OP (azamethiphos) and the Phe362Tyr mutation. This was confirmed at 15 sites where results from independently conducted bioassays and genotyping of parasites correlated well. Furthermore, genotyping of surviving and moribund parasites from six bioassay experiments demonstrated a highly significant negative correlation between the frequency of resistance alleles and the probability of dying when exposed to azamethiphos in a bioassay. Based on these observations, we could strongly conclude that the Phe362Tyr mutation is a major factor responsible for OP resistance in salmon louse on Norwegian fish farms."

Insights into the chemical signaling underlying this process can be achieved with a multiplex and untargeted chemical imaging method such as mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), which can enable de novo studies of nervous system regeneration. A combination of MSI and multivariate statistics was used to differentiate peptide dynamics in the freshwater planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea at different time points during cephalic ganglia regeneration. A protocol was developed to make S. mediterranea tissues amenable for MSI. MS ion images of planarian tissue sections allow changes in peptides and unknown compounds to be followed as a function of cephalic ganglia regeneration. In conjunction with fluorescence imaging, our results suggest that even though the cephalic ganglia structure is visible after 6 days of regeneration, the original chemical composition of these regenerated structures is regained only after 12 days. Differences were observed in many peptides, such as those derived from secreted peptide 4 and EYE53-1. Peptidomic analysis further identified multiple peptides from various known prohormones, histone proteins, and DNA- and RNA-binding proteins as being associated with the regeneration process. Mass spectrometry data also facilitated the identification of a new prohormone, which we have named secreted peptide prohormone 20 (SPP-20), and is up-regulated during regeneration in planarians.

Understanding mechanisms of tissue regeneration is significant for biomedical research because many diseases, in particular neurodegenerative diseases that affect the CNS, do not have a cure. A simple organism like the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is an ideal model for studying the molecular mechanisms that guide the regenerative process because these freshwater flatworms can regenerate missing tissue (1Newmark P.A.

The CNS of S. mediterranea is characterized by bi-lobed anterior cephalic ganglia with two nerve cords that run along the ventral surface of the animal. When the head is amputated, a planarian will regenerate the ganglia and reconnect them to the remaining ventral nerve cords (3Fraguas S. Barberán S. Ibarra B. Stöger L. Cebrià F.

MALDI is well suited for analyzing biological samples because of its large mass range and general tolerance to salts (38Rubakhin S.S. Sweedler J.V.

MALDI MS, in a non-imaging application, has been used to study protein expression changes during planarian anterior regeneration (39Chen X. Xu C.

MALDI MSI has been applied to studies of peptide and protein changes during nervous system regeneration in the medicinal leech, reporting an interaction between the nerve cord and the surrounding blood sinus (40Meriaux C.

Here, building on data from that study, we used MALDI MSI to visualize m/z distribution changes associated with cephalic ganglia regeneration.

To validate the peptide and proteins observed via MS, we conducted in situ hybridization, providing mRNA localization of the regeneration markers. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Mature, asexual strains of S. mediterranea, ∼1 cm in length, were maintained at 20 °C in Instant Ocean salts (Spectrum Brands, Blacksburg, VA) dissolved at 0.5 g/liter in ultrapure water. Animals were starved for at least 1 week prior to analysis to avoid nonspecific background signals from the gut contents (23Collins 3rd, J.J. Hou X. Romanova E.V. Lambrus B.G. Miller C.M. Saberi A.

To initiate cephalic ganglia regeneration, the planarians were amputated midway between the tip of the head and the pharynx (Fig. 1A). The posterior portions of amputated planarians were then returned to the salt solution to regenerate. For the peptidomic analysis of regenerating planarians, 80 planarians were amputated, and the anterior and posterior portions were placed in separate containers of the same salt solution described above. Intact planarians, and planarians at 3, 6, or 12 days after amputation, were placed on a Parafilm M substrate and immobilized on ice. Once immobile, each animal was embedded in 10% gelatin and frozen in dry ice-chilled ethanol. Longitudinal sequential tissue sections (20 μm) were taken at −16 °C using a Leica CM 3050 S cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) and individually thaw-mounted onto separate silicon wafers. For tissue sections taken from intact and 12-day regenerated planarians, the cephalic ganglia could be seen under a dissection microscope (Leica MZ75, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and were visible among at least one of the four most ventral sections; the sections having visible cephalic ganglia were used for the MSI studies. The cephalic ganglia were not clearly visible under a dissection microscope for sections from 3- and 6-day regenerated planarians. For these two time points, the four most ventral sections were used for MSI so as to be consistent with intact and 12-day regenerated planarians. Sections to be imaged were rinsed for 10 s in ice-chilled 150 mm ammonium acetate buffer, followed immediately by 100% isopropyl alcohol for 30 s. The rinsed sections were dried using an Autosamdri-931 supercritical dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD) with 100% isopropyl alcohol as the intermediate fluid and “bone dry” liquid carbon dioxide (SJ Smith, Davenport, IA) as the supercritical fluid. Supercritical drying was begun by submerging tissue sections in 10 ml of 100% isopropyl alcohol in the supercritical drying chamber. The chamber was then slow filled with liquid carbon dioxide for 90 s before being fully filled at the regular flow rate for 30 s. The isopropyl alcohol was purged from the sample chamber with liquid carbon dioxide for 4 min. After purging, the chamber pressure and temperature were raised and held at above 1200 p.s.i. and 31 °C for 4 min. The chamber was returned to ambient conditions by slowly bleeding the pressure to 550 p.s.i. before fully venting. The MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was sublimed onto the sample in a glass sublimation chamber (Ace Glass, Vineland, NJ). The cold finger was chilled using an ice bath, and heating was conducted using a heating mantle powered with a variable autotransformer set to 55% of 120 V (Staco, Dayton, OH). A vacuum was created in the chamber using an Edwards 30 E2M30 rotary pump (Edwards ROC, Sanborn, NY). The setup ran for 18.5 min to create a α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid coating with a density of ∼0.2 mg/cm2. To improve peptide extraction into the matrix, the matrix-coated samples were placed in a humidity chamber with 1 ml of 5% acetic acid for 225 s at 85 °C, following a previously described approach (48Yang J. Caprioli R.M. Matrix sublimation/recrystallization for imaging proteins by mass spectrometry at high spatial resolution.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 5728-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Our protocols for MSI are similar to a prior report (49Masyuko R.N. Lanni E.J. Driscoll C.M. Shrout J.D. Sweedler J.V. Bohn P.W. Spatial organization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms probed by combined matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and confocal Raman microscopy.Analyst. 2014; 139: 5700-5708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, silicon wafers containing prepared samples were taped to a custom MALDI target using double-sided conductive copper tape (electrical tape, 3M, St. Paul, MN). The target contained a shallow cutout that allowed the wafer surface to be positioned at the same level as the target surface. MSI was conducted in positive mode using an ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a Smartbeam II frequency tripled Nd:YAG solid state laser. The laser footprint was set to “small” at ∼30 μm diameter. Mass spectra were acquired at 50-μm intervals, and signals from 250 shots fired at 1000 Hz were summed. Images and mass spectra were processed using flexAnalysis and flexImaging software (Bruker Daltonics). The ion images generated in flexImaging were normalized to the total ion count. Thaw-mountedplanarian sections were submerged in 1 μg/ml of DAPI for several minutes in ambient conditions and fluorescently imaged using a SteREO Lumar.V12 stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), equipped with an X-Cite 120 mercury lamp (Excelitas, Ontario, Canada) and a Neolumar S objective lens (1.5×, FWD, 30 mm). Images were captured using an AxioCam MRM camera (Carl Zeiss) and AxioVision software, version 4.6.3 (Carl Zeiss). The acquired images were not processed using any other software. Given the information-rich nature of MSI data sets, statistical approaches such as PCA can be helpful for reducing the dimensionality of the data set and determining important markers (50Deininger S.-O. Becker M. Suckau D. Tutorial: multivariate statistical treatment of imaging data for clinical biomarker discovery.in: Rubakhin S.S. Sweedler J.V. Mass Spectrometry Imaging. Humana Press, New York2010: 385-403Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To focus the statistical analysis on the cephalic ganglia and the blastema, these areas were selected as the regions of interest. Regions of interest selection was conducted by generating ion images that showed the ganglia or the blastema, and then manually outlining the relevant structure(s). MALDI mass spectra from each region of interest were converted from the Container format to the XMass format and imported into the ClinProTools software, version 2.2 (Bruker Daltonics), as separate groups based on biological replicates (intact, n = 7; 3 days, n = 7; 6 days, n = 5; 12 days, n = 5). Spectra were smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm for 3 cycles with an m/z width of 0.1. Baseline subtraction was performed with the Top Hat algorithm with 10% baseline width. Peak picking was performed on the average spectrum from each spectral group representative of a biological replicate, with a signal-to-noise cutoff of 5. For each group, the similarity selection option was used to choose the spectrum closest to the group average for PCA. To determine the ions that varied significantly between regeneration time points, the Anderson-Darling test (PAD) was conducted on each peak to test for a normal distribution. Signals that followed a normal distribution (PPAD ≥ 0.05) were tested for significance via analysis of variance. Signals that were not normally distributed (PPAD ≤ 0.05) were tested for significance via the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. The Benjamini-Hochberg p value adjustment procedure was automatically applied to correct for the multiple hypothesis testing problem commonly associated with MS data (29Wagner D.E. Ho J.J.

Peptides were extracted from the anterior and posterior pieces of 6-day regenerated planarians (n = 80), including the blastema that developed on both kinds of tissue pieces. Tissues were combined and homogenized in 1 ml of acidified acetone (40:6:1, acetone:water:HCl) with the pH adjusted to 4 using 5 m ammonium hydroxide (23Collins 3rd, J.J. Hou X. Romanova E.V. Lambrus B.G. Miller C.M. Saberi A. Sweedler J.V. Newmark P.A. Genome-wide analyses reveal a role for peptide hormones in planarian germline development.PLos Biol. 2010; 8: e1000509Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) at ∼21,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was separated from the tissue pellet, dried, and reconstituted in 60 μl of 0.1% formic acid (FA). An oily phase and some undissolved residue were observed after reconstituting in the FA, and these two portions were separately isolated from the primary extract. The tissue pellet, peptide extract, oily phase, and undissolved residue were individually frozen at −80 °C until further processing. Peptides were also extracted and reconstituted in 90 μl of 0.1% FA from a separate batch of intact, non-regenerating planarians (n = 58) in a similar manner. Reconstituted peptide extracts were fractionated using either a Breeze 2 HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a reversed-phase column (Atlantis T3, C18, 2.1-mm inner diameter × 150 mm length, 5-μm particle size, 100 Å pore size; Waters), or a Magic 2002 analytical LC system (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Auburn, CA), also using a reversed-phase column (Vydac, C18, 2.1-mm inner diameter × 150 mm length, 5-μm particle size, 300 Å pore size; W. R. Grace & Co., Columbia, MD). Solvent gradients were established by mixing solvents A and B. Fractions were collected with an analytical gradient of ∼10–50% solvent B ramped over a period of 35–45 min. For the Breeze 2 HPLC system, solvent A was water + 1% acetonitrile (ACN) + 0.1% FA, and solvent B was ACN + 0.1% FA. For the Magic 2002 analytical LC system, solvent A was 5% ACN + 0.1% FA + 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and solvent B was 95% ACN + 0.1% FA + 0.01% TFA. For the extract from regenerating planarians, the oily phase and undissolved residue were each dissolved in 600 μl of 5% meth"
https://openalex.org/W2280494835,"Background While most HIV care is provided on an outpatient basis, hospitals continue to treat serious HIV-related admissions, which is relatively resource-intensive and expensive. This study reports the primary reasons for HIV-related admission at a regional, urban hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa and estimates the associated lengths of stay and costs. Methods and Findings A retrospective cohort study of adult, medical admissions was conducted. Each admission was assigned a reason for admission and an outcome. The length of stay was calculated for all patients (N = 1,041) and for HIV-positive patients (n = 469), actual utilization and associated costs were also estimated. Just under half were known to be HIV-positive admissions. Deaths and transfers were proportionately higher amongst HIV-positive admissions compared to HIV-negative and unknown. The three most common reasons for admission were tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections (18%, n = 187), cardiovascular disorders (12%, n = 127) and bacterial infections (12%, n = 121). The study sample utilized a total of 7,733 bed days of those, 55% (4,259/7,733) were for HIV-positive patients. The average cost per admission amongst confirmed HIV-positive patients, which was an average of 9.3 days in length, was $1,783 (United States Dollars). Conclusions Even in the era of large-scale antiretroviral treatment, inpatient facilities in South Africa shoulder a significant HIV burden. The majority of this burden is related to patients not on ART (298/469, 64%), and accounts for more than half of all inpatient resources. Reducing the costs of inpatient care is thus another important benefit of expanding access to ART, promoting earlier ART initiation, and achieving rates of ART retention and adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2275856377,"Polysialic acid is an oncofetal glycopolymer, added to the glycans of a small group of substrates, that controls cell adhesion and signaling. One of these substrates, neuropilin-2, is a VEGF and semaphorin co-receptor that is polysialylated on its O-glycans in mature dendritic cells and macrophages by the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV. To understand the biochemical basis of neuropilin-2 polysialylation, we created a series of domain swap chimeras with sequences from neuropilin-1, a protein for which polysialylation had not been previously reported. To our surprise, we found that membrane-associated neuropilin-1 is polysialylated at ∼50% of the level of neuropilin-2 but not polysialylated when it lacks its cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region and is secreted from the cell. This was not the case for neuropilin-2, which is polysialylated when either membrane-associated or soluble. Evaluation of the soluble chimeric proteins demonstrated that the meprin A5 antigen-μ tyrosine phosphatase (MAM) domain and the O-glycan-containing linker region of neuropilin-2 are necessary and sufficient for its polysialylation and serve as better recognition and acceptor sites in the polysialylation process than those regions of neuropilin-1. In addition, specific acidic residues on the surface of the MAM domain are critical for neuropilin-2 polysialylation. Based on these data and pull-down experiments, we propose a model where ST8SiaIV recognizes and docks on an acidic surface of the neuropilin-2 MAM domain to polysialylate O-glycans on the adjacent linker region. These results together with those related to neural cell adhesion molecule polysialylation establish a paradigm for the process of protein-specific polysialylation.

PolySia has been shown to be crucially important for the development of the nervous system, synaptic plasticity and cell migration in the adult nervous system, and the regeneration of damaged nerves and tissues, and it is also up-regulated in many types of late stage cancers, where it is suggested to promote cancer metastasis (reviewed in Refs. 2Colley K.J.

Nakagawa T. Kawano Y. Miyahara R. Li M. Yanagihara K. Nakayama J. Fujimoto I. Ikenaka K. Wada H. Expression of polysialic acid and STX, a human polysialyltransferase, is correlated with tumor progression in non-small cell lung cancer.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3072-3080PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates that a substantial proportion of late stage non-small cell lung cancers express polySia, but not NCAM, suggesting that other substrates are polysialylated in these cancers. These functions of polySia are due to its abilities to serve as an anti-adhesive, a reservoir for biologically significant ligands, and a signaling modulator (reviewed in Ref. 2Colley K.J. Kitajima K. Sato C. Polysialic acid: biosynthesis, novel functions and applications.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 49: 498-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Due to its large size and negative charge, polySia binds water and increases the hydrodynamic radius of the proteins it modifies (12Rutishauser U. Polysialic acid in the plasticity of the developing and adult vertebrate nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). As a result, the presence of polySia abrogates adhesion mediated by it carriers as well as by other nearby adhesion molecules (13Johnson C.P. Fujimoto I. Rutishauser U. Leckband D.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PolySia has also been shown to bind to neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and growth factors, serving as a reservoir for these molecules and altering their availability for receptor binding and downstream signaling (reviewed in Ref. 2Colley K.J. Kitajima K. Sato C. Polysialic acid: biosynthesis, novel functions and applications.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 49: 498-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NRPs are well established co-receptors for VEGF and class 3 semaphorins and also bind other growth factors (14Prud'homme G.J. Glinka Y. Neuropilins are multifunctional coreceptors involved in tumor initiation, growth, metastasis and immunity.Oncotarget. 2012; 3: 921-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These interactions serve to modulate the signaling mediated by these ligands' primary receptors (15Neufeld G. The neuropilins multifunctional semaphorin and VEGF receptors that modulate axon guidance and angiogenesis.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). There are two neuropilins, NRP-1 and NRP-2, that share 44% homology at the amino acid level. Mice lacking NRP-1 die between embryonic days 10 and 13.5 due to defects in vascular development and angiogenesis that cause severe hemorrhage. In contrast, NRP-2 knock-out mice are viable and have a milder phenotype characterized by defects in lymphatic system development and axon guidance (reviewed in Ref. 16Pellet-Many C. Frankel P.

The expression of both NRP-1 and NRP-2 is observed in a variety of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancers, neuroblastoma, gliomas, astrocytomas, and colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancers, where they are important for the proliferation, survival, and migration of cancer cells (reviewed in Refs. 14Prud'homme G.J.

Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells that migrate to the lymph node to activate T-lymphocytes (18Friedl P. den Boer A.T. Gunzer M.

This group presented evidence suggesting that the presence of polySia on dendritic cell NRP-2 prevents T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation. However, later work by Bax et al.

In this work, we investigate the sequence requirements for NRP-2 polysialylation using NRP-2 chimeric and mutant proteins. We find that the NRP-2 meprin A5 protein-μ tyrosine phosphatase (MAM) domain is required for the ST8SiaIV recognition and the polysialylation of O-glycans in the adjacent linker region. Additionally, we unexpectedly find that, unlike other generic glycoproteins, membrane-associated NRP-1 can also be polysialylated when ectopically expressed with ST8SiaIV in COS cells, but less robustly than NRP-2.

In the pcDNA3.1/V5-His B vector, the NRP-2 cDNA sequence is flanked by HindIII and XbaI restriction sites. For the construction of the NRP-2ΔCF construct, a unique KpnI restriction site was introduced after Cys592 at the beginning of the NRP-2 linker region using primer set 1 (Table 1). The NRP-2ΔCF portion was excised using restriction enzymes KpnI and XbaI and ligated into pcDNA3.1/V5-His B vector at these sites. To insert the signal sequence, the first 22 amino acids of NRP-2 were amplified to include a HindIII site at the N terminus and a KpnI site at the C terminus using primer set 2 (Table 1), and the amplified fragment was ligated into the pcDNA3.1 NRP-2ΔCF vector between the HindIII and KpnI sites.

The individual domains were extracted by restriction enzyme digestion. The NRP-1 MAM domain was inserted between newly engineered EcoRV and NheI sites in the NRP-2 cDNA to obtain the NRP-2Δ1 construct, whereas the NRP-2 MAM domain was inserted between engineered EcoRV and NheI sites in the NRP-1 cDNA to obtain the NRP-1Δ2 construct. The EcoRV and NheI restriction sites flanking the MAM domains were removed from both the chimeric mutants using primer sets 8–11 (Table 1) by site-directed mutagenesis. During the removal of the restriction sites from NRP-2Δ1, a single nucleotide change at amino acid Glu622 introduced a stop codon, which was removed by site-directed mutagenesis using primer set 12. The pcDNA4-NRP2-hFc vector was a kind gift from Dr. Ken Kitajima (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan), and we constructed NRP-1-Fc, NRP-1Δ2-Fc, and NRP-2Δ1-Fc in this vector. Extracellular portions of NRP-1 and the NRP-2Δ1 and NRP-1Δ2 chimeras were amplified from the full-length constructs to include a 15-bp overhang complementary to both the pcDNA4 vector on the N terminus and the human antibody Fc sequence on the C terminus using primer set 13 for NRP-1 and NRP-1Δ2 and primer set 14 for NRP-2Δ1 (Table 1). The In-Fusion homology-directed cloning kit was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol to construct the Fc-tagged proteins. Briefly, the pcDNA4-hFc vector was amplified using primer set 15 (Table 1). The amplified vector and insert fragments were mixed. A splice consensus sequence was inserted between the NRP sequences and Fc sequence, which contains introns, to ensure splicing within the Fc portion. This sequence, ACAGGTAAGT, was inserted by site-directed mutagenesis using primer set 16 for NRP-2-Fc and NRP-2Δ1-Fc constructs and primer set 17 for the NRP-1 and NRP-1Δ2-Fc constructs (Table 1). NRP-2ΔLM1 and NRP-1ΔLM2 constructs were initially made as full-length, V5-tagged constructs in pcDNA3.1/V5-His B vector. For the NRP-2ΔLM1 construct, NRP1 sequences from the linker through the cytoplasmic tail were amplified with primer set 18 (Table 1), which includes 15-bp overhangs complementary to the NRP2 coagulation factor 5/8 homology (F5/8)-2 region on the N terminus and to the pcDNA3.1/V5-His B, including the V5 tag, on the C terminus. For the NRP-1ΔLM2 construct, NRP2 sequences from the linker through the cytoplasmic tail were amplified with primer set 19 (Table 1), which includes 15-bp overhangs complementary to the NRP1 F5/8-2 region on the N terminus and to the pcDNA3.1/V5-His B, including the V5 tag, on the C terminus.

In order to make bioinformatics software easily accessible to researchers, we here present a web-based platform. The Center for Bioinformatics Tuebingen (ZBIT) Bioinformatics Toolbox provides web-based access to a collection of bioinformatics tools developed for systems biology, protein sequence annotation, and expression data analysis. Currently, the collection encompasses software for conversion and processing of community standards SBML and BioPAX, transcription factor analysis, and analysis of microarray data from transcriptomics and proteomics studies. All tools are hosted on a customized Galaxy instance and run on a dedicated computation cluster. Users only need a web browser and an active internet connection in order to benefit from this service. The web platform is designed to facilitate the usage of the bioinformatics tools for researchers without advanced technical background. Users can combine tools for complex analyses or use predefined, customizable workflows. All results are stored persistently and reproducible. For each tool, we provide documentation, tutorials, and example data to maximize usability. The ZBIT Bioinformatics Toolbox is freely available at https://webservices.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/."

https://openalex.org/W2280398256,"DNA damage and other forms of replication stress can cause replication forks to stall. Replication stress response proteins stabilize and resolve stalled forks by mechanisms that include fork remodeling to facilitate repair or bypass of damaged templates. Several enzymes including SMARCAL1, HLTF, and ZRANB3 catalyze these reactions. SMARCAL1 and HLTF utilize structurally distinct accessory domains attached to an ATPase motor domain to facilitate DNA binding and catalysis of fork remodeling reactions. Here we describe a substrate recognition domain within ZRANB3 that is needed for it to recognize forked DNA structures, hydrolyze ATP, catalyze fork remodeling, and act as a structure-specific endonuclease. Thus, substrate recognition domains are a common feature of fork remodeling, SNF2-family, DNA-dependent ATPases, and our study provides further mechanistic understanding of how these enzymes maintain genome integrity during DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2277194959,"Unique mixtures of pheromone components are commonly identified in insects, and have been shown to increase attractiveness towards conspecifics when reconstructed at the natural ratio released by the signaler. In previous field studies of pheromones that attract female sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus, L.), putative components of the male-released mating pheromone included the newly described bile alcohol 3,12-diketo-4,6-petromyzonene-24-sulfate (DkPES) and the well characterized 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS). Here, we show chemical evidence that unequivocally confirms the elucidated structure of DkPES, electrophysiological evidence that each component is independently detected by the olfactory epithelium, and behavioral evidence that mature female sea lamprey prefer artificial nests activated with a mixture that reconstructs the male-released component ratio of 30:1 (3kPZS:DkPES, molar:molar). In addition, we characterize search behavior (sinuosity of swim paths) of females approaching ratio treatment sources. These results suggest unique pheromone ratios may underlie reproductive isolating mechanisms in vertebrates, as well as provide utility in pheromone-integrated control of invasive sea lamprey in the Great Lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2279901336,"Human flap endonuclease-1 (hFEN1) catalyzes the essential removal of single-stranded flaps arising at DNA junctions during replication and repair processes. hFEN1 biological function must be precisely controlled, and consequently, the protein relies on a combination of protein and substrate conformational changes as a prerequisite for reaction. These include substrate bending at the duplex-duplex junction and transfer of unpaired reacting duplex end into the active site. When present, 5′-flaps are thought to thread under the helical cap, limiting reaction to flaps with free 5′-termini in vivo. Here we monitored DNA bending by FRET and DNA unpairing using 2-aminopurine exciton pair CD to determine the DNA and protein requirements for these substrate conformational changes. Binding of DNA to hFEN1 in a bent conformation occurred independently of 5′-flap accommodation and did not require active site metal ions or the presence of conserved active site residues. More stringent requirements exist for transfer of the substrate to the active site. Placement of the scissile phosphate diester in the active site required the presence of divalent metal ions, a free 5′-flap (if present), a Watson-Crick base pair at the terminus of the reacting duplex, and the intact secondary structure of the enzyme helical cap. Optimal positioning of the scissile phosphate additionally required active site conserved residues Tyr40, Asp181, and Arg100 and a reacting duplex 5′-phosphate. These studies suggest a FEN1 reaction mechanism where junctions are bound and 5′-flaps are threaded (when present), and finally the substrate is transferred onto active site metals initiating cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2286162260,"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) discriminate multiple object features such as colour, pattern and 2D shape, but it remains unknown whether and how bees recover three-dimensional shape. Here we show that bees can recognize objects by their three-dimensional form, whereby they employ an active strategy to uncover the depth profiles. We trained individual, free flying honeybees to collect sugar water from small three-dimensional objects made of styrofoam (sphere, cylinder, cuboids) or folded paper (convex, concave, planar) and found that bees can easily discriminate between these stimuli. We also tested possible strategies employed by the bees to uncover the depth profiles. For the card stimuli, we excluded overall shape and pictorial features (shading, texture gradients) as cues for discrimination. Lacking sufficient stereo vision, bees are known to use speed gradients in optic flow to detect edges; could the bees apply this strategy also to recover the fine details of a surface depth profile? Analysing the bees' flight tracks in front of the stimuli revealed specific combinations of flight maneuvers (lateral translations in combination with yaw rotations), which are particularly suitable to extract depth cues from motion parallax. We modelled the generated optic flow and found characteristic patterns of angular displacement corresponding to the depth profiles of our stimuli: optic flow patterns from pure translations successfully recovered depth relations from the magnitude of angular displacements, additional rotation provided robust depth information based on the direction of the displacements; thus, the bees flight maneuvers may reflect an optimized visuo-motor strategy to extract depth structure from motion signals. The robustness and simplicity of this strategy offers an efficient solution for 3D-object-recognition without stereo vision, and could be employed by other flying insects, or mobile robots."
https://openalex.org/W2278025825,"Two-component systems are the major means by which bacteria couple adaptation to environmental changes. All utilize a phosphorylation cascade from a histidine kinase to a response regulator, and some also employ an accessory protein. The system-wide signaling fidelity of two-component systems is based on preferential binding between the signaling proteins. However, information on the interaction kinetics between membrane embedded histidine kinase and its partner proteins is lacking. Here, we report the first analysis of the interactions between the full-length membrane-bound histidine kinase CpxA, which was reconstituted in nanodiscs, and its cognate response regulator CpxR and accessory protein CpxP. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy in combination with interaction map analysis, the affinity of membrane-embedded CpxA for CpxR was quantified, and found to increase by tenfold in the presence of ATP, suggesting that a considerable portion of phosphorylated CpxR might be stably associated with CpxA in vivo. Using microscale thermophoresis, the affinity between CpxA in nanodiscs and CpxP was determined to be substantially lower than that between CpxA and CpxR. Taken together, the quantitative interaction data extend our understanding of the signal transduction mechanism used by two-component systems."

A homology model of PCFT, based upon theEscherichia coliglycerol 3-phosphate transporter structure, predicted that PCFT transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1, 2, 7, and 11 form an extracellular gate in the inward-open conformation. To assess this model, five residues (Gln(45)-TMD1, Asn(90)-TMD2, Leu(290)-TMD7, Ser(407)-TMD11 and Asn(411)-TMD11) in the predicted gate were substituted with Cys to generate single and nine double mutants. Transport function of the mutants was assayed in transient transfectants by measurement of [(3)H]substrate influx as was accessibility of the Cys residues to biotinylation. Pairs of Cys residues were assessed for spontaneous formation of a disulfide bond, induction of a disulfide bond by oxidization with dichloro(1,10-phenanthroline)copper (II) (CuPh), or the formation of a Cd(2+)complex. The data were consistent with the formation of a spontaneous disulfide bond between the N90C/S407C pair and a CuPh- and Cd(2+)-induced disulfide bond and complex, respectively, for the Q45C/L290C and L290C/N411C pairs. The decrease in activity induced by cross-linkage of the Cys residue pairs was due to a decrease in the influxVmaxconsistent with restriction in the mobility of the transporter. The presence of folate substrate decreased the CuPh-induced inhibition of transport. Hence, the data support the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter-based homology model of PCFT and the presence of an extracellular gate formed by TMDs 1, 2, 7, and 11."
https://openalex.org/W2277320462,"Background In early 2013, a novel avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) virus emerged in China, and has caused sporadic human infections. The incubation period is the delay from infection until onset of symptoms, and varies from person to person. Few previous studies have examined whether the duration of the incubation period correlates with subsequent disease severity. Methods and Findings We analyzed data of period of exposure on 395 human cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in China in a Bayesian framework using a Weibull distribution. We found a longer incubation period for the 173 fatal cases with a mean of 3.7 days (95% credibility interval, CrI: 3.4–4.1), compared to a mean of 3.3 days (95% CrI: 2.9–3.6) for the 222 non-fatal cases, and the difference in means was marginally significant at 0.47 days (95% CrI: -0.04, 0.99). There was a statistically significant correlation between a longer incubation period and an increased risk of death after adjustment for age, sex, geographical location and underlying medical conditions (adjusted odds ratio 1.70 per day increase in incubation period; 95% credibility interval 1.47–1.97). Conclusions We found a significant association between a longer incubation period and a greater risk of death among human H7N9 cases. The underlying biological mechanisms leading to this association deserve further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2283800962,"Background Clinically unrecognized myocardial infarctions (UMI) are not uncommon and may be associated with adverse outcome. The aims of this study were to determine the prognostic implication of UMI in patients with stable suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and to investigate the associations of UMI with the presence of CAD. Methods and Findings In total 235 patients late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) imaging and coronary angiography were performed. For each patient with UMI, the stenosis grade of the coronary branch supplying the infarcted area was determined. UMIs were present in 25% of the patients and 67% of the UMIs were located in an area supplied by a coronary artery with a stenosis grade ≥70%. In an age- and gender-adjusted model, UMI independently predicted the primary endpoint (composite of death, myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris or heart failure within 2 years of follow-up) with an odds ratio of 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.1–7.9. However, this association was abrogated after adjustment for age and presence of significant coronary disease. There was no difference in the primary endpoint rates between UMI patients with or without a significant stenosis in the corresponding coronary artery. Conclusions The presence of UMI was associated with a threefold increased risk of adverse events during follow up. However, the difference was no longer statistically significant after adjustments for age and severity of CAD. Thus, the results do not support that patients with suspicion of CAD should be routinely investigated by LGE-CMR for UMI. However, coronary angiography should be considered in patients with UMI detected by LGE-CMR. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NTC01257282"
https://openalex.org/W2286559796,"Microorganisms have evolved to occupy certain environmental niches, and the metabolic genes essential for growth in these locations are retained in the genomes. Many microorganisms inhabit niches located in the human body, sometimes causing disease, and may retain genes essential for growth in locations such as the bloodstream and urinary tract, or growth during intracellular invasion of the hosts’ macrophage cells. Strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella spp. are thought to have evolved over 100 million years from a common ancestor, and now cause disease in specific niches within humans. Here we have used a genome scale metabolic model representing the pangenome of E. coli which contains all metabolic reactions encoded by genes from 16 E. coli genomes, and have simulated environmental conditions found in the human bloodstream, urinary tract, and macrophage to determine essential metabolic genes needed for growth in each location. We compared the predicted essential genes for three E. coli strains and one Salmonella strain that cause disease in each host environment, and determined that essential gene retention could be accurately predicted using this approach. This project demonstrated that simulating human body environments such as the bloodstream can successfully lead to accurate computational predictions of essential/important genes."
https://openalex.org/W2287537660,"The effective and robust separation of biomolecules of interest from patient samples is an essential step in diagnostic applications. We present a platform for the fast extraction of nucleic acids from clinical specimens utilizing paramagnetic PMPs, an oil-water interface, a small permanent magnet and a microfluidic channel to separate and purify captured nucleic acids from lysate in less than one minute, circumventing the need for multiple washing steps and greatly simplifying and expediting the purification procedure. Our device was able to isolate influenza RNA from clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples with high efficiency when compared to the Ambion® MagMAXTM Viral RNA Isolation Kit, sufficiently separating nucleic acid analytes from PCR-inhibiting contaminants within the lysate while also critically maintaining high integrity of the viral genome. We find that this design has great potential for rapid, efficient and sensitive nucleic acid separation from patient sample."
https://openalex.org/W2298653154,"Under environmental stress, microbes are known to alter their translation patterns using sequence-specific endoribonucleases that we call RNA interferases. However, there has been limited insight regarding which RNAs are specifically cleaved by these RNA interferases, hence their physiological functions remain unknown. In the current study, we developed a novel method to effectively identify cleavage specificities with massive parallel sequencing. This approach uses artificially designed RNAs composed of diverse sequences, which do not form extensive secondary structures, and it correctly identified the cleavage sequence of a well-characterized Escherichia coli RNA interferase, MazF, as ACA. In addition, we also determined that an uncharacterized MazF homologue isolated from Pseudomonas putida specifically recognizes the unique triplet, UAC. Using a real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, the UAC triplet was further proved to be essential for cleavage in P. putida MazF. These results highlight an effective method to determine cleavage specificity of RNA interferases."
https://openalex.org/W2286539819,"Aims The 3D geometry of individual vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which are essential for understanding the mechanical function of blood vessels, are currently not available. This paper introduces a new 3D segmentation algorithm to determine VSMC morphology and orientation. Methods and Results A total of 112 VSMCs from six porcine coronary arteries were used in the analysis. A 3D semi-automatic segmentation method was developed to reconstruct individual VSMCs from cell clumps as well as to extract the 3D geometry of VSMCs. A new edge blocking model was introduced to recognize cell boundary while an edge growing was developed for optimal interpolation and edge verification. The proposed methods were designed based on Region of Interest (ROI) selected by user and interactive responses of limited key edges. Enhanced cell boundary features were used to construct the cell’s initial boundary for further edge growing. A unified framework of morphological parameters (dimensions and orientations) was proposed for the 3D volume data. Virtual phantom was designed to validate the tilt angle measurements, while other parameters extracted from 3D segmentations were compared with manual measurements to assess the accuracy of the algorithm. The length, width and thickness of VSMCs were 62.9±14.9μm, 4.6±0.6μm and 6.2±1.8μm (mean±SD). In longitudinal-circumferential plane of blood vessel, VSMCs align off the circumferential direction with two mean angles of -19.4±9.3° and 10.9±4.7°, while an out-of-plane angle (i.e., radial tilt angle) was found to be 8±7.6° with median as 5.7°. Conclusions A 3D segmentation algorithm was developed to reconstruct individual VSMCs of blood vessel walls based on optical image stacks. The results were validated by a virtual phantom and manual measurement. The obtained 3D geometries can be utilized in mathematical models and leads a better understanding of vascular mechanical properties and function."
https://openalex.org/W2282383648,"miRNAs might be potentially useful biomarkers for prediction of response to chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy and survival. The aim of this retrospective study was to validate miRNA response predictors in a cohort of patients with gastrooesophageal cancer in order to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).The study population encompassed 53 patients treated with curative intend for loco-regional gastrooesophageal cancer. miRNA expression was quantified from pre-therapeutic and diagnostic, formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumour specimens using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 1.0 Array. Based on growth inhibition of the NCI60 panel in the presence of cisplatin, epirubicine and capecitabine, a miRNA based response predictor was developed. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to assess the correlations of the response predictor with OS and DSS.A univariate analysis demonstrated a statistical significant improvement of OS for patients who had undergone surgical resection with prediction scores above the median prediction score (HR: 0.41 (95% CI: 0.17-0.96). Adjusting for surgery and stage, this predictor was identified to be independently associated with both OS (HR: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.16-0.87)) and DSS (HR: 0.32 (0.12-0.87)).The miRNA profile predictive for sensitivity to cisplatin, epirubicine and capecitabine was shown to be independently associated with OS and DSS in patients with gastrooesophageal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2284346804,"This study aimed to assess the association of clinical factors with P2Y12-dependent platelet inhibition as monitored by the ratio of ADP- to TRAP-induced platelet aggregation and conventional ADP-induced aggregation, respectively.Controversial findings to identify and overcome high platelet reactivity (HPR) after coronary stent-implantation and to improve clinical outcome by tailored anti-platelet therapy exist. Monitoring anti-platelet therapy ex vivo underlies several confounding parameters causing that ex vivo platelet aggregation might not reflect in vivo platelet inhibition.In a single centre observational study, multiple electrode aggregometry was performed in whole blood of patients after recent coronary stent-implantation. Relative ADP-induced aggregation (r-ADP-agg) was defined as the ratio of ADP- to TRAP- induced aggregation reflecting the individual degree of P2Y12-mediated platelet reactivity.Platelet aggregation was assessed in 359 patients. Means (± SD) of TRAP-, ADP-induced aggregation and r-ADP-agg were 794 ± 239 AU*min, 297 ± 153 AU*min and 37 ± 14%, respectively. While ADP- and TRAP-induced platelet aggregation correlated significantly with platelet count (ADP: r = 0.302; p<0.001; TRAP: r = 0.509 p<0.001), r-ADP-agg values did not (r = -0.003; p = 0.960). These findings were unaltered in multivariate analyses adjusting for a range of factors potentially influencing platelet aggregation. The presence of an acute coronary syndrome and body weight were found to correlate with both ADP-induced platelet aggregation and r-ADP-agg.The ratio of ADP- to TRAP-induced platelet aggregation quantifies P2Y12-dependent platelet inhibition independently of the platelet count in contrast to conventional ADP-induced aggregation. Furthermore, r-ADP-agg was associated with the presence of an acute coronary syndrome and body weight as well as ADP-induced aggregation. Thus, the r-ADP-agg is a more valid reflecting platelet aggregation and potentially prognosis after coronary stent-implantation in P2Y12-mediated HPR than conventional ADP-induced platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2282654150,"Pheromones play an important role in modifying vertebrate behavior, especially during courtship and mating. Courtship behavior in urodele amphibians often includes female exposure to secretions from the cloacal gland, as well as other scent glands. The first vertebrate proteinaceous pheromone discovered, the decapeptide sodefrin, is a female attracting pheromone secreted by the cloacal gland of male Cynops pyrrhogaster. Other proteinaceous pheromones in salamanders have been shown to elicit responses from females towards conspecific males. The presence and levels of expression of proteinaceous pheromones have not been identified in the family Ambystomatidae, which includes several important research models. The objective of this research was therefore to identify putative proteinaceous pheromones from male axolotls, Ambystoma mexicanum, as well as their relative expression levels. The results indicate that axolotls possess two different forms of sodefrin precursor-like factor (alpha and beta), as well as a putative ortholog of plethodontid modulating factor. The beta form of sodefrin precursor-like factor was amongst the most highly expressed transcripts within the cloacal gland. The ortholog of plethodontid modulating factor was expressed at a level equivalent to the beta sodefrin precursor-like factor. The results are from a single male axolotl; therefore, we are unable to assess how representative our results may be. Nevertheless, the presence of these highly expressed proteinaceous pheromones suggests that male axolotls use multiple chemical cues to attract female conspecifics. Behavioral assays would indicate whether the putative protein pheromones elicit courtship activity from female axolotls."
https://openalex.org/W2284550847,"To determine whether the baseline retinal sensitivity can predict the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 1 month after intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in eyes with macular edema (ME) associated with a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).We evaluated 16 eyes of 16 patients who had ME associated with a BRVO. The mean ± standard deviation age was 69.1 ± 8.9 years, and all had a single IVB injection. The BCVA, central macular thickness (CMT), integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) of the photoreceptors, and retinal sensitivity were determined before (baseline) and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month following the IVB. The average threshold retinal sensitivity (AT) within the central 10° was determined by Macular Integrity Assessment. The correlations between the BCVA at 1 month and the CMT, integrity of the EZ, and AT at each visit were determined.One month after IVB, the BCVA improved significantly from 0.56 ± 0.27 logMAR units to 0.32 ± 0.28 logMAR units, and the CMT from 611.4 ± 209.3 μm to 258.7 ± 64.0 μm (P <0.05). The AT improved significantly from 17.9 ± 5.3 dB to 21.2 ± 5.0 dB (P <0.05). At 1 day after the treatment, both the integrity of the EZ (r = 0.59) and the retinal sensitivity (r = 0.76) were moderately correlated with the BCVA at 1 month.These results indicate that both the integrity of the EZ and the AT at 1 day after the IVB can predict the BCVA after treatment for ME associated with BRVO. There is a possibility that these parameters will predict the effectiveness of IVB for each case."
https://openalex.org/W2284978546,"The stabilization of human papillomavirus type 16 virus-like particles has been examined by means of different techniques including dynamic and static light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and electrophoretic mobility. All these techniques provide different and often complementary perspectives about the aggregation process and generation of stabilized virus-like particles after a period of time of 48 hours at a temperature of 298 K. Interestingly, static light scattering results point towards a clear colloidal instability in the initial systems, as suggested by a negative value of the second virial coefficient. This is likely related to small repulsive electrostatic interactions among the particles, and in agreement with relatively small absolute values of the electrophoretic mobility and, hence, of the net surface charges. At this initial stage the small repulsive interactions are not able to compensate binding interactions, which tend to aggregate the particles. As time proceeds, an increase of the size of the particles is accompanied by strong increases, in absolute values, of the electrophoretic mobility and net surface charge, suggesting enhanced repulsive electrostatic interactions and, consequently, a stabilized colloidal system. These results show that electrophoretic mobility is a useful methodology that can be applied to screen the stabilization factors for virus-like particles during vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2280615960,"We examined whether the abilities of observers to perform an analogue of a real-world monitoring task involving detection and identification of changes to items in a visual display could be explained better by models based on signal detection theory (SDT) or high threshold theory (HTT). Our study differed from most previous studies in that observers were allowed to inspect the initial display for 3s, simulating the long inspection times typical of natural viewing, and their eye movements were not constrained. For the majority of observers, combined change detection and identification performance was best modelled by a SDT-based process that assumed that memory resources were distributed across all eight items in our displays. Some observers required a parameter to allow for sometimes making random guesses at the identities of changes they had missed. However, the performance of a small proportion of observers was best explained by a HTT-based model that allowed for lapses of attention."
