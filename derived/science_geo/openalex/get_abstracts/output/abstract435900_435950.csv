Approximately 2% of colorectal cancer is linked to pre-existing inflammation known as colitis-associated cancer, but most develops in patients without underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Colorectal cancer often follows a genetic pathway whereby loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor and activation of β-catenin are followed by mutations in K-Ras, PIK3CA and TP53, as the tumour emerges and progresses1,2. Curiously, however, ‘inflammatory signature’ genes characteristic of colitis-associated cancer are also upregulated in colorectal cancer3,4. Further, like most solid tumours, colorectal cancer exhibits immune/inflammatory infiltrates5, referred to as ‘tumour-elicited inflammation’6. Although infiltrating CD4+ TH1 cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells constitute a positive prognostic sign in colorectal cancer7,8, myeloid cells and T-helper interleukin (IL)-17-producing (TH17) cells promote tumorigenesis5,6, and a ‘TH17 expression signature’ in stage I/II colorectal cancer is associated with a drastic decrease in disease-free survival9. Despite its pathogenic importance, the mechanisms responsible for the appearance of tumour-elicited inflammation are poorly understood. Many epithelial cancers develop proximally to microbial communities, which are physically separated from immune cells by an epithelial barrier10. We investigated mechanisms responsible for tumour-elicited inflammation in a mouse model of colorectal tumorigenesis, which, like human colorectal cancer, exhibits upregulation of IL-23 and IL-17. Here we show that IL-23 signalling promotes tumour growth and progression, and development of a tumoural IL-17 response. IL-23 is mainly produced by tumour-associated myeloid cells that are likely to be activated by microbial products, which penetrate the tumours but not adjacent tissue. Both early and late colorectal neoplasms exhibit defective expression of several barrier proteins. We propose that barrier deterioration induced by colorectal-cancer-initiating genetic lesions results in adenoma invasion by microbial products that trigger tumour-elicited inflammation, which in turn drives tumour growth."

Metabolic syndrome represents a collection of abnormalities that includes fatty liver, and it currently affects one-third of the United States population and has become a major health concern worldwide. Fructose intake, primarily from added sugars in soft drinks, can induce fatty liver in animals and is epidemiologically associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in humans. Fructose is considered lipogenic due to its ability to generate triglycerides as a direct consequence of the metabolism of the fructose molecule. Here, we show that fructose also stimulates triglyceride synthesis via a purine-degrading pathway that is triggered from the rapid phosphorylation of fructose by fructokinase. Generated AMP enters into the purine degradation pathway through the activation of AMP deaminase resulting in uric acid production and the generation of mitochondrial oxidants. Mitochondrial oxidative stress results in the inhibition of aconitase in the Krebs cycle, resulting in the accumulation of citrate and the stimulation of ATP citrate lyase and fatty-acid synthase leading to de novo lipogeneis. These studies provide new insights into the pathogenesis of hepatic fat accumulation under normal and diseased states."
https://openalex.org/W2139495058,"The substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area contain the two largest populations of dopamine-releasing neurons in the mammalian brain. These neurons extend elaborate projections in the striatum, a large subcortical structure implicated in motor planning and reward-based learning. Phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in response to salient or reward-predicting stimuli is thought to modulate striatal output through the release of dopamine to promote and reinforce motor action. Here we show that activation of dopamine neurons in striatal slices rapidly inhibits action potential firing in both direct- and indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons through vesicular release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). GABA is released directly from dopaminergic axons but in a manner that is independent of the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT. Instead, GABA release requires activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2, which is the vesicular transporter for dopamine. Furthermore, VMAT2 expression in GABAergic neurons lacking VGAT is sufficient to sustain GABA release. Thus, these findings expand the repertoire of synaptic mechanisms used by dopamine neurons to influence basal ganglia circuits, show a new substrate whose transport is dependent on VMAT2 and demonstrate that GABA can function as a bona fide co-transmitter in monoaminergic neurons."

This paper reports the isolation of a new class of peptides from the African black mamba snake that can abolish pain through the inhibition of particular subtypes of acid-sensing channel (ASIC) expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. These peptides — called mambalgins — are as effective as morphine when it comes to pain relief but are nontoxic in mice and do not induce tolerance or respiratory distress. Their effect differs from the analgesia associated with previously identified animal peptides that can block ASICs, whose action involves activation of the enkephalin system. Polypeptide toxins have played a central part in understanding physiological and physiopathological functions of ion channels1,2. In the field of pain, they led to important advances in basic research3,4,5,6 and even to clinical applications7,8. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are generally considered principal players in the pain pathway9, including in humans10. A snake toxin activating peripheral ASICs in nociceptive neurons has been recently shown to evoke pain11. Here we show that a new class of three-finger peptides from another snake, the black mamba, is able to abolish pain through inhibition of ASICs expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. These peptides, which we call mambalgins, are not toxic in mice but show a potent analgesic effect upon central and peripheral injection that can be as strong as morphine. This effect is, however, resistant to naloxone, and mambalgins cause much less tolerance than morphine and no respiratory distress. Pharmacological inhibition by mambalgins combined with the use of knockdown and knockout animals indicates that blockade of heteromeric channels made of ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits in central neurons and of ASIC1b-containing channels in nociceptors is involved in the analgesic effect of mambalgins. These findings identify new potential therapeutic targets for pain and introduce natural peptides that block them to produce a potent analgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2020044960,"Synthetic genetic programs are built from circuits that integrate sensors and implement temporal control of gene expression. Transcriptional circuits are layered by using promoters to carry the signal between circuits. In other words, the output promoter of one circuit serves as the input promoter to the next. Thus, connecting circuits requires physically connecting a promoter to the next circuit. We show that the sequence at the junction between the input promoter and circuit can affect the input-output response (transfer function) of the circuit. A library of putative sequences that might reduce (or buffer) such context effects, which we refer to as 'insulator parts', is screened in Escherichia coli. We find that ribozymes that cleave the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the mRNA are effective insulators. They generate quantitatively identical transfer functions, irrespective of the identity of the input promoter. When these insulators are used to join synthetic gene circuits, the behavior of layered circuits can be predicted using a mathematical model. The inclusion of insulators will be critical in reliably permuting circuits to build different programs."

https://openalex.org/W2124744205,"A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is a ubiquitous transmembrane metalloprotease that cleaves the extracellular regions from over 40 different transmembrane target proteins, including Notch and amyloid precursor protein. ADAM10 is essential for embryonic development and is also important in inflammation, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. However, ADAM10 regulation remains poorly understood. ADAM10 is compartmentalized into membrane microdomains formed by tetraspanins, which are a superfamily of 33 transmembrane proteins in humans that regulate clustering and trafficking of certain other transmembrane “partner” proteins. This is achieved by specific tetraspanin-partner interactions, but it is not clear which tetraspanins specifically interact with ADAM10. The aims of this study were to identify which tetraspanins interact with ADAM10 and how they regulate this metalloprotease. Co-immunoprecipitation identified specific ADAM10 interactions with Tspan5, Tspan10, Tspan14, Tspan15, Tspan17, and Tspan33/Penumbra. These are members of the largely unstudied TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, all six of which promoted ADAM10 maturation. Different cell types express distinct repertoires of TspanC8 tetraspanins. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells express relatively high levels of Tspan14, the knockdown of which reduced ADAM10 surface expression and activity. Mouse erythrocytes express predominantly Tspan33, and ADAM10 expression was substantially reduced in the absence of this tetraspanin. In contrast, ADAM10 expression was normal on Tspan33-deficient mouse platelets in which Tspan14 is the major TspanC8 tetraspanin. These results define TspanC8 tetraspanins as essential regulators of ADAM10 maturation and trafficking to the cell surface.

ADAM10-deficient mice die at embryonic day 9.5, consistent with the essential role of ADAM10 in the cleavage and activation of Notch, which is central to most cell fate decision-making processes during metazoan development (5Hartmann D. de Strooper B.

Amyloid precursor protein is an ADAM10 target that is central to Alzheimer disease (6Postina R. Schroeder A. Dewachter I. Bohl J. Schmitt U. Kojro E. Prinzen C. Endres K. Hiemke C. Blessing M.

Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretases gives rise to the pathogenic amyloid β-peptide that forms the amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer disease patients. Counteracting this is the α-secretase activity of ADAM10 that cleaves amyloid precursor protein at a third site, thus preventing release of the pathogenic peptide. Indeed, transgenic overexpression of ADAM10 prevents amyloid plaque deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease, suggesting that ADAM10 is a promising target for disease treatment in humans (6Postina R.

The regulation of transmembrane proteins by their compartmentalization into membrane microdomains is a concept that has developed over recent years through the study of neuronal and immunological synapses, lipid rafts, caveolae, and tetraspanins. The latter are a superfamily of four-transmembrane proteins that number 33 in humans (12Charrin S. le Naour F. Silvie O. Milhiet P.E. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E.

Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains: a functional unit in cell plasma membranes.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 434-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Tetraspanins possess two extracellular regions, the larger of which has four to eight conserved cysteine residues that form structurally important disulfide bonds. They appear to fold into compact rod-shaped structures that only project about 5 nm from the plasma membrane and play a fundamental organizing role by self-associating to form microdomains. Specific tetraspanins recruit so-called “partner” proteins into the microdomains. These partners include certain integrins, immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, and proteases, and in some cases, their interaction with tetraspanins is essential for normal biosynthesis and trafficking to the plasma membrane (12Charrin S. le Naour F. Silvie O. Milhiet P.E. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Lateral organization of membrane proteins: tetraspanins spin their web.Biochem.

Tetraspanin microdomains can also facilitate cell adhesion and signaling by providing platforms in which associated proteins can be clustered. For example, the endothelial cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and P-selectin require clustering by tetraspanins CD9, CD151, and CD63, respectively, for efficient capture of leukocytes from the circulation (14Barreiro O.

In contrast, vascular development in mice is normal in the absence of CD151, but pathological angiogenesis is defective, possibly due to the well characterized regulation of laminin-binding integrins α3β1 and α6β1 by this tetraspanin (19Takeda Y.

ADAM10 was recently shown to predominantly localize to tetraspanin microdomains in human leukocyte cell lines (23Arduise C. Abache T. Li L. Billard M. Chabanon A. Ludwig A. Mauduit P. Boucheix C.

In addition, tetraspanin antibodies could promote ADAM10 activity as measured by shedding of two ADAM10 targets, TNF-α and EGF (23Arduise C. Abache T. Li L. Billard M. Chabanon A. Ludwig A.

A second study showed that ADAM10 co-immunoprecipitated with Tspan12 in human breast cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines (24Xu D. Sharma C. Hemler M.E. Tetraspanin12 regulates ADAM10-dependent cleavage of amyloid precursor protein.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3674-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Tspan12 also promoted ADAM10 maturation, which involves the cleavage of its prodomain by proprotein convertases during trafficking to the plasma membrane. Moreover, ADAM10 activity was enhanced by Tspan12 as detected by shedding of the ADAM10 target amyloid precursor protein (24Xu D. Sharma C. Hemler M.E. Tetraspanin12 regulates ADAM10-dependent cleavage of amyloid precursor protein.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3674-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, Tspan12 is unlikely to be the only tetraspanin that regulates ADAM10 because it does not share the ubiquitous expression profile of the metalloprotease, instead appearing relatively restricted to endothelial cells of the retina, meninges of the brain, and smooth muscle cells of the colon (16Junge H.J.

Therefore, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that one or more platelet tetraspanins could interact with and regulate ADAM10. This led to the identification of a subgroup of six related, but largely unstudied, tetraspanins that fulfilled these criteria that we termed the TspanC8 tetraspanins due to the eight cysteine residues within their main extracellular region.

Sepp1 is a widely expressed extracellular protein that in humans and mice contains 10 selenocysteine residues in its primary structure. Extra-hepatic tissues take up plasma Sepp1 for its selenium via apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2)-mediated endocytosis. The role of Sepp1 in the transport of selenium from liver, a rich source of the element, to peripheral tissues was studied using mice with selective deletion of Sepp1 in hepatocytes (Sepp1(c/c)/alb-cre(+/-) mice). Deletion of Sepp1 in hepatocytes lowered plasma Sepp1 concentration to 10% of that in Sepp1(c/c) mice (controls) and increased urinary selenium excretion, decreasing whole-body and tissue selenium concentrations. Under selenium-deficient conditions, Sepp1(c/c)/alb-cre(+/-) mice accumulated selenium in the liver at the expense of extra-hepatic tissues, severely worsening clinical manifestations of dietary selenium deficiency. These findings are consistent with there being competition for metabolically available hepatocyte selenium between the synthesis of selenoproteins and the synthesis of selenium excretory metabolites. In addition, selenium deficiency down-regulated the mRNA of the most abundant hepatic selenoprotein, glutathione peroxidase-1 (Gpx1), to 15% of the selenium-replete value, while reducing Sepp1 mRNA, the most abundant hepatic selenoprotein mRNA, only to 61%. This strongly suggests that Sepp1 synthesis is favored in the liver over Gpx1 synthesis when selenium supply is limited, directing hepatocyte selenium to peripheral tissues in selenium deficiency. We conclude that production of Sepp1 by hepatocytes is central to selenium homeostasis in the organism because it promotes retention of selenium in the body and effects selenium distribution from the liver to extra-hepatic tissues, especially under selenium-deficient conditions."

Cholesterol is an essential component of cellular membranes and is central to maintaining both membrane integrity and fluidity as well as regulating membrane protein function, cell signaling, and ion permeability (5Ikonen E. Cellular cholesterol trafficking and compartmentalization.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). In addition, cholesterol is the precursor molecule for synthesis of cellular components such as bile acids, oxysterols, and steroid hormones. Cholesterol homeostasis is tightly regulated at both the cellular and whole-body levels (6Ory D.S. The Niemann-Pick disease genes. Regulators of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the homeostasis of serum and tissue cholesterol has been well defined, many details of intracellular cholesterol regulation and trafficking are yet to be elucidated. Esterified cholesterol contained in low density lipoprotein (LDL) enters a cell via endocytosis. Upon LDL entry into the late endosome/lysosome, LAL hydrolyzes fatty acyl chains from cholesteryl esters to liberate unesterified cholesterol that is transported out of the late endosome/lysosome involving NPC1 and NPC2 proteins (6Ory D.S.

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for either NPC disease or Wolman disease. However, miglustat, originally approved as a substrate reduction drug for Gaucher disease, has been approved in the European Union for the treatment of NPC1 disease by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. Therapeutic strategies that have been explored include reduction of lysosomal lipid burden, augmentation of mutant protein expression, or replacement of mutant proteins in lysosome (10Pérez-Poyato M.S. Pineda M. New agents and approaches to treatment in Niemann-Pick type C disease.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2011; 12: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Enzyme replacement therapy, which has been successfully used to treat selected lysosomal storage diseases, was studied in the mouse model of Wolman disease but is not clinically approved (11Du H.

A protein replacement therapy, similar to enzyme replacement therapy, would in theory be possible for NPC2 disease, but it is not feasible for NPC1 disease because NPC1 is an integral membrane protein.

A recent report revealed that cyclodextrin's mechanism of action to reduce cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 mutant cells is through induction of exocytosis (16Chen F.W. Li C. Ioannou Y.A. Cyclodextrin induces calcium-dependent lysosomal exocytosis.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15054Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of δ-tocopherol (δ-T) in a phenotypic screen of an approved drug library that significantly reduces lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 fibroblasts. Following δ-T treatment, the enlarged acidic endosomal/lysosome compartment was dramatically reduced, and the pathological phenotype of NPC1 cells, as determined by ultrastructural analysis, was alleviated. Similar effects of δ-T were also observed in Wolman fibroblasts. The mechanism of action for δ-T was linked to increase in cytosolic Ca2+, correction of the lysosomal Ca2+ deficiency, and enhancement of lysosomal exocytosis. The effect of δ-T also extended to patient-derived fibroblasts from other lysosomal storage diseases, including Batten (CLN2), Fabry, Farber, Niemann-Pick disease type A, NPC2, Sanfilippo type B (MPS IIIB), and Tay-Sachs. The results indicate that the enhancement of lysosomal exocytosis may represent a new therapeutic strategy for drug development that may be widely applicable to lysosomal storage diseases. Hoechst and LysoTracker Red dye were purchased from Invitrogen. Filipin dye was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. α-Tocopherol and δ-tocopherol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and purified by HPLC to a purity greater than 99%. β-Tocopherol (racemic), α-tocotrienol, β- tocotrienol, and γ-tocotrienol were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich in analytical standard grade (purity ≥97%). γ-Tocopherol and δ-tocotrienol were purchased from ChromaDex (Irvine, CA) in vitamin reference standard grade (purity >96%). The 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well plates were purchased from Greiner Bio-One (Monroe, NC).

The GM03123 fibroblasts were utilized mainly in the NPC1 experiments unless specifically indicated. The NPC25 (c.2979dupA, p.N701K) skin fibroblast line was derived from an NPC1 patient evaluated under an NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Institutional Review Board-approved clinical protocol and obtained with consent. Both human fibroblasts and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, catalog no. 11995-040) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

The compounds were serially diluted 1:5 in 384-well plates for seven concentrations and formatted into 1536-well plates at 5 μl/well as the compound source plates. In the primary screen, 23 nl of compounds in DMSO solution was transferred using a Pintool station (Klaypsys, San Diego, CA) to 1536-well assay plates containing 5 μl/well cell culture medium. The final concentrations of compounds ranged from 1.32 nm to 46 μm. Total cholesterol in patient cells was measured by the Amplex-Red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen). The unesterified cholesterol was determined using the same kit without the enzyme acid lipase. Esterified cholesterol was determined as the difference between the total and unesterified cholesterol values. The cells were seeded in black, tissue culture-treated 1536-well plates at 800 cells/well in 5 μl of medium by a Multidrop Combi dispenser (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cultured for 24 h. The assay plates were added with 23 nl/well compound DMSO solution using a Pintool station (Klaypsys, San Diego, CA) and cultured for 3 days. The cells were washed twice using a centrifugation method in which the inverted plates were placed on a stack of paper towels and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 1 min followed by the addition of 7 μl/well PBS (added gently with a 45º angled liquid dispenser (Klaypsys)). The cholesterol assay mixture from the kit was added at 2.5 μl/well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The resulting fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation of 560 ± 10 nm and emission of 590 ± 10 nm in a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC). Cell pellets were collected from 100-mm dishes and washed once with 10 ml of PBS. Proteins were assayed using the BCA kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42799) Google Scholar) from the cells. Internal standards were added based on protein concentration that included D7-cholesterol and 17:0 cholesteryl ester (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc). The lipid extract was derivatized to convert cholesterol and its ester into acetate for facilitating ionization using a direct infusion mass spectrometric assay. The derivatization was performed by treating the dried crude lipid extract with solutions of 1 m acetic acid with 1 m DMAP (4-Dimethylaminopyridine) in chloroform and 1 m EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide) in chloroform at 50 °C for 2 h. The derivatized product was extracted with hexane and analyzed by a direct infusion mass spectrometric assay with 5% ammonium hydroxide for facilitating ionization. A triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray was used for analysis of lipids in positive mode. Cholesterol and cholesteryl esters were detected by a neutral loss scan of 213 (collision energy, 50 V), neutral loss scan of 77 (collision energy, 14 V), and precursor ion scan of m/z 369 (collision energy, 14 V), respectively. Data processing of mass spectrometric analyses, including ion peak selection, data transfer, peak intensity comparison, and quantification, was conducted using self-programmed Microsoft Excel macros (19Han X.

Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In an initial experiment, we found that commercially available vitamin E isoforms were cytotoxic at concentrations required for their pharmacological effect. The ATP content assay kit (Promega or PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied to monitor the compound cytotoxicity. Cells were seeded in white solid 96- or 1536-well plates and treated with compounds as described above for the cholesterol assay. On the day of the experiment, 3 μl/well assay mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) was added to the assay plates, followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. The luminescence signal was determined in the luminescence mode of a Tecan multifunction plate reader. Cells were seeded at 1500 cells/well in 100 μl of medium in black/clear bottom tissue culture-treated 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h. After the addition of compound solution, the plates were cultured for 3 days. The cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed by 100 μl/well 3.2% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. After washing with PBS two times, the cells were stained with 100 μl/well 50 ng/ml filipin (freshly dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/ml and then diluted in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were stored at 4 °C after washing two times with PBS before the imaging analysis. On the day of the imaging experiment, cells were stained with 100 μl/well 2 μm CellMask-Red dye (Invitrogen, catalog no. H32711) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were imaged using an Incell2000 automated fluorescence plate imaging reader (GE Healthcare) with a ×20 or ×40 objective. A DAPI filter set (excitation = 360 ± 20 nm, and emission = 460 ± 20 nm) and TRITC filter set (excitation = 545 ± 20 nm, and emission = 593 ± 20 nm) were used to visualize filipin and CellMask staining, respectively. The cells were cultured and treated as described above. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed two times with PBS and live-stained with 1 μm Nile Red dye solution (prepared in cell culture medium) at 100 μl/well, followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were fixed in 3.2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 100 μl/well for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclear staining was carried out by an addition of 100 μl/well 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) in PBS and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The plate was washed twice with PBS, and the images were measured in an Incell2000 imaging plate reader with an FITC filter set (excitation = 480 ± 20 nm, emission = 535 ± 36 nm) for the neutral lipids (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) and a DAPI filter set for Hoechst nuclear staining. The cells in a 96-well assay plate were prepared as described above, incubated with 100 μl/well BODIPY-LacCer dye (Invitrogen, catalog no. B-34402) in 1% FBS DMEM, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by plate washing with HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium (13.8 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.18 mm Na2HPO4, 1× minimum essential medium vitamins, and 1× minimum essential medium amino acids at pH 7.4). The cells were rinsed with cold HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium containing 5% fatty acid-free BSA and back-exchanged at 11 °C six times over 60 min as described previously (20Lloyd-Evans E. Morgan A.J. He X. Smith D.A. Elliot-Smith E. Sillence D.J. Churchill G.C. Schuchman E.H. Galione A. Platt F.M. Niemann-Pick disease type C1 is a sphingosine storage disease that causes deregulation of lysosomal calcium.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Images were immediately taken in the InCell2000 imaging plate reader with the DAPI filter set. The assay was optimized to visualize the enlarged lysosomes by applying an appropriate concentration of LysoTracker dye in which the control cells exhibited minimal staining while the NPC1 or other disease cells showed significant staining. The cells were cultured and treated as described above. On the day of the experiment, cells were live-stained with 100 μl/well 50 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 dye (Invitrogen, catalog no. L-7528) in medium at 37 °C for 1 h followed by plate washing twice with PBS. The plate was used for image analysis of live cell staining or was fixed in 100 μl/well 3.2% formaldehyde for 1 h and washed two times with PBS. The nuclear staining was performed by an addition of 100 μl/well 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) in PBS and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS, the plates were stored at 4 °C until imaging analysis. A DAPI filter set and TRITC filter set in the Incell2000 imaging plate reader were used to visualize Hoechst nuclear staining and LysoTracker staining, respectively. Fibroblast cells were seeded in 6-well plates in 5 ml of medium at 150,000 cells/well and cultured for 1 day in the presence or absence of compounds. Cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 1 h at room temperature and then stored at 4 °C until transmission electron microscopy analysis was performed. The cells were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 1 h and stained en bloc with 0.5% uranyl acetate in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.2. The cells were then dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions (35, 50, 70, 95, and 100%) and infiltrated overnight in epoxy resin (Poly/Bed 812, Polysciences). After adding fresh pure resin, the cell plates were cured for 72 h in 55 °C. After removing the polystyrene plates, suitable areas for thin sectioning were selected, cut out with a jewelry saw, and glued onto empty resin stubs. About 70-nm thin sections were cut on an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC6) and mounted on naked copper grids. The thin sections were double-stained (uranyl acetate and lead citrate) and examined in a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope, and images were taken using an AMT CCD camera (21Nagashima K. Zheng J. Parmiter D. Patri A.K. Biological tissue and cell culture specimen preparation for TEM nanoparticle characterization.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 697: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared, and protein concentrations were determined as described above. Samples were heated at 65 °C for 10 min before being resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using either Criterion Blotter (Bio-Rad) or iBlot dry blotting devices (Invitrogen). For NPC1 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase detection, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NPC1 (Abcam, catalog no. ab36983; 1:2000) or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (Millipore, catalog no. 07-457; 1:1000) were used, respectively. A peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used as secondary antibody at a 1:500 dilution. Flotillin, an exosome marker, was determined using a method described previously (16Chen F.W. Li C. Ioannou Y.A. Cyclodextrin induces calcium-dependent lysosomal exocytosis.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15054Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the media from cells in 100 × 20-mm dishes treated with 40 μm δ-T or two positive controls (2% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and 1 μm ionomycin) for 1 h at 37 °C were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h for isolation of exosomes. The resulting exosomes were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and sonicated in a bath sonicator to yield the final samples for Western blot analysis as described above. A mouse anti-flotillin 2 antibody (BD Biosciences) was used for the detection of flotillin in the exosomes. Cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were collected for the determination of GAPDH used for normalization of proteins in each sample. Efflux of cholesterol from BHK cells was performed as described previously (22Sethi A.A. Stonik J.A. Thomas F. Demosky S.J. Amar M. Neufeld E. Brewer H.B. Davidson W.S. D'Souza W. Sviridov D. Remaley A.T. Asymmetry in the lipid affinity of bihelical amphipathic peptides. A structural determinant for the specificity of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux by peptides.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32273-32282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells and BHK cells stably transformed with ABCA1, ABCG1, and Scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI) were radiolabeled with [3H]cholesterol (1 μCi/ml) in medium for 24 h. After washing three times with DMEM, DMEM containing 50 μg/ml HDL was added and cultured for 18 h. The radioactivity in the HDL-containing medium and cell lysate were determined. The percentage of total radiolabeled cholesterol effluxed into the medium was calculated by dividing by the sum of the radioactive counts remaining in the cells after the efflux period plus the counts in medium. Intracellular cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was measured fluorescently using a Fluo-8 dye kit (ATT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously. Briefly, fibroblasts were cultured at 2500 cell/well in 20 μl of medium in black/clear bottom 384-well plates for 24 h at 37 °C. The calcium dye mixture was added at 20 μl/well and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by room temperature for 30 min. The plates were then placed into a fluorescence kinetic plate reader (μCell, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan). The basal fluorescence intensity was recorded 10 times at 1 Hz for 10 s, and the compound (δ-T or α-T) was then added at 20 μl/well inside the instrument followed by an additional reading at 1 Hz for 5 min. The results were normalized to the average basal fluorescence intensity in a ratio, and the peak response (maximum) was used for the result calculation. The lysosomal Ca2+ induced by Gly-Phe β-naphthylamide (GPN) was measured similarly as that for cytosolic Ca2+, except 200 nm GPN was added instead of δ-T or α-T after the measurement of basal fluorescence intensity that released lysosomal Ca2+. Endocytosis was measured using a fluorescence-labeled dextran dye (pHrodoTM dextran; catalogue no. P10361, Invitrogen) that enters cells through endocytosis. This dye emits fluorescent signal at the acidic pH while exhibiting a minimal fluorescence signal at neutral pH. The fibroblasts in 96-well plates were treated with 40 μm δ-T or 80 μm α-T for 24 h and incubated with 20 mg/ml pHrodo dye for 16 h. The live cell imaging was carried out after a cell wash with PBS with an excitation of 560 nm and emission of 590 nm. Chlorpromazine, a known inhibitor of endocytosis, was used as a positive control (final concentration of 5 μg/ml). The lysosomal pH was determined using a fluorescent LysoSensor dextran dye (catalogue no. L-22460, Invitrogen) that emits strongly at 530 nm in an acidic pH environment and at 450 nm in neutral pH. The fibroblasts in 96-well plates were treated with 40 μm δ-T for 24 h and incubated with the pH indicator dye for 16 h. The images were taken using Incell2000 (GE Healthcare) with an excitation of 360 nm, emission-1 of 530, and emission-2 of 450 nm. Fibroblasts were cultured in 24-well plates at 30,000 cells/well in 0.4 ml of medium for 1 day at 37 °C. After being washed twice with assay buffer (DMEM with 2 mm d-mannose 6-phosphate sodium salt), the cells with 0.4 ml/well assay buffer were incubated at 37 °C with 0.2 ml/well compound in assay buffer. At the 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min time points, 30 μl of assay buffer from each well in the 24-well plate were aliquoted into a 96-well black plate. The rest of the assay buffer in the 24-well plate was discarded, followed by the addition of 0.6 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in distilled H2O to lyse th"
https://openalex.org/W1979321726,"The role of ""sphingolipid rheostat"" by ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in the regulation of autophagy remains unclear. In human leukemia HL-60 cells, amino acid deprivation (AA(-)) caused autophagy with an increase in acid sphingomyleinase (SMase) activity and ceramide, which serves as an autophagy inducing lipid. Knockdown of acid SMase significantly suppressed the autophagy induction. S1P treatment counteracted autophagy induction by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. AA(-) treatment promoted mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dephosphorylation/inactivation, inducing autophagy. S1P treatment suppressed mTOR inactivation and autophagy induction by AA(-). S1P exerts biological actions via cell surface receptors, and S1P(3) among five S1P receptors was predominantly expressed in HL-60 cells. We evaluated the involvement of S1P(3) in suppressing autophagy induction. S1P treatment of CHO cells had no effects on mTOR inactivation and autophagy induction by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. Whereas S1P treatment of S1P(3) overexpressing CHO cells resulted in activation of the mTOR pathway, preventing cells from undergoing autophagy induced by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. These results indicate that S1P-S1P(3) plays a role in counteracting ceramide signals that mediate mTOR-controlled autophagy. In addition, we evaluated the involvement of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases (CAPPs) in ceramide-dependent inactivation of the mTOR pathway. Inhibition of CAPP by okadaic acid in AA(-)- or C(2)-ceramide-treated cells suppressed dephosphorylation/inactivation of mTOR, autophagy induction, and autophagy-associated cell death, indicating a novel role of ceramide-CAPPs in autophagy induction. Moreover, S1P(3) engagement by S1P counteracted cell death. Taken together, these results indicated that sphingolipid rheostat in ceramide-CAPPs and S1P-S1P(3) signaling modulates autophagy and its associated cell death through regulation of the mTOR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2084215388,"Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a postprandial enterokine induced by the nuclear bile acid receptor, FXR, in ileum. FGF19 inhibits bile acid synthesis in liver through transcriptional repression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) via a mechanism involving the nuclear receptor SHP. Here, in a series of loss-of-function studies, we show that the nuclear receptors HNF4α and LRH-1 have dual roles in regulating Cyp7a1 in vivo. First, they cooperate in maintaining basal Cyp7a1 expression. Second, they enable SHP binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter and facilitate FGF19-mediated repression of bile acid synthesis. HNF4α and LRH-1 promote active transcription histone marks on the Cyp7a1 promoter that are reversed by FGF19 in a SHP-dependent manner.

Bile acids are natural detergents that facilitate the solubilization and absorption of lipophilic nutrients in the intestine. Bile acids are synthesized in liver and stored as bile in the gallbladder. Following a meal, bile acids are released into the small intestine, where they aid digestion. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver via the portal circulation (1.Russell D.W. Fifty years of advances in bile acid synthesis and metabolism.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S120-S125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2.Chiang J.Y. Bile acids: regulation of synthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1955-1966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Because of their detergent properties, bile acid concentrations are tightly regulated.

FXR is highly expressed in the liver and ileum, where it regulates numerous genes involved in maintaining bile acids at appropriate levels (3.Lee F.Y. Lee H. Hubbert M.L. Edwards P.A. Zhang Y. FXR, a multipurpose nuclear receptor.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 572-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Among the genes regulated by FXR is cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which encodes the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the major bile acid synthetic pathway. FXR represses CYP7A1 through an indirect, bipartite mechanism. First, in liver, FXR induces expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), an atypical nuclear receptor lacking a DNA binding domain. SHP binds to the CYP7A1 promoter and represses its transcription through interactions with other transcription factors (4.Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C.

Mice were infected with adenovirus by injection into the jugular vein. Each mouse received 1 × 1010 particles/g body weight FLAG-SHP and/or 3 × 1010 particles/g body weight Cre adenovirus in 0.15 ml of saline. Mice were killed 3–5 days after injection. RNA was extracted from frozen liver samples using RNA-STAT60TM (Isotex Diagnostics), DNase treated, and reverse transcribed using random hexamers. Resulting cDNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Briefly, 25 ng of cDNA and 150 nmol of each primer were mixed with SYBR® GreenERTM PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen). Reactions were performed in triplicate in 384-well format using an ABI PRISM® 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative Ct method normalized to cyclophilin. The primers were designed using Primer Express® Software (Applied Biosystems) and listed in the supplemental data. Frozen and crushed liver samples were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min in PBS at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of glycine. After two washes with PBS, samples were homogenized with glass homogenizers in a hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% sucrose, and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was laid on a cushion buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, and spun down to obtain nuclear pellet. The pellet was washed once with PBS and lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 33 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 84 mm NaCl, and then sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant (chromatin) was aliquoted and used for immunoprecipitation reactions performed with a Millipore ChIP kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies for the following proteins were purchased from indicated suppliers: HNF4α and LRH-1 (Perseus Proteomics), Histone H3K4 trimethyl and RNA Polymerase II-CTD (Abcam) and Acetyl-histone H3 (Millipore). PCR purification kits from Qiagen were used to purify final DNA products. Results were analyzed by q-PCR using primers listed in the supplemental data. For re-ChIP experiments, the above protocol was used. In the first round of ChIP, antibody bound chromatin on protein A beads was eluted with a buffer containing 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 5 mm DTT and diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer and used in the second round of ChIP following the Millipore protocol. For FLAG-SHP ChIP experiments, a dual crosslinking protocol was followed. Liver samples were first crosslinked with 2 mm di(N-succinimidyl) glutarate (Sigma) in PBS at room temperature for 45 min. After two washes with PBS, the samples were cross-linked with formaldehyde and processed as described above. FLAG antibody beads were purchased from Sigma. HNF4α and LRH-1 were in vitro translated with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Double-stranded oligonucleotides with GCTA overhangs were generated and labeled with 32P dCTP by end filling. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 75 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm DTT, 7.5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg of poly[d(I-C)] (Sigma), 40 pmol of a nonspecific single-stranded oligonucleotide (to remove nonspecific binding), and 1 μl of each in vitro translation protein lysate. Later, 40 fmol of 32P-labeled probe was added, and the reactions incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gels run in 0.25 × TBE and visualized by autoradiography. Frozen and crushed liver samples were homogenized using glass homogenizers in a hypotonic buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, precipitated nuclear pellet was washed once with homogenization buffer and incubated with hypertonic Buffer C containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2.5% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors for 45 min at 4 °C with agitation. After centrifugation at 70,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant was used as the nuclear extract. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad Bradford assay and 30 μg of proteins were used in each SDS-PAGE run. Nitrocellulose membrane was used for Western blotting. Antibody incubation was performed in TBS containing 0.05% Tween and 5% milk. For visualization of the results, either SuperSignal West Pico or ECL Western blotting substrates from Pierce were used. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant differences between two groups were evaluated using two-tailed, unpaired t test. It was previously shown that FGF15 overexpression fails to repress Cyp7a1 transcription in Shp−/− mice (8.Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G. Luo G. Jones S.A.

Fibroblast growth factor 15 functions as an enterohepatic signal to regulate bile acid homeostasis.Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Because recombinant FGF15 is relatively unstable but has strongly overlapping effects with FGF19 (20.Potthoff M.J. Boney-Montoya J. Choi M. He T. Sunny N.E. Satapati S. Suino-Powell K. Xu H.E. Gerard R.D. Finck B.N. Burgess S.C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A.

FGF19 treatment also failed to inhibit Cyp7a1 transcription in Shp−/− mice sacrificed at either 8 am or 2 pm (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, SHP is required for FGF19-mediated repression of Cyp7a1. SHP is an unusual nuclear receptor that does not bind directly to DNA but interacts with other nuclear receptors to repress their transcriptional activity (6.Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. An orphan nuclear hormone receptor that lacks a DNA binding domain and heterodimerizes with other receptors.Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The Cyp7a1 promoter contains conserved putative DNA binding sites for two nuclear receptors, HNF4α and LRH-1, which interact with SHP (5.Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A.

HNF4 and COUP-TFII interact to modulate transcription of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1).J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier studies, FLAG-HA-tagged SHP co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged HNF4α and LRH-1 (Fig. 1B), and SHP overexpression repressed HNF4α and LRH-1 transcriptional activity on the SHP and Cyp7a1 promoters in luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 1, C and D). These data support the hypothesis that SHP represses Cyp7a1 through interactions with HNF4α and LRH-1. We next tested whether SHP, HNF4α, and LRH-1 bind to the Cyp7a1 promoter in mouse liver. Putative overlapping HNF4α and LRH-1 binding sites are located ∼150 bp upstream of the Cyp7a1 transcription start region (Fig. 2A). In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments done with liver extracts, both HNF4α and LRH-1 bound to this region (Fig. 2, B and C). Since adequate antibodies against endogenous SHP are not available, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged SHP in liver via adenoviral expression. ChIP experiments were performed with anti-FLAG beads. FLAG-SHP co-localized with HNF4α and LRH-1 on the Cyp7a1 promoter (Fig. 2D), suggesting that SHP interacts with these two factors in vivo. Given the overlap in the HNF4α and LRH-1 binding sites (Fig. 2A), we examined whether both factors bind simultaneously to the Cyp7a1 promoter. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), HNF4α and LRH-1 each resulted in a shifted complex (Fig. 2E) (5.Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J.

HNF4 and COUP-TFII interact to modulate transcription of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1).J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When both proteins were mixed, a third, more slowly migrating complex appeared (Fig. 2E). This third complex disappeared if either the HNF4α or LRH-1 binding sites were mutated (supplemental Fig. S2). Notably, there was no evidence of cooperative binding. In re-ChIP assays in which liver chromatin was first immunoprecipitated with an LRH-1 antibody and then subjected to a second round of ChIP, comparable results were obtained with LRH-1 and HNF4α antibodies (Fig. 2F). Taken together, the EMSA and re-ChIP data demonstrate that HNF4α and LRH-1 can interact with the Cyp7a1 promoter simultaneously but do not do so cooperatively. To determine whether HNF4α and LRH-1 contribute to SHP binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter in vivo, we used conditional knock-out models for Hnf4α and Lrh-1. Cre and/or FLAG-SHP were overexpressed in liver via adenoviral expression and FLAG-SHP binding was tested by ChIP. While knock-out of hepatic Hnf4α in Hnf4αfl/fl mice or knock-out of hepatic Lrh-1 in Lrh-1fl/fl mice did not change FLAG-SHP binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter in liver, knock-out of both genes in Hnf4αfl/fl:Lrh-1fl/fl mice abolished FLAG-SHP binding (Fig. 3). These results show that SHP relies on both HNF4α and LRH-1 for binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter. Although HNF4α and LRH-1 did not bind cooperatively to the Cyp7a1 promoter in EMSA assays (Fig. 2E), we observed reduced HNF4α binding in Lrh-1-deficient mice but no reciprocal change in LRH-1 binding in Hnf4α-deficient mice (supplemental Fig. S3). It is unclear how LRH-1 facilitates HNF4α binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter. We next used the conditional knock-out mice to examine the contribution of HNF4α and LRH-1 to FGF19-mediated repression of Cyp7a1. In albumin-Cre liver-specific Hnf4α-knock-out mice, basal Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were reduced (Fig. 4A). However, FGF19 treatment further reduced Cyp7a1 expression (Fig. 4A). As described (15.Lee Y.K.

Compromised intestinal lipid absorption in mice with a liver-specific deficiency of liver receptor homolog 1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8330-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Lrh-1 deficiency in livers of albumin-Cre mice did not significantly alter Cyp7a1 mRNA levels. FGF19 treatment repressed Cyp7a1 transcription in Lrh-1 liver knock-out mice (Fig. 4B). To avoid compensation that might occur due to disruption of the Hnf4α and Lrh-1 genes during liver development, we acutely disrupted the Hnf4α and/or Lrh-1 genes via adenoviral Cre expression in liver. Acute knock-out of hepatic Hnf4α in Hnf4αfl/fl mice gave results similar to albumin-Cre knock-out: Cyp7a1 basal mRNA levels were reduced and FGF19-mediated Cyp7a1 repression was intact (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, acute knock-out of hepatic Lrh-1 in Lrh-1fl/fl mice differed from the albumin-Cre knock-out. When Lrh-1 was knocked out acutely, basal Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased. However, FGF19 treatment further repressed Cyp7a1 expression (Fig. 4D). In double Hnf4α:Lrh-1 liver knock-out mice, basal Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were severely reduced and not further repressed by FGF19 treatment (Fig. 4E). Taken together, the acute knock-out studies show that HNF4α and LRH-1 cooperate in regulating the Cyp7a1 promoter in vivo. Moreover, they show that the presence of either HNF4α or LRH-1 is sufficient for repression of the Cyp7a1 promoter by the FGF19/SHP pathway. To test whether SHP binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter is regulated by FGF19, FLAG-SHP protein was overexpressed in liver via adenoviral expression (Fig. 5, A and B). FGF19 treatment did not change nuclear FLAG-SHP protein levels (Fig. 5B). SHP overexpression caused only a trend toward decreased Cyp7a1 expression while FGF19 treatment markedly repressed Cyp7a1 levels (Fig. 5C), demonstrating that the FGF19-dependent repression mechanism is functional in this SHP-overexpression system. Surprisingly, FGF19 treatment did not change FLAG-SHP binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter (Fig. 5D). Similarly, FGF19 treatment failed to alter the binding of either HNF4α or LRH-1 to the Cyp7a1 promoter (Fig. 5, E and F) or the nuclear levels of these proteins (Fig. 5, G and H). These results show that FGF19 does not regulate SHP, HNF4α, and LRH-1 binding to the Cyp7a1 promoter. To gain insight into how FGF19 represses the Cyp7a1 promoter, histone modifications on the promoter were examined. Histone H3 acetylation, a mark of active transcription, was repressed by FGF19 in wild-type but not Shp−/− mice (Fig. 6A, top panel). Knock-out of Hnf4α or Lrh-1 led to depletion of histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 6A, middle and lower panels), which agrees with the decreased Cyp7a1 mRNA levels. FGF19 treatment further reduced acetylation in all these knock-out strains (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, FGF19 caused histone H3 deacetylation on either side of the HNF4α/LRH-1 binding site at −150 bp but not at the binding site itself. Additional ChIP assays showed that histone H3 levels are low at the −150 bp position (supplemental Fig. S4). We speculate that the HNF4α/LRH-1/SHP complex recruits deacetylases that then act on both upstream and downstream histones. Similar results were obtained for two other active transcription marks - histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (Fig. 6B) and histone H4 acetylation - as well as for RNA polymerase II recruitment (supplemental Fig. S5). These changes correlate with FGF19-mediated repression of the Cyp7a1 promoter. However, treatment of primary mouse hepatocytes with trichostatin A (histone demethylase inhibitor), nicotinamide (sirtuin inhibitor), 5-azacytidine (5- DNA methylation inhibitor), BIX-01294 (histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a inhibitor), tranylcypromine (histone H3K4 demethylase LSD1 inhibitor) or dimethyl-oxoglutarate (deoxygenase/jumonji demethylase inhibitor) failed to block FGF19-mediated repression of Cyp7a1 (supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting either redundancy or the involvement of other pathways. We conclude that HNF4α and LRH-1 maintain the Cyp7a1 promoter in an active transcriptional state whereas SHP is essential for its repression by FGF19 through pathways that remain to be defined. In this report, we use acute, liver-specific knock-out mice to show that both HNF4α and LRH-1 serve as crucial regulators of Cyp7a1. The effects of HNF4α and LRH-1 on Cyp7a1 are 2-fold. First, they cooperate in inducing basal Cyp7a1 transcription. Second, they both contribute to SHP recruitment and the repression of Cyp7a1 by FGF19. Thus, there is surprising overlap in the actions of these two transcription factors on this promoter. Our finding that HNF4α regulates basal Cyp7a1 expression is consistent with a previous study in which the Hnf4α gene was disrupted in liver using an albumin-Cre driver (17.Inoue Y. Yu A.M. Yim S.H. Ma X. Krausz K.W. Inoue J. Xiang C.C. Brownstein M.J. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Gonzalez F.J. Regulation of bile acid biosynthesis by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α.J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 215-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, our results with acute LRH-1 knock-out differ from those using albumin-Cre, in which Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were either unchanged or increased (15.Lee Y.K. Schmidt D.R. Cummins C.L. Choi M. Peng L. Zhang Y. Goodwin B. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A.

Compromised intestinal lipid absorption in mice with a liver-specific deficiency of liver receptor homolog 1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8330-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It seems likely that albumin-Cre-mediated disruption of Lrh-1 during liver development induces compensatory mechanisms that maintain Cyp7a1 transcription. We previously showed that SHP is required for FGF15-mediated repression of Cyp7a1. Here we show similar results with FGF19. Notably, FGF19 did not alter the binding of HNF4α, LRH-1 or SHP to the Cyp7a1 promoter. In contrast to a previous report showing that FGF19 increases SHP stability by preventing its ubiquitination (25.Miao J. Xiao Z. Kanamaluru D. Min G. Yau P.M. Veenstra T.D. Ellis E. Strom S. Suino-Powell K. Xu H.E. Kemper J.K. Bile acid signaling pathways increase stability of Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) by inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 986-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we did not observe FGF19-mediated changes in SHP concentrations. We conclude that the repression of Cyp7a1 promoter by FGF19 is not mediated by changes in the occupancy of HNF4α, LRH-1, or SHP on the Cyp7a1 promoter. Elimination of HNF4α or LRH-1 markedly reduced active transcription histone marks on the Cyp7a1 promoter. FGF19 also down-regulated these histone modifications in a SHP-dependent manner. The most dramatic changes occurred in histone H3 and H4 acetylation and histone H3K4 trimethylation. Minor effects on repressive histone marks histone H3 K9 and K27 methylation, were also observed (supplemental Fig. S5). Inhibition of histone deacetylases or demethylases failed to block Cyp7a1 repression by FGF19 (supplemental Fig. S5). It seems likely that the FGF19/SHP pathway regulates multiple downstream pathways that impact Cyp7a1 repression. It remains to be determined precisely how FGF19 cooperates with SHP to repress Cyp7a1. As discussed above, our data show that SHP is constitutively present at the Cyp7a1 promoter, so FGF19 does not appear to promote SHP recruitment. A likely possibility is that FGF19 causes recruitment of co-repressor complexes that require the presence of SHP. In this regard, SHP has been shown to interact with factors that can modify chromatin (26.Fang S. Miao J. Xiang L. Ponugoti B. Treuter E. Kemper J.K.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15665-15670Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the two promoters that are repressed by FGF19 (Cyp7a1 and cholesterol 12α-hydroxylase) contain overlapping HNF4α and LRH-1 binding sites (29.del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Suppression of sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase transcription by the short heterodimer partner: insights into the repression mechanism.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggests that these two factors provide the context necessary for SHP-mediated repression. In summary, we show that HNF4α and LRH-1 cooperate in regulating basal expression and FGF19/SHP-mediated repression of Cyp7a1 in liver. Understanding how FGF19 represses Cyp7a1 has important therapeutic implications for the treatment of primary bile acid malabsorption disease characterized by the excess production of bile acids.

How mutant IDH and 2-HG alter signaling pathways to promote cancer, however, remains unclear. Additionally, there exist relatively few cell lines with IDH mutations. To examine the effect of endogenous IDH mutations and 2-HG, we created a panel of isogenic epithelial cell lines with either wild-type IDH1/2 or clinically relevant IDH1/2 mutations. Differences were noted in the ability of IDH mutations to cause robust 2-HG accumulation. IDH1/2 mutants that produce high levels of 2-HG cause an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype, characterized by changes in EMT-related gene expression and cellular morphology. 2-HG is sufficient to recapitulate aspects of this phenotype in the absence of an IDH mutation. In the cells types examined, mutant IDH-induced EMT is dependent on up-regulation of the transcription factor ZEB1 and down-regulation of the miR-200 family of microRNAs. Furthermore, sustained knockdown of IDH1 in IDH1 R132H mutant cells is sufficient to reverse many characteristics of EMT, demonstrating that continued expression of mutant IDH is required to maintain this phenotype. These results suggest mutant IDH proteins can reversibly deregulate discrete signaling pathways that contribute to tumorigenesis.

The IDH1/2 mutations recurrently identified in cancers are almost always heterozygous point mutations that occur in one of only a few residues in the catalytic pocket (IDH1, Arg-132; IDH2, Arg-140 and Arg-172), a genetic “signature” for activating oncogenic mutations (18.Dang L.

Although IDH mutants are no longer capable of efficiently carrying out their normal “forward” reactions (isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (αKG)), IDH mutations confer a novel gain-of-function and can efficiently catalyze a modified “reverse” reaction, converting αKG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (6.Ward P.S.

Interestingly, 2-HG also accumulates in patients with inactivating mutations in the 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase genes (D2HGDH and L2HGDH) and is associated with the development of brain tumors (21.Struys E.A.

Schenkein D.P. Cancer-associated isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations.Oncologist. 2012; 17: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). αKG-dependent enzymes control a wide variety of cellular processes, including deregulation of the hypoxic response, modification of the collagen matrix, and the turnover of DNA and histone methylation, leading to potentially global changes in gene expression and cellular biology (23.Loenarz C.

Because of the general lack of IDH1/2 mutant cell lines (35.Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V. Sonkin D. Reddy A. Liu M.

The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modeling of anticancer drug sensitivity.Nature. 2012; 483: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar), most studies have relied on mutant IDH overexpression; it is unclear, however, if the biology observed in such models accurately recapitulates the role of endogenously expressed mutant IDH in the initiation and progression of clinically observed cancers. To address this question, we generated a panel of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells and MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells with endogenously expressed, heterozygous, and clinically relevant IDH1/2 mutations. Our characterization of these cell lines suggests differences in the ability of these IDH1/2 mutations to produce 2-HG in cells, an observation that allowed for the separation of the effects of 2-HG from the IDH mutation. From this, we observe that 2-HG accumulation, rather than IDH1/2 mutational status alone, has more dramatic effects on altering cellular signaling. Specifically, we observe a direct correlation between intracellular 2-HG levels and an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype, characterized by changes in both morphology and expression of EMT markers. Addition of exogenous 2-HG is sufficient on its own to induce similar EMT-like alterations in IDH1/2 wild-type cells. Mutant IDH1/2 and 2-HG up-regulate ZEB1 and down-regulate miR-200, two key drivers of the EMT process. We demonstrate that this deregulation of ZEB1 and miR-200 is necessary to drive EMT-like phenotypes downstream of mutant IDH1/2. Finally, sustained knockdown of IDH1 in an IDH1 R132H mutant clone is able to reverse many aspects of the EMT-like phenotype, demonstrating that mutant IDH phenotypes are reversible, albeit with surprisingly slow kinetics. Thus, our data demonstrate that mutant IDH1/2 can regulate specific signaling pathways that remain dependent on continued mutant IDH expression and provide insight into core pathways that may be deregulated in epithelial tumors that bear the IDH1/2 mutation. HCT116 or MCF-10A cells with endogenously heterozygous mutations in IDH1/2 were generated via recombinant adeno-associated virus technology, as described previously (36.Kohli M. Rago C. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Facile methods for generating human somatic cell gene knockouts using recombinant adeno-associated viruses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e3Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These cell lines were sequence-verified at both the genomic and RNA levels. Note that one of the clones (HCT116 R132C/+ 16F8) contains the IDH1 R132C mutation at the DNA level but not at the RNA level and thus is utilized as a nonexpressing control. Detailed information regarding the targeting and production of these cells lines is available upon request. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A modified medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. 2-HG treatments were done at 10 mm and replenished every 48 h. MCF-10A cells were cultured as described previously (37.Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Morphogenesis and oncogenesis of MCF-10A mammary epithelial acini grown in three-dimensional basement membrane cultures.Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Exogenous 2-HG treatments were done at 10 mm, and fresh 2-HG was added every 2 days. For all light microscopy images of cells, images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U with phase contrast microscopy using a Nikon Digital Camera DXM 1200. Representative images are shown, and scale bars represent 50 μm. Cells were cultured in 8-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then rinsed in PBS. Primary antibodies (ZO-1 (Invitrogen, 61-7300) and β-catenin (BD Biosciences, 610154)) were incubated in PBS for 1 h, followed by PBS rinsing, and then fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated in PBS. After PBS washing, cells were then mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen). Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M. Representative images are shown, and scale bars represent 50 μm. For step 1, a solution of sodium nitrite (16.56 g, 240 mmol) in water (50 ml) was added dropwise at 0–5 °C to a stirred mixture of d-glutamic acid (29.44 g, 200 mmol), water (80 ml), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (52.6 ml, 520 mmol). After complete addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature overnight. The volatile components were evaporated in vacuo at 50–60 °C. The residue was triturated with hot EtOAc (4× 150 ml). Each time the hot EtOAc was decanted from the undissolved solids. The combined EtOAc solutions were cooled, dried (Na2SO4), concentrated to dryness, and placed under high vacuum for 72h to give (R)-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid (11.77 g, 45%) as a white waxy solid. 1H NMR in CDCl3 suggests ∼15 mol % of the ring open 2-HG (relative integral of peaks at δ 4.43 ppm for 2-HG versus δ 4.95 ppm for lactone). This material was used as-is in the following step: (R)-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 10.88 (H, br s), 4.98–4.93 (H, m), 2.65–2.49 (3H, m), 2.40–2.30 (H, m); diagnostic peak for 2-HG, δ 4.43 (H, dd, J 8,6 Hz). For step 2, (R)-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid (11.77 g, 90 mmol) was dissolved in MeOH (50 ml), treated with NaOH (8 g, 200 mmol) in water (100 ml), and stirred for 2 h at room temperature (initial exotherm and slight yellow coloration observed). The reaction mixture was kept at pH 14. The reaction mixture was sampled and concentrated to dryness, and 1H NMR of sample showed the reaction was complete. The reaction mixture was concentrated to the point where the solid started to precipitate from the solution, and MeCN (30 ml) was then added followed by sufficient methanol to give one phase, followed by additional methanol (50 ml). The white precipitate was filtered off, suspended in 5% water/MeOH (100 ml), filtered, and washed with 50:50 methanol/MeCN followed by neat MeCN. The solid was dried under high vacuum to give sodium (R)-2-hydroxypentanedioate (13.06 g, 75%) (also known as (R)-2-hydroxyglutaric acid disodium salt) as a white crystalline powder. For 1H NMR (D2O), δ 3.93 (H, dd, J 8,6 Hz), 2.25–2.10 (2H, m), 1.96–1.86 (H, m), and 1.80–1.69 (H, m). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bioproducts) containing Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture (Thermo Scientific). Lysates were spun at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and normalized for protein concentration. Lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transfer/blotting was performed as described previously (38.Grassian A.R. Metallo C.M. Coloff J.L. Stephanopoulos G. Brugge J.S.

https://openalex.org/W2064267502,"Bacillus subtilis can perform chemotaxis toward all 20 L-amino acids normally found in proteins. Loss of a single chemoreceptor, McpC, was previously found to reduce chemotaxis to 19 of these amino acids. In this study, we investigated the amino acid-sensing mechanism of McpC. We show that McpC alone can support chemotaxis to 17 of these amino acids to varying degrees. Eleven amino acids were found to directly bind the amino-terminal sensing domain of McpC in vitro. Sequence analysis indicates that the McpC sensing domain exhibits a dual Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain structure. Using this structure as a guide, we were able to isolate mutants that suggest that four amino acids (arginine, glutamine, lysine, and methionine) are sensed by an indirect mechanism. We identified four candidate binding lipoproteins associated with amino acid transporters that may function in indirect sensing: ArtP, GlnH, MetQ, and YckB. ArtP was found to bind arginine and lysine; GlnH, glutamine; MetQ, methionine; and YckB, tryptophan. In addition, we found that ArtP, MetQ, and YckB bind the sensing domain of McpC, suggesting that the three participate in the indirect sensing of arginine, lysine, methionine, and possibly tryptophan as well. Taken together, these results further our understanding of amino acid chemotaxis in B. subtilis and gain insight into how a single chemoreceptor is able to sense many amino acids."

Docking the atomic coordinates of the crystal structures of TrwB and FtsK into the EM map revealed a better fit for FtsK. Interestingly, we have found that like TrwB, TrwK is able to bind DNA with a higher affinity for G4 quadruplex structures than for single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, TrwK exerts a dominant negative effect on the ATPase activity of TrwB, which reflects an interaction between the two proteins.

Clearance of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is traditionally handled by ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a process that requires retro-translocation and ubiquitination mediated by a luminal chaperone network. Here we investigated whether the secreted, glaucoma-associated protein myocilin was processed by this pathway. Myocilin is typically transported through the ER/Golgi network, but inherited mutations in myocilin lead to its misfolding and aggregation within trabecular meshwork cells, and ultimately, ER stress-induced cell death. Using targeted knockdown strategies, we determined that glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94), the ER equivalent of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), specifically recognizes mutant myocilin, triaging it through ERAD. The addition of mutant myocilin to the short list of Grp94 clients strengthens the hypothesis that β-strand secondary structure drives client association with Grp94. Interestingly, the ERAD pathway is incapable of efficiently handling the removal of mutant myocilin, but when Grp94 is depleted, degradation of mutant myocilin is shunted away from ERAD toward a more robust clearance pathway for aggregation-prone proteins, the autophagy system. Thus ERAD inefficiency for distinct aggregation-prone proteins can be subverted by manipulating ER chaperones, leading to more effective clearance by the autophagic/lysosomal pathway. General Hsp90 inhibitors and a selective Grp94 inhibitor also facilitate clearance of mutant myocilin, suggesting that therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting Grp94 could be beneficial for patients suffering from some cases of myocilin glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2095264331,"Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) promotes the formation of UVR-induced, DNA helix distorting photolesions such as (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Effective repair of such lesions by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is required to prevent DNA mutations and chromosome aberrations. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a zinc finger protein with well documented involvement in base excision repair. PARP-1 is activated in response to DNA damage and catalyzes the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) subunits that assist in the assembly of DNA repair proteins at sites of damage. In this study, we present evidence for PARP-1 contributions to NER, extending the knowledge of PARP-1 function in DNA repair beyond the established role in base excision repair. Silencing the PARP-1 protein or inhibiting PARP activity leads to retention of UVR-induced photolesions. PARP activation following UVR exposure promotes association between PARP-1 and XPA, a central protein in NER. Administration of PARP inhibitors confirms that poly(ADP-ribose) facilitates PARP-1 association with XPA in whole cell extracts, in isolated chromatin complexes, and in vitro. Furthermore, inhibition of PARP activity decreases UVR-stimulated XPA chromatin association, illustrating that these relationships occur in a meaningful context for NER. These results provide a mechanistic link for PARP activity in the repair of UVR-induced photoproducts."

Dysfunctional Cosmc results in the formation of inactive T-synthase and consequent expression of the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), which is associated with several human diseases. However, the molecular regulation of expression of Cosmc, which is encoded by a single gene on Xq24, is poorly understood. Here we show that epigenetic silencing of Cosmc through hypermethylation of its promoter leads to loss of Cosmc transcripts in Tn4 cells, an immortalized B cell line from a male patient with a Tn-syndrome-like phenotype. These cells lack T-synthase activity and express the Tn antigen. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine causes restoration of Cosmc transcripts, restores T-synthase activity, and reduces Tn antigen expression. Bisulfite sequencing shows that CG dinucleotides in the Cosmc core promoter are hypermethylated. Interestingly, several other X-linked genes associated with glycosylation are not silenced in Tn4 cells, and we observed no correlation of a particular DNA methyltransferase to aberrant methylation of Cosmc in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2085004099,"The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glucose-stimulated insulin release remains controversial because ROS have been shown to both amplify and impede insulin release. In regard to preventing insulin release, ROS activates uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that negatively regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. With our recent discovery that the UCP2-mediated proton leak is modulated by reversible glutathionylation, a process responsive to small changes in ROS levels, we resolved to determine whether glutathionylation is required for UCP2 regulation of GSIS. Using Min6 cells and pancreatic islets, we demonstrate that induction of glutathionylation not only deactivates UCP2-mediated proton leak but also enhances GSIS. Conversely, an increase in mitochondrial matrix ROS was found to deglutathionylate and activate UCP2 leak and impede GSIS. Glucose metabolism also decreased the total amount of cellular glutathionylated proteins and increased the cellular glutathione redox ratio (GSH/GSSG). Intriguingly, the provision of extracellular ROS (H(2)O(2), 10 μM) amplified GSIS and also activated UCP2. Collectively, our findings indicate that the glutathionylation status of UCP2 contributes to the regulation of GSIS, and different cellular sites and inducers of ROS can have opposing effects on GSIS, perhaps explaining some of the controversy surrounding the role of ROS in GSIS."
https://openalex.org/W1970889645,"GABA(B) receptors assemble from principle and auxiliary subunits. The principle subunits GABA(B1) and GABA(B2) form functional heteromeric GABA(B(1,2)) receptors that associate with homotetramers of auxiliary KCTD8, -12, -12b, or -16 (named after their K(+) channel tetramerization domain) subunits. These auxiliary subunits constitute receptor subtypes with distinct functional properties. KCTD12 and -12b generate desensitizing receptor responses while KCTD8 and -16 generate largely non-desensitizing receptor responses. The structural elements of the KCTDs underlying these differences in desensitization are unknown. KCTDs are modular proteins comprising a T1 tetramerization domain, which binds to GABA(B2), and a H1 homology domain. KCTD8 and -16 contain an additional C-terminal H2 homology domain that is not sequence-related to the H1 domains. No functions are known for the H1 and H2 domains. Here we addressed which domains and sequence motifs in KCTD proteins regulate desensitization of the receptor response. We found that the H1 domains in KCTD12 and -12b mediate desensitization through a particular sequence motif, T/NFLEQ, which is not present in the H1 domains of KCTD8 and -16. In addition, the H2 domains in KCTD8 and -16 inhibit desensitization when expressed C-terminal to the H1 domains but not when expressed as a separate protein in trans. Intriguingly, the inhibitory effect of the H2 domain is sequence-independent, suggesting that the H2 domain sterically hinders desensitization by the H1 domain. Evolutionary analysis supports that KCTD12 and -12b evolved desensitizing properties by liberating their H1 domains from antagonistic H2 domains and acquisition of the T/NFLEQ motif."

Newly assembled dengue viruses (DENV) undergo maturation to become infectious particles. The maturation process involves major rearrangement of virus surface premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins. The prM-E complexes on immature viruses are first assembled as trimeric spikes in the neutral pH environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. When the virus is transported to the low pH environment of the exosomes, these spikes rearrange into dimeric structures, which lie parallel to the virus lipid envelope. The proteins involved in driving this process are unknown. Previous cryoelectron microscopy studies of the mature DENV showed that the prM-stem region (residues 111-131) is membrane-associated and may interact with the E proteins. Here we investigated the prM-stem region in modulating the virus maturation process. The binding of the prM-stem region to the E protein was shown to increase significantly at low pH compared with neutral pH in ELISAs and surface plasmon resonance studies. In addition, the affinity of the prM-stem region for the liposome, as measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, was also increased when pH is lowered. These results suggest that the prM-stem region forms a tight association with the virus membrane and attracts the associated E protein in the low pH environment of exosomes. This will lead to the surface protein rearrangement observed during maturation."

Furthermore, previous work on ErbB4 used ligands shared with other receptors, raising the question of whether the observed responses are explicitly due to ErbB4. In this study, we used the ErbB4-specific ligand neuregulin-4 (NRG4) to activate ErbB4 and define its role in colonocyte biology. NRG4 treatment, either in cultured cells or in mice, blocked colonic epithelial apoptosis induced by TNF and IFN-γ. It was also protective in a murine experimental colitis model. NRG4 stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB4 but not other ErbB receptors, indicating that this is a specific response. Furthermore, in contrast to related ligands, NRG4 enhanced cell survival but not proliferation or migration, and stimulated phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic mediator Akt but not ERK MAPK. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling reversed the anti-apoptotic effects of NRG4, confirming the role of this cascade in NRG4-induced cell survival. With regard to the potential clinical importance of this pathway, NRG4 expression was decreased in human inflammatory bowel disease samples and mouse models of colitis, suggesting that activation of ErbB4 is altered in disease.

Sports Exerc. 2010; 42: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14.Hill C.A. Harris R.C. Kim H.J. Harris B.D. Sale C. Boobis L.H. Kim C.K. Wise J.A. Influence of beta-alanine supplementation on skeletal muscle carnosine concentrations and high intensity cycling capacity.Amino Acids. 2007; 32: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This suggests that in situ synthesis of β-alanine would be advantageous for carnosine synthesis. Muscles have high levels of taurine concentration, whereas the muscular taurine is mostly synthesized in livers and transported to muscles via the taurine transporter (15.Warskulat U. Heller-Stilb B. Oermann E. Zilles K. Haas H. Lang F. Häussinger D. Phenotype of the taurine transporter knockout mouse.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 428: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It has generally been considered that taurine and β-alanine are not synthesized in muscles, but the similarity of GADL1 to mammalian CSADC and insect ADC, together with its high expression levels in muscles, provides a basis to speculate that GADL1 could use cysteine sulfinic acid or/and aspartate as a substrate, therefore likely involving in taurine or/and β-alanine biosynthesis. In this study, we expressed recombinant human GADL1 and examined its activity to different amino acids, which resulted in the detection of decarboxylation activity of both aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid. GADL1 does not work on glutamate as its name suggests. Subsequently, we analyzed the transcript and protein levels of GADL1 in mice and cattle, determining that its mRNA and protein were present primarily in skeletal muscles of both species. The transcription and expression of GADL1 in muscles and the ability of its recombinant protein to produce β-alanine and hypotaurine through decarboxylation of aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid, respectively, suggest that the decarboxylation of aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid could be a route of β-alanine and hypotaurine synthesis in skeletal muscles. Then, we were able to detect the hypotaurine-producing activities in the supernatant of protein extracts from muscle and kidney tissues. A number of endogenous compounds were shown to inhibit the ADC activity of GADL1. All of the chemicals used in this report were from Sigma-Aldrich unless specified otherwise. Mouse tissues were collected from two male mice ∼8 weeks old. Bovine tissues were collected from two Holstein bulls ∼5 years old at slaughter. The tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA isolation. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic antimyotic). C2C12 myotubes were cultured in differentiation medium (DMEM with 2% horse serum and 1% antibiotic antimyotic) for 72 h before experiments. To express HuGADL1, a forward primer (5′-AAACATATGATTCCAAGTAAGAAGAATGCT-3′) containing a NdeI site (underlined nucleotides) and a reverse primer (5′-AAAGAATTCACATGTCTTTACCCAGTAAGTCTA-3′) containing an EcoRI site (underlined nucleotides) were designed and used to amplify HuGADL1 from human liver cDNA. The amplified HuGADL1 cDNA was cloned into an Impact-CN plasmid (New England Biolabs) for expression of its recombinant protein. The frame of the HuGADL1 was verified by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli BL 21 cells with the expression vector were induced at 0.15 mm of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when optical density reached 1.0 and grew for 24 h at 15 °C before breaking the cells in a suggested lysis buffer. The recombinant enzyme was obtained from E. coli BL 21 cells. The concentrated protein sample was further purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographies (Mono-Q column and Sepharose 12; GE Healthcare) with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The spectrum of HuGADL1 was recorded using a Hitachi U2800 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The purified recombinant HuGADL1 was used for substrate screening. Each reaction mixture of 200 μl containing 10 μg of purified recombinant protein and 40 μl of 50 mm of a substrate (aspartate, cysteine sulfinic acid, cysteic acid, or glutamate) was prepared in 150 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 0.40 μm of PLP. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C and stopped by adding two volumes of 100% ethanol. The specific activities and standard deviations were calculated based on the averages of triplicates. The mixtures were derivatized by two volumes of o-phthaldialdehyde (OPT) agent as described in a previous method (9.Liu P. Ding H. Christensen B.M. Li J. Cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase activity of Aedes aegypti aspartate 1-decarboxylase. The structural basis of its substrate selectivity.Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 42: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Determination of the products was based on the detection of OPT derivatives by reverse phase liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The mobile phase consisted of 50 mm of phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 25% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.5 ml per min. The oxidation potential of the working electrode was set to +0.75 V. The activities of HuGADL1 toward the substrates were calculated based on standard curves generated with authentic standards at the identical conditions. After the substrate specificity of GADLI was determined, protein extracts from either mouse muscles or mouse kidneys were obtained and assayed for decarboxylation of aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid. The extracts were obtained from raw tissues by homogenization in 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). 1 mm of MgCl2, 10 μm of PLP, 2 mm of β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μm of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (protease inhibitor) were added into the homogenization buffer. The components of homogenization was the same to the previous lysis buffer except that the buffer compound is HEPES instead of Tris as the amino group of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane will interfere with the following OPT assay. The protein extract was directly used for activity assay. The catalytic efficiencies of HuGADL1 toward aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid were determined by incubating 20 μg of enzyme in the presence of varying concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mm) of aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid in 500 μl of 150 mm of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.40 μm of PLP. Fifty millimolars of aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid were prepared as stock and adjusted to pH 7.0 using 1 m of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Each reaction was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C before analysis. The kinetic parameters and standard deviations were calculated based on the averages of triplicates. Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots (1/V versus 1/S) were used to determine the Michaelis-Menten constant Km and the maximum velocity Vmax. Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent® according to the manufacturer's instruction (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). The extracted RNA was dissolved in diethypyrocarbonate-treated water. Concentrations of total RNA were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Total RNA (0.1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a total volume of 20 μl using the ImProm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Ribosomal 18 S RNA was used as internal standard. To amplify the target gene, 5 ng of cDNA was mixed with 12.5 μl of 2 × PCR Master Mix (Promega) and 10 pmol of each corresponding primer in a total volume of 25 μl. The conditions for PCR were 32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. The primers used for RT-PCR are shown in supplemental Table S1. Frozen tissues (∼0.5 g) and C2C12 cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The final supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). For Western blot analyses, 40 μg of isolated total protein or 10 μg of purified CSADC protein was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with GADL1 antibody (Thermo Scientific) at 1:100 dilution in TBST with 5% BSA overnight at 4 °C. This antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific). Following detection of GADL1 protein, the membrane was stripped with Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) and re-probed with the β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Although not specified in the databases, human GADL1 is likely the first one named as GADL1, and the other GADL1 sequences likely have been based on the human sequence. To date, there have been several GADL1 genes in the databases. The deduced sequences from these genes are highly conserved. For example, GADL1 sequences from human, cattle, and mice share more than 90% sequence identity (supplemental Fig. S1). In human, GADL1 also shares considerable similarity with human GAD65 and GAD67, which likely explains why it has been named GAD-like protein. However, GADL1 shares noticeable better similarity (59% identity) with CSADC than with mammalian GAD sequences (50 and 51% identity) (supplemental Fig. S2). The concentrated protein solution showed a visible light yellow color. Spectral analysis of purified HuGADL1 revealed the presence of typical visible absorbance peaks with their λmax at 340 and 430 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). These visible absorption peaks were due to the presence of PLP cofactor. The ratio of the 340-nm peak versus the 430-nm peak reflected the relative contents of PLP tautomers. Overall, the visible spectrum of HuGADL1 was quite similar to that of HuCSADC (9.Liu P. Ding H. Christensen B.M. Li J. Cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase activity of Aedes aegypti aspartate 1-decarboxylase. The structural basis of its substrate selectivity.Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 42: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), except that HuGADL1 had a higher 340-nm/430-nm peak ratio (Fig. 2). HuGADL1 was screened against all 20 proteogenic amino acids and also cysteine sulfinic acid and cysteic acid for decarboxylation activity. Among them, HuGADL1 showed decarboxylation activities with aspartate, cysteine sulfinic acid, and cysteic acid (Fig. 3, A–C) but displayed no activity with glutamate (Fig. 3D) and other amino acids. Fig. 3 (A–C) demonstrates that HuGADL1 has both ADC activity and CSADC activity. Under the applied assay conditions, the specific activity of HuGADL1 was 1.3 ± 0.2 μmol min−1 mg−1 to aspartate, 2.08 ± 0.3 μmol min−1 mg−1 to cysteine sulfinic acid, and 0.46 μmol min−1 mg−1 to cysteic acid, respectively. Based on its substrate specificity, HuGADL1 could be called a HuCSADC isozyme or named HuADC. When the enzyme was incubated with aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid at the same time, its CSADC activity was not affected to any significant degree, but its ADC activity was considerably reduced (Fig. 3E), indicating that cysteine sulfinic acid competes much more effectively than aspartate in HuGADL1 binding. For example, in the presence of 10 mm of cysteine sulfinic acid and 5 mm of aspartate, the calculated CSADC activity and ADC activity were ∼1.67 and 0.06 μmol min−1 mg−1 (Fig. 3E, left panel), respectively. When GADL1 was incubated with cysteine sulfinic acid and aspartate with each at 10 mm final concentration, its CSADC activity and ADC activity were ∼1.41 and 0.12 μmol min−1 mg−1 (Fig. 3E, middle panel), respectively. When the enzyme was incubated with 5 mm of cysteine sulfinic acid and 10 mm of aspartate, the CSADC activity and ADC activity were ∼1.29 and 0.22 μmol min−1 mg−1 (Fig. 3E, right panel), respectively. Fig. 3F shows the elution profile of hypotaurine, taurine, β-alanine, and GABA in our assay conditions. HuGADL1 showed moderate substrate affinity to aspartate and cysteine sulfinic acid. Although the enzyme showed overall better affinity and catalytic efficiency to cysteine sulfinic acid than to aspartate (Table 1), the concentration of aspartate is generally much higher than that of cysteine sulfinic acid in many tissues. Therefore, the enzyme could be functional primarily as ADC or CSADC, depending on its locations.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of HuGADL1EnzymeSubstrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmmmμmol/min/mgs−1mm − 1 s − 1HuGADL1Aspartate2.72 ± 0.221.56 ± 0.121.30.48Cysteine sulfinic acid1.14 ± 0.142.31 ± 0.271.91.67 Open table in a new tab Tissue distributions of GADL1 mRNA of mice and cattle were determined by RT-PCR using ribosomal 18 S RNA as an internal standard for cDNA normalization. In mice, GADL1 mRNA expression was detected at high levels only in skeletal muscles and kidneys (Fig. 4A). In cattle, GADL1 mRNA was detected in skeletal muscles and hearts, but transcript abundance was much greater in muscles than in hearts (Fig. 4B). GADL1 mRNA was not found in mouse brains (supplemental Fig. S3). The GADL1 mRNA was detected from C2C12 myoblasts but not from C2C12 myotubes. The presence of GADL1 was investigated in mouse muscles, kidneys, C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12 myotubes. Antibody against β-actin was used as an internal control. Purified recombinant mouse CSADC was used to test the specificity of the GADL1 antibody. The result showed that GADL1 is present in muscles, kidneys, C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 5, A and B). These results are comparable with the RT-PCR data, except that GADL1 transcript was not detected from C2C12 myotubes (supplemental Fig. S3). It is possible that GADL1 in C2C12 myotubes might be carried over from the myoblast stage of the muscle cells. It was also noted that the GADL1 antibody cross-reacted with mouse CSADC (Fig. 5C). Trace amounts of CSADC were detected from kidney samples but not from muscle samples (Fig. 5A). The ADC and CSADC activities were investigated with fresh protein extracts from kidneys and muscles, respectively. When the supernatant of freshly prepared muscle protein extracts was mixed with cysteine sulfinic acid and incubated for 10 min, no apparent accumulation of hypotaurine was observed, but the relative amount of taurine (Fig. 6A) was much greater than that of the endogenous taurine present in the supernatant of muscle protein extracts (see Fig. 6B as a reference). When the freshly prepared muscle sample was mixed with aspartate for 10 min, no apparent accumulation of β-alanine was observed in the reaction mixture (Fig. 6B). Because only aspartate was incubated with the supernatant, the taurine peak corresponded to the relative base level of taurine in the supernatant of muscle protein extracts (Fig. 6B). Based on the apparent increase of taurine concentration in the reaction mixture with cysteine sulfinic acid as a substrate, it seemed that no hypotaurine was produced in the reaction mixture, but hypotaurine, once formed, was converted to taurine. When hypotaurine was directly mixed with muscle extract sample, hypotaurine was also converted to taurine (supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting that crude muscle extract contains factor(s) capable of oxidation of hypotaurine to taurine. Compared with the high concentration of endogenous taurine, no endogenous β-alanine peak was observed in the supernatant of muscle protein extracts. Also, no apparent decrease of β-alanine was observed when the compound was incubated with muscle extract sample (supplemental Fig. S5). When the supernatant of freshly prepared kidney protein extracts was incubated with cysteine sulfinic acid as a substrate, accumulation of hypotaurine was observed in the reaction mixture (Fig. 6C). When the kidney sample was incubated with aspartate, no apparent accumulation of β-alanine was observed in the reaction mixture (Fig. 6D). It is worth noting that, when substrate was incubated with the supernatant of muscle protein extracts, the majority of product was found in the form of taurine, not hypotaurine (Fig. 6A). The CSADC activity in muscle and kidney protein extracts was calculated ∼11 and 13 nmol min−1 mg−1, respectively. GADL1 was not stable in protein extracts because attempts to get rid of the endogenous taurine in protein extracts, such as dialysis and ammonia sulfate precipitation/resuspension, led to the disappearance of CSADC activity in both muscle and kidney tissue samples (data not shown). In this manuscript, we reported for the first time the biochemical activities of recombinant HuGADL1 and the distribution of GADL1 mRNA in mice and cattle. The recombinant HuGADL1, expressed in E. coli, has a UV-visible spectrum similar to that of other identified glutamate/cysteine sulfinic acid/aspartate 1-decarboxylases. HuGADL1 has different substrate usage than the name would imply. The enzyme catalyzes decarboxylation of α-carboxyl group of cysteine sulfinic acid and aspartate but not glutamate. GADL1 mRNA showed tissue-specific expression in cattle and mice, with relatively high levels in the muscle of both species. High levels of GADL1 transcript were also detected in mouse kidneys. The presence of GADL1 in muscles and kidneys has been confirmed by Western blot analysis and activity assays with tissue samples. It is likely that GADL1 may contribute to in vivo taurine or/and β-alanine biosynthesis (supplemental Fig. S6). Consistent with our results in terms of GADL1 expression, online human microarray data indicated that GADL1 expression went up significantly under conditions of neuromuscular pain (ArrayExpress: E-GEOD-7307, Gene Expression Atlas). These online data have been derived from a number of independent DNA array studies. The linking of GADL1 with muscular pain conditions provides some basis to suggest that GADL1 plays a physiological role in muscles. There are only a limited number of GADL1 genes in the Gene database with most of them from mammals. It was interesting to observe that although GADL1 from cattle and mice is highly similar in primary sequence and both are transcribed primarily in skeletal muscles, the mouse gene is also transcribed a lot in kidney, and the cattle gene is transcribed a little in heart. In addition, GADL1 mRNA was detected in C2C12 myoblasts, a cell line corresponding to earlier stages of muscle ontogeny, but it disappeared in the next C2C12 myotube stage, indicating that GADL1 might be tightly regulated during myogenesis. The Western blot data indicated the presence of GADL1 in mouse muscles, kidneys, C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12 myotubes, which is comparable with our RT-PCR data except for the C2C12 myotube result. Hypotaurine is the indispensable intermediate along the cysteine sulfinic acid to taurine pathway. Accumulation of taurine in the supernatant of muscle extracts and cysteine sulfinic acid reaction mixture determined the CSADC activity in muscles. Based on the Western blot analysis, however, typical CSADC was absent in muscles. Accordingly, the CSADC activity in muscles likely is primarily due to the presence of GADL1, whereas in kidney tissues, activity might well be a contribution by both typical CSADC and GADL1 as seen in Fig. 5A. It has been suggested that the hypotaurine-to-taurine reaction was enzyme-mediated, but there have been no reports or evidence showing the presence of such an enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2067345392,"Chromosome segregation in mitosis is orchestrated by the dynamic interactions between the kinetochore and spindle microtubules. Our recent study shows that mitotic motor CENP-E cooperates with SKAP to orchestrate an accurate chromosome movement in mitosis. However, it remains elusive how kinetochore core microtubule binding activity KMN (KNL1-MIS12-NDC80) regulates microtubule plus-end dynamics. Here, we identify a novel interaction between MIS13 and SKAP that orchestrates accurate interaction between kinetochore and dynamic spindle microtubules. SKAP physically interacts with MIS13 and specifies kinetochore localization of SKAP. Suppression of MIS13 by small interfering RNA abrogates the kinetochore localization of SKAP. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopic assays demonstrate that SKAP exhibits an EB1-dependent, microtubule plus-end loading and tracking in vitro. Importantly, SKAP is essential for kinetochore oscillations and dynamics of microtubule plus-ends during live cell mitosis. Based on those findings, we reason that SKAP constitutes a dynamic link between spindle microtubule plus-ends and mitotic chromosomes to achieve faithful cell division."

Ska-deficient GAS strains were generated by targeted allelic exchange mutagenesis and confirmed to lack surface plasmin activity after growth in human plasma or media supplemented with plasminogen and fibrinogen. Loss of surface plasmin activity left GAS unable to efficiently degrade LL-37 and increased bacterial susceptibility to killing by the antimicrobial peptide. When mice infected with GAS were simultaneously treated with the plasmin inhibitor aprotinin, a significant reduction in the size of necrotic skin lesions was observed.

Plasmin is a broad-spectrum host protease produced in the liver that is involved in fibrinolysis.

We hypothesized that the ability of GAS to co-opt from the host broad-spectrum protease activity on its own surface may provide the pathogen additional virulence properties. A critical element of host innate defense at the initial focus of infection is the activity of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (AMP). Produced by epithelial cells such as keratinocytes and immune cells including neutrophils in response to injury or infection, cathelicidin exerts direct antibacterial activity and stimulates other components of the innate immune response (11.Dürr U.H.

In this study, we investigate the effect of surface plasmin accumulation on GAS susceptibility to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides. The well characterized AP SpeB-negative, covS mutant M1T1 strain 5448AP and its parental strain 5448 were used in this study (3.Walker M.J. Hollands A. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Cole J.N. Kirk J.K.

DNase Sda1 provides selection pressure for a switch to invasive group A streptococcal infection.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains MC1061 and TOP10 were used for cloning. GAS strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) or on Todd-Hewitt agar plates, and E. coli was grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) or on Luria-Bertani agar plates. For antibiotic selection, erythromycin was used at 5 μg/ml for GAS or 500 μg/ml for E. coli. Kanamycin was used at 50 μg/ml. Bacteria were routinely grown at 37 °C unless noted otherwise. A precise, in-frame allelic replacement of the ska gene with cat encoding chloramphenicol transferase was created in GAS wild-type (WT) strain 5448 using established methods (16.Buchanan J.T. Simpson A.J. Aziz R.K. Liu G.Y. Kristian S.A. Kotb M. Feramisco J. Nizet V. DNase expression allows the pathogen group A Streptococcus to escape killing in neutrophil extracellular traps.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 396-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Briefly, an 854-bp fragment upstream of ska was PCR-amplified with primers ska-upF (5′-TGTACCCGCAGTTACCTGATACC-3′) and ska-upRcat (5′-AGAAACCTCCTACTAAAAGTTAAG-3′), the latter containing a 30-bp 5′ overhang homologous to the 5′ end of cat, and an 853-bp fragment downstream of ska was amplified by primers ska-downFcat (5′-CCACGATCTTCTAAAATGATG-3′), containing a 30-bp 5′ overhang homologous to the 3′ end of cat, and ska-downR (5′-TGGCTACCAAGAACGCTTGATTG-3′). The upstream and downstream fragments were combined with the 650-bp cat gene in a fusion PCR reaction using primers ska-upF and ska-downR, creating an amplicon in which ska had been precisely replaced with cat. The resulting triple fragment was TA-cloned into pCR-2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subsequently digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and XbaI, ligated into the temperature-sensitive vector pHY304 to generate the knock-out plasmid pskaKO, and then transformed into GAS strain 5448 by electroporation and transformants identified at the permissive temperature of 30 °C under erythromycin selection. Transformants were then grown at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C with erythromycin present to select for homologous recombination and integration of the plasmid into the genome. Single crossovers were confirmed by PCR analysis. Relaxation of the plasmid was carried out at 30 °C with no antibiotic. Screening for erythromycin-sensitive colonies was used to identify double crossover events, allelic replacement mutants were confirmed by PCR, and the strain was denoted 5448Δska. To create an AP Ska knock-out, equivalent to the animal-passaged covR/S mutant 5448AP, the knock-out strain 5448Δska was passaged in mice. 10-week-old female CD1 mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 108 colony-forming units (cfu) of 5448Δska. At 72 h after infection, mice were sacrificed, lesions were homogenized, and bacteria were plated on Todd-Hewitt agar. Individual colonies were screened for cysteine protease activity to detect SpeB using the azocasein assay described previously (17.Cole J.N. Pence M.A. von Köckritz-Blickwede M. Hollands A. Gallo R.L. Walker M.J. Nizet V. M protein and hyaluronic acid capsule are essential for in vivo selection of covRS mutations characteristic of invasive serotype M1T1 group A Streptococcus.MBio. 2010; 1 (e00110): e00191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SpeB-negative colonies were used for covR/S PCR and sequencing as described previously (18.Hollands A. Aziz R.K. Kansal R. Kotb M. Nizet V. Walker M.J. A naturally occurring mutation in ropB suppresses SpeB expression and reduces M1T1 group A streptococcal systemic virulence.PloS One. 2008; 3: e4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A covR/S mutant was identified containing a duplication of nucleotides 1056–1078 resulting in a premature stop codon after amino acid 369. This strain was subsequently used in this study and designated 5448APΔska. Although additional mutations during animal passage cannot be ruled out entirely, we ensured that the key phenotypic changes under examination were reversed upon plasmid-based complementation. Complementation was performed by transforming 5448APΔska with the plasmid pDCerm containing the ska gene, creating the resultant strain, 5448APΔska[pSka]. All experiments involving the complemented strain were performed using 5448AP and 5448APΔska transformed with the empty vector pDCerm. Plasminogen was activated by combining 2 μg of group C streptococcal Ska (Sigma) with 2 μg of human plasminogen (Sigma) in 20 μl of PBS; 2 μg of human plasmin (Sigma) without streptokinase was also incubated with LL-37. For cathelicidin degradation, 32 μm human LL-37 or CRAMP (American Peptide Co.) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for the specified time. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were run on 12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) with MES buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions or processed for mass spectrometry analysis. Cleavage reaction samples at differential time points were prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis by mixing a 1:1 ratio with Sigma-Aldrich universal MALDI matrix resuspended in 78% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of each mixed sample was plated on a Bruker MALDI target plate for analysis. The Bruker microflex MALDI-TOF was calibrated at 25 ppm mass error with the Bruker peptide calibration standard. After calibration, each spot was analyzed using reflectron positive ionization and a laser power of 60%. Masses that corresponded to truncated forms of LL-37 and were absent in the control samples were noted. Select LL-37 cleavage ions were further confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry for identification purposes. Bacterial cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4), and bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 3200 × g. Supernatants were run on 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) in MOPS buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% skim milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Membranes were incubated with polyclonal rabbit-anti-Ska antibody (5.Cole J.N. McArthur J.D. McKay F.C.

The membrane was subsequently washed and developed using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). Bacterial cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4), pelleted as described above, and filter-sterilized through 0.22 μm syringe-driven filters. 90 μl of sterile supernatant was mixed 1:1 with 1 unit/ml human plasminogen (Calbiochem) and 7 μm human fibrinogen (Calbiochem) in THB in flat bottom 96-well plates (Costar). 20 μl of 3 μm S-2251 (Chromogenix) was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Absorbance was then read at 405 nm. 1 μg of group C Ska (Sigma) was used as a positive control. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as mean ± S.D. Blood was collected from healthy volunteers under informed consent by venipuncture with heparin used as the anticoagulant. Plasma was obtained by centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g. Bacterial cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4) in THB + 50% fresh human plasma, THB supplemented with 1 unit/ml human plasminogen (Calbiochem) and 7 μm human fibrinogen (Calbiochem), or THB only. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 7000 × g. Bacterial pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.1 volume of sterile PBS. 20 μl of S-2251 (Chromogenix) was added to 180 μl of bacteria in flat bottom 96-well plates (Costar) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Absorbance was read at 405 nm. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as mean ± S.D. Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4) in THB supplemented with plasminogen and fibrinogen as described above. The presence of plasmin activity at the bacterial surface was confirmed as described above. Bacteria were incubated with 10 μg of LL-37 at 37 °C for 1 h. Bacteria were then pelleted as above, and the supernatant was collected to screen for LL-37. Prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, supernatants were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. An equal volume of 10% TCA was added to supernatants and incubated on ice for 20 min. Following centrifugation at 7000 × g, the protein pellet was washed with 100% ethanol and allowed to air dry. The protein pellet was then resuspended in 40 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and electrophoresed as described above. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following protein transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS, 1% skim milk. Membranes were then incubated with goat-anti-LL-37 (Eurogenetics, Tessenderlo, Belgium) diluted 1 in 500 in PBS, 1% skim milk) followed by rabbit anti-goat IgG HRP diluted 1 in 1000 in PBS, 1% skim milk. Excess secondary antibody was removed by three PBS washes for 10 min each, and all blots were developed in a solution of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1.4 mm diaminobenzidine and 0.06% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4) in THB supplemented with plasminogen and fibrinogen as described above. Bacteria were centrifuged for 5 min at 7000 × g and resuspended in 0.1 volume of sterile PBS. Bacteria were incubated at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped at the desired time points by the addition of aprotinin at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Bacteria were then pelleted as above and resuspended in 100 mm glycine (pH 2.0) to elute proteins bound to the bacterial surface. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, 0.1 volume of 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) was added to neutralize the solution. Bacteria were pelleted as above, and supernatants were run on 12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) in MES buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.4) in PBS + 50% THB supplemented with 1 unit/ml human plasminogen (Calbiochem) and 7 μm human fibrinogen (Calbiochem). Bacteria were then diluted 1:1000 in the same media and added to LL-37 (American Peptide Co.) at concentrations of 0–8 μm in 1 μm increments in flat bottom 96-well plates (Costar) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Aprotinin was added to relevant cultures at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml 10 min prior to addition of LL-37. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined as the lowest concentration at which no growth was observed by absorbance at 600 nm. Assays were performed in triplicate, and where there was variation between replicates, the data are presented as a range. For killing kinetics, bacteria were prepared as above, and LL-37 was added at a final concentration of 4 μm in siliconized tubes. Tubes were incubated at 37 °C with rotation, and aliquots were taken at the specified time points and serially diluted for enumeration of cfu. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test at each time point. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as mean ± S.D. Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase in THB supplemented with human plasminogen and fibrinogen as described above. Bacteria were then washed with sterile PBS and resuspended to 1 × 107 cfu/ml in PBS containing 1 unit/ml human plasminogen (Calbiochem) and 7 μm human fibrinogen (Calbiochem) with or without 20 μg/ml aprotinin. 1 × 106 cfu in 100 μl volume was injected into the flank of 10-week-old female CD1 mice. Pictures of mice were taken daily, and lesion area was calculated using ImageJ software. Statistical significance was determined by two-way analysis of variance. Each data point represents one lesion, n = 9 for each group. Permission to obtain human blood and undertake animal experiments was obtained from the University of California, San Diego. Human volunteers provided informed consent before blood samples were obtained. Ska-activated plasmin as well as purified human plasmin was observed to degrade the human cathelicidin AMP, LL-37 (Fig. 1A). No degradation of LL-37 was observed in the absence of either Ska or plasmin. A previous study of LL-37 degradation by cutaneous host proteases (e.g. kallikreins) identified a range of degradation products, some retaining and some losing antimicrobial activity (19.Yamasaki K. Schauber J. Coda A. Lin H. Dorschner R.A. Schechter N.M. Bonnart C. Descargues P. Hovnanian A. Gallo R.L. Kallikrein-mediated proteolysis regulates the antimicrobial effects of cathelicidins in skin.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2068-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To elucidate the plasmin cleavage products of LL-37, we incubated Ska-activated plasmin with purified LL-37 for varying times between 0 and 120 min (Fig. 1B). Reactions were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Degradation products of LL-37 were observed beginning at as early as 1 min of incubation time (Fig. 1C). Previously described inactive fragments LLGDFFR and IKDFLRNLVPRTES were identified, as well as a fragment with known antimicrobial activity, KSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES, (19.Yamasaki K. Schauber J. Coda A. Lin H. Dorschner R.A. Schechter N.M. Bonnart C. Descargues P. Hovnanian A. Gallo R.L. Kallikrein-mediated proteolysis regulates the antimicrobial effects of cathelicidins in skin.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2068-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) which was present at 1 min of incubation time but was not detectable after 120 min. The previously undescribed fragments RIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES and DFLRNLVPRTES were also observed and still detectable after 120 min. Because the exact contribution of a dynamic mixture of degradation products to antimicrobial activity over time was uncertain, further analysis of the interaction between plasmin-accumulating bacteria and LL-37 was needed. To study the role of plasmin in GAS resistance to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides, we created a precise, in-frame allelic replacement knock-out of Ska in hypervirulent, SpeB-negative, covS mutant GAS generated by animal passage and characteristic of the human invasive GAS M1T1 genotype/phenotype (2.Sumby P. Whitney A.R. Graviss E.A. DeLeo F.R. Musser J.M.

Nizet V. Walker M.J. Molecular insight into invasive group A streptococcal disease.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed the presence of Ska in the supernatants from WT strain 5448AP, but not from the knock-out strain (5448APΔska), from here on referred to as WT and Δska, respectively (Fig. 2A). Empty vector controls, containing the plasmid pDCerm, showed similar levels of expression to their parental strains. Ska expression was restored in the plasmid-complemented strain, Δska[pSka]. Ska activity was observed in the supernatants of WT GAS (Fig. 2B), and the WT strain accumulated surface plasmin activity when grown in fresh human plasma or in THB supplemented with human plasminogen and fibrinogen (Fig. 2C). To avoid the possible confounding influence of other plasma proteins, subsequent experiments were performed in THB supplemented with human plasminogen and fibrinogen. After allowing bacteria to accumulate surface plasmin activity by growth in the presence of human plasminogen and fibrinogen, we demonstrated that these bacteria are able to degrade LL-37 in a manner dependent on the expression of Ska (Fig. 2D). Because LL-37 targets the bacterial cell wall to exert its antimicrobial activity, we further investigated whether surface plasmin could degrade LL-37 peptide associated with the bacterial surface. Bacteria allowed to accumulate surface plasmin activity were incubated with LL-37, and after washing away unbound LL-37, a low pH buffer was used to elute surface-bound LL-37. Although Ska-expressing WT GAS showed reduced levels of intact LL-37 on their surface over time, the level of LL-37 bound to Δska mutant bacteria remained relatively constant (Fig. 2E). Although it is possible that other factors may play a role in degradation of LL-37 over this time period, it is apparent from the data presented in Fig. 2E that surface-acquired plasmin is the major contributor in this assay. To determine the physiological relevance of GAS surface plasmin cleavage of cathelicidin, we conducted LL-37 sensitivity testing. After growth in medium supplemented with plasminogen and fibrinogen to allow accumulation of surface plasmin activity, Ska-expressing WT GAS exhibited increased minimum inhibitory concentrations for LL-37 when compared with the Δska mutant (Fig. 3A). Ska-expressing WT bacteria also had significantly increased survival versus the isogenic Δska mutant in an LL-37 kinetic killing assay (Fig. 3B). These findings show that accumulation of surface plasmin, activated by Ska, provides GAS with increased resistance to LL-37 cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides. To study the effect of plasmin inhibition in vivo, we utilized a murine model of necrotizing fasciitis in which cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides have been shown to be abundantly expressed (20.Dorschner R.A. Pestonjamasp V.K. Tamakuwala S. Ohtake T. Rudisill J. Nizet V. Agerberth B. Gudmundsson G.H. Gallo R.L. Cutaneous injury induces the release of cathelicidin anti-microbial peptides active against group A Streptococcus.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 91-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Ska-activated plasmin was confirmed to degrade the murine cathelicidin, CRAMP, in vitro (Fig. 4A). Because Ska activity is specific to human plasminogen and not murine plasminogen, GAS strains were allowed to accumulate surface plasmin activity during growth, and bacteria were co-administered with human plasminogen and fibrinogen, with or without the addition of the plasmin inhibitor aprotinin. Significantly smaller lesions were observed when plasmin acquisition was absent, either in the Ska-knock-out strain or with the addition of aprotinin (Fig. 4B), demonstrating a potential therapeutic benefit of plasmin inhibition in restricting GAS proliferation. The ability of GAS to activate plasmin through Ska and bind the active protease to the bacterial surface has been known for some time (8.Walker M.J. McArthur J.D. McKay F. Ranson M.

In this study, we demonstrate the ability of surface-acquired plasmin activity to degrade host cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides. Cathelicidin peptides serve a critical front line role in mammalian innate immunity against invasive bacterial infection as first demonstrated in a murine model of GAS infection; cathelicidin-deficient mice are more susceptible to invasive GAS infection (13.Nizet V. Ohtake T. Lauth X. Trowbridge J. Rudisill J. Dorschner R.A. Pestonjamasp V. Piraino J. Huttner K. Gallo R.L. Innate antimicrobial peptide protects the skin from invasive bacterial infection.Nature. 2001; 414: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), and overexpression of an additional (porcine) cathelicidin in mice provides increased resistance (21.Lee P.H. Ohtake T. Zaiou M. Murakami M. Rudisill J.A. Lin K.H. Gallo R.L. Expression of an additional cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide protects against bacterial skin infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The invasive M1T1 clone of GAS demonstrates increased resistance to cathelicidin AMPs when compared with other GAS strains (22.Lauth X. von Köckritz-Blickwede M. McNamara C.W. Myskowski S.

Innate Immun. 2009; 1: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which may in part be attributable to cathelicidin binding properties of the M1 protein hypervariable domain (22.Lauth X. von Köckritz-Blickwede M.

Trigger for group A streptococcal M1T1 invasive disease.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1745-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we show that the co-optation of this host protease activity represents another important cathelicidin resistance phenotype of the globally disseminated hyperinvasive M1T1 GAS clone. Plasmin is an important host factor involved in fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling following injury (24.Collen D. The plasminogen (fibrinolytic) system.Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Because of its potent proteolytic activity, plasmin activation is tightly regulated under normal conditions (6.Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Plasminogen: a structural review.Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). GAS-secreted Ska is able to activate plasmin independent of host plasmin activators (8.Walker M.J. McArthur J.D. McKay F. Ranson M. Is plasminogen deployed as a Streptococcus pyogenes virulence factor?.Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 308-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), creating the opportunity for active plasmin to function in environments that are not present in an uninfected host. Cathelicidin has previously been shown to influence the expression of Ska through the two-component regulatory system covR/S (25.Gryllos I. Tran-Winkler H.J. Cheng M.F. Chung H. Bolcome 3rd, R. Lu W.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16755-16760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); however, no relationship between Ska expression and resistance to cathelicidin has been shown. The genetically unrelated plasmin activator of Staphylococcus aureus, staphylokinase, can increase resistance to human defensins through direct binding of the AMP by staphylokinase, independent of its plasmin-activating capacity (26.Jin T. Bokarewa M. Foster T. Mitchell J. Higgins J. Tarkowski A. Staphylococcus aureus resists human defensins by production of staphylokinase, a novel bacterial evasion mechanism.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, here we showed that Ska-activated plasmin increases resistance to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides by virtue of its plasmin protease activity. Interestingly, cathelicidin has been shown to increase staphylokinase-dependent fibrinolysis by plasmin (27.Braff M.H. Jones A.L. Skerrett S.J. Rubens C.E. Staphylococcus aureus exploits cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides produced during early pneumonia to promote staphylokinase-dependent fibrinolysis.J. Infect Dis. 2007; 195: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is not known whether staphylokinase activation of plasmin results in increased resistance of S. aureus to cathelicidin or whether cathelicidin can influence the fibrinolytic capacity of Ska-activated plasmin. We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of plasmin inhibition for reducing the severity of GAS subcutaneous infections. Blocking the ability of GAS to acquire Ska-activated plasmin activity on its surface, either by genetic manipulation of Ska or by inhibition of plasmin activity with aprotinin, significantly reduced virulence in a murine infection model. Pharmacological inhibition of Ska in combination with other virulence determinants has recently been shown to reduce GAS virulence in mice (28.Sun H. Xu Y. Sitkiewicz I. Ma Y. Wang X. Yestrepsky B.D. Huang Y. Lapadatescu M.C. Larsen M.J. Larsen S.D. Musser J.M. Ginsburg D. Inhibitor of streptokinase gene expression improves survival after group A Streptococcus infection in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 3469-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our data have shown that inhibition of plasmin protease activity (the critical effector mechanism of Ska) is sufficient to reduce GAS virulence in a murine skin infection model. In summary, these data present a new look at a GAS virulence factor. In addition to providing GAS with an ability to spread through tissue barriers, Ska also provides the bacterium with an immune evasion tool. Although there is no current inhibitor of Ska in clinical development, plasmin protease activity itself provides a valid target for novel GAS therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1965241071,"L-Glucose, the enantiomer of D-glucose, was believed not to be utilized by any organisms.An L-glucose-utilizing bacterium was isolated, and its L-glucose catabolic pathway was identified genetically and enzymatically.L-Glucose was utilized via a novel pathway to pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.This might lead to an understanding of homochirality in sugar metabolism. An L-glucose-utilizing bacterium, Paracoccus sp. 43P, was isolated from soil by enrichment cultivation in a minimal medium containing L-glucose as the sole carbon source. In cell-free extracts from this bacterium, NAD(+)-dependent L-glucose dehydrogenase was detected as having sole activity toward L-glucose. This enzyme, LgdA, was purified, and the lgdA gene was found to be located in a cluster of putative inositol catabolic genes. LgdA showed similar dehydrogenase activity toward scyllo- and myo-inositols. L-Gluconate dehydrogenase activity was also detected in cell-free extracts, which represents the reaction product of LgdA activity toward L-glucose. Enzyme purification and gene cloning revealed that the corresponding gene resides in a nine-gene cluster, the lgn cluster, which may participate in aldonate incorporation and assimilation. Kinetic and reaction product analysis of each gene product in the cluster indicated that they sequentially metabolize L-gluconate to glycolytic intermediates, D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and pyruvate through reactions of C-5 epimerization by dehydrogenase/reductase, dehydration, phosphorylation, and aldolase reaction, using a pathway similar to L-galactonate catabolism in Escherichia coli. Gene disruption studies indicated that the identified genes are responsible for L-glucose catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2034291567,"Halogenated inhaled anesthetics modulate voltage-gated ion channels by unknown mechanisms.Biophysical analyses revealed novel activation of K(v) channels by the inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane.K(v) channel activation by sevoflurane results from the positive allosteric modulation of activation gating.The unique activation of K(v) channels by sevoflurane demonstrates novel anesthetic specificity and offers new insights into allosteric modulation of channel gating. Voltage-gated ion channels are modulated by halogenated inhaled general anesthetics, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood. Alkanols and halogenated inhaled anesthetics such as halothane and isoflurane inhibit the archetypical voltage-gated Kv3 channel homolog K-Shaw2 by stabilizing the resting/closed states. By contrast, sevoflurane, a more heavily fluorinated ether commonly used in general anesthesia, specifically activates K-Shaw2 currents at relevant concentrations (0.05-1 mM) in a rapid and reversible manner. The concentration dependence of this modulation is consistent with the presence of high and low affinity interactions (K(D) = 0.06 and 4 mM, respectively). Sevoflurane (<1 mM) induces a negative shift in the conductance-voltage relation and increases the maximum conductance. Furthermore, suggesting possible roles in general anesthesia, mammalian Kv1.2 and Kv1.5 channels display similar changes. Quantitative description of the observations by an economical allosteric model indicates that sevoflurane binding favors activation gating and eliminates an unstable inactivated state outside the activation pathway. This study casts light on the mechanism of the novel sevoflurane-dependent activation of Kv channels, which helps explain how closely related inhaled anesthetics achieve specific actions and suggests strategies to develop novel Kv channel activators."
https://openalex.org/W2108746522,"Studies employing native PAGE suggest that most nDNA-encoded CI subunits form subassemblies before assembling into holo-CI. In addition, in vitro evidence suggests that some subunits can directly exchange in holo-CI. Presently, data on the kinetics of these two incorporation modes for individual CI subunits during CI maintenance are sparse. Here, we used inducible HEK293 cell lines stably expressing AcGFP1-tagged CI subunits and quantified the amount of tagged subunit in mitoplasts and holo-CI by non-native and native PAGE, respectively, to determine their CI incorporation efficiency. Analysis of time courses of induction revealed three subunit-specific patterns. A first pattern, represented by NDUFS1, showed overlapping time courses, indicating that imported subunits predominantly incorporate into holo-CI. A second pattern, represented by NDUFV1, consisted of parallel time courses, which were, however, not quantitatively overlapping, suggesting that imported subunits incorporate at similar rates into holo-CI and CI assembly intermediates. The third pattern, represented by NDUFS3 and NDUFA2, revealed a delayed incorporation into holo-CI, suggesting their prior appearance in CI assembly intermediates and/or as free monomers. Our analysis showed the same maximum incorporation into holo-CI for NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFS1, NDUFS3, NDUFS4, NDUFA2, and NDUFA12 with nearly complete loss of endogenous subunit at 24 h of induction, indicative of an equimolar stoichiometry and unexpectedly rapid turnover. In conclusion, the results presented demonstrate that newly formed nDNA-encoded CI subunits rapidly incorporate into holo-CI in a subunit-specific manner."

We here combine live cell imaging and systems modeling to investigate caspase-dependent apoptosis execution subsequent to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) in several cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that, although most cell lines that underwent MOMP also showed robust and fast activation of executioner caspases and apoptosis, the colorectal cancer cell lines LoVo and HCT-116 Smac(-/-), similar to X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-overexpressing HeLa (HeLa XIAP(Adv)) cells, only showed delayed and often no caspase activation, suggesting apoptosis impairment subsequent to MOMP. Employing APOPTO-CELL, a recently established model of apoptosis subsequent to MOMP, this impairment could be understood by studying the systemic interaction of five proteins that are present in the apoptosis pathway subsequent to MOMP. Using APOPTO-CELL as a tool to study detailed molecular mechanisms during apoptosis execution in individual cell lines, we demonstrate that caspase-9 was the most important regulator in DLD-1, HCT-116, and HeLa cells and identified additional cell line-specific co-regulators. Developing and applying a computational workflow for parameter screening, systems modeling identified that apoptosis execution kinetics are more robust against changes in reaction kinetics in HCT-116 and HeLa than in DLD-1 cells. Our systems modeling study is the first to draw attention to the variability in cell specific protein levels and reaction rates and to the emergent effects of such variability on the efficiency of apoptosis execution and on apoptosis impairment subsequent to MOMP."

https://openalex.org/W2033965609,"The biosynthesis of the major cell envelope glycoconjugates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is topologically split across the plasma membrane, yet nothing is known of the transporters required for the translocation of lipid-linked sugar donors and oligosaccharide intermediates from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic side of the membrane in mycobacteria. One of the mechanisms used by prokaryotes to translocate lipid-linked phosphate sugars across the plasma membrane relies on translocases that share resemblance with small multidrug resistance transporters. The presence of an small multidrug resistance-like gene, Rv3789, located immediately upstream from dprE1/dprE2 responsible for the formation of decaprenyl-monophosphoryl-β-D-arabinose (DPA) in the genome of M. tuberculosis led us to investigate its potential involvement in the formation of the major arabinosylated glycopolymers, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan (AG). Disruption of the ortholog of Rv3789 in Mycobacterium smegmatis resulted in a reduction of the arabinose content of both AG and LAM that accompanied the accumulation of DPA in the mutant cells. Interestingly, AG and LAM synthesis was restored in the mutant not only upon expression of Rv3789 but also upon that of the undecaprenyl phosphate aminoarabinose flippase arnE/F genes from Escherichia coli. A bacterial two-hybrid system further indicated that Rv3789 interacts in vivo with the galactosyltransferase that initiates the elongation of the galactan domain of AG. Biochemical and genetic evidence is thus consistent with Rv3789 belonging to an AG biosynthetic complex, where its role is to reorient DPA to the periplasm, allowing this arabinose donor to then be used in the buildup of the arabinan domains of AG and LAM."

Dynein light chain 1 (LC8), a highly conserved protein, is known to bind to a variety of different polypeptides. It functions as a dimer, which is inactivated through phosphorylation at the Ser-88 residue. A loss of LC8 function causes apoptosis in Drosophila embryos, and its overexpression induces malignant transformation of breast cancer cells. Here we show that LC8 binds to tubulin, promotes microtubule assembly, and induces the bundling of reconstituted microtubules in vitro. Furthermore, LC8 decorates microtubules both in Drosophila embryos and in HeLa cells, increases the microtubule stability, and promotes microtubule bundling in these cells. Microtubule stability influences a number of different cellular functions including mitosis and cell differentiation. The LC8 overexpression reduces the susceptibility of microtubules to cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerization in tissue-cultured cells and increases microtubule acetylation, suggesting that LC8 stabilizes microtubules. We also show that LC8 knockdown or transfection with inhibitory peptides destabilizes microtubules and inhibits bipolar spindle assembly in HeLa cells. In addition, LC8 knockdown leads to the mitotic block in HeLa cells. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis using the crystal structures of tubulin and LC8 dimer indicated that the latter may bind at α-β tubulin junction in a protofilament at sites distinct from the kinesin and dynein binding sites. Together, we provide the first evidence of a novel microtubule-associated protein-like function of LC8 that could explain its reported roles in cellular metastasis and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1975894445,"Tau is a major member of the neuronal microtubule-associated proteins. It promotes tubulin assembly and stabilizes axonal microtubules. Previous studies have demonstrated that Tau forms cross-bridges between microtubules, with some particles located on cross-bridges, suggesting that some proteins interact with Tau and might be involved in regulating Tau-related microtubule dynamics. This study reports that PACSIN1 interacts with Tau in axon. PACSIN1 blockade results in impaired axonal elongation and a higher number of primary axonal branches in mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons, which is induced by increasing the binding ability of Tau to microtubules. In PACSIN1-blocked dorsal root ganglia neurons, a greater amount of Tau is inclined to accumulate in the central domain of growth cones, and it promotes the stability of the microtubule network. Taken together, these results suggest that PACSIN1 is an important Tau binding partner in regulating microtubule dynamics and forming axonal plasticity."

Specifically, the ppk1 gene was deleted using Flippase-mediated recombination between the PBac insertion lines f07052 and d02171. The elB gene was also deleted in the recombination event but ruled out because of functional rescue by the ppk1 encoding transgene. The ppk1 transgene used in rescue experiments was generated by cloning the coding sequence of ppk1 from the cDNA RE19290 (DGRC) into the pUAST vector in front of a C-terminal FLAG epitope. The degenerin gain of function mutant, ppk1deg, was engineered by incorporating the S551F substitution into this transgene. UAS-ppk1-FLAG and UAS-ppk1deg-FLAG flies were generated through P-element-mediated transformation (Rainbow Transgenic). Rescue flies of the genotype ppk1ESB;ppk1-Gal4,UAS-CD8-GFP/UAS-ppk1-FLAG were generated by crossing homozygotic ppk1ESB;ppk1-Gal4,UAS-CD8-GFP females to homozygotic ppk1ESB;UAS-ppk1-FLAG males. All genotypes were verified using PCR. Single fly genomic DNA preparations for the polymerase chain reaction were performed as described previously (23Gloor G.B. Preston C.R. Johnson-Schlitz D.M.

The ppk1 gene, including the first two introns, and the UAS-ppk1-FLAG (Ppk1-transgene), which contains no introns, were identified with a standard PCR using the forward 5′-GGGAGGATGAGGAGGAAAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-ACTCCATTGCTATCGCAGCT-3′ primers at an annealing temperature of 68 °C with 3 mm Mg2+. Early third instar larvae in the foraging stage were used in all crawling assays (16Ainsley J.A. Pettus J.M. Bosenko D. Gerstein C.E. Zinkevich N. Anderson M.G. Adams C.M. Welsh M.J. Johnson W.A.

Larvae were derived from 10-h-old embryo collections and aged for 80 h at 25 °C and 60% humidity. Prior to the assay, larvae were washed three times with distilled water to remove food particles. Larvae then were placed on 1% agarose plates and allowed to acclimate to testing conditions for 10 min. Larval crawling was assayed at 25 °C. For video capture of movement during the assay, three individual larvae were placed on the center of a fresh 150-mm agarose plate and recorded for 1.5 min or until they moved out of range. Video recordings of larvae crawling were captured at 30 frames/s with a Sony HDV1080i digital high definition video camera and analyzed with DIAS 3.4.2 software (Soll Technologies, Iowa City, IA) (24Soll D.R. The use of computers in understanding how animal cells crawl.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 43-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nociceptive responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were assayed using a standard protocol (2Kim S.E. Coste B. Chadha A. Cook B. Patapoutian A.

Pickpocket is a DEG/ENaC protein required for mechanical nociception in Drosophila larvae.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 429-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In brief, third instar larvae in the wandering stage were exposed to a transient, noxious mechanical stimulus applied to the third, fourth, or fifth segment of the abdominal region with a 46-mN Von Frey filament. Positive responses were scored only when larvae performed at least one 360° rotation around the anterior-posterior axis. Each larva was stimulated only once. Neuronal cultures from midgastrula stage embryos were prepared as described previously (25Sicaeros B. O'Dowd D.K. Preparation of neuronal cultures from midgastrula stage Drosophila embryos.J. Vis. Exp. 2007; 2007: 226Google Scholar). Briefly, 3–4-h-old embryos were collected and dechorionated with 50% bleach. The content of three to four embryos was removed and dispersed onto a glass coverslip in a drop of culture medium. Neurons were grown in culture in a defined bicarbonate based medium in 5% CO2 at 23 °C for 2–3 days. In these midgastrula stage embryo cultures, neurons arise from neuroblast precursors. Class IV md sensory neurons were identified in primary midgastrula neuronal cultures with epifluorescence for GFP expression, as driven by ppk1-Gal4,UAS-mCD8-GFP. Acid-sensing macroscopic currents from these neurons were recorded in voltage clamp experiments using the whole cell patch clamp configuration. The neurons were clamped to −60 mV (unless noted otherwise), and currents were activated by rapid solution exchange from control (pH 7.4) to acidic pH. For most experiments, the extracellular bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm MES (pH was adjusted with HCl before each experiment). The pipette solution contained 120 mm cesium gluconate, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). In paired patch clamp experiments examining PK/PNa selectivity, the extracellular bath solution initially presented to the neuron contained 110 mm NaCl plus 40 mm TEA-Cl. The NaCl was subsequently replaced with 110 mm KCl. Under both conditions, the pipette contained 140 mm cesium gluconate with current evoked with pH 4.5. The currents were filtered at 1 kHz and acquired at 2 kHz and analyzed with an Axopatch 200B interfaced via a Digidata 1440A to a PC running the pClamp 10.2 software suite (Molecular Devices). Recording pipettes had resistances of 10–13 MΩ. Acidic pH was applied using a computer-controlled fast perfusion system (AutoMate Scientific). All of the electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature. Action potentials from class IV md neurons were recorded using the whole cell current clamp configuration. Action potentials were evoked with 600-ms intracellular injections of suprathreshold depolarizing current pulses or by relief from amiloride blockade subsequent to an acid challenge. For these experiments, the extracellular bath solution was 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution was 120 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). The first action potentials evoked with minimal current excitation were used to determine action potential threshold, amplitude, half-width, and maximal rates of depolarization and repolarization. Firing frequencies were compared at 2 pA/pF current injection. Cell capacitance was determined by integrating the area of capacitive transients from the average of 10 ramps from −60 to −100 mV. For the analytical description of block by amiloride, the dose response curve was fitted with the following Hill equation: δ=11+(IC50[X])""(Eq. 1) where δ is the blocked fraction of the current in the presence of amiloride at the concentration [X], IC50 is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of amiloride, and n is the Hill coefficient. The pH response curve for the sustained acid-sensing current was fitted with the alternative formulation of the following Hill equation, θ=11+10n•pH-pKa(Eq. 2) where θ is the fraction of current activated at pH, and n is the Hill coefficient. All of the summarized data are reported as the means ± S.E. The summarized data were compared with that of a two-tailed Student's t test. The proportions were compared with a z test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The mammalian homologs of ppk1 that are expressed in sensory receptors of the peripheral nervous system, the ASICs, are activated by acidic pH (9Lingueglia E.

Thus, we voltage-clamped Ppk1-expressing md sensory neurons and probed the effects of an acid stimulus on macroscopic current. For these studies, primary neuronal cultures were generated from embryos expressing GFP in class IV md neurons (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1, decreasing extracellular pH rapidly evoked a sustained inward Na+ current (Is) in md sensory neurons. A distinct transient inward Na+ current (It) was also observed in these neurons. This transient current, however, was only observed following relief from amiloride blockade subsequent to an activating acid challenge with application of amiloride alone in the absence of an acid stimulus not provoking It. These data demonstrate for the first time the existence of acid-sensitive currents in Drosophila sensory neurons. Further analysis of the sustained current (Is) in voltage-clamped class IV md sensory neurons determined, as shown in Fig. 2, that the half-activation pH (pH50) for Is is 4.1 ± 0.08. The majority of this sustained, acid-sensing current, moreover, is sensitive to the Deg/ENaC channel inhibitor amiloride, IC50 = 230 ± 20 μm, with ∼20% residual current remaining in the presence of a saturating dose of amiloride. In contrast, Is is refractory to the broad spectrum TRP channel inhibitor ruthenium red. Is is also equally selective for Na+ and K+. This pharmacological and biophysical fingerprint is consistent with a Deg/ENaC ion channel mediating the bulk of this current. Similar to Is, the transient acid-sensing current It identified in class IV md neurons, as shown in Fig. 3, is sensitive to amiloride, refractory to ruthenium red and carried by inward Na+ flux. Thus, Is and It are acid-activated depolarizing currents, likely conducted by Deg/ENaC but not TRP channels.FIGURE 3Characterization of It. a, this simple kinetic scheme rationalizes activation of It by relief from blockade following removal of blocker subsequent to activation by an acid challenge and explains why It is transient. C indicates closed channels; A indicates activated channels; AB indicates activated but blocked channels; and I indicates inactivated channels. Transitions from C to A and A to I are pH-dependent, and that from A to AB is amiloride-dependent where activated, but blocked channels can be captured in this state as a function of the [amiloride] provided during an activating acidic pH pulse. b, macroscopic I-V relation for It as determined from voltage clamp experiments (n ≥ 3). Bath and pipette solutions contained 140 mm NaCl, and 140 mm cesium gluconate, respectively. c, representative sustained (Is) and transient (It) acid-sensing macroscopic Na+ currents in a typical voltage-clamped class IV md neuron in the presence of 20 μm ruthenium red (n = 7; all other conditions are the same as in a). d and e, representative macroscopic currents from a typical voltage-clamped md neuron (d) and corresponding summary graph (e; n = 8), demonstrating that the magnitude of It is dependent on relief from blockade, increasing as a function of the [amiloride] used to captured the channel in the AB state during the activating pH pulse. *, significantly greater compared with 100 μm amiloride. f, a representative current trace of It sequentially evoked with different latency periods prior to washing amiloride and the corresponding summary graph (inset; n ≥ 3) showing that It decreases in magnitude as a function of the latency period between the cessation of the activating acid pulse and washing of the blocker. The hash marks in the continuous current traces represent regions removed to generate the figure. In each of these deleted regions, an activating acid prepulse of consistent time was provided in the presence of amiloride.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The simplified kinetic scheme shown in Fig. 3a can be used to rationalize the transient nature of It and the appearance of this current only after relief from blockade following an activating acid challenge, with the condition that the open channel blocker, amiloride, is able to protect the activated channel from inactivation. Although open channel blockers do not always function in this manner, this is the most reasonable explanation of these results and is consistent with additional experiments designed to test this possibility. For example, this model predicts that the magnitude of It should depend on the concentration of blocker because it controls the capture of channels in the activated but blocked state. (Conversely, Is decreases with increasing [amiloride] as described for Fig. 2c.) Moreover, the magnitude of It is expected to decline as a function of the latency period separating the removal of blocker from the activating acid pulse. As shown in Fig. 3 (d–f), both expectations are met by It. Because It increases as a function of the [amiloride] used to capture the channel in the activated but blocked state and is evoked by relief from inhibition, this current must be amiloride-sensitive. A ppk1 null mutant (ppk1ESB) and rescue flies were used to determine the relation between the gene product of ppk1 and the acid-sensing currents identified above in class IV md neurons. To verify our ppk1 genetic approaches, we first confirmed the effects of our ppk1 loss of function (ppk1ESB) mutants on previously published behavioral phenotypes (16Ainsley J.A. Pettus J.M. Bosenko D. Gerstein C.E. Zinkevich N. Anderson M.G. Adams C.M. Welsh M.J. Johnson W.A. Enhanced locomotion caused by loss of the Drosophila DEG/ENaC protein Pickpocket1.Curr.

Pickpocket is a DEG/ENaC protein required for mechanical nociception in Drosophila larvae.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 429-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, ppk1ESB null mutant larvae have a defect in larval locomotion and a reduction in a characteristic motor response to mechanical nociception similar to what has been previously published for ppk1 mutants. Both defects are rescued by the expression of wild type Ppk1 in md neurons of ppk1ESB mutants consistent with Ppk1 function being disrupted in the ppk1ESB mutant md neuron. As shown by the representative current traces from voltage-clamped class IV md neurons and the corresponding summary graphs in Fig. 5, deletion of ppk1 abolishes It but is without effect on Is. Moreover, targeted expression of wild type Ppk1 in class IV md neurons of ppk1ESB mutant flies rescues It, having no effect on Is. These results demonstrate that ppk1 encodes a nonredundant component of an acid-sensing Na+ channel in md neurons responsible for It but not Is. Importantly, it also identifies a paradigm by which relief from blockade following activation by an acid stimulus can be used as a means for the targeted manipulation of the transient current conducted by Ppk1 channels in md neurons. Such targeted activation is critical for testing whether a certain channel is capable of driving stimulus-dependent action potential firing: a requirement for establishing the channel as an ionotropic molecular sensory transducer. Use of relief from inhibition following an acid stimulus to specifically activate Ppk1 versus applying a mechanical stimulus, which is known to activate many mechanosensitive ion channels in md and other sensory neurons, allowed us to focus specifically on the cellular function of Ppk1. The relationship of this heterotypic stimulation to the endogenous stimuli remains to be determined; nonetheless this approach is valid for determining Ppk1 channel properties. Additional support for the conclusion that Ppk1 is a channel protein responsible for It comes from study of md neurons expressing the gain of function mutant ppk1deg. The gain of function degenerin mutation increases the activity of Deg/ENaC channels (26Hong K. Driscoll M.

https://openalex.org/W2019429102,"We have demonstrated that phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac2 and determined the PLD2 domains and amino acid site(s) responsible for its GEF activity. Experiments using GST fusion proteins or GST-free counterparts, purified proteins revealed that the PX domain is sufficient to exert GEF activity similar to full-length PLD2. The PLD2-GEF catalytic site is formed by a hydrophobic pocket of residues Phe-107, Phe-129, Leu-166, and Leu-173, all of which are in the PX domain. A nearby Arg-172 is also important in the overall activity. PX mutants altering any of those five amino acids fail to have GEF activity but still bind to Rac2, while their lipase activity was mostly unaffected. In addition to the PX domain, a region in the pleckstrin homology domain (Ile-306-Ala-310) aids in the PX-mediated GEF activity by providing a docking site to hold Rac2 in place during catalysis. We conclude that PLD2 is a unique GEF, with the PX being the major catalytic domain for its GEF activity, whereas the pleckstrin homology domain assists in the PX-mediated activity. The physiological relevance of this novel GEF in cell biology is demonstrated here in chemotaxis and phagocytosis of leukocytes, as the specific PX and PH mutants abolished cell function. Thus, this study reveals for the first time the catalytic site that forms the basis for the mechanism behind the GEF activity of PLD2."
https://openalex.org/W2035246243,"By UV-irradiation, cells are subjected to DNA damage followed by mutation, cell death and/or carcinogenesis. DNA repair systems such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) protect cells against UV-irradiation. To understand the role of histone acetyltransferase GCN5 in regulation of DNA repair, we studied the sensitivity of GCN5-deficient DT40, GCN5(-/-), to various DNA-damaging agents including UV-irradiation, and effects of GCN5-deficiency on the expression of NER- and TLS-related genes. After UV-irradiation, cell death and DNA fragmentation of GCN5(-/-) were appreciably accelerated as compared with those of DT40. Interestingly, GCN5(-/-) showed a remarkable sensitivity to only UV-irradiation but not to other DNA-damaging agents tested. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that transcription of DNA polymerase η (POLH) gene whose deficiency is responsible for a variant form of xeroderma pigmentosum was drastically down-regulated in GCN5(-/-) (to ∼25%). In addition, ectopic expression of human POLH in GCN5(-/-) dramatically reversed the sensitivity to UV-irradiation of GCN5(-/-) to almost the same level of wild type DT40. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that GCN5 binds to the chicken POLH gene 5'-flanking region that contains a typical CpG island and acetylates Lys-9 of histone H3, but not Lys-14 in vivo. These data suggest that GCN5 takes part in transcription regulation of POLH gene through alterations in the chromatin structure by direct interaction with its 5'-flanking region, and protects vertebrate cells against UV-induced DNA damage via controlling POLH gene expression."

Previous studies indicate that ethanol can modulate glycine receptors (GlyR), in part, through Gβγ interaction with basic residues in the intracellular loop. In this study, we show that a seven-amino acid peptide (RQH(C7)), which has the primary structure of a motif in the large intracellular loop of GlyR (GlyR-IL), was able to inhibit the ethanol-elicited potentiation of this channel from 47 ± 2 to 16 ± 4%, without interfering with the effect of Gβγ on GIRK (G protein activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel) activation. RQH(C7) displayed a concentration-dependent effect on ethanol action in evoked and synaptic currents.

Tissue factor and hemostasis.Blood. 1988; 71: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It functions as a high affinity receptor for the serine proteases factors VII and VIIa. The resulting TF FVIIa complex activates both factors IX and X (FIX and FX) leading to thrombin generation and fibrin formation (1McVey J.H. Tissue factor pathway.Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1994; 7: 469-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TF-induced coagulation is regulated by a specific inhibitor termed tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The mechanism of inhibition by TFPI involves its binding first to factor Xa (FXa) and then to the FVIIa TF complex (1McVey J.H. Tissue factor pathway.Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1994; 7: 469-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). tissue factor tissue factor pathway inhibitor mouse embryonic fibroblast quantitative PCR para-nitroaniline factor. In the last few years, it has become evident that TF is involved in various other (patho-) physiological processes apart from homeostasis, such as embryonic development, transmission of signals, promotion of cell migration, adhesion, tumor initiation, growth, and inflammation (3Versteeg H.H. Ruf W. Emerging insights in tissue factor-dependent signaling events.Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2006; 32: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, TFPI, the physiological inhibitor of TF, has also been widely implicated in the regulation of these nonhomeostatic functions of TF (4Bajaj M.S. Birktoft J.J. Steer S.A. Bajaj S.P. Structure and biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor.Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). TF is essential for the normal embryonic development, and its absence could lead to a defective vessel development and embryonic death in mice (5Bugge T.H. Xiao Q. Kombrinck K.W. Flick M.J. Holmbäck K. Danton M.J. Colbert M.C. Witte D.P. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Degen J.L.

U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6258-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The expression of TF is deregulated in many cancers, and this up-regulation is often linked with aggressive malignancies (6Contrino J. Hair G. Kreutzer D.L. Rickles F.R. In situ detection of tissue factor in vascular endothelial cells. Correlation with the malignant phenotype of human breast disease.Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and increased tumor growth (7Ruf W. Tissue factor and PAR signaling in tumor progression.Thromb. Res. 2007; 120: S7-S12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of TF amplifies the inflammatory reaction in patients with sepsis (8Levi M. ten Cate H. Bauer K.A. van der Poll T. Edgington T.S. Büller H.R. van Deventer S.J. Hack C.E. ten Cate J.W. Rosenberg R.D.

Med. 1990; 322: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). TF contributes to pathologies by activation of the coagulation cascade (proteolysis-dependent signaling) as well as by coagulation-independent (proteolysis-independent) signaling events via the cytoplasmic domain of TF (3Versteeg H.H. Ruf W. Emerging insights in tissue factor-dependent signaling events.Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2006; 32: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Pendurthi U.R. Rao L.V. Factor VIIa/tissue factor-induced signaling. A link between clotting and disease.Vitam. Horm. 2002; 64: 323-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TF might not only function as the initiator of coagulation but also as a transmembrane signaling receptor that regulates angiogenesis, tumor growth, metastasis, and inflammation. Therefore, understanding the transcriptional regulation of TF expression and its inhibitor, TFPI, would appear to be a critical step in the control of many different processes. The PAKs are serine/threonine kinases that were originally identified as binding partners and downstream effectors of Cdc42 and Rac1 in actin reorganization and cell migration (11Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. A brain serine/threonine protein kinase activated by Cdc42 and Rac1.Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). PAK1, the best characterized member of the PAK family, is activated by the p21ras-related proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 (11Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. A brain serine/threonine protein kinase activated by Cdc42 and Rac1.Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) and also by a wide variety of extracellular signals (12Tsakiridis T.

During a previous gene profiling study that includes wild-type (WT) and knock-out PAK1 (PAK1-KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we identified TF and TFPI to be down- and up-regulated, respectively, in the PAK1-KO MEFs in comparison with its wild-type controls, 3R. Kumar, unpublished data. suggesting that PAK1 might regulate the expression of TF and TFPI. Given the involvement of TF and TFPI in several pathological and physiological events, this study was undertaken to investigate the genomic regulation of TF and TFPI by PAK1 signaling. To date, nothing is known about the regulation of TF expression by PAK1 in cancer cells. We discovered, for the first time, that PAK1 signaling stimulates and inhibits the transcription of TF and TFPI, respectively, and modulates the coagulation process. HeLa, HEK 293T, and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture collection (ATCC, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PAK1 WT and KO MEFs have been described earlier (21Molli P.R. Li D.Q. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Pakala S.B. Katayama H. Sen S. Iyer J. Chernoff J. Tsai M.Y. Nair S.S. Kumar R.

All GST recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subsequently purified using the glutathione-Sepharose 4B batch method (GE Healthcare). In vitro translation was performed using the TnT® QuickCoupled transcription/translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid transfections were carried out using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When needed, after 24 h of transfection, cells were serum-starved for another 24 h before serum stimulation for the indicated times. Specific siRNAs targeting human PAK1 or control siRNAs were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The transfection of siRNA was performed twice at 24-h intervals with OligofectamineTM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after the second round of transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h before serum stimulation for the indicated times.

The datasets of differentially expressed genes between PAK1 WT and KO MEFs were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to discover relationships between the genes as well as their association with various processes and disorders. 4M. Motwani, D.-Q. Li, A. Horvath, and R. Kumar, unpublished data. The Fisher's exact test was used to identify significant functions and pathways represented within the respective datasets. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 2 μg of extracted RNA was converted to cDNA using the SuperScriptTM III First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA was subjected to qPCR by using the iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on an iCycler iQTM real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The values for specific genes were normalized to human actin or mouse 18 S housekeeping controls. Mean values are displayed ± S.D.

All qPCR primers were synthesized in Sigma. Protein extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma), and protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Cell extracts were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the indicated antibodies. Detections were performed using the ECL reagents. For immunoprecipitation analysis, a total of 1 mg of protein material was incubated with 1 μg of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C on a rocket platform, followed by incubation with total 50 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Trueblot immunoprecipitation beads (eBioscience, San Diego) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, whereupon the pellet was washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA), with protease inhibitors for three to five times, and then dissolved in a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The GST pulldown assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST or GST fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads with in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein, in a 400-μl reaction volume. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three to six times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The transferred protein on the blot was visualized using Ponceau S stain. The ChIP assays were performed as described previously (27Kumar R. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. A naturally occurring MTA1 variant sequesters oestrogen receptor-α in the cytoplasm.Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼106 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link histones to DNA and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were lysed by sonication and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed; DNA was eluted off the beads, and purified DNA (phenol/chloroform extraction) was subjected to PCR. PCR primers for ChIP assays for TF and TFPI promoters are provided in supplemental Tables 1 and 2, respectively. For re-ChIP assays, the first ChIP using a PAK1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) was followed by a second ChIP using a c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantification of the bands amplified by PCR was done using ImageJ software. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a Nonidet P-40 lysis method (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Rapid detection of octamer binding proteins with “mini-extracts,” prepared from a small number of cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). EMSA for the binding of different transcription factors was performed using the annealed and [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotides in a 20-μl reaction mixture for 15 min at 20 °C. Samples were run on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and imaged by autoradiography. Supershift EMSAs were performed by incubating the nuclear extracts with 2 μg of either the PAK1 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) or the c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody for 1 h before the addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides used are listed in supplemental Table 3. TF activity, measured as the amount of FXa generated, was determined using the Assay Sense human TF chromogenic activity assay kit (AssayPro) with minor modifications, according to Drake et al. (29Drake T.A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. Selective cellular expression of tissue factor in human tissues. Implications for disorders of hemostasis and thrombosis.Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were detached by brief exposure to trypsin/EDTA, washed three times with DMEM/F-12, and resuspended in DMEM/F-12 at 4 × 105 cells/ml. For blocking cell-surface expressed TF, anti-TF mAb TF8–5G9 (10 μg/ml) was incubated with 1 ml of the corresponding intact cell suspensions for 15 min at 37 °C, washed three times with DMEM/F-12, and divided into two equal portions. One portion was resuspended in Hepes/saline buffer (25 mm Hepes, 0.85% NaCl, pH 7.4) and kept at 4 °C before assay of intact cell surface TF activity. The other portion was lysed by freezing the cell suspension at −70 °C for 15 min and solubilizing with 15 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside at 37 °C for 15 min for assay of total TF procoagulant activity. Identical aliquots of intact (cell surface TF procoagulant activity) and lysed cells (total TF procoagulant activity) were assayed, following the manufacturer's recommendations, and the amount of FXa generated was determined by reading the absorbance at 405 nm every 2 min for 20 min, using a kinetic 96-well microplate reader (Synergy-H1 Hybrid Reader, Biotek). A microarray gene profiling study that includes wild-type (WT) and PAK1-knock-out (KO) MEFs was performed to identify the new genes or pathways that are influenced by PAK1.2 When the statistically significant differentially expressed genes were studied using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, a total of 16 genes assigned to thrombosis were differentially expressed in between wild-type and PAK1-KO MEFs (Table 1). These findings raise a new interesting line of research and for the first time introduce PAK1 as a possible new regulatory player in thrombosis.TABLE 1List of the down-regulated or up-regulated genes, involved in thrombosis, in the PAK1 knock-out MEFs compared to its wild-type controlsRefseqGene symbolFold changeRegulationGene descriptionNM_009378Thbd7.86DownThrombomodulinNM_011058 NM_001083316Pdgfra5.04DownPlatelet-derived growth factor receptor, α-polypeptideNM_009255Serpine23.27DownSerine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 2NM_010171F32.53DownCoagulation factor IIINM_008610Mmp22.51DownMatrix metallopeptidase 2NM_031168Il62.42DownInterleukin 6NM_009506Vegfc2.37DownVascular endothelial growth factor CNM_001110504 NM_007600Capn14.88UpCalpain 1NM_011576Tfpi3.46UpTissue factor pathway inhibitorNM_011198Ptgs23.26UpProstaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2NM_010217Ctgf2.70UpConnective tissue growth factorNM_008873Plau2.25UpPlasminogen activator, urokinaseNM_009931Col4a12.08UpCollagen, type IV, α1NM_019521Gas62.02UpGrowth arrest specific 6NM_011057Pdgfb2.01UpPlatelet-derived growth factor, B polypeptideNM_008969Ptgs12.01UpProstaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 Open table in a new tab In the microarray analysis, TF, the primary initiator of the coagulation cascade, was remarkably found to be differentially expressed between both cell lines. The expression of TF was 2.53-fold down-regulated in the PAK1-KO compared with wild-type MEFs (Table 1). Consistent with the above data, RT-quantitative PCR confirmed that TF expression was down-regulated in the PAK1-KO MEFs as compared with its wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1A), positioning TF as a potential downstream target of PAK1. Through its impact on the coagulation cascade and cellular signaling, TF acts as an important regulator of vascular development, several cancer-related processes, such as hypercoagulability, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and inflammation (3Versteeg H.H. Ruf W. Emerging insights in tissue factor-dependent signaling events.Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2006; 32: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, the knowledge of its transcriptional regulation will be of great scientific interest. A previous study already implicated PAK1 in the regulation of TF expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (30Görlach A. BelAiba R.S. Hess J. Kietzmann T. Thrombin activates the p21-activated kinase in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Role in tissue factor expression.Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 93: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These authors observed that PAK1 is involved in thrombin signaling in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and regulates the expression of TF by activating p38MAPK, PDK1, and PKB, and thus, PAK1 could play a role in vascular remodeling. Given the established connection between malignancy and hypercoagulant states (31Rickles F.R. Levine M.N. Epidemiology of thrombosis in cancer.Acta Haematol. 2001; 106: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and PAK1's role in malignant processes (32Kumar R. Gururaj A.E. Barnes C.J. p21-activated kinases in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), as well as the linkage of TF with cancer-related processes (6Contrino J. Hair G. Kreutzer D.L. Rickles F.R. In situ detection of tissue factor in vascular endothelial cells. Correlation with the malignant phenotype of human breast disease.Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 33Ruf W. Disse J. Carneiro-Lobo T.C. Yokota N. Schaffner F. Tissue factor and cell signaling in cancer progression and thrombosis.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2011; 9: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the possible role of PAK1 as a modulator of thrombosis in cancer cells was viewed of high interest for a more in-depth study. To date, nothing is known about the regulation of TF by PAK1 in cancer cells. Further studies in human epithelial cancer cell lines, such as HeLa and MDA-MB-231, demonstrated that the serum induction of PAK1 activity induced up-regulation of TF protein as well as mRNA levels (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting a role of PAK1 in the regulation of TF expression. Since the induction of TF by serum has been well described (34Mackman N. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Functional analysis of the human tissue factor promoter and induction by serum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2254-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), to further demonstrate the implication of PAK1 in the regulation of TF expression by serum, we examined the effect of PAK1 down-regulation conditions on TF expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, PAK1 down-regulation by siRNA transfection in HeLa cells compromised the ability of serum to stimulate TF protein as compared with cells transfected with a control siRNA. The induction of TF mRNA expression was also analyzed in wild-type and PAK1-KO MEFs (Fig. 2B). The results show that the serum induction of TF mRNA observed in the wild-type MEFs was almost completely abolished in PAK1-KO MEFs, highlighting the significance of PAK1 in the regulation of TF expression. We next examined whether the kinase activity of PAK1 is essential for the regulation of TF expression. To test this, we analyzed the effect of a dominant-negative K229R and catalytically active T423E PAK1 mutants (22Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J.

Transient transfection of HeLa cells with the catalytically active T423E PAK1 mutant resulted in a superior stimulation of TF protein and mRNA by serum as compared with the control cells (Fig. 2C). However, cells expressing the kinase-dead K229R PAK1 partially suppressed the ability of serum to stimulate TF protein and mRNA expression levels (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate the significance of PAK1 expression and activity in the induction of TF expression by serum. The previously observed nuclear localization of PAK1 (18Singh R.R. Song C.

https://openalex.org/W2078864418,"Type 1 diabetes is characterized by a loss of islet β-cells. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) protects pancreatic islets against cytokine-induced apoptosis. For this reason, we assessed whether CNTF protects mice against streptozotocin-induced diabetes (a model of type 1 diabetes) and the mechanism for this protection. WT and SOCS3 knockdown C57BL6 mice were treated for 5 days with citrate buffer or 0.1 mg/kg CNTF before receiving 80 mg/kg streptozotocin. Glycemia in non-fasted mice was measured weekly from days 0–28 after streptozotocin administration. Diabetes was defined as a blood glucose > 11.2 mmol/liter. Wild-type (WT) and SOCS3 knockdown MIN6 cells were cultured with CNTF, IL1β, or both. CNTF reduced diabetes incidence and islet apoptosis in WT but not in SOCS3kd mice. Likewise, CNTF inhibited apoptosis in WT but not in SOCS3kd MIN6 cells. CNTF increased STAT3 phosphorylation in WT and SOCS3kd mice and MIN6 cells but reduced STAT1 phosphorylation only in WT mice, in contrast to streptozotocin and IL1β. Moreover, CNTF reduced NFκB activation and required down-regulation of inducible NO synthase expression to exert its protective effects. In conclusion, CNTF protects mice against streptozotocin-induced diabetes by increasing pancreatic islet survival, and this protection depends on SOCS3. In addition, SOCS3 expression and β-cell fate are dependent on STAT1/STAT3 ratio. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by a loss of islet β-cells. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) protects pancreatic islets against cytokine-induced apoptosis. For this reason, we assessed whether CNTF protects mice against streptozotocin-induced diabetes (a model of type 1 diabetes) and the mechanism for this protection. WT and SOCS3 knockdown C57BL6 mice were treated for 5 days with citrate buffer or 0.1 mg/kg CNTF before receiving 80 mg/kg streptozotocin. Glycemia in non-fasted mice was measured weekly from days 0–28 after streptozotocin administration. Diabetes was defined as a blood glucose > 11.2 mmol/liter. Wild-type (WT) and SOCS3 knockdown MIN6 cells were cultured with CNTF, IL1β, or both. CNTF reduced diabetes incidence and islet apoptosis in WT but not in SOCS3kd mice. Likewise, CNTF inhibited apoptosis in WT but not in SOCS3kd MIN6 cells. CNTF increased STAT3 phosphorylation in WT and SOCS3kd mice and MIN6 cells but reduced STAT1 phosphorylation only in WT mice, in contrast to streptozotocin and IL1β.

CCK-1 and -2 receptors share a common phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, yet little is known regarding their possible functional coupling. We focused on CCK-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (PVN) cells, which control satiety and other autonomic functions. Analysis of mouse hypothalamic slices demonstrated that the general CCK receptor agonist CCK-8s (10 nM) triggered Ca(2+) transients most significantly in the posterior subregion of the PVN (PaPo). This 10 nM CCK-8s-induced response was absent in CCK-1 receptor knock-out (CCK1R(-/-)) slices, showing that the response is mediated by CCK-1 receptors. CCK-8s concentrations higher than 30 nM triggered a Ca(2+) rise similarly in wild-type and CCK1R(-/-) slices. The large CCK-8s (100 nM)-induced Ca(2+) responses in CCK1R(-/-) slices were blocked by a CCK-2 receptor antagonist (CI-988), whereas those in wild-type slices required a mixture of CI-988 and lorglumide (a CCK-1 receptor antagonist) for complete antagonism. Therefore, CCK-1 and -2 receptors may function synergistically in single PaPo neurons and deletion of CCK-1 receptors may facilitate CCK-2 receptor signaling. This hypothesis was supported by results of real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence double labeling and Western blotting assays, which indicated CCK-2 receptor overexpression in PaPo neurons of CCK1R(-/-) mice. Furthermore, behavioral studies showed that intraperitoneal injections of lorglumide up-regulated food accesses in wild-type but not in CCK1R(-/-) mice, whereas CI-988 injections up-regulated food accesses in CCK1R(-/-) but not in wild-type mice. Compensatory CCK signaling via CCK-2 receptors in CCK1R(-/-) mice shed light on currently controversial satiety-controlling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2006960606,"HoxA10 is a homeodomain transcription factor that is involved in maintenance of the myeloid progenitor population and implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis. Previously, we found that FGF2 and CDX4 are direct target genes of HoxA10 and that HOXA10 is a Cdx4 target gene. We also found that increased production of fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2) by HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells results in activation of β-catenin in an autocrine manner. In this study, we identify novel cis elements in the CDX4 and HOXA10 genes that are activated by β-catenin in myeloid progenitor cells. We determine that β-catenin interacts with these cis elements, identifying both CDX4 and HOXA10 as β-catenin target genes in this context. We demonstrate that HoxA10-induced CDX4 transcription is influenced by Fgf2-dependent β-catenin activation. Similarly, Cdx4-induced HOXA10 transcription is influenced by β-catenin in an Fgf2-dependent manner. Increased expression of a set of Hox proteins, including HoxA10, is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. Cdx4 contributes to leukemogenesis in Hox-overexpressing acute myeloid leukemia, and increased β-catenin activity is also associated with poor prognosis. The current studies identify a molecular mechanisms through which increased expression of HoxA10 increases Cdx4 expression by direct CDX4 activation and by Fgf2-induced β-catenin activity.

In humans and mice, HOX genes are found in groups on four different chromosomes with 9–11 genes in each group (referred to as HOXA-D). During embryogenesis, HOX genes control organogenesis and are activated 5′ to 3′ in a cranial to caudal manner (1Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F.

Expression of this set of Hox proteins is also found in association with other recurring chromosomal translocations and in a poor prognosis subset with normal karyotype. Increased expression of Hox proteins in leukemia is often associated with dysregulated expression of other homeodomain transcription factors, including Meis and Cdx proteins. Cdx proteins are of particular interest because they function as regulators of the HOX locus. Cdx4 influences expression of a number of HOX genes, including the genes encoding HoxB3, -B4, and -A7-11 (19Davidson A.J. Ernst P. Wang Y. Dekens M.P. Kingsley P.D. Palis J. Korsmeyer S.J. Daley G.Q. Zon L.I. Cdx4 mutants fail to specify blood progenitors and can be rescued by multiple hox genes.Nature. 2003; 425: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cdx4 expression has been shown to contribute to Hox-induced leukemogenesis in murine models and to bypass the requirement for Mll for hematopoiesis (20Bansal D. Scholl C. Fröhling S. McDowell E.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16924-16929Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Cdx4 in murine bone marrow results in a myeloproliferative neoplasm that progresses to AML in vivo, and co-overexpression of Cdx4 and HoxB4 in ES cells induces long term repopulating activity in murine transplantation experiments (19Davidson A.J.

Daley G.Q. Embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoietic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2005; 102: 19081-19086Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we identified CDX4 as a HoxA10 target gene using a high throughput, chromatin immunoprecipitation-based screening approach (22Bei L. Huang W. Wang H. Shah C. Horvath E. Eklund E. HoxA10 activates CDX4 transcription and Cdx4 activates HOXA10 transcription in myeloid cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19047-19064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We also found that HOXA10 is a direct target gene for Cdx4, indicating positive feedback between these genes. Other investigators identified Cdx4 as a downstream target for canonical Wnt signaling. These studies identified several β-catenin-Lef binding consensus sequences in the proximal 1.1 kb of the murine CDX4 promoter that contributed to promoter activity in transfection studies using embryonic carcinoma cells (23Pilon N. Oh K. Sylvestre J.R. Bouchard N. Savory J. Lohnes D. Cdx4 is a direct target of the canonical Wnt pathway.Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In other previous studies, we identified FGF2 as a HoxA10 target gene (24Shah C.A. Bei L. Wang H. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. HoxA10 regulates transcription of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in myeloid cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18230-18248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of HoxA10 in primary murine myeloid progenitor cells or myeloid cell lines increases Fgf2 expression and results in Fgf2-dependent activation of β-catenin in an autocrine manner. We also found that Fgf2-induced β-catenin activity contributes to the increased response of HoxA10-overexpressing cells to cytokine-induced proliferation (i.e. cytokine hypersensitivity) (24Shah C.A. Bei L. Wang H. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. HoxA10 regulates transcription of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in myeloid cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18230-18248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the current studies investigate the hypothesis that HoxA10 influences CDX4 transcription both directly and via Fgf2-induced activation of β-catenin. In addition, we identified HOXA10 as a novel β-catenin target gene, indicating another positive feedback mechanism for HoxA10 expression. Because Hox expression and β-catenin activity are both associated with poor prognosis in human AML, these studies are of interest for unraveling the complex interactions between HOX genes, β-catenin, and adverse events in human disease. The cDNA representing the major transcript of human HoxA10 was obtained from C. Largman (University of California, San Francisco) (25Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. LeBeau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J.

The sequence of this cDNA was compared with the sequence in GenBankTM. Both were subcloned into the pSRα vector for expression in mammalian cell lines and the MSCV vector for generation of retrovirus (per manufacturer's instructions; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA for β-catenin was obtained from Origene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD). HoxA10- and Cdx4-specific shRNAs and scrambled control sequences were designed with the assistance of the Promega Web site (Madison, WI). Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the complementary sequences separated by a hairpin loop were subcloned into the pLKO.1puro vector (a gift from Dr. Kathy Rundell, Northwestern University, Chicago). Several sequences were tested, and the most efficient sequences were used in combination. Negative controls for these experiments were matched shRNAs with rearranged sequences (bp swapping or scrambled controls). Vectors to express an shRNA specific to mouse and human β-catenin were obtained from OriGene (OriGene, Rockville, MD). Various sequences from the CDX4 or HOXA10 5′-flanks were amplified by PCR from chromatin extracted from the human U937 myeloid cell line. The fragments were sequenced to ensure identity with the ENSEMBL database. CDX4 5′-flanking sequences were subcloned into the pGL3-E reporter vector, and HOXA10 5′-flanking sequences were subcloned into the pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega). Additional constructs were generated in the pGL3-promoter vector with three copies of the −1020 to −1045 bp (β-catenin-binding) sequence from the CDX4 promoter or with two copies of the −800 to −825 bp (β-catenin-binding) sequence from the HOXA10 promoter (as described under “Oligonucleotides”). Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by MWG Biotech (Piedmont, NC). Oligonucleotides used for EMSA were as follows: −1020 to −1045 bp of CDX4 promoter (wild type, 5′-TGTCTTTTTCAACAATTGGAGTTTT-3′; β-catenin-binding mutant, 5′-TGTCTTTTTCAAGTTTTGGAGTTTT-3′), −809 to −829 bp of HOXA10 promoter (wild type, 5′-TCTTTCCATCAAGGCTGGCA-3′; mutant, 5′-TCTTTCCTAGAAGGCTGGCA-3′), a consensus sequence for β-catenin/Tcf binding (5′-AAGATCAAAGGGGGTA-3′; mutant, 5′-GGTAAGGCCAAAGGG-3′; from FOPFlash and TOPFlash vectors, respectively). Oligonucleotides used for real time PCR to quantify mRNA expression were as follows (listed 5′ to 3′): Cdx4 (forward, CGAGAAGACTGGAGCGTGTA; reverse, CTGTAGTCGGTCGAGCAGAA), HoxA10 (forward, ACACTGGAGCTGGAGAAGGA; reverse, TCACTTGTCTGTCCGTGAGG).

Sexually dimorphic sterility phenotypes in Hoxa10-deficient mice.Nature. 1995; 374: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Sca1+ cells were separated using the Miltenyi magnetic bead system (Miltenyi Biotechnology, Auburn, CA). Bipotential myeloid progenitor cells were cultured (2 × 105 cells/ml) for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 10 ng/ml murine GM-CSF (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and 10 ng/ml murine recombinant IL-3 (R&D Systems Inc.). Cells were either maintained in GM-CSF + IL-3 for 48 h or differentiated over 48 h in 10 ng/ml G-CSF (granulocyte) or 10 ng/ml murine M-CSF (monocyte). Retrovirus (∼107 pfu/ml) was generated with the HoxA10/MSCV or control MSCV plasmid using the Phoenix cell packaging line according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Bone marrow mononuclear cells were cultured for 24 h in 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 100 ng/ml SCF. Cells were transduced by incubation with retroviral supernatant in the presence of Polybrene (6 μg/ml) as described (10Wang H. Lindsey S. Konieczna I. Bei L. Horvath E. Huang W. Saberwal G.

RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and tested for integrity by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Primers were designed with Applied Biosystems software, and real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green according to the “standard curve” method. Results were normalized to 18S (for mRNA) or input chromatin (for co-precipitated chromatin). U937 cells were briefly treated with formaldehyde to generate DNA-protein cross-links. Cell lysates were sonicated to generate chromatin fragments of ∼200 bp and immunoprecipitated with a β-catenin-specific antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Precipitated chromatin was recovered and analyzed by PCR using primer sets to amplify various sequences in the 5′-flank of CDX4 or HOXA10. Several batches of precipitated chromatin were combined for each experiment (31Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Probing chromatin immunoprecipitates with CpG-island microarrays to identify genomic sites occupied by DNA-binding proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). U937 cells were transfected by electroporation with equal amounts of β-catenin, HoxA10, or Cdx4 expression vector or empty vector control (using pcDNAamp) plus a vector with a neomycin phosphotransferase cassette (pSRα) (30 μg each). Stable pools of transfected cells were selected in G418 (0.5 mg/ml), and aliquots of cells were tested for HoxA10 and Cdx4 expression by Western blot and real-time PCR. Other cells were transfected by electroporation with a lentiviral vector (pLKO.1puro) for expression of β-catenin-specific shRNAs or scrambled control shRNAs. Stable pools of transfected cells were selected in puromycin (1.2 μg/ml). In some experiments, U937 cells were stably co-transfected with a HoxA10 expression vector, Cdx4 expression vector, or empty vector control plus a vector to express β-catenin-specific shRNAs or scrambled control shRNAs. Co-transfectants were selected in both G418 and puromycin. To identify β-catenin-binding cis elements in the CDX4 promoter, U937 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-E) containing 1.4 kb, 1050 bp (with or without mutation of the β-catenin-binding consensus in this construct), 1025 bp, or 539 bp of CDX4 5′-flanking sequences or pGL3-E control (30 μg) and a vector to overexpress β-catenin (or empty vector control) (50 μg). In other experiments, cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-basic) with 1.0 kb, 825 bp (with or without mutation of the β-catenin-binding consensus in this construct), 772 bp, or 200 bp of the HOXA10 5′-flank or with pGL3-basic control (30 μg) and a vector to overexpress β-catenin or empty expression vector (50 μg). In additional experiments, cells were co-transfected with a minimal promoter/luciferase reporter vector with multiple copies of either the β-catenin-binding cis element from the CDX4 promoter (−1025 to −1050 bp) or the β-catenin-binding cis element from the HOXA10 promoter (−800 to −825 bp) (30 μg) and vectors to overexpress β-catenin or β-catenin-specific shRNAs or relevant controls (empty vectors or vector with scrambled shRNA sequences) (50 μg). Cells were also transfected with a β-galactosidase reporter vector to control for transfection efficiency (CMV/β-gal). For some studies, cells were transfected with TopFlash or FopFlash reporter vectors. TopFlash contains three copies of a consensus binding site for Tcf-Lef linked to a minimal promoter and a luciferase reporter. FopFlash is a similar construct but with a mutation that abolishes Tcf-Lef binding. The TopFlash and FopFlash reporter constructs were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). U937 or murine bone marrow cells were lysed by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. Lysate proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to β-catenin, HoxA10, Cdx4, and GAPDH or tubulin. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with different lysate proteins. A representative blot is shown. Oligonucleotide probes were prepared, and EMSAs were performed, as described (32Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R.

For binding reactions with β-catenin antibody, disruption of the complex (not supershift) was anticipated, based on the location of the epitopes used for antibody production. Binding competition studies were performed with double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides were used in dose titration experiments to determine the efficiency of binding competition. Data are presented for assays with a 200-fold molar excess of the competitor (standard for such studies; see also Refs. 34Bei L. Lu Y. Bellis S.L. Zhou W. Horvath E. Eklund E.A.

https://openalex.org/W1994358953,"Transduction of biological signals at the molecular level involves the activation and/or inhibition of allosteric proteins. In the transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) from Escherichia coli, the allosteric activation, or apo-holo transition, involves rigid body motions of domains and structural rearrangements within the hinge region connecting the cAMP- and DNA-binding domains. During this apo-holo transition, residue 138 is converted as part of the elongated D-helix to the position of the N-terminal capping residue of a shorter D-helix. The goal of the current study is to elucidate the role of residue 138 in modulating the allostery between cAMP and DNA binding. By systematically mutating residue 138, we found that mutants with higher N-terminal capping propensities lead to increased cooperativity of cAMP binding and a concomitant increase in affinity for lac-DNA. Furthermore, mutants with higher N-terminal capping propensity correlate with properties characteristic of holo-CRP, particularly, increase in protein structural dynamics. Overall, our results provide a quantitative characterization of the role of residue 138 in the isomerization equilibrium between the apo and holo forms of CRP, and in turn the thermodynamic underpin to the molecular model of allostery revealed by the high resolution structural studies.

One of the fundamental questions yet to be resolved about allostery is the identity of the physical properties of the protein that are responsible for modulating the phenomenon of allostery. Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 5The abbreviations used are: CRPcAMP receptor proteinH/Dhydrogen/deuteriumITCisothermal titration calorimetry. is chosen as a model system to address this important yet unanswered question. Cooperativity between the two high affinity cAMP-binding sites and DNA binding by the cAMP-activated CRP are the consequences of homotropic and heterotropic allosteric effects, respectively (1Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Communications between the high-affinity cyclic nucleotide binding sites in E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein. Effect of single site mutations.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). cAMP receptor protein hydrogen/deuterium isothermal titration calorimetry. Recently, we uncovered two fundamental features of allostery in CRP. First, the nature of cooperativity can be modulated from negative to positive via mutations at sites not directly involved in ligand binding or in subunit contacts. Second, negative cooperativity and positive cooperativity arise from the modulation of the dynamics of the protein. This conclusion is based on our observation of a linear relationship between the energetics of cooperativity in cAMP binding and protein dynamics (2Gekko K. Obu N. Li J. Lee J.C. A linear correlation between the energetics of allosteric communication and protein flexibility in the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein revealed by mutation-induced changes in compressibility and amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3844-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion can be derived from the DNA binding results. One of the critical dynamic motions in CRP during the apo-holo transition is the reorientation of the DNA- and cAMP-binding domains (3Popovych N. Tzeng S.R Tonelli M. Ebright R.H. Kalodimos C.G.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16604-16609Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) resolved the structure by x-ray crystallography. Both groups observed a rotation and translation of the DNA-binding domain relative to the cAMP-binding domain (Fig. 1), although the x-ray data revealed an additional structural change that involved a change in the length of the D-helix during the apo-holo transition (3Popovych N. Tzeng S.R Tonelli M. Ebright R.H. Kalodimos C.G. Structural basis for cAMP-mediated allosteric control of the catabolite activator protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A consequence of this domain rotation is the exposure of the DNA recognition F-helices to position them for binding DNA (Fig. 1) and another concomitant change involving a coil-helix conversion including residues Val126 through Phe136. Residues 126–136 constitute part of the C-helix in the holo form, whereas in apo-CRP, the same residues assume a coil configuration (Fig. 1). Moreover, in the apo-CRP structure, the length of the D-helix is extended to include residue Asp-138, leading to an interdomain antiparallel helix-helix interaction between the two D-helices of adjacent subunits (4Sharma H. Yu S. Kong J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Structure of apo-CAP reveals that large conformational changes are necessary for DNA binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because residue 138 is part of the secondary structural change during the apo-holo transition, we hypothesize that a change in the N-terminal capping propensity of the Asp-138 side chain should influence the equilibrium distribution of the apo-holo states. As a consequence, the allosteric properties of CRP should be altered. Hence, the functional energetics of cAMP binding and DNA binding are correlated to the structural energetic landscape of CRP and to the N-terminal capping propensities of amino acid substitutions at position 138. cAMP and proteases (subtilisin and chymotrypsin) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium azide was purchased from Kodak. The absorption coefficient of cAMP was 14,650 m−1 cm−1 at 259 nm. Calibration proteins for chromatography were products of Roche Applied Science. All of the experiments were conducted in TEK100 buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm KCl at pH 7.8 and 25 °C). Wild type and all Asp-138 mutants of CRP were purified from isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli strains HMS174DE3 with a published procedure (9Cheng X. Lee J.C.

The protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE gel stained by Coomassie Blue. Purified protein was stored in a −20 °C freezer with ∼0.2 m KCl and ∼10% glycerol at pH 7.5. Protein solutions were concentrated by passage through a hydroxyapatite gel column. CRP solution was dialyzed against TEK100 buffer overnight with three buffer changes before being used. The concentration of stock CRP solution was determined spectrophotometrically by using the extinction coefficient of 40,800 m−1 cm−1 at 278 nm for the CRP dimer (12Lin S.H. Kovac L. Chin A.J.

The ratio of absorbance at 278 nm to that at 260 nm was larger than 1.85, indicating that contaminated DNA was removed. The presence of the desired substitutions was confirmed by mass spectrometry and automated dideoxy sequencing of the DNA templates. All ITC titration experiments were carried out on the VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA), which was calibrated with electrically generated heat pulses as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentrations of all CRP mutants were higher than 180 μm in TEK100 buffer. All ITC experiments were conducted in TEK100 buffer, and the method for data analysis was the same as previously described (1Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

Effect of single site mutations.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Heats of dilution of cAMP were corrected in the calculation for the heats of reactions. The relationship between DNA binding affinity of CRP and cAMP concentration was monitored by our previously published method of fluorescence anisotropy (13Heyduk T. Lee J.C.

The experiments, repeated three times, were carried out using a Phenomenex Biosep SEC-S2000 HPLC gel filtration column 2000 × 7.8 mm. Constant temperature was maintained by a water bath set at 25 °C. The protein samples (∼30 μm) were warmed up to room temperature before using. The steel-jacketed column was washed with 500 ml of degassed H2O and then equilibrated with 500 ml of filtered and degassed TEK100 buffer. The column was operated with mechanical injection within a fully automated BioCad SPRINT HPLC system. The elution volumes of protein sample, blue dextran, and sodium azide were obtained, and the partition coefficient (Kd) was calculated with Equation 1 (15Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. Monitoring the sizes of denatured ensembles of staphylococcal nuclease proteins: implications regarding m values, intermediates, and thermodynamics.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18010-18017Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Kd=(Vprotein-Vblue dextran)(Vazide-Vblue dextran)(Eq. 1) where Vprotein, Vblue dextran, and Vazide represent the elution volumes of protein sample, blue dextran, and azide, respectively. Before each experiment, the column was calibrated using proteins with Stokes radii taken from the literature (15Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. Monitoring the sizes of denatured ensembles of staphylococcal nuclease proteins: implications regarding m values, intermediates, and thermodynamics.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18010-18017Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 1/Kd was shown to be proportional to the Stokes radius (RS) of protein as described by Equation 2, which was used for estimating the dimensions of native protein. 1/Kd=0.154Rs-1.289(Eq. 2) The range of data chosen for numerical analysis encompassed the entire protein peak for CRP wild type and all mutants. To determine the numerical value of the maximum (or peak), a nonlinear least squares fitting routine using a sixth degree polynomial was employed to simulate the elution profile. The first derivative of the fitted data were employed to determine the numerical values corresponding to slope zero, which was the maximum value of the elution profile. The fitting procedures were performed using SigmaPlot 8.0. Numerical calculations were performed using Mathematica 4.0 (Wolfram Research). Proteolytic digestion was carried out in a reaction volume of 50 μl containing 15 μm CRP and 8 μg/ml protease at room temperature in TEK100 buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 2 μl of a stock solution of 200 μg/ml protease and was stopped by adding 1 μl of 100 mm PMSF in 2-propanol to a final concentration of 1 mm. The reaction time was 85 min for subtilisin and 120 min for chymotrypsin. 15-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE slab gel for analysis (16Heyduk T.

The gels were stained by Coomassie Blue. The digestion percentage of each mutant was analyzed by monitoring the intensity of each band using a Kodak camera system (model EDAS 290). FTIR spectra were measured with a Bomem (Quebec, Canada) MB series Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a dTGS detector and purged constantly with dry air, using the same published procedure (18Dong A.

Acquisition and interpretation of hydrogen exchange data from peptides, polymers, and proteins.Methods Biochem. Anal. 1982; 28: 1-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction of the unexchanged amide proton, F, was calculated at various time intervals using Equation 3, F=(AII-AII∞)/AIω(Eq. 3) where AI and AII are the absorbance maximum of the amide I and II bands, respectively. AII∞ is the amide II absorbance maximum of fully deuterated protein, and ω is the ratio of AIIo/AIo, with AIIo and AIo being the respective absorbance maxima for the amide II and amide I bands of protein in H2O (20Susi H.

Acquisition and interpretation of hydrogen exchange data from peptides, polymers, and proteins.Methods Biochem. Anal. 1982; 28: 1-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exchange kinetic parameters were fitted to Equation 4, F=A1e-k1+A2e-k2t+C(Eq. 4) where F is amide proton fraction at given time t; k1 and k2 are the intermediate and slow exchange rate, respectively; and A1, A2, and C are the constants. F0 is the remaining amide proton fraction at 1 min. Double exponential expression is necessary for fitting the data. We measured the affinity as well as the thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy and entropy change) during cAMP binding to WT CRP and position 138 mutants. The left panel of Fig. 2 shows a typical calorimetric titration of cAMP into a solution of WT-CRP. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the heat exchange/mole of titrant versus the ratio of the total concentration of ligand to that of protein. The results of all Asp-138 mutant binding reactions are shown in Fig. 3. The solid lines represent the best least squares fits of the data as described (1Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

The magnitude and nature of cooperativity of cAMP binding to the first and second site are expressed as ΔΔG, i.e., ΔG2 − ΔG1, derived from their microscopic binding constants, k2 and k1 (Table 1). We observed that mutations at residue 138 affect the affinity and various thermodynamic parameters of cAMP binding significantly. Side chain substitutions at residue 138 affect the binding affinity of these CRP mutants for lac-DNA, as shown in Table 2 (14Yu S. Lee J.C.

However, all Asp-138 mutants maintain the WT CRP characteristic biphasic feature. It is well established that the relationship between DNA binding affinity of CRP and cAMP concentration is biphasic regardless of DNA sequence (Fig. 4) (16Heyduk T. Lee J.C.

Evidence for three protein conformational states with different promoter binding affinities.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). First, an initial increase in the value of the DNA binding constant is observed as the two high affinity cAMP-binding sites are occupied (1Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Communications between the high-affinity cyclic nucleotide binding sites in E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein. Effect of single site mutations.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Then the binding constant decreases as the cAMP concentration reaches saturation of the weak cAMP-binding sites in CRP (1Lin S.H. Lee J.C.

Hence, mutations at residue 138 affect the affinity for DNA but not the basic mechanism of DNA binding in response to cAMP concentration.TABLE 2Correlations between N-capping frequency and thermodynamic parametersSide chainResidue N-cap frequencyaThe values are from Table I of Aurora and Rose (33).Protein stability (−) m-valuebThe values are from Yu and Lee (14).Intersubunit interactionbThe values are from Yu and Lee (14).Proteolytic digestionStokes radiusH→D exchange out rate k1cAMP binding cooperativity−ΔG of DNA bindingbThe values are from Yu and Lee (14).CDFluoΔΔG−T(ΔS2 − ΔS1)Kcal/mol%Ås−1Kcal/molKcal/molKcal/molAsp1.581.8 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.111.7 ± 0.95020.4 ± 0.10.31 ± 0.030.659.510.7Thr1.411.8 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.213.5 ± 2.04921.0 ± 0.20.32 ± 0.020.474.810.6Ser1.252.0 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.415.0 ± 1.43021.2 ± 0.10.35 ± 0.08−0.54−0.99.7Gln1.051.9 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.413.0 ± 0.75320.5 ± 0.20.20 ± 0.032.0314.9.8Gly0.982.2 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.411.4 ± 0.85020.9 ± 0.10.43 ± 0.040.246.39.8Lys0.841.6 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.211.4 ± 0.85520.2 ± 0.10.27 ± 0.0304.2>12Leu0.791.7 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.211.8 ± 0.76819.8 ± 0.30.53 ± 0.012.6−4.56.1Ala0.671.5 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.418.6 ± 1.72521.6 ± 0.10.56 ± 0.040.060.06.7Val0.671.9 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.323.5 ± 1.72321.6 ± 0.20.55 ± 0.030.47−0.35.0a The values are from Table I of Aurora and Rose (33Aurora R.

Open table in a new tab As a structural parameter, the Stokes radius reflects the global hydrodynamic conformation of CRP. Gel filtration was used to determine the Stokes radii of WT CRP and Asp-138 mutants. The elution profiles of CRP wild type and Asp-138 mutants are shown in the inset of Fig. 5A. Small but highly reproducible shifts in the elution profiles are observed, indicating a shift in Stokes radius in CRP induced by side chain replacements at residue 138 (Fig. 5A). We determined the peak value of the elution time of the Asp-138 mutants (Fig. 5). Knowing the flow rate, the elution time can be converted to elution volume, which is related to Stokes radius as expressed by Equation 2. The results are summarized in Table 2. The Asp-138 mutations affect the hydrodynamic property of CRP so much that it is reflected in a change in Stokes radius. The sensitivity of CRP to proteolytic digestion is one of the diagnostic tools to monitor changes in CRP structure (16Heyduk T. Lee J.C. E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein.

Both subtilisin and chymotrypsin were employed in this study to detect the protein conformational changes induced by mutations at residue 138. All of the CRP samples behaved identically regardless of the specific protease employed. Similar to WT, the proteolytic digestion pattern of all 138 mutants is identical, namely, the appearance of a single protease-resistant gore of very similar molecular weight as detected by SDS-PAGE and biphasic as a function of cAMP concentration as reported by Heyduk and Lee (16Heyduk T. Lee J.C. E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein. Evidence for three protein conformational states with different promoter binding affinities.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Typical results of the subtilisin digestion are shown in Fig. 6. Despite these side chain-specific changes in rate of proteolysis, these mutations have not altered the general response of CRP to cAMP binding, namely, a change in intersubunit interaction resulted in an increase in sensitivity to proteolysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis showed that the molecular weights of the protease resistant cores are 15,266 and 15,602 for subtilisin and chymotrypsin digestions, respectively. In turn these values matched the predicted mass of 15,265 and 15,597 for the sequences containing residues Val-2 to Leu-134 and Val-2 to Leu-137, respectively. To explore and compare the protein dynamics of WT CRP and Asp-138 mutants, H/D exchange rates of these mutants were monitored by FTIR. The overall H/D exchange rates were estimated by plotting the fraction of unexchanged amide protons as a function of time (Fig. 7). The fraction of the unexchanged amide protons at the first exchange time point (1 min) for all studied proteins are from 15 to 25%, suggesting that the majority of the amide protons exchanged so rapidly that their exchange was ∼80% completed within the time interval of the acquisition of the first time point. Therefore, only the intermediate and slow exchange protons can be practically monitored semiquantitatively over the time range employed in this study. A two-exponential decay model (Equation 4) was used to describe the exchange reaction of the remaining amide protons within the experimental time frame, and the resolved parameters are summarized in Tables 2. F0, nonexchanged protein fraction at 1 min of exposure to D2O, also reflects the dynamics of the protein. Because of the complexity of the overall H/D exchange reaction and technical limitation, the data shown in Table 2 reveal that the dynamics of Asp-138 mutants can be grossly divided into three classes: D138L is the most dynamic mutant followed"

These enzymes catalyze the cleavage of PI or glycan phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins to diacylglycerol and an inositol 1,2-(cyclic)-phosphate.

The enzyme from Listeria monocytogenes is activated by many amphiphiles in a somewhat nonspecific fashion where the diluting lipid prevents protein-induced vesicle aggregation and the resulting sequestration of the enzyme. This nonspecific activation mechanism also likely reduces penetration of the highly cationic protein into a negatively charged bilayer (3Chen W. Goldfine H. Ananthanarayanan B. Cho W. Roberts M.F.

Its optimum activity is around pH 6.5, and unlike the other homologues it is strongly inhibited by moderate concentrations of salt (6Daugherty S. Low M.G.

A recent structure of the protein (7Goldstein R. Cheng J. Stec B. Roberts M.F.

S. aureus PI-PLC activity is also enhanced by the presence of PC in assays systems (7Goldstein R. Cheng J. Stec B. Roberts M.F. Structure of the S. aureus PI-specific phospholipase C reveals modulation of active site access by a titratable π-cation latched loop.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 2579-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have solved a novel crystal structure of S. aureus PI-PLC, formed in the presence of dibutyroyl-PC, with significant inter-monomer contacts at the interface of the hydrophobic side chains of helix B and no anion in the anion binding pocket. This is strikingly different from previous, monomeric crystal structures (7Goldstein R. Cheng J. Stec B. Roberts M.F. Structure of the S. aureus PI-specific phospholipase C reveals modulation of active site access by a titratable π-cation latched loop.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 2579-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The relevance of this dimer structure to protein function and regulation has been tested by measuring enzymatic activity and lipid binding of recombinant enzyme and variants with selected mutations. The experimental findings suggest that S. aureus PI-PLC is optimally active as a dimer when, as the crystal structure suggests, the anion binding pocket is occluded. PC activates the enzyme by diluting anionic substrate (which has some affinity for the anion binding pocket as well as the active site), enhancing transient PI-PLC aromatic side chain π/choline cation interactions, and in turn allowing transient dimers to form. This complex mechanism, in which electrostatic interactions, spatially removed from the active site, compete with dimerization facilitated by zwitterionic PC, may be a broadly applicable mechanism allowing differential regulation of peripheral membrane enzymes by specific phospholipids. l-α-Phosphatidylinositol and other phospholipids, including 1,2-dibutyroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (diC4PC), PC, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (PG), were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., and used without further purification. All competent cells used in mutagenesis (XL1-Blue) and overexpression (BL21 Codonplus) were obtained from Stratagene. LB media and LB agar were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Inc. The fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester was purchased from Invitrogen. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin was purchased from Qiagen and Q-Sepharose fast-flow anion-exchange resin was purchased from GE Healthcare. Bio-Spin 6 columns were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.

Mutations in the piplc gene were made using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and complementary primers purchased from Operon to generate the PI-PLC variants V44C, V44W, H86E, H86Y, F249W, Y253K, Y253S, Y253W, Y290A, and Y253S/Y255S. The sequence of each mutated gene was confirmed by Genewiz. Escherichia coli BL21-Codonplus (DE3)-RIL cells were transformed with the plasmid containing the S. aureus piplc gene. Overexpression and purification of the His-tagged recombinant protein followed protocols reported previously (7Goldstein R. Cheng J. Stec B. Roberts M.F.

The purity of the PI-PLC enzymes was above 95% as monitored by SDS-PAGE; concentrations were measured by the absorption at 280 nm using ϵ280 = 60,280 m−1 cm−1 calculated by ProtParam (8Gasteiger E.

Secondary structure and thermal stability of S. aureus PI-PLC variants were determined using far-UV CD as described previously for Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC (9Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F.

Compared with recombinant wild type S. aureus PI-PLC (WT), there are no significant changes in structure and thermal stability for the single mutation enzymes. Although Y253S/Y255S has the same secondary structure content, its thermal denaturation temperature is 5 °C lower than WT. Recombinant B. thuringiensis PI-PLC was generated as described previously (9Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F.

Purified S. aureus PI-PLC was concentrated to 20 mg/ml before being combined with 100 mm myo-inositol and, in the case of WT only, 5 mm diC4PC. Each mixture was diluted to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml using deionized water. The protein was incubated on ice for a minimum of 2 h before setting up crystallization trays. Samples were crystallized at 20 °C by vapor diffusion, using hanging drops of 3 μl. Crystals of the recombinant PI-PLC were obtained in 150 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, with 1 mm Mg(NO3)2, and 20% PEG 4000. Except for the presence of the monomeric diC4PC, these conditions differ from those used previously (7Goldstein R. Cheng J. Stec B. Roberts M.F.

Y253S crystals were obtained using similar conditions with an increase in the concentration of Mg(NO3)2 to 100 mm, and a slight decrease in PEG 4000 (to 16%). WT S. aureus PI-PLC crystals appeared as large plates and formed in the drop after approximately nine months, whereas the Y253S crystals appeared as plates after 2 weeks. Suitable crystals were mounted in nylon loops and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100 K using an in-house Rigaku MicroMax-07 HF high intensity microfocus rotating Cu anode x-ray generator, coupled with Osmic VariMax Optics and a R-Axis IV++ image plate area detector.

Enzyme kinetics experiments used PI/PC small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) prepared by sonication, where XPC is the mole fraction of PC in these SUVs. Aliquots of phospholipids (PI, PG, and PC species) in chloroform were mixed, dried under N2, and then lyophilized overnight. The lipid film was rehydrated with the desired buffer. Small PI/PC vesicles were generated by sonicating lipid mixtures for 10 to 15 min on ice (Branson Sonifier 250). The average radii for PI and PI/PC (XPC = 0.5) vesicles were 130 Å, with 20 and 46% polydispersity, respectively. Similar sizes have also been documented for the PG/PC SUVs used in FCS experiments (18Pu M. Roberts M.F. Gershenson A. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C monitors the interplay of substrate and activator binding sites.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6835-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Specific activities of the PI-PLC enzymes were measured by monitoring production of cIP from PI by 31P NMR spectroscopy (Varian VNMRS 600) (1, 2, 9). Most assays were in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, with 1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin at 28 °C. However, for assays examining the pH dependence of activity, a mixed buffer system of MES and HEPES (total concentration of 50 mm) with the required pH value was used. Specific activities in the presence of salt were determined using a NaCl (137 mm)/KCl (2.7 mm) mixture. S. aureus PI-PLC concentrations used in assays ranged from 0.2 to 8 μg/ml. The enzyme and SUVs were incubated for fixed times at 28 °C, and the reaction was quenched by addition of acetic acid followed by Triton X-100 to solubilize the remaining lipids in mixed micelles. The relative integrated intensity of the cIP resonance versus the total phospholipid concentration was used to calculate PI-PLC specific activity. For all reactions, the cleavage of PI was kept below 20% (no inositol 1-phosphate was generated under these conditions). The increase in cIP under these conditions is linear with time indicative of an initial rate being measured. Because we are dealing with a vesicle and some fusion of SUVs as diacylglycerol is produced, this is not the same as a steady-state rate with the substrate in solution, but it is operationally useful for comparing rates under different conditions (pH, concentration of enzyme, salt, etc.). S. aureus PI-PLC proteins were labeled at pH 7.2 to maximize preferential labeling of the N terminus with Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After removal of unbound dye using 3 spin columns, the absorption at 280 nm for protein plus dye and at 495 nm for the dye were used to estimate the number of dye molecules incorporated. Labeled S. aureus PI-PLC typically had 93–100% dye incorporation. Electrospray ionization mass spectral data of intact PI-PLC were obtained at the University of Massachusetts Amherst Mass Spectrometry Facility, which is supported in part by the National Science Foundation. Labeling percentages ranged from 80 to 99% with >70% of the protein containing a single Alexa Fluor 488 moiety and the remainder doubly labeled. At 99% labeling efficiency, 25–30% of the labeled protein has 2 labels, whereas this percentage is lower (20–25%) at 80% labeling. The activity of labeled PI-PLC is not significantly different from that of unlabeled PI-PLC. FCS-based binding assays were performed on a home-built confocal setup described previously (18Pu M.

The fluorescence was monitored at 22 °C with samples placed in chambered coverglass wells (Lab-Tek, Nunc), containing 10 nm labeled PI-PLC and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin in 300 μl of 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5 (the same buffer used in the enzymatic assays). The anionic phospholipid PG was used as the substrate analog. For vesicle binding experiments, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled PI-PLC variants were titrated with unlabeled PG/PC vesicles, where XPC was varied between 0 and 1. For each XPC, FCS titrations were run in duplicate and repeated a second time with different vesicle and protein preparations. Data analysis was based on previous work by Elson, Thompson and others (20Elson E.L. Magde D. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. I.

The fitted diffusion coefficient for free, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled S. aureus PI-PLC (Dfree) was 50 ± 2 μm2 s−1 and the vesicle diffusion coefficient, Dbound, determined from analysis of vesicles containing fluorescently labeled lipids, was in the range of 12–15 μm2 s−1 (18Pu M.

To account for the possibility that multiple proteins could bind to the same vesicle, autocorrelations (G(τ)) (obtained in cross-correlation mode using a 50–50 beamsplitter) for samples containing SUVs were fit to Equation 1 (22Thompson N.L.

The correlation function for species j, gj(τ) is shown in (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4) (20Elson E.L. Magde D. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. I.

Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. II. An experimental realization.Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 29-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar)). τD,j is the diffusion time. The fraction of protein bound to the SUVs, f, is determined from Ap and the time-averaged number of proteins in the observation volume, 〈No〉, as described previously (18Pu M. Roberts M.F. Gershenson A. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C monitors the interplay of substrate and activator binding sites.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6835-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The average brightness of the SUVs relative to the protein (22Thompson N.L. Lakowicz J. Topics in Fluorescence Microscopy. Plenum Press, New York1991: 337-378Google Scholar, 24Middleton E.R.

The apparent dissociation constant, Kd, representing PI-PLC partitioning to the vesicle surface, and a cooperativity coefficient, n, was determined using the empirical equation (18Pu M. Roberts M.F.

Although fits to Equation 1 assume that all of the SUVs have the same diffusion coefficient, the SUVs are polydisperse with a rather broad size (18Pu M. Roberts M.F. Gershenson A. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C monitors the interplay of substrate and activator binding sites.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6835-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This assumption does not cause the apparent Kd values to significantly deviate from the actual values, but does result in values for fmax that are less than one, even for computer-generated data where fmax = 1. Previously reported crystal structures of S. aureus PI-PLC show a monomeric protein with significantly different, pH-dependent conformations of a rim loop near the active site (7Goldstein R. Cheng J. Stec B. Roberts M.F.

However, in the presence of diC4PC and Mg(NO3)2 at pH 4.6, we serendipitously found that the protein crystallized as a complete homodimer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). This protein crystallizes in a variety of unit cells with very different crystal packing (supplemental Fig. S1). However, this particular crystal structure is the only one to date where the dimer is not the result of crystal contacts.

The small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-activating protein complex (SNAPc) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor that is required for expression of small nuclear RNA genes. This complex binds to an essential promoter element, the proximal sequence element, centered ∼50 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site of snRNA genes. SNAP190, the largest subunit of SNAPc, uncharacteristically contains 4.5 tandem Myb repeats. Little is known about the arrangement of the Myb repeats in the SNAPc-DNA complex, and it has not been clear whether all 4.5 Myb repeats contact the DNA. By using a site-specific protein-DNA photo-cross-linking assay, we have now mapped specific nucleotides where each of the Myb repeats of Drosophila melanogaster SNAP190 interacts with a U1 snRNA gene proximal sequence element.

https://openalex.org/W2135530334,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for maintaining a functional cell. Not only does it remove incorrectly folded proteins, it also regulates protein levels to ensure their appropriate spatial and temporal distribution. Proteins marked for degradation by the addition of Lys(48)-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains are recognized by shuttle factors and transported to the 26 S proteasome. One of these shuttle factors, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rhp23, has an unusual domain architecture. It comprises an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain that can recognize the proteasome followed by two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, termed UBA1 and UBA2, which can bind Ub. This architecture is conserved up to humans, suggesting that both domains are important for Rhp23 function. Such an extent of conservation raises the question as to why, in contrast to all other shuttle proteins, does Rhp23 require two UBA domains? We performed in vitro Ub binding assays using domain swap chimeric proteins and mutated domains in isolation as well as in the context of the full-length protein to reveal that the Ub binding properties of the UBA domains are context-dependent. In vivo, the internal Rhp23 UBA1 domain provides sufficient Ub recognition for the protein to function without UBA2."
