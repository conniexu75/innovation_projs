In an effort to facilitate such studies, we attempted to develop a means of applying conjugation techniques also, using S. typhimurium and Escherichia coli, since Baron and his collaborators1 had been able to produce hybrids between these two bacteria. We have been successful in experiments with a Salmonella culture carrying a mutator gene (mut) and a culture of E. coli strain K-12 carrying the factor for high frequency of recombination (Hfr). The mutator strain was isolated by Miyake2 from strain LT-7. Its main characteristic is a 10- to 100-fold increase in spontaneous mutability."

https://openalex.org/W2040985237,"IN an earlier communication1, we reported two sisters having the Kell phenotype K–,k–,Kp(a–b–). The parents were second cousins, and it was assumed that the sisters were homozygous for a Kell gene the product of which does not react with any of the known Kell antisera. Allen et al. 2 later gave this gene the abbreviation K0. Alternatively, there may be a deletion or suppression. We have sought for other examples of this phenotype by using the serum of the propositus of the above family by the capillary–papain method3; by this method the serum reacts with all K+ or k+ bloods. The 3,122nd blood so tested did not react, indicating that it was of the phenotype we sought. This was confirmed by testing with anti-K, anti-k, anti-Kpa and anti-kpb; it reacted with none of these."

https://openalex.org/W1994586985,"THE scheme proposed by Cheesman1, and now generally accepted, for the classification of the Musaceae depends partly on basic chromosome numbers. Two genera are recognized. The genus Ensete Horan. comprises species with monocarpic habit and 2n = 18 chromosomes. Species of Musa L. form suckers more or less freely and are placed in four sections: Musa (Eumusa) and Rhodochlamys with 2n = 22, Callimusa and Australimusa with 2n = 20. This scheme includes nicely all the species thus far described, but among recent introductions to the Trinidad collections are two exceptional forms for which the classification will need to be elaborated."

https://openalex.org/W2010215170,"IT is an established fact that part of the initial testing of new drugs involves their estimation in biological fluids from animals or patients receiving the drug. This information is required to establish dosage regimes and to study rates and methods of elimination from the body. Hitherto, the use of physico-chemical techniques such as spectrophotometry, colorimetry and polarography has frequently required a separation of the drug from interfering materials present in the biological fluid. This communication suggests that, in suitable circumstances, the polarographic method can be successfully employed without any such separation."

https://openalex.org/W2039603058,"CYTOLOGICAL investigations carried out on Theobroma cacao have revealed the fact that the incompatibility reaction in this species is based on non-fusion between male gametes and female haploid nuclei carrying the same dominant S allele1. Incompatibility pollinated cacao ovaries contain approximately 25, 50 or 100 per cent of ovules wherein fusions between the first male gamete and the egg nucleus and between the second male gamete and the polar nuclei have not taken place. In such ovules, the egg and male nuclei appear always to lie in actual contact, each preserving its spherical shape; the second male gamete and the polar nuclei, however, do not show such regularity of behaviour, for the two polar nuclei may sometimes become dissociated from one another, the male nucleus lying elsewhere in the embryo-sac or in contact with one of the separated polar nuclei."

On the basis of such data, a conclusion was drawn by investigators that protein is a necessary dietary constituent for normal storage and utilization of vitamin A. The work described here was designed to test the validity of the former hypothesis by comparing hepatic vitamin A storage in young rats fed an 18 per cent casein diet and in animals fed a protein-free diet under the conditions of controlled intake of vitamin A."

https://openalex.org/W2029560328,"THE major chemical components of a chromosome so far described are two types of protein and deoxyribonucleic acid. The amounts of the two types of chromosomal protein vary considerably between the tissues of one animal1. Deoxyribonucleic acid content is much less variable, however, and appears2–4 to be approximately constant in the nuclei of the same species. However, recent work by Leuchtenberger and Schrader5 indicates that the quantities are likely to vary in secretory tissues."

Our chief aim in the present investigation is to develop a reliable, practical and simplified method for studying the excretion of urinary œstrogens by patients with cancer of the breast."

https://openalex.org/W2091544185,"RUSHTON1 has recently suggested that the ‘red’ mechanism of the normal eye depends upon a mixture of two light-sensitive pigments, one of which is the same as that used for the ‘green’ mechanism. Marriage2 has pointed out that addition of ‘green’ sensitivity to the red mechanism in this way will not affect the position on the chromaticity diagram of the red fundamental stimulus, but will affect that of the green fundamental stimulus, and will move it towards or away from the red fundamental point."
