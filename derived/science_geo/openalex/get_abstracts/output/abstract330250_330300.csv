https://openalex.org/W1985720140,"Global warming from the increase in greenhouse gases has become a major scientific and political issue during the past decade. That infrared radiation is trapped by greenhouse gases and particles in a planetary atmosphere and that the atmospheric CO(2) level has increased by some 25 percent since 1850 because of fossil fuel combustion and land use (largely deforestation) are not controversial; levels of other trace greenhouse gases such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons have increased by even larger factors. Estimates of present and future effects, however, have significant uncertainties. There have also recently been controversial claims that a global warming signal has been detected. Results from most recent climatic models suggest that global average surface temperatures will increase by some 2 degrees to 6 degrees C during the next century, but future changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and feedback processes not properly accounted for in the models could produce greater or smaller increases. Sea level rises of 0.5 to 1.5 meters are typically projected for the next century, but there is a small probability of greater or even negative change. Forecasts of the distribution of variables such as soil moisture or precipitation patterns have even greater uncertainties. Policy responses range from engineering countermeasures to passive adaptation to prevention and a ""law of the atmosphere."" One approach is to implement those policies now that will reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and have additional societal benefits. Whether the uncertainties are large enough to suggest delaying policy responses is not a scientific question per se, but a value judgment."

https://openalex.org/W2092051516,"The current understanding of stratospheric chemistry is reviewed with particular attention to the influence of human activity. Models are in good agreement with measurements for a variety of species in the mid-latitude stratosphere, with the possible exception of ozone (O(3)) at high altitude. Rates calculated for loss of O(3) exceed rates for production by about 40 percent at 40 kilometers, indicating a possible but as yet unidentified source of high-altitude O(3). The rapid loss of O(3) beginning in the mid-1970s at low altitudes over Antarctica in the spring is due primarily to catalytic cycles involving halogen radicals. Reactions on surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds play an important role in regulating the abundance of these radicals. Similar effects could occur in northern polar regions and in cold regions of the tropics. It is argued that the Antarctic phenomenon is likely to persist: prompt drastic reduction in the emission of industrial halocarbons is required if the damage to stratospheric O(3) is to be reversed."
https://openalex.org/W2062602375,"Because sources of sulfur and nitrogen oxides distributed broadly across eastern North America have greatly overlapping zones of influence, it is difficult to determine detailed relations between emissions and the resulting acid deposition. Although substantial progress has been made in the past decade in understanding the pertinent atmospheric processes and in describing them in numerical models, because of the complexities of these processes and the wide range of the time and space scales involved, credible source-receptor relations for regional-scale acid deposition are not yet at hand. Consequently, near-term strategies for reducing acid deposition should be based on considerations other than detailed atmospheric source-receptor relations, but with confidence that regional deposition will be reduced equivalently to any reduction in regional emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2093210399,"The single-crystal elastic moduli of MgSiO(3) in the perovskite structure, the high-pressure polymorph of MgSiO(3) pyroxene, have been determined. The data indicate that a mantle with either pyrolite or pyroxene stoichiometry is compatible with the seismic models appropriate to the earth's lower mantle, provided that the shear modulus of MgSiO(3) perovskite exhibits a strong negative temperature derivative. Such a temperature derivative falls outside of the range expected for a well-behaved refractory ceramic and could result if the pressure-temperature regime of the earth's lower mantle is near that required for a ferroelastic phase transformation of the perovskite phase."
