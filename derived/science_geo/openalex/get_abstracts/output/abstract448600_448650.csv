The initial steps of this process involve very small entities—with diameters of less than 2 nanometers—which have been difficult to observe. Kulmala et al. (p. 943 ; see the Perspective by Andreae ) developed a sensitive observational protocol that allows these tiny seeds to be detected and counted, and they mapped out the process of aerosol formation in detail."
https://openalex.org/W2169515956,"Foreign particles and cells are cleared from the body by phagocytes that must also recognize and avoid clearance of ""self"" cells. The membrane protein CD47 is reportedly a ""marker of self"" in mice that impedes phagocytosis of self by signaling through the phagocyte receptor CD172a. Minimal ""Self"" peptides were computationally designed from human CD47 and then synthesized and attached to virus-size particles for intravenous injection into mice that express a CD172a variant compatible with hCD47. Self peptides delay macrophage-mediated clearance of nanoparticles, which promotes persistent circulation that enhances dye and drug delivery to tumors. Self-peptide affinity for CD172a is near the optimum measured for human CD172a variants, and Self peptide also potently inhibits nanoparticle uptake mediated by the contractile cytoskeleton. The reductionist approach reveals the importance of human Self peptides and their utility in enhancing drug delivery and imaging."

(p. 961 ) calculated the impact of intensifying ART on the life expectancy of people living in rural KwaZulu Natal. The dates of death were collected from a population of about 100,000 people during 2000–2011: Four years before and 8 years after the scaling up of ART. Life expectancy of adults increased by more than 11 years after ART was expanded, and the economic value of the lifetimes gained were calculated to far exceed the cost of treatment. Tanser et al. (p. 966 ) followed nearly 17,000 HIV-uninfected individuals in KwaZulu-Natal over an 8-year period. Holding other HIV risk factors constant, individual HIV acquisition risk declined significantly with increasing ART coverage of HIV-infected people."
https://openalex.org/W1985839444,"Water Flowing Underground In addition to serving as an out-of-sight, yet much-needed water source, groundwater influences ecosystems on land—especially when the groundwater depth is shallow. Fan et al. (p. 940 ) used government archives and published studies to construct a global map of groundwater depth based on over 1,000,000 direct well measurements. A groundwater model was then used to construct a continuous global map of groundwater depth. The findings reveal the global influence of sea level and climate on groundwater depths across several regions and ecosystems."

Although protein factors and DNA elements involved in pausing have been identified, the post-initiation events that lead to pausing are poorly understood. Kwak et al. (p. 950 ) present an approach, termed PRO-seq, for monitoring the position of actively transcribing RNA polymerase with single-nucleotide precision. The approach was used to explore the mechanism of promoter proximal pausing and showed that precise positioning between core promoter elements and the pause site is critical. The findings show how the promoter dictates transcriptional pausing and detects the preferential localization of active transcription complexes within the genome."

https://openalex.org/W2044643945,"Emerging evidence indicates that exosomes play a key role in tumor-host cross-talk and that exosome secretion, composition, and functional capacity are altered as tumors progress to an aggressive phenotype. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate these changes. Heparanase is an enzyme whose expression is up-regulated as tumors become more aggressive and is associated with enhanced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We have discovered that in human cancer cells (myeloma, lymphoblastoid, and breast cancer), when expression of heparanase is enhanced or when tumor cells are exposed to exogenous heparanase, exosome secretion is dramatically increased. Heparanase enzyme activity is required for robust enhancement of exosome secretion because enzymatically inactive forms of heparanase, even when present in high amounts, do not dramatically increase exosome secretion. Heparanase also impacts exosome protein cargo as reflected by higher levels of syndecan-1, VEGF, and hepatocyte growth factor in exosomes secreted by heparanase-high expressing cells as compared with heparanase-low expressing cells. In functional assays, exosomes from heparanase-high cells stimulated spreading of tumor cells on fibronectin and invasion of endothelial cells through extracellular matrix better than did exosomes secreted by heparanase-low cells. These studies reveal that heparanase helps drive exosome secretion, alters exosome composition, and facilitates production of exosomes that impact both tumor and host cell behavior, thereby promoting tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W2074388351,"Hosts have numerous defenses against parasites, of which behavioral immune responses are an important but underappreciated component. Here we describe a behavioral immune response that Drosophila melanogaster uses against endoparasitoid wasps. We found that when flies see wasps, they switch to laying eggs in alcohol-laden food sources that protect hatched larvae from infection. This change in oviposition behavior, mediated by neuropeptide F, is retained long after wasps are removed. Flies respond to diverse female larval endoparasitoids but not to males or pupal endoparasitoids, showing that they maintain specific wasp search images. Furthermore, the response evolved multiple times across the genus Drosophila. Our data reveal a behavioral immune response based on anticipatory medication of offspring and outline a nonassociative memory paradigm based on innate parasite recognition by the host."
https://openalex.org/W2044400597,"Arsenic Makes a Difference A quantum critical point (QCP) occurs when quantum fluctuations, which do not go away even at absolute zero, cause a gradual (so-called second order) phase change. QCPs have been observed in ferromagnets, but for ferromagnetic metals, the evidence is less clear-cut and it is thought that, as the temperature is lowered, another order—such as superconductivity—will prevent the formation of a QCP. However, Steppke et al. (p. 933 ), using specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements, found strong evidence for a QCP in a quasi–one-dimensional heavy fermion material, YbNi 4 (P 1− x As x ) 2 , near an Arsenic substitution level of about 10%. The results present a challenge to theories about quantum criticality in ferromagnets."

https://openalex.org/W2090854355,"Bacterial lipoproteins are the most potent microbial agonists for the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) subfamily, and this pattern recognition event induces cellular activation, leading to host immune responses. Triacylated bacterial lipoproteins coordinately bind TLR1 and TLR2, resulting in a stable ternary complex that drives intracellular signaling. The sensitivity of TLR-expressing cells to lipoproteins is greatly enhanced by two lipid-binding serum proteins known as lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14); however, the physical mechanism that underlies this increased sensitivity is not known. To address this, we measured the ability of LBP and sCD14 to drive ternary complex formation between soluble extracellular domains of TLR1 and TLR2 and a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide agonist. Importantly, addition of substoichiometric amounts of either LBP or sCD14 significantly enhanced formation of a TLR1·TLR2 lipopeptide ternary complex as measured by size exclusion chromatography. However, neither LBP nor sCD14 was physically associated with the final ternary complex. Similar results were obtained using outer surface protein A (OspA), a naturally occurring triacylated lipoprotein agonist from Borrelia burgdorferi. Activation studies revealed that either LBP or sCD14 sensitized TLR-expressing cells to nanogram levels of either the synthetic lipopeptide or OspA lipoprotein agonist. Together, our results show that either LBP or sCD14 can drive ternary complex formation and TLR activation by acting as mobile carriers of triacylated lipopeptides or lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1988244669,"Dentin tissue is derived from mesenchymal cells induced into the odontoblast lineage. The differentiation of odontoblasts is a complex process regulated by several transcriptional factor signaling transduction pathways. However, post-translational regulation of these factors during dentinogenesis remains unclear. To further explore the mechanisms, we investigated the role of microRNA (miRNA) during odontoblast differentiation. We profiled the miRNA expression pattern during mouse odontoblast differentiation using a microarray assay and identified that miR-145 and miR-143 were down-regulated during this process. In situ hybridization verified that the two miRNAs were gradually decreased during mouse odontoblast differentiation. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments revealed that down-regulation of miR-145 and miR-143 could promote odontoblast differentiation and increased Dspp and Dmp1 expression in mouse primary dental pulp cells and vice versa. We found that miR-145 and miR-143 controlled odontoblast differentiation through several mechanisms. First, KLF4 and OSX bind to their motifs in Dspp and Dmp1 gene promoters and up-regulate their transcription thereby inducing odontoblast differentiation. The miR-145 binds to the 3′-UTRs of Klf4 and Osx genes, inhibiting their expression. Second, KLF4 repressed miR-143 transcription by binding to its motifs in miR-143 regulatory regions as detected by ChIP assay and dual luciferase reporter assay. Third, miR-143 regulates odontoblast differentiation in part through miR-145 pathway. Taken together, we for the first time showed that the miR-143 and miR-145 controlled odontoblast differentiation and dentin formation through KLF4 and OSX transcriptional factor signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2011896456,"Invertase is an enzyme that is widely distributed among plants and microorganisms and that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose into glucose and fructose. Despite the important physiological role of Saccharomyces invertase (SInv) and the historical relevance of this enzyme as a model in early biochemical studies, its structure had not yet been solved. We report here the crystal structure of recombinant SInv at 3.3 Å resolution showing that the enzyme folds into the catalytic β-propeller and β-sandwich domains characteristic of GH32 enzymes. However, SInv displays an unusual quaternary structure. Monomers associate in two different kinds of dimers, which are in turn assembled into an octamer, best described as a tetramer of dimers. Dimerization plays a determinant role in substrate specificity because this assembly sets steric constraints that limit the access to the active site of oligosaccharides of more than four units. Comparative analysis of GH32 enzymes showed that formation of the SInv octamer occurs through a β-sheet extension that seems unique to this enzyme. Interaction between dimers is determined by a short amino acid sequence at the beginning of the β-sandwich domain. Our results highlight the role of the non-catalytic domain in fine-tuning substrate specificity and thus supplement our knowledge of the activity of this important family of enzymes. In turn, this gives a deeper insight into the structural features that rule modularity and protein-carbohydrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2028284381,"Activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) ameliorates glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in obese mice. The recently discovered fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hepatocyte-derived hormone that restores glucose and lipid homeostasis in obesity-induced diabetes. However, whether hepatic RAR is linked to FGF21 in the control of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis remains elusive. Here we identify FGF21 as a direct target gene of RARβ. The gene transcription of Fgf21 is increased by the RAR agonist RA and by overexpression of RARα and RARβ, but it is unaffected by RARγ in HepG2 cells. Promoter deletion analysis characterizes a putative RA-responsive element (RARE) primarily located in the 5'-flanking region of the Fgf21 gene. Disruption of the RARE sequence abolishes RA responsiveness. In vivo adenoviral overexpression of RARβ in the liver enhances production and secretion of FGF21, which in turn promotes hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis and ultimately leads to increased energy expenditure in mice. The metabolic effects of RA or RARβ are mimicked by FGF21 overexpression and largely abolished by FGF21 knockdown. Moreover, hepatic RARβ is bound to the putative RAREs of the Fgf21 promoter in a fasting-inducible manner in vivo, which contributes to FGF21 induction and the metabolic adaptation to prolonged fasting. In addition to other nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and retinoic acid receptor-related receptor α, RAR may act as a novel component to induce hepatic FGF21 in the regulation of lipid metabolism. The hepatic RAR-FGF21 pathway may represent a potential drug target for treating metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1997956087,"Although plants contain substantial amounts of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), the enzymes responsible for AGP glycosylation are largely unknown. Bioinformatics indicated that AGP galactosyltransferases (GALTs) are members of the carbohydrate-active enzyme glycosyltransferase (GT) 31 family (CAZy GT31) involved in N- and O-glycosylation. Six Arabidopsis GT31 members were expressed in Pichia pastoris and tested for enzyme activity. The At4g21060 gene (named AtGALT2) was found to encode activity for adding galactose (Gal) to hydroxyproline (Hyp) in AGP protein backbones. AtGALT2 specifically catalyzed incorporation of [14C]Gal from UDP-[14C]Gal to Hyp of model substrate acceptors having AGP peptide sequences, consisting of non-contiguous Hyp residues, such as (Ala-Hyp) repetitive units exemplified by chemically synthesized (AO)7 and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride-deglycosylated d(AO)51. Microsomal preparations from Pichia cells expressing AtGALT2 incorporated [14C]Gal to (AO)7, and the resulting product co-eluted with (AO)7 by reverse-phase HPLC. Acid hydrolysis of the [14C]Gal-(AO)7 product released 14C-radiolabel as Gal only. Base hydrolysis of the [14C]Gal-(AO)7 product released a 14C-radiolabeled fragment that co-eluted with a Hyp-Gal standard after high performance anion-exchange chromatography fractionation. AtGALT2 is specific for AGPs because substrates lacking AGP peptide sequences did not act as acceptors. Moreover, AtGALT2 uses only UDP-Gal as the substrate donor and requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for high activity. Additional support that AtGALT2 encodes an AGP GALT was provided by two allelic AtGALT2 knock-out mutants, which demonstrated lower GALT activities and reductions in β-Yariv-precipitated AGPs compared with wild type plants. Confocal microscopic analysis of fluorescently tagged AtGALT2 in tobacco epidermal cells indicated that AtGALT2 is probably localized in the endomembrane system consistent with its function.

Biofilms are an increasing environmental and healthcare issue, causing problems ranging from the biofouling of ocean-going vessels, to dental plaque, infections of the urinary tract, and contamination of medical instruments such as catheters. A complete understanding of biofilm formation therefore requires knowledge of the regulatory pathways underpinning its formation so that effective intervention strategies can be determined. The master regulator that determines whether the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis switches from a free-living, planktonic lifestyle to form a biofilm is called SinR. The activity of SinR, a transcriptional regulator, is controlled by its antagonists, SinI, SlrA, and SlrR. The interaction of these four proteins forms a switch, which determines whether or not SinR can inhibit biofilm formation by its repression of a number of extracellular matrix-associated operons. To determine the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions at the heart of this epigenetic switch, we have analyzed the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions by isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance. We also present the crystal structure of SinR in complex with DNA, revealing the molecular basis of base-specific DNA recognition by SinR and suggesting that the most effective means of transcriptional control occurs by the looping of promoter DNA. The structural analysis also enables predictions about how SinR activity is controlled by its interaction with its antagonists.

The Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis has evolved a number of adaptive responses to meet the various challenges posed by changes in its environment. In addition to the free-living, motile form most commonly found in liquid media, B. subtilis can differentiate under conditions of nutrient starvation to form spores, a dormant cell type highly resistant to extremes of heat, pH, and salt. Alternatively, B. subtilis can form a biofilm, a lifestyle more commonly associated with microorganisms in their natural environments (1Davey M.E. O'toole G.A.

Biofilm formation as microbial development.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). A biofilm is an architecturally complex community of microorganisms that is attached to surfaces by an extracellular matrix of exopolysaccharide, protein, and DNA (3Sutherland I.W.

Tolker-Nielsen T. Ragas P.C. Mattick J.S. Extracellular DNA required for bacterial biofilm formation.Science. 2002; 295: 1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Biofilms are found in an array of environmental niches, including the hulls of ocean-going vessels, medical instruments, catheters, teeth, and the urinary tract. Biofilms are thus a societal problem of significant magnitude. The propensity for wild isolates of B. subtilis to form biofilms was discovered only quite recently (5Branda S.S. González-Pastor J.E.

The B. subtilis biofilm is a complex community of bacteria with multiple, different specializations. For instance, some members of the biofilm are dedicated to excreting the extracellular matrix that holds the biofilm together, whereas others are fated to sporulate and are typically located at the end of tongue like protrusions, similar to the fruiting bodies of the myxobacteria or fungi (5Branda S.S.

Although multiple gene products are necessary for biofilm development in B. subtilis, the decision to switch from a free-living, planktonic state to a sessile, biofilm forming state is governed by SinR, the master regulator of biofilm formation (6Margot P.

For instance, SinR is constitutively expressed at low levels throughout growth, whereas SinI is expressed at low levels during vegetative growth and at higher levels during sporulation because it is under the control of the sporulation response regulator, Spo0A (15Gaur N.K.

Bistability and biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), leading to biofilm formation. It has been proposed that these high SinI-expressing cells go on to become specialized for the production of the biofilm matrix for the entire community (17Chai Y. Chu F. Kolter R. Losick R. Bistability and biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The SinR-SinI switch is made yet more complex by SlrR (18Chu F. Kearns D.B. McLoon A. Chai Y. Kolter R. Losick R. A novel regulatory protein governing biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), a transcriptional regulator that contains regions of homology to both SinR and SinI. slrR is located immediately adjacent to epsA on the B. subtilis chromosome, and thus its expression is under direct negative control by SinR. The repression is relieved when SinR is inhibited by SinI (18Chu F. Kearns D.B. McLoon A. Chai Y. Kolter R. Losick R. A novel regulatory protein governing biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). SlrR binds to SinR, and this complex represses genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis and cell separation (19Kobayashi K. SlrR/SlrA controls the initiation of biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Chai Y. Norman T. Kolter R. Losick R. An epigenetic switch governing daughter cell separation in Bacillus subtilis.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SlrR expression is controlled by SinR; the SinR-SlrR complex no longer represses SlrR expression, thus creating a self-reinforcing double-negative feedback loop. Finally, SlrA is an additional SinR antagonist that is homologous to SinI (19Kobayashi K. SlrR/SlrA controls the initiation of biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Pulldown assays have indicated that a tight complex could be formed between SinR and SlrA that antagonized the DNA binding properties of SinR (9Chai Y. Kolter R. Losick R. Paralogous antirepressors acting on the master regulator for biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but no quantitative data are available for this complex. Although SlrA was initially described as an activator of SlrR (19Kobayashi K. SlrR/SlrA controls the initiation of biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it would seem that SlrR antagonizes SlrA, forming part of a negative feedback loop that alleviates the effects of SlrA (9Chai Y. Kolter R. Losick R. Paralogous antirepressors acting on the master regulator for biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The complex interplay between these transcription factors and their antagonists, as well as the feedback loops created by these interactions, explains how B. subtilis adapts to challenging environmental conditions (Fig. 1). Cells either develop motility, with the aim of moving to a better environment, or become sessile and cooperate with other cells to form a biofilm. To understand the nature of the SinR-SinI complex at the heart of this epigenetic switch, the crystal structure of the SinR-SinI complex was solved previously (14Lewis R.J. Brannigan J.A. Offen W.A. Smith I. Wilkinson A.J. An evolutionary link between sporulation and prophage induction in the structure of a repressor:anti-repressor complex.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of SinR (SinR1–64) resembles a Cro-like helix-turn-helix (HTH) 2The abbreviations used are: HTHhelix-turn-helixITCisothermal titration calorimetrySPRsurface plasmon resonance. DNA binding domain, whereas the C-terminal domain of SinR (SinR75–111) forms a pair of α-helices called a helical hook. The helical hook structure is replicated in SinI and is used by both proteins to drive heterodimerization (14Lewis R.J. Brannigan J.A. Offen W.A. Smith I. Wilkinson A.J. An evolutionary link between sporulation and prophage induction in the structure of a repressor:anti-repressor complex.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The structures of the two isolated domains of SinR have also been solved, confirming that SinR homodimerization occurs using the same helical hook interactions as seen in the SinR-SinI heterodimer (11Colledge V.L. Fogg M.J. Levdikov V.M. Leech A. Dodson E.J. Wilkinson A.J. Structure and organisation of SinR, the master regulator of biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The interaction between the two proteins has also been studied by analytical ultracentrifugation (21Scott D.J. Leejeerajumnean S. Brannigan J.A. Lewis R.J. Wilkinson A.J. Hoggett J.G. Quaternary re-arrangement analysed by spectral enhancement: the interaction of a sporulation repressor with its antagonist.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle laser light scattering (11Colledge V.L. Fogg M.J. Levdikov V.M. Leech A.

However, these studies have provided neither the molecular basis of the tetramerization of SinR nor an explanation of the sequence specificity of SinR binding to DNA. Equilibrium and rate constants of the various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions are also lacking, which are necessary to understand the regulation of the switch on a systems level. Therefore, to understand the hierarchy of the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in this molecular switch, we have obtained the missing quantitative data and have determined the crystal structure of SinR in complex with DNA, enabling the interactions that provide specificity in DNA recognition to be visualized. Finally, an alternative model of the SinR tetramer, as well as its implications for the looping of DNA at SinR-regulated promoters, is discussed. helix-turn-helix isothermal titration calorimetry surface plasmon resonance. For all constructs, coding sequences were amplified by the PCR with Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) using oligodeoxynucleotide primers (Eurofins MWG Operon) and B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA as the template. The CloneJET PCR cloning kit (Thermo Scientific) was used for sinI, sinR, and slrR PCR products. The fragments were then restricted with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into pET24a. The ligation product was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α-competent cells where the presence of the insert was verified by colony PCR with primers for T7 promoter and terminator regions. For slrA, the amplified fragment was digested with NcoI and SalI restriction enzymes and ligated into pET28a. The ligation product was transformed into E. coli DH5α-competent cells where the presence of the insert was verified by colony PCR with primers for T7 promoter and terminator regions. All the constructs were used for overexpression of full-length, untagged proteins. All restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, CloneJET PCR cloning kit, and DNA polymerase were used as recommended by their manufacturers, and all clones generated were verified by DNA sequencing. The final constructs were all transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein overexpression. Cultures were grown in Lennox L broth at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6–0.8, at which point overexpression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 4 h after induction, with the exception of SlrR, which was incubated at 18 °C overnight to maximize the production of soluble protein. All proteins were expressed and purified as full-length, untagged proteins. For SlrA, cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, disrupted by sonication (4 × 25 s), and clarified by centrifugation (46,000 × g for 25 min), and the supernatant was loaded onto an SP Sepharose cation exchange column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 250–750 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing SlrA were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼1 ml and loaded directly onto a Superdex 75 16/60 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column, pre-equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing SlrA were pooled and concentrated for further analysis by ITC and SPR. For SinI, cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, prior to sonication. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto an ANX Sepharose anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing SinI were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration before further purification by size exclusion chromatography as described above for SlrA. To purify SinR, cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and disrupted by sonication before the addition of concentrated NaCl to a final concentration of 1 m. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 4-fold before loading onto a heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 250 mm to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing SinR were poled and concentrated by ultrafiltration before final purification by size exclusion chromatography as above. To purify SlrR, cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicated. NaCl was added to 1 m, and the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation as described for SinR. The supernatant was diluted 2-fold before purification by heparin-Sepharose with the application of a linear gradient of 500 mm to 1 m NaCl. Further attempts to concentrate SlrR beyond 0.5 mg/ml for purification by size exclusion chromatography were unsuccessful. The SinR-SlrR complex was purified by mixing cell pellets in the approximate ratio of 2 parts SlrR to 1 part SinR before disruption and purification by heparin-Sepharose chromatography as described for SlrR. Fractions containing the SinR-SlrR complex were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography as described for SlrA. All proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE to be greater than 90% pure. Protein concentrations were monitored during purification by the Bradford method using lysozyme as the standard. Final protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. All oligodeoxynucleotides used for ITC and crystallization were synthesized on the 1.0-μmol scale and provided by the manufacturer (Eurofins MWG Operon) in the high purity, salt-free form. The oligodeoxynucleotides were used without further purification. The inverted repeat duplex for crystallography was prepared by heating the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide sequences 5′-ATTGTTCTCTAAAGAGAACTT-3′ and 5′-AAAGTTCTCTTTAGAGAACAA-3′ to 95 °C before allowing the duplex to cool to room temperature over 15 min. Double-stranded DNA was prepared for ITC by resuspending single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides in ITC buffer (20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl). The two oligodeoxynucleotides were then mixed and heated to 90 °C for 10 min, and the duplex was then left to cool to room temperature. SPR experiments were carried out on a Biacore X1000 (GE Healthcare) using CM5 sensor chips. Proteins were immobilized onto the sensor surface by amine coupling. The surface was activated by injection of 35 μl of a 1:1 mixture of 100 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 400 mm N-ethyl (dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Proteins were immobilized onto the chip using the optimal preconcentration conditions as determined by trial experiments, to an immobilized level of 400 response units for SinR and SinI and 1000 response units for SlrA on flow cell 2. Flow cell 1 was used as an activated blank control for in-line subtraction. Unoccupied groups on the flow cells were blocked by injecting 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine·HCl, pH 8.5. Interaction experiments were carried out in a running buffer of 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl and at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The high salt concentration was necessary to prevent precipitation of SinR and to suppress artifacts caused by protein aggregation. The interaction between SinR and SlrR was monitored using multicycle kinetics, and the sensor surface was regenerated between runs by injecting 50 μl of 10 mm NaOH. All other interaction experiments were performed using the single cycle mode in which interactions were monitored without the need for regeneration of the sensor surface. Binding curves were corrected, aligned, and fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using the Biacore x1000 evaluation program (GE Healthcare). All ITC experiments were performed on a MicroCal ITC200 (GE Healthcare) at a temperature of 25 °C in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl. For the SinR-SinI interaction, SinR was used in the cell at a concentration of 38 μm, whereas SinI was injected at an initial concentration of 516 μm for a total of 20 injections; the first three injections were separated by 180 s, and the subsequent 17 injections were separated by 240 s, comprising 0.2 μl of SinI for the first injection and then 2 μl of SinI for the remaining 19 injections. For the SinR-SlrA interaction, SinR was used in the cell at a concentration of 40 μm, whereas SinI was injected at an initial concentration of 400 μm for a total of 20 injections, each separated by 180 s, consisting of 0.2 μl of SinI for the first injection and then 2 μl of SinI for 19 injections. In both cases, the kon measured by SPR was used when fitting the data due to the high c value, the ratio between the analyte concentration and the equilibrium dissociation constant, (a consequence of the high affinity and relatively low ΔH). For the interaction of SinR with inverted repeat DNA, SinR was used in the cell at a concentration of 29 μm with the oligodeoxynucleotide injected at an initial concentration of 197 μm for 1 injection of 0.2 μl and 19 injections of 2 μl, each separated by 180 s. For the single site DNA-SinR interaction, the oligodeoxynucleotide was used in the cell at 142 μm with SinR in the syringe at 1455 μm for 1 injection of 0.2 μl and 19 injections of 2 μl, each separated by 180 s. Finally, for the interaction of SinR with tandem repeat DNA, SinR was used in the cell at 50 μm with the oligodeoxynucleotide in the syringe at a concentration of 500 μm for 1 injection of 0.2 μl and 19 injections of 2 μl, each separated by 180 s. Due to the low c value, the stoichiometry was fixed at 2.0 for fitting of the SinR-DNA tandem repeat data. To provide consistency between all data fits, SinR was considered to be the ligand throughout. All ITC data were fit with Origin 7 using the one-site model. SinR, in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 10 mg/ml and mixed with DNA (also in 20 mm HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl) in the molar ratio 1:1.2 (1.0 mol of SinR dimer to 1.2 mol of DNA duplex). Sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization trials of the SinR-DNA complex at a concentration of 5 mg/ml were performed with a Mosquito (TTP Labtech) crystallization robot, using commercially available screens (Molecular Dimensions). Crystals of the SinR-DNA complex grew over 1 week against a crystallization buffer containing 0.01 m ZnCl2, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 20% (w/v) PEG 6000. Crystals were cryoprotected by soaking for 30 s in the well solution supplemented by the addition of 18% (v/v) ethylene glycol before being loop-mounted and plunged into a pool of liquid nitrogen. The crystals diffracted to 3.0 Å on beamline I02 at the Diamond Synchrotron Light Source, Didcot, Oxfordshire, UK. Diffraction data were processed using XDS (22Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11218) Google Scholar); the crystals obey primitive orthorhombic symmetry and belong to space group P21212 with unit cell parameters of a = 65.4 Å, b = 79.7 Å, and c = 67.9 Å. There is one copy of the SinR dimer bound to a single DNA duplex in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.

Here, we provide evidence that SK2 channels are also located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of neuronal mitochondria. Patch clamp recordings in isolated mitoplasts suggest insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane with the C and N termini facing the intermembrane space. Activation of SK channels increased mitochondrial K(+) currents, whereas channel inhibition attenuated these currents. In a model of glutamate toxicity, activation of SK2 channels attenuated the loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, blocked mitochondrial fission, prevented the release of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins, and reduced cell death. Neuroprotection was blocked by specific SK2 inhibitory peptides and siRNA targeting SK2 channels. Activation of mitochondrial SK2 channels may therefore represent promising targets for neuroprotective strategies in conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction."

Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of the plasma membrane protease BACE2 enhances pancreatic β-cell function and proliferation, and therefore BACE2 is a putative target for the therapeutic intervention under conditions of β-cell loss and dysfunction. To gain a molecular understanding of BACE2 function, we performed a systematic and quantitative proteomic analysis to map the natural substrate repertoire of BACE2 and its homologue BACE1 in β-cells. Loss- and gain-of-function studies of in vitro and in vivo models identified specific and functionally heterogeneous targets. Our analysis revealed non-redundant roles of BACE1/2 in ectodomain shedding with BACE1 regulating a broader and BACE2 a more distinct set of β-cell-enriched substrates including two proteins of the seizure 6 protein family (SEZ6L and SEZ6L2). Lastly, our study provides insights into the global β-cell sheddome and secretome, an important prerequisite to uncover novel mechanisms contributing to β-cell homeostasis and a resource for therapeutic target and biomarker discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W2125001665,"The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB is a major signaling hub integrating metabolic, survival, growth, and cell cycle regulatory signals. The definition of the phospho-motif cipher driving phosphorylation by Akt led to the identification of hundreds of putative substrates, and it is therefore pivotal to identify those whose phosphorylation by Akt is of consequence to biological processes. The Lmna gene products lamin A/C and the lamin A precursor prelamin A are type V intermediate filament proteins forming a filamentous meshwork, the lamina, underneath the inner nuclear membrane, for nuclear envelope structures organization and interphase chromatin anchoring. In our previous work, we reported that A-type lamins are phosphorylated by Akt at S301 and S404 in physiological conditions and are therefore bona fide substrates of Akt. We report here that Akt phosphorylation at S404 targets the precursor prelamin A for degradation. We further demonstrate that Akt also regulates Lmna transcription. Our study unveils a previously unknown function of Akt in the control of prelamin A stability and expression. Moreover, given the large number of diseases related to prelamin A, our findings represent a further important step bridging basic A-type lamin physiology to therapeutic approaches for lamin A-linked disorders.—Bertacchini, J., Beretti, F., Cenni, V., Guida, M., Gibellini, F., Mediani, L., Marin, O., Maraldi, N.

https://openalex.org/W2154038782,"Following severe burns and trauma injuries, the changes of neutrophil migratory phenotype are a double-edged sword. Activated neutrophils migrate into injured tissues and help contain microbial infections, but they can also enter normal tissues and damage vital organs. Depleting the neutrophils from circulation protects vital organs against neutrophil-induced damage but leaves the body exposed to infectious complications. Here we show that restoring normal neutrophil migratory phenotype in rats with burn injuries correlates with improved survival in a classical double-injury model of sequential burn and septic insults. We uncovered that the directionality of neutrophils from burned rats can be restored both in vitro by 1 nM resolvin D2 (RvD2) and in vivo by RvD2 for 7 d, 25 ng/kg body mass (8-10 ng/rat). Restoring neutrophil directionality dramatically increases survival after a second septic insult at d 9 postburn. Survival of RvD2-treated animals increases from 0 to 100% after lipopolysaccharide injection and is extended by 1 wk after cecal ligation. Survival does not significantly increase when the restoration of neutrophil directionality is incomplete, following shorter regimens of RvD2. We conclude that restoring neutrophil directionality using RvD2 could have prophylactic value and delay lethal complications after burn injuries."

We examine possible long-range interactions between these spin-polarized geoelectrons and the spin-polarized electrons and nucleons in three laboratory experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2019413738,"θ-Defensins are ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptides found in the leukocytes of some primate species and have promising applications as antimicrobial agents and scaffolds for peptide drugs. The cyclic cystine ladder motif, comprising a cyclic peptide backbone and three parallel disulfide bonds, is characteristic of θ-defensins. In this study, we explore the role of the cyclic peptide backbone and cystine ladder in the structure, stability, and activity of θ-defensins. θ-Defensin analogues with different numbers and combinations of disulfide bonds were synthesized and characterized in terms of their NMR solution structures, serum and thermal stabilities, and their antibacterial and membrane-binding activities. Whereas the structures and stabilities of the peptides were primarily dependent on the number and position of the disulfide bonds, their antibacterial and membrane-binding properties were dependent on the cyclic backbone. The results provide insights into the mechanism of action of θ-defensins and illustrate the potential of θ-defensin analogues as scaffolds for peptide drug design."

In the present study, we initially examined miR-375 expression in the mouse pituitary gland and demonstrated that miR-375 is highly expressed and is mainly located in the intermediate lobe. Upon further research, we have shown that miR-375 functions as a mediator of the CRF signaling pathway by targeting MAP3K8 to inhibit POMC expression and transcription. These new findings suggest that miR-375 plays a key role in regulating POMC expression by targeting MAP3K8 and affects the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones by manipulating POMC gene transcription. Adult male and female (6–8 months) Kunming white mice were purchased from the Animal Institute of the Chinese Medical Academy (Beijing, China) and were raised in a controlled temperature of 25 ± 1 °C and humidity (60–70%) on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. The animal experiments were approved by the Chinese Association for Laboratory Animal Sciences. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The pituitary glands were removed and separated into anterior lobes, intermediate lobes, and posterior lobes. We also dissected whole pituitary glands, hypothalamus, brain, lung, liver, and heart and divided them into three sections per group for RT-PCR. For in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the collected mice pituitary glands were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and then placed in 30% sucrose at 4 °C overnight. The tissues were embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China), and 10-μm sections were cut using a cryostat. miR-375 ISH was carried out by using digoxigenin-labeled locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes. Mus musculus miR-375-3p miRCURY LNA microRNA detection probes, and scrambled probes were purchased from Exiqon (Woburn, MA). We labeled the LNA probes with digoxigenin using a digoxigenin oligonucleotide tailing kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) following the manufacturer's instructions. miR-375 ISH assays were carried out as described previously (34Obernosterer G. Martinez J. Alenius M. Locked nucleic acid-based in situ detection of microRNAs in mouse tissue sections.Nature Protoc. 2007; 2: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dried slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then washed twice for 3 min in 1× PBS. The fixed sections were subjected to acetylation for 10 min, followed by PBS washes. The slides were prehybridized for 8 h at room temperature, and the hybridization was carried out at 54 °C overnight. After stringency washings using 5× SSC for 10 min and 0.2× SSC for 1 h at 60 °C, the slides were incubated in a blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, which was followed by incubation with anterior lobe of the pituitary-conjugated antibody to digoxigenin at 4 °C overnight. After PBS and alkaline phosphates buffer washes, the slides were incubated in Nitrotetrazolium Blue chloride (NBT) and 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) in the dark until the prospective intensity of staining was reached. The ISH-stained sections were treated with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS and incubated with anti-POMC antibody (1:50; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG-TRITC (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 3 h. After washing with PBS for three times, the slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus, Japan) and photographed. The pituitary glands were removed and separated into anterior lobes and neurointermediate lobes from adult mice. The neurointermediate lobes were placed in sterile PBS. Preparation of the primary intermediate pituitary cells assay was carried out as described previously (35Sei C. Toneff T. Aaron W. Hook V.Y.

AtT-20 cells originating from a mouse pituitary corticotrope tumor and 293T cell line were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin streptomycin. The cells were also incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Primary intermediate lobe cells were transfected after being cultured for 48 h, and AtT-20 cells were passaged and cultured for 12 h.

Stable negative control (nc mimic) (forward, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′) and nc inhibitor (5′-CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA-3′) were used as negative controls. PKA siRNA and signal silence control siRNA duplex were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The MAP3K8 siRNA kit was purchased from RibBio (Guangzhou,China). The X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. According to the manufacturer's instructions (TaKaRa), the total RNA of the tissues and cells was isolated using the RNAiso Plus. The microRNA expression assay was based on the method described previously (36Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q.

U6 RNA was used for normalization of microRNA expression. Reverse transcriptase reactions contained the purified total RNA and 50 nm RT primer (the RT-miR-375 stem-loop primer, CTCAACTGGTGTCGTGGAGTCGGCAATTCAGTTGAGAGCGCACT; RT-miR-25 primer, CTCAACTGGTGTCGTGGAGTCGGCAATTCAGTTGAGGCAATTGC; U6 RT primer, AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT). M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) was used. The 15-μl reactions were incubated in a DNA Thermal Cycler 4800 for 30 min at 16 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 85 °C. Real-time PCR was performed using a standard Takara SYBR Premix Ex Taq protocol on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer sequences are listed in Table 1, and the conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The relative abundance of the genes was determined using the ABI PRISM 7500 equipped software (Applied Biosystems).

The Dual-Luciferase reporter genes were constructed using the psiCHECKTM-2 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and the 3′-UTR sequences of mouse Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) or MAP3K8. Their 3′-UTR fragments were cloned using an overlap PCR. The sequences were introduced between the NotI and XhoI sites to Renilla luciferase 3′-UTR. The firefly luciferase vector was used for internal reference. Constructs with mutated 3′-UTR of KLF4 and MAP3K8 were used as negative controls. The 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A total of 4 × 104 cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates. After 24 h in culture, the cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 agent (Invitrogen) with a mixture containing 200 ng/ml of the Dual-Luciferase reporter plasmid and 40 nm miR-375 mimic or nc mimic. The cells transfected with the mutation in 3′-UTR of KLF4 or MAP3K8 vectors (p-Luc-3′-UTR MUT MAP3K8 or KLF4) served as controls for normalization. When the cells were transfected for 24 h, the luciferase activity was measured by a ModulusTM II microplate multimode reader (Promega) using a Dual Luc Reporter Assay Kit (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China). All transfections were repeated independently at least three times. The AtT-20 cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm PMSF). The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the BCA assay reagent (Vigorous Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of proteins (100 μg) were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE for POMC, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, MAP3K8 and GAPDH, and the bands were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in 0.05 m TBS (pH 7.4) for 3 h and incubated at 4 °C overnight with a purified goat polyclonal IgG anti-MAP3K8 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal IgG anti-POMC (1:2500; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and monoclonal mouse IgG anti-GAPDH (1:10000; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in TBST. The PVDF membrane was then washed three times for 30 min in TBST (0.1% Tween-20 in TBS) and incubated for 2 h with an HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were washed for 1 h and treated with the SuperSignal West Pico kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) substrate at room temperature from 10 s to 10 min. EZ-ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit was from Millipore, a rat anti-NGFI-B antibody was from Abcam. The ChIP experiment was performed as our report. Input and immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified by real-time PCR using primers as follows: POMC-P1, GGAGGTTGAAGACAGAAGTGTATTA (sense) and GACTTCCTGCTGTCCATCTTGTATC (antisense); POMC-P2, TCCATTGCCCACCACAGAGCGC (sense) and GCCTAGTTCTGAGATCTTGCAG (antisense). Real-time PCR products quantified by comparison with the PCR products of a dilution series of relevant input DNA. Two algorithms were used to computationally predict targets of miR-375. They included Sanger's miRNA target database and the TargetScan database. The minimum free energy of hybridization between the target gene and miR-375 was predicted by RNAhybrid (37Krüger J. Rehmsmeier M. RNAhybrid: microRNA target prediction easy, fast and flexible.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W451-W454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Co-expressed genes with NGFI-B were analyzed by Coxpressiondb database. Results are presented as means ± S.E. single comparisons were performed by Student's t test, whereas multiple comparisons were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We detected miR-375 levels in the whole mouse pituitary gland, the anterior lobe of the pituitary, the intermediate lobe, hypothalamus, brain, lung, liver, heart, and AtT-20 and LβT2 cell lines. The results showed that the miR-375 expression level was the highest in the pituitary gland among all the tissues and cell lines examined (Fig. 1A). We also found that miR-375 level was much higher in the intermediate lobe than in the anterior lobe of the pituitary and in the whole pituitary gland. AtT-20 and LβT2 are two types of pituitary adenoma cell lines, and there was a higher expression of miR-375 in AtT-20 cells than in LβT2 cells. To detect the miR-375 amount in the pituitary, we used absolute quantification real-time PCR. The results showed that there were ∼2.0 × 1013 copy numbers of miR-375 in 0.5 μg of total pituitary RNA. (Fig. 1C) We also detected miR-375 expression in the pituitary gland by the locked nucleic acid LNA-ISH method. It was observed that the miR-375 LNA-ISH signal was much stronger in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland (Fig. 1D). miR-375 LNA-ISH and POMC IHC dual staining in the intermediate lobe were performed. We observed that the POMC IHC staining was much stronger in areas with a weaker miR-375 LNA-ISH expressing signal and vice versa (Fig. 1E). These results confirm that miR-375 is highly expressed in mouse pituitary gland and is specifically located in the intermediate lobe. These results suggest that miR-375 negatively regulates POMC gene transcription and the related hormone secretion. Because miR-375 expression was mainly localized in the intermediate lobe that primarily produces POMC, we deduced that miR-375 was involved in regulating POMC expression. To confirm this hypothesis, we transfected miR-375-inhibitors (miR-375-in) and miR-375-mimics (miR-375-mi) into the primary cultured cells and AtT-20 cells. The relative and absolute quantification of miR-375 results showed that miR-375 inhibitors dramatically down-regulated the endogenous miR-375 (Fig. 2, A and C) and the mimics sharply up-regulated miR-375 expression (Fig. 2, B and D), and these effects were not affect by CRF. Meanwhile, we assessed the effects of the miR-375 inhibitors and mimics on POMC expression in cultured primary cells from the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. The results showed that miR-375-in increased the POMC mRNA levels by ∼40% and miR-375-mi decreased POMC mRNA levels by ∼30% (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that miR-375 negatively regulates pituitary POMC expression. It is generally thought that CRF is the key factor influencing POMC expression and ACTH secretion. To confirm that miR-375 is involved in the CRF signaling pathway, cultured AtT-20 cells were transfected with miR-375-mi and miR-375-in for 24 h and then treated with 10"

In this study, we demonstrate that electron abstraction from a nearby amino acid by the excited FAD triggers further electron transfer steps even if the conserved chain of three tryptophans, known to be an effective electron transfer pathway in these proteins, is blocked. Furthermore, we were able to characterize this secondary electron transfer pathway and identify the amino acid partner of the resulting flavin-amino acid radical pair as a tyrosine located at the protein surface. This alternative electron transfer pathway could explain why interrupting the conserved tryptophan triad does not necessarily alter photoreactions of cryptochromes in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that light-induced electron transfer is a robust property of cryptochromes and more intricate than commonly anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W2019880292,"Systemic infection by the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans produces high mortality in immune-compromised people. Such infection starts with the penetration of the organism at the mucosal surfaces, facilitated by the secreted aspartic proteases (Saps) 4, 5, and 6. The functional mechanism of these virulence factors is unclear. We discovered that Saps 4–6 each contains amino acid motifs RGD/KGD to bind integrins on epithelial cell A549 and are internalized to endosomes and lysosomes. These processes are inhibited by RGD-containing peptides or by substituting RGD motifs of these Saps. The internalization of Saps 4–6 results in partial permeabilization of lysosomal membranes, measured by the redistribution of the lysosomal tropic dye acridine orange to the cytosol, and the triggering of apoptosis via caspase activation. Sap 2 and mutated Saps 4–6 contain no RGD motif, are ineffective in these processes, and a proteolytic inhibitor abolished Sap 4 activity in lysosome permeabilization. Same results were also seen for human tongue keratinocyte SCC-15 cells. Mucosal lesions from this fundamental new mechanism may permit C. albicans to enter the body and may be used to attack cells in immune defense during systemic infections. RGD-motif may also be incorporated in Sap inhibitors for Candidiasis drugs targeting to lysosomes.—Wu, H., Downs, D., Ghosh, K., Ghosh, A. K., Staib, P., Monod, M., and Tang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2029296337,"Membrane proteins interact with phospholipids either via an annular layer surrounding the transmembrane segments or by specific lipid-protein interactions. Although specifically bound phospholipids are observed in many crystal structures of membrane proteins, their roles are not well understood. Na,K-ATPase is highly dependent on acid phospholipids, especially phosphatidylserine, and previous work on purified detergent-soluble recombinant Na,K-ATPase showed that phosphatidylserine stabilizes and specifically interacts with the protein. Most recently the phosphatidylserine binding site has been located between transmembrane segments of αTM8-10 and the FXYD protein. This paper describes stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity of the purified human α1β1 or α1β1FXYD1 complexes by neutral phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylethanolamine. In the presence of phosphatidylserine, soy phosphatidylcholine increases the Na,K-ATPase turnover rate from 5483 ± 144 to 7552 ± 105 (p < 0.0001). Analysis of α1β1FXYD1 complexes prepared with native or synthetic phospholipids shows that the stimulatory effect is structurally selective for neutral phospholipids with polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains, especially dilinoleoyl phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. By contrast to phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine destabilizes the Na,K-ATPase. Structural selectivity for stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity and destabilization by neutral phospholipids distinguish these effects from the stabilizing effects of phosphatidylserine and imply that the phospholipids bind at distinct sites. A re-examination of electron densities of shark Na,K-ATPase is consistent with two bound phospholipids located between transmembrane segments αTM8-10 and TMFXYD (site A) and between TM2, -4, -6, -and 9 (site B). Comparison of the phospholipid binding pockets in E2 and E1 conformations suggests a possible mechanism of stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by the neutral phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W2014035737,"Glycosylation is an important mechanism of controlling the reactivities and bioactivities of plant secondary metabolites and phytohormones. Rice (Oryza sativa) Os9BGlu31 is a glycoside hydrolase family GH1 transglycosidase that acts to transfer glucose between phenolic acids, phytohormones, and flavonoids. The highest activity was observed with the donors feruloyl-glucose, 4-coumaroyl-glucose, and sinapoyl-glucose, which are known to serve as donors in acyl and glucosyl transfer reactions in the vacuole, where Os9BGlu31 is localized. The free acids of these compounds also served as the best acceptors, suggesting that Os9BGlu31 may equilibrate the levels of phenolic acids and carboxylated phytohormones and their glucoconjugates. The Os9BGlu31 gene is most highly expressed in senescing flag leaf and developing seed and is induced in rice seedlings in response to drought stress and treatment with phytohormones, including abscisic acid, ethephon, methyljasmonate, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and kinetin. Although site-directed mutagenesis of Os9BGlu31 indicated a function for the putative catalytic acid/base (Glu(169)), catalytic nucleophile residues (Glu(387)), and His(386), the wild type enzyme displays an unusual lack of inhibition by mechanism-based inhibitors of GH1 β-glucosidases that utilize a double displacement retaining mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2087649816,"We have studied stress-induced reversion to virulence of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in persistently infected Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) fry. Naïve fry were persistently infected with a virulent strain (T217A221 of major structural virus protein 2, VP2) or a low virulent (T217T221) variant of IPNV. The fry were infected prior to immunocompetence as documented by lack of recombination activating gene-1, T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor mRNA expression at time of challenge. The fish were followed over 6 months and monitored monthly for presence of virus and viral genome mutations. No mutation was identified in the TA or TT group over the 6 months period post infection. Six months post infection TA and TT infected groups were subject to daily stress for 7 days and then sampled weekly for an additional period of 28 days post stress. Stress-responses were documented by down-regulation of mRNA expression of IFN-α1 and concomitant increase of replication levels of T217T221 infected fish at day 1 post stress. By 28 days post stress a T221A reversion was found in 3 of 6 fish in the T217T221 infected group. Sequencing of reverted isolates showed single nucleotide peaks on chromatograms for residue 221 for all three isolates and no mix of TA and TT strains. Replication fitness of reverted (TA) and non-reverted (TT) variants was studied in vitro under an antiviral state induced by recombinant IFN-α1. The T217A221 reverted variant replicated to levels 23-fold higher than the T217T221 strain in IFN-α1 treated cells. Finally, reverted TA strains were virulent when tested in an in vivo trial in susceptible salmon fry. In conclusion, these results indicate that stress plays a key role in viral replication in vivo and can facilitate conditions that will allow reversion from attenuated virus variants of IPNV."
https://openalex.org/W2070566118,"One of the primary neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease is the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques resulting from the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. The intrinsic disorder of the Aβ peptide drives self-association and progressive reordering of the conformation in solution, and this dynamic distribution of Aβ complicates biophysical studies. This property poses a challenge for understanding the interaction of Aβ with apolipoprotein E (apoE). ApoE plays a pivotal role in the aggregation and clearance of Aβ peptides in the brain, and the ε4 allele of APOE is the most significant known genetic modulator of Alzheimer risk. Understanding the interaction between apoE and Aβ will provide insight into the mechanism by which different apoE isoforms determine Alzheimer disease risk. Here we applied alternating laser excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy to observe the single molecule interaction of Aβ with apoE in the hydrated state. The diffusion time of freely diffusing Aβ in the absence of apoE shows significant self-aggregation, whereas in the presence of apoE, binding of the protein results in a more stable complex. These results show that apoE slows down the oligomerization of Aβ in solution and provide direct insight into the process by which apoE influences the deposition and clearance of Aβ peptides in the brain. Furthermore, by developing an approach to remove signals arising from very large Aβ aggregates, we show that real-time single particle observations provide access to information regarding the fraction of apoE bound and the stoichiometry of apoE and Aβ in the complex."

In brief, hippocampi were dissected from embryonic day 16.5 mice and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen). The cells were plated at a density of 3–6 × 104 cells/ml onto coverglasses in a 6-well plate or glass-bottom dishes (35-mm dish, MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) coated with poly-l-lysine hydrobromide (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The cells were maintained in MEM containing B27® supplements, 1% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNAs were transfected into neurons at 2–4 days in vitro (DIV) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells and Neuro2A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were plated onto a 6-well plate. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into COS-7 cells and Neuro2A cells by using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine 2000, respectively, each according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neurons were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries) and 4% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer. After permeabilizing the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, they were blocked with the blocking buffer (10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h. The cells were then immunostained for 1 h with anti-MAP2 chick antibody (1/1000 dilution), anti-neurofilament-H mouse antibody (1/500 dilution), anti-Tau mouse antibody (1/100 dilution), anti-Myc mouse antibody (1/500 dilution), anti-Rab17 rabbit antibody (1/500 dilution), anti-GFP rabbit antibody (1/1000 dilution), and/or anti-GFP guinea pig antibody (1/1000 dilution), after which they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa-Fluor 488/594/633-labeled secondary IgG (1/5000 dilution). The cells were examined for fluorescence with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluo-view 1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software (CS4). Fluorescent intensity was quantified with ImageJ software (Version 1.42q; National Institutes of Health). To quantify the signals of each Rab protein in the entire neuron (cell body, dendrites, and axon) or just the axon region or dendrite region, image thresholds were set to exclude pixels that did not fall over the cell body, the axon, or the dendrites, and after subtracting the background intensity values from each image before quantification, the integrated fluorescence intensity of Rab proteins in the entire neuron or just the axon (or dendrite) region was obtained. The proportion (%) of each Rab protein in the axon (or the dendrites) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the axon (or dendrite) region by the fluorescence intensity of the entire neuron (i.e. total fluorescence intensity). Neurites were morphometrically analyzed as described previously with slight modifications (21Mori Y. Matsui T. Furutani Y. Yoshihara Y. Fukuda M.

Hippocampal neurons were fixed and then subjected to immunocytochemistry with antibodies against GFP, MAP2, and neurofilament-H (or Tau). All quantitative analyses were carried out based on immunostaining of the morphometric marker GFP. Dendrites and axons were identified based on the presence of a dendrite-specific marker (MAP2) and an axon-specific marker (neurofilament-H or Tau), respectively.

These mice had lower plasma glucose levels (60 min: 298±32 vs. 418±35 mg/dl; 120 min: 205±15 vs. 284±20 mg/dl) and higher insulin levels (15 min: 2.1±0.2 vs. 1.5±0.1 ng/ml; 30 min: 1.8±0.1 vs. 1.5±0.1 ng/ml) during intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) compared with HFD-fed wild-type (WT) mice. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was increased in Tg islets by 33%. Pancreatic asymmetrical dimethylarginine, nitric oxide, and oxidative stress levels were not correlated with improvements in insulin secretion in Tg mice. Secretagogin, an insulin vesicle docking protein, was up-regulated by 2.7-fold in Tg mice and in pancreatic MIN-6 cells overexpressing DDAH2. GSIS in MIN-6 cells was dependent on DDAH2-induced secretagogin expression. Pancreatic Sirt1, DDAH2, and secretagogin were down-regulated in HFD-fed WT mice by 70, 75, and 85%, respectively. Overexpression of Sirt1 overexpression by 3.9-fold increased DDAH2 and secretagogin expression in MIN-6 cells by 3.2- and 2.5-fold, respectively. DDAH2 overexpression improved GSIS in pancreas-specific Sirt1-deficient mice. In summary, the Sirt1/DDAH2/secretagogin pathway is a novel regulator of GSIS."
https://openalex.org/W2121121796,"Apoptotic nuclear morphology and oligonucleosomal double-strand DNA fragments (also known as DNA ladder) are considered the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. From a classic point of view, these two processes occur concomitantly. Once activated, DNA fragmentation factor, 40-kDa subunit (DFF40)/caspase-activated DNase (CAD) endonuclease hydrolyzes the DNA into oligonucleosomal-size pieces, facilitating the chromatin package. However, the dogma that the apoptotic nuclear morphology depends on DNA fragmentation has been questioned. Here, we use different cellular models, including MEF CAD(-/-) cells, to unravel the mechanism by which DFF40/CAD influences chromatin condensation and nuclear collapse during apoptosis. Upon apoptotic insult, SK-N-AS cells display caspase-dependent apoptotic nuclear alterations in the absence of internucleosomal DNA degradation. The overexpression of a wild-type form of DFF40/CAD endonuclease, but not of different catalytic-null mutants, restores the cellular ability to degrade the chromatin into oligonucleosomal-length fragments. We show that apoptotic nuclear collapse requires a 3'-OH endonucleolytic activity even though the internucleosomal DNA degradation is impaired. Moreover, alkaline unwinding electrophoresis and In Situ End-Labeling (ISEL)/In Situ Nick Translation (ISNT) assays reveal that the apoptotic DNA damage observed in the DNA ladder-deficient SK-N-AS cells is characterized by the presence of single-strand nicks/breaks. Apoptotic single-strand breaks can be impaired by DFF40/CAD knockdown, abrogating nuclear collapse and disassembly. In conclusion, the highest order of chromatin compaction observed in the later steps of caspase-dependent apoptosis relies on DFF40/CAD-mediated DNA damage by generating 3'-OH ends in single-strand rather than double-strand DNA nicks/breaks."

A genetically modified mouse model involving ablation of the CD320 gene was generated to study the effects on cobalamin homeostasis. The nonlethal nature of this knockout and the lack of systemic cobalamin deficiency point to other mechanisms for cellular Cbl uptake in the mouse. However, severe cobalamin depletion in the central nervous system (CNS) after birth (P<0.01) indicates that TCblR is the only receptor responsible for Cbl uptake in the CNS. Metabolic Cbl deficiency in the brain was evident from the increased methylmalonic acid (P < 0.01–0.04), homocysteine (P<0.01), cystathionine (P<0.01), and the decreased S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosyl homocysteine ratio (P<0.01).

Continuous intraperitoneal administration to dystrophin-deficient mdx mice resulted in a near 2-fold increase in utrophin (protein homologous to dystrophin) in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, accompanied by an improvement of the dystrophic phenotype in both adult and newborn mice (45 and 70% decrease in creatine kinase level, respectively; 14% increase in tidal volume, 30% decrease in necrotic area in limb and 23% increase in isometric force). Intermittent administration, as performed in clinical trials, was then used to reduce the frequency of injections and to improve safety. This also enhanced utrophin level around 2-fold (EC50=284 mg/ml) and alleviated the dystrophic phenotype (inverted grid and grip test performance near to wild-type values, creatine kinase level decreased by 50%). Skin biopsies were used to monitor treatment efficacy, instead of invasive muscle biopsies, and this could be done a few days after the start of treatment. A 2-fold increase in utrophin expression was also shown in cultured human myotubes. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that the drug combination acts synergistically. Together, these data constitute a proof of principle of the beneficial effects of arginine butyrate on muscular dystrophy."

Two small fragments of HIV-1 gp120, b121a and b122a, which display about 70% of the b12 epitope and include solubility-enhancing mutations, were designed. Bacterially expressed b121a/b122a were partially folded and could bind b12 but not the CD4bs-directed non-neutralizing antibody b6. Sera from rabbits primed with b121a or b122a protein fragments and boosted with full-length gp120 showed broad neutralizing activity in a TZM-bl assay against a 16-virus panel that included nine Tier 2 and 3 viruses as well as in a five-virus panel previously designed to screen for broad neutralization. Using a mean IC50 cut-off of 50, sera from control rabbits immunized with gp120 alone neutralized only one virus of the 14 non-Tier 1 viruses tested (7%), whereas sera from b121a- and b122a-immunized rabbits neutralized seven (50%) and twelve (86%) viruses, respectively. Serum depletion studies confirmed that neutralization was gp120-directed and that sera from animals immunized with gp120 contained lower amounts of CD4bs-directed antibodies than corresponding sera from animals immunized with b121a/b122a. Competition binding assays with b12 also showed that b121a/2a sera contained significantly higher amounts of antibodies directed toward the CD4 binding site than the gp120 sera.

Previously, surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have been shown to be of increasing interest in the field of microfluidics, where the refraction of a SAW into a drop of fluid creates a convective flow, a phenomenon generally known as SAW streaming. We now show how SAWs, generated at microelectronic devices, can be used as an efficient method of propulsion actuated by localised fluid streaming. The direction of the force arising from such streaming is optimal when the devices are maintained at the Rayleigh angle.

IL-10 promoter variants may affect its expression level or functional efficiency and, subsequently, susceptibility to and survival of HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx (SCCOP). We determined tumor HPV16 DNA and genotyped three IL-10 promoter polymorphisms in 309 incident patients with SCCOP. Compared with the patients with corresponding common homozygous genotypes, patients carrying variant genotypes of IL-10 rs1800871 and rs1800872 were ~2.5 times more likely to have HPV16+ tumors among patients with SCCOP. Among HPV16+ patients with SCCOP only, compared to those with the corresponding variant genotypes, the patients with IL-10 rs1800871 and rs1800872 CC genotypes had significantly better survival and ~70–80% reduced risk of death/recurrence after multivariable adjustment. Additionally, functional relevance of these variants was characterized to explore the genotype-phenotype correlation. Our findings indicate that IL-10 genetic variants may be associated with tumor HPV16+ SCCOP and predict survival of HPV16+ patients with SCCOP.

https://openalex.org/W2063301686,"All members of the EGF family are produced as transmembrane precursors that are proteolytically processed into soluble forms by disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) for autocrine/paracrine pathways. In turn, the ligand-activated EGF receptor (EGFR) induces the expression of EGF family members, so-called ""autoinduction."" However, it is not well understood how this autoinduction occurs. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the autoinduction of amphiregulin (AREG), a member of the EGF family. We found that ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure increased the AREG mRNA level by stabilization of its mRNA in a human immortalized keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. The 3' UTR of AREG mRNA was responsible for binding to an mRNA-binding protein, human antigen R (HuR), and the interaction between AREG mRNA and HuR was enhanced by UVB. Inducible knockdown of HuR expression significantly decreased AREG mRNA stability. Interestingly, treatment of HaCaT cells with an EGFR inhibitor, an EGFR neutralizing antibody, or an ADAM inhibitor destabilized AREG mRNA. In the case of ADAM inhibition, administration of soluble AREG restored the mRNA level, indicating that the stabilization occurs in a shedding-dependent manner of EGFR ligands. The HuR dependence of AREG mRNA and protein expression was also confirmed in human primary keratinocytes. Taken together, we propose a novel mechanism by which HuR regulates the stability of AREG mRNA in keratinocytes after UVB exposure and suggest that targeting of HuR functions might be crucial for understanding skin cancers caused by aberrant EGF family member-EGFR signaling."

We reported previously that the RXR-type dibasic motif in the distal C-terminal tail of an HIV coreceptor GPR15 negatively regulates the cell surface expression by mediating the coatomer protein I complex-dependent retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we demonstrate that another pair of basic residues (Arg310-Arg311) in the membrane-proximal region of the C-terminal tail plays a pivotal role in mediating the anterograde trafficking of GPR15. The Ala mutation of the C-terminal membrane-proximal basic residues (MPBRs) (R310/311A) abolished the O-glycosylation and cell surface expression of GPR15.

In this study, we found that PKD2 is the main PKD isoform expressed in osteoclastic cells.

They do this as part of the repair mechanism in response to fracture or other mechanical trauma and in response to physiological cues such as systemic hypocalcemia. Osteoclasts are derived from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Stimulation of monocytes with M-CSF and RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) directs them first toward a preosteoclast stage, characterized as mononucleated cells that express osteoclast marker genes such as Nfatc1 and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). 4The abbreviations used are: TRAPtartrate-resistant acid phosphataseDAGdiacylglycerolBMMbone marrow macrophageDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideAd5adenovirus type 5qRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRHDAChistone deacetylase.

PKD consists of three related serine/threonine kinases (PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3) that are placed in the CAMK family of kinases (reviewed in Ref. 3Rozengurt E. Protein kinase D signaling: multiple biological functions in health and disease.Physiology. 2011; 26: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). They have been implicated in numerous cell types with diverse cellular processes, including gene expression, cell adhesion and motility, Golgi-vesicle fission and trafficking, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. PKD activity is stimulated by growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters, most commonly acting as second messengers downstream of diacylglycerol (DAG) and PKC (4Wang Q.J. PKD at the crossroads of DAG and PKC signaling.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Monocytes, key lineage precursors of osteoclasts, are reported to express primarily PKD2, which is involved in their migration (5Tan M. Hao F. Xu X. Chisolm G.M. Cui M.Z. Lysophosphatidylcholine activates a novel PKD2-mediated signaling pathway that controls monocyte migration.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the expression status and functional role of PKD during osteoclastogenesis have not been directly characterized. The goal of this study was to determine the expression and functions of PKD in osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorptive activity. We found that PKD, primarily PKD2, is expressed in cells of the osteoclast lineage. We used overexpression, functional inhibition, and shRNA gene knockdown strategies to determine that PKD promotes differentiation of TRAP-positive preosteoclasts into multinucleated osteoclasts through regulation of DC-STAMP expression. Mouse primary osteoclasts were cultured as described previously (6Bradley E.W. Oursler M.J. Osteoclast culture and resorption assays.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 455: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow was flushed from mouse tibiae and femurs, treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (150 mm ammonium chloride, 10 mm potassium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 ng/ml M-CSF on tissue culture-treated plastic. After overnight incubation, non-adherent bone marrow monocytes were collected and replated onto 24-well plates in α-minimal essential medium, 10% FBS, and 10 ng/ml M-CSF for a further 48 h to generate bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Osteoclast differentiation was then stimulated by addition of 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 60 ng/ml RANKL. For inhibitor studies, cells were treated with 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or an equal volume of CID755673 or Gö 6976 (both from EMD Millipore) dissolved in DMSO to give the indicated final concentrations. Cultures were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with 0.3 mg/ml Fast Red Violet, 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX, and 30 mm sodium tartrate in acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Cells were then counterstained with DAPI and photographed using phase-contrast and epifluorescence microscopy to facilitate counting nuclei. Bone marrow monocytes were cultured on 24-well osteo assay plates (Corning). After differentiating for 5 days in standard α-minimal essential medium supplemented with M-CSF and RANKL, the cell medium was replaced with α-minimal essential medium, pH 7.0, M-CSF, and RANKL supplemented with 0.05% DMSO or 30 μm CID755673 for an additional 48 h. Cells were removed by incubation with 5% bleach for 5 min. Resorbed surface was photographed and analyzed using NIH ImageJ. Bone marrow monocytes were cultured as described above. After differentiating for 3 or 4 days in M-CSF and RANKL, DMSO or 30 μm CID755673 was added, and the cultures were incubated overnight. The following day, caspase activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was prepared from sets of three replicates using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. cDNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and amplified using iQ SYBR Green Supermix. Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH. For inhibitor studies, gene expression is presented relative to the mean expression in DMSO-treated cells. Cell lysates were prepared in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with HaltTM protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce), resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked in TBS/Tween 20 and 5% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies against PKD1 (Cell Signaling), PKD2 (EMD Millipore), PKD3 (Bethyl Laboratories), phospho-PKD Ser-744/748 (Cell Signaling), phospho-PKD Ser-916 (Cell Signaling), HA (Sigma), and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Plus chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare). Two lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs against PKD2 and a control shRNA, together with a GFP marker, were purchased from Open Biosystems and used to produce replication-incompetent lentivirus according to the manufacturer's protocols. Viral stocks were titrated by infection in HeLa cells and assessed by GFP fluorescence. These stocks were used to infect murine primary osteoclasts. Following infection, primary osteoclast cultures were stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL, and after 5 days, cells were either harvested for RNA and protein or fixed and stained for TRAP. The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector expressing full-length DC-STAMP cDNA contains the CMV promoter-driven DC-STAMP transgene cassette inserted in place of the deleted E1 region of a common Ad5 vector. The full-length DC-STAMP cDNA was cloned into the pShuttle-CMV plasmid (7Davydova J. Le L.P. Gavrikova T. Wang M. Krasnykh V. Yamamoto M. Infectivity-enhanced cyclooxygenase-2-based conditionally replicative adenoviruses for esophageal adenocarcinoma treatment.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4319-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, pShuttle-CMV-DC-STAMP, was linearized by PmeI digestion and subsequently cotransformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 with the RGD fiber-modified Ad backbone plasmid (pAdEasy-RGD). After selection of recombinants, the recombinant DNA was linearized by PacI digestion and transfected into 911 cells to generate Ad-DC-STAMP. The virus was propagated in HEK293 cells, dialyzed in PBS with 10% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. Titering was performed with an optical density-based measurement to determine the number of viral particles/ml. An identical replication-incompetent CMV promoter-driven luciferase expression vector (control virus) was used as a control vector. 5Detailed information about the procedures used to construct the RGD fiber-modified Ad5 backbone plasmid (pAdEasy-RGD) and Ad control vector is available upon request. BMMs were isolated as described above. Prior to beginning stimulation with RANKL, the cells were incubated with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 50 viral particles/cell of DC-STAMP-expressing or control adenovirus for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of M-CSF. After 3 h, the adenovirus was removed from the osteoclasts, and the cells were treated with M-CSF and RANKL plus CID755673 or DMSO. Five days later, RNA was extracted for use in real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), protein was extracted for Western blotting, or cells were stained for TRAP. Significance between groups was analyzed by Student's t test, with p values of 0.05 or less considered significant. To begin characterizing the role of PKD in osteoclasts, we determined the expression pattern of the three PKD isoforms during osteoclast differentiation. BMMs were generated by treatment of bone marrow monocytes with M-CSF for 48 h. Further stimulation with M-CSF and RANKL gave rise to TRAP-positive mononucleated preosteoclasts after 3 days and mature multinucleated osteoclasts after 5–6 days. The expected course of osteoclast differentiation was monitored by light microscopy (data not shown) and by qRT-PCR against the osteoclast marker gene Ctsk (cathepsin K), which showed a strong increase during the culture period (Fig. 1A). qRT-PCR indicated that PKD2 was most highly expressed, with a lower level of PKD3 and very low levels of PKD1 expression in osteoclasts (Fig. 1A). A similar expression pattern was detected by Western blotting, with PKD2 and PKD3 (but not PKD1) expression detected in osteoclasts (Fig. 1B). In both assays, HEK293T cells were used as a positive control. PKD kinase activity is stimulated by phosphorylation of the kinase domain activation loop at Ser-744 and Ser-748 (using the amino acid numbering of PKD1). Active PKD then catalyzes phosphorylation at Ser-916 in PKD1 and PKD2, a residue not conserved in PKD3, thereby providing a further measure of PKD catalytic activity. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in phospho-PKD Ser-744/748 and Ser-916 at the preosteoclast stage at day 3 (Fig. 1C). Together, these data indicate that PKD proteins, particularly PKD2, are present and activated during osteoclast differentiation. We next asked whether treatment with the PKD inhibitor CID755673 inhibited differentiation of BMMs into preosteoclasts. BMM cultures were stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL for 3 days in the presence of DMSO vehicle or CID755673 at 10 and 30 μm. TRAP staining showed that each treatment group contained a similar number of TRAP-positive mononucleated cells (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas staining with DAPI revealed no significant change in the total number of nuclei (Fig. 2C). Similarly, we detected little change in expression of osteoclast markers Nfatc1, c-fos, or Rank (Fig. 2D). Expression of Rank was reduced by 50% with 10 μm CID755673 (p = 0.0004), but was not significantly reduced with 30 μm CID755673. From these observations, we conclude that PKD inhibition has little effect on induction of TRAP-positive preosteoclasts by RANKL and M-CSF. To further assess whether PKD regulates osteoclastogenesis, we continued culture of BMMs with M-CSF and RANKL in the presence of DMSO vehicle or CID755673 for 5–6 days, at which point the DMSO-treated cultures showed numerous large multinucleated osteoclasts (Fig. 3A). Cultures treated with 10 or 30 μm CID755673 showed a trend toward fewer TRAP-positive multinucleated cells with three or more nuclei (Fig. 3B). The CID755673-treated TRAP-positive osteoclasts were much smaller and had fewer nuclei compared with control cells. The median number of nuclei/osteoclast was reduced upon CID755673 treatment by ∼30%, and the maximum number of nuclei/osteoclast was decreased by >50% (Fig. 3B), but there was no significant change in the total number of nuclei in CID755673 cultures (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this inhibition was not due to changes in proliferation or survival of osteoclast precursors. To further characterize the effect of CID755673 on osteoclastogenesis, we measured expression of a panel of genes involved in osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 3C). qRT-PCR analysis on day 5 showed relatively small or inconsistent effects on most osteoclast marker genes tested with the exception of DC-STAMP (a transmembrane protein involved in cell-cell fusion), which was consistently reduced, on average, by 36% in cultures treated with 10 μm CID755673 (p = 0.0008) and by 60% in those treated with 30 μm CID755673 (p < 5 × 10−7) (Fig. 3C). We observed a similar effect, i.e. impaired formation of multinucleated osteoclasts despite the presence of numerous TRAP-positive preosteoclasts, when BMM cultures were treated with the structurally distinct PKD inhibitor Gö 6976 (Fig. 3D). To further test whether the impaired osteoclastogenesis from CID755673 and Gö 6976 was due to specific inhibition of PKD activity, we reduced PKD2 expression by infecting BMM cultures with lentiviruses encoding two distinct shRNAs against PKD2 or a negative control shRNA. qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A) and Western blotting (Fig. 4B) showed that both PKD2 shRNAs produced a strong reduction in endogenous PKD2 expression compared with cells infected with control shRNA lentivirus. Subsequent RANKL stimulation of the PKD2 shRNA-infected cultures showed that osteoclastogenesis was substantially impaired, with both of the PKD2 shRNAs giving a similar effect (Fig. 4C). Suppressing PKD2 had little effect on the total number of TRAP-positive cells induced by RANKL (Fig. 4D, black bars) but decreased the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells by 60% (Fig. 4D, white bars) and reduced their average size from 0.04 to ∼0.015 mm2 (Fig. 4E). Real-time qPCR analysis showed an ∼80% reduction in DC-STAMP expression and a 59% inhibition of Ctsk (Fig. 4E). Nfatc1 was reduced by ∼20%, although this trend did not reach statistical significance. From the pharmacological inhibitor and RNAi studies, we conclude that PKD activity is required for osteoclast differentiation. The observation that BMMs treated with CID755673 and PKD2 shRNA generated many TRAP-positive mononucleated cells but few multinucleated osteoclasts suggested that PKD activity is not required until the TRAP-positive preosteoclast stage, which occurs on approximately day 3 under our culture conditions. To further define the CID755673-sensitive period, we treated BMM cultures with M-CSF and RANKL for 5 days and added or removed CID755673 during defined portions of the culture period such that all cells were exposed either to DMSO vehicle alone or to DMSO and CID755673 for the entire culture period. TRAP staining on day 5 showed that differentiation of multinucleated osteoclasts was inhibited when CID755673 was present on days 1–5 and 1–4 but was not inhibited by treatments on days 1–3 or 1–2 (Fig. 5). Similarly, inhibition was noted upon treatments on days 2–5 and 3–5 but not days 4–5. In all cases, numerous TRAP-positive mononucleated cells were detected, further demonstrating that CID755673 does not inhibit induction of preosteoclasts. As these data suggest that PKD action is required after the TRAP-positive mononucleated preosteoclast stage, we asked whether CID755673 affected resorptive activity or survival of multinucleated osteoclasts. To measure the effects of CID755673 on resorptive activity, multinucleated osteoclasts were differentiated on osteo assay plates for 5 days and then treated with CID755673 for 48 h. We observed no change in either the number or average size of resorption pits or total resorbed area (Fig. 6, A–C). To measure apoptosis, BMMs were treated with M-CSF and RANKL for either 3 or 4 days and then treated overnight with 30 μm CID755673. We did not visually note any apparent cell death from CID755673 treatment (data not shown) or any change in caspase-3/7 activity following CID755673 treatment (Fig. 6D). These data do not provide evidence of PKD involvement in regulating osteoclast resorptive activity or survival. DC-STAMP is a transmembrane protein required for osteoclast fusion (8Yagi M. Miyamoto T. Sawatani Y. Iwamoto K. Hosogane N. Fujita N. Morita K. Ninomiya K. Suzuki T. Miyamoto K. Oike Y. Takeya M. Toyama Y. Suda T. DC-STAMP is essential for cell-cell fusion in osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Because DC-STAMP expression was strongly reduced in CID755673-treated and PKD2-suppressed osteoclasts, we hypothesized that restoring DC-STAMP expression would restore fusion in CID755673-treated cultures. To test this, we infected BMMs with an adenoviral vector encoding HA-tagged DC-STAMP or a control adenovirus. Western blotting (Fig. 7A) and qRT-PCR (Fig. 7B) indicated successful expression of HA-DC-STAMP protein. Following viral transduction, cells were stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL and treated with either DMSO or CID755673 for 5 days (Fig. 7, C–E). As expected from a previous report (8Yagi M. Miyamoto T. Sawatani Y. Iwamoto K. Hosogane N. Fujita N. Morita K. Ninomiya K. Suzuki T. Miyamoto K. Oike Y. Takeya M. Toyama Y. Suda T. DC-STAMP is essential for cell-cell fusion in osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), in DMSO-treated cultures, the DC-STAMP-overexpressing virus increased the number and size of osteoclasts. CID755673 impaired differentiation of control virus-infected cells. Importantly, infection of CID755673-treated cultures with the DC-STAMP-expressing virus significantly increased the size and number of multinucleated osteoclasts compared with CID755673-treated cells infected with control virus. Additionally, we examined expression of Nfatc1 and Ctsk in these cells (Fig. 7F). In the case of Nfatc1, the DC-STAMP-expressing virus increased expression by 2.5-fold in DMSO-treated cultures, although this did not reach the level of statistical significance (p = 0.18), and in CID755673-treated cells, DC-STAMP overexpression did not alter Nfatc1 levels. Expression of Ctsk was increased upon DC-STAMP overexpression by 5.6-fold in DMSO-treated cells (p = 0.001) and by 3.2-fold in CID755673-treated cells (p = 0.03). These data indicate that PKD contributes to osteoclast fusion at least in part by promoting DC-STAMP expression. This study is the first to investigate the expression and functional role of PKD in osteoclasts. There is substantial sequence similarity between the PKD proteins and functional redundancy between family members. However, the phenotypes of knocking out individual PKD genes in mice are distinct from one another, indicating that non-redundant functions that are achieved by different expression patterns in specific cells or tissues, by differential recruitment to subcellular domains mediated by PKD interactions with scaffold proteins, or by differences in substrate specificity. Our data indicate that, of the three PKD isoforms, PKD2 is the most highly expressed in osteoclast precursors and during osteoclast differentiation, suggesting that PKD2 may play a unique role in osteoclastogenesis. This finding is in agreement with a previous report that indicates that PKD2 is the most abundant form of PKD in monocytes (5Tan M. Hao F. Xu X. Chisolm G.M. Cui M.Z. Lysophosphatidylcholine activates a novel PKD2-mediated signaling pathway that controls monocyte migration.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mice mutant for PKD2 are viable but display deficient T-cell function (9Matthews S.A. Navarro M.N. Sinclair L.V. Emslie E. Feijoo-Carnero C. Cantrell D.A. Unique functions for protein kinase D1 and protein kinase D2 in mammalian cells.Biochem. J. 2010; 432: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether PKD2 knock-out mice display an in vivo defect in osteoclastogenesis or bone remodeling. We found that inhibition of PKD kinase activity or RNAi suppression of its expression inhibited osteoclast formation, acting chiefly during the transition from TRAP-positive mononucleated preosteoclasts to multinucleated osteoclasts. Although blocking PKD impaired formation of mature multinucleated osteoclasts, numerous TRAP-expressing mononucleated cells were detected along with no change in expression of early osteoclast marker genes such as Nfatc1 and c-fos following treatment of osteoclast cultures with the PKD inhibitor CID755673 or RNAi suppression of PKD2. PKD activity is regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues within the activation loop (10Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Lost in transcription: p21 repression, mechanisms, and consequences.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 11Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. Protein kinase D signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), which enables phosphorylation of PKD substrates and autophosphorylation of Ser-873 at the extreme C terminus of PKD2 (corresponding to Ser-916 of PKD1) (12Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. Characterization of serine 916 as an in vivo autophosphorylation site for protein kinase D/protein kinase Cμ.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Notably, we detected elevated PKD phosphorylation at these sites at roughly the same time as fusion began to take place, and this corresponded with sensitivity to inhibition of differentiation by CID755673. It is not yet known which pathways mediate activation of PKD in osteoclasts. PKD is activated by DAG and PKC family members, most commonly novel PKC isoforms that are themselves responsive to DAG but not to calcium. RANKL can activate phospholipase C to generate DAG via DAP12 and Syk in preosteoclasts (13Faccio R. Zou W. Colaianni G. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P.

Invest. 2006; 116: 2869-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting that this pathway could represent a potential mechanism for PKD activation during osteoclastogenesis. The change in cellular phenotype from preosteoclast to osteoclast is achieved by fusion of mononucleated precursors to form multinucleated syncytia. This process requires several steps: acquisition of fusion competence, chemotaxis, cell-cell recognition and adhesion, and finally fusion of the plasma membranes (2Helming L. Gordon S. Molecular mediators of macrophage fusion.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 514-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). DC-STAMP is a transmembrane protein that is crucial for fusion (8Yagi M. Miyamoto T. Sawatani Y. Iwamoto K. Hosogane N. Fujita N. Morita K. Ninomiya K. Suzuki T. Miyamoto K. Oike Y. Takeya M. Toyama Y. Suda T. DC-STAMP is essential for cell-cell fusion in osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Homozygous deletion of DC-STAMP has little effect on osteoclast marker gene expression but greatly inhibits fusion of preosteoclasts into polykaryons. We found that PKD inhibition decreased levels of DC-STAMP and that overexpressing DC-STAMP rescued fusion of CID755673-treated cells. We further detected increased cathepsin K levels following DC-STAMP overexpression and decreased cathepsin K levels upon PKD2 shRNA (but not CID755673) treatment. The significance of these observations is currently unclear. Taken together, our data led us to conclude that the impairment of osteoclast formation in PKD-inhibited cells is largely accounted for by the defect in DC-STAMP expression. PKD can act to enhance gene transcription by phosphorylating class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressor proteins HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7, causing them to be exported from the nucleus and freeing target genes from the repressive actions of HDACs (16Dequiedt F.

Protein kinases C and D mediate agonist-dependent cardiac hypertrophy through nuclear export of histone deacetylase 5.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that suppression of HDAC7 acts in osteoclast lineage cells to inhibit their differentiation (21Pham L. Kaiser B. Romsa A. Schwarz T. Gopalakrishnan R. Jensen E.D. Mansky K.C. HDAC3 and HDAC7 have opposite effects on osteoclast differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 12056-12065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Perhaps PKD attenuates the repressive effects of HDAC7 by such a mechanism. However, it is not yet known whether this is the mechanism through which PKD regulates DC-STAMP expression. This study establishes an important role for PKD signaling in osteoclast differentiation. Our findings also raise a number of questions. What are the upstream signals that activate PKD activity? What proteins are phosphorylation substrates of PKD in osteoclasts? How does PKD regulate DC-STAMP expression? We hope that understanding these questions will give a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern osteoclast formation and activity in vivo and may enable novel opportunities for better diagnostics or therapeutics targeting osteoclasts and bone resorption."
