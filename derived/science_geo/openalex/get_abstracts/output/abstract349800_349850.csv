https://openalex.org/W2147429782,"The prevailing mechanism for recurrent and some nonrecurrent rearrangements causing genomic disorders is nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between region-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs). For other nonrecurrent rearrangements, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is implicated. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked dysmyelinating disorder caused most frequently (60%–70%) by nonrecurrent duplication of the dosage-sensitive proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene but also by nonrecurrent deletion or point mutations. Many PLP1 duplication junctions are refractory to breakpoint sequence analysis, an observation inconsistent with a simple recombination mechanism. Our current analysis of junction sequences in PMD patients confirms the occurrence of simple tandem PLP1 duplications but also uncovers evidence for sequence complexity at some junctions. These data are consistent with a replication-based mechanism that we term FoSTeS, for replication Fork Stalling and Template Switching. We propose that complex duplication and deletion rearrangements associated with PMD, and potentially other nonrecurrent rearrangements, may be explained by this replication-based mechanism.

Structural variation of the human genome can be associated with disease traits or represent benign copy-number variation (CNV) (Lee and Lupski, 2006Lee J.A. Lupski J.R.

Structural variation in the human genome.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 1169-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Genomic disorders are a group of human genetic diseases caused by DNA rearrangements that result in the gain, loss, or disruption of a gene(s) for which dosage is critical (Lupski, 1998Lupski J.R.

These disorders are often characterized by similar genomic features in the rearrangement-susceptible regions but represent a wide spectrum of unrelated clinical entities. The recombination mechanisms nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) have been shown to underlie the rearrangements causing genomic disorders (Shaw and Lupski, 2004Shaw C.J. Lupski J.R. Implications of human genome architecture for rearrangement-based disorders: the genomic basis of disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: R57-R64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the former accounting for the majority. NAHR can use either region-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs, or segmental duplications) or sometimes repetitive sequences (e.g., Alu) as homologous recombination substrates, yielding recurrent events with clustered breakpoints. Much less is known about the mechanism(s) for nonrecurrent rearrangements. NHEJ has been implicated for several such disorders (Inoue et al., 2002Inoue K. Osaka H. Thurston V.C. Clarke J.T.R. Yoneyama A. Rosenbarker L. Bird T.D. Hodes M.E. Shaffer L.G. Lupski J.R.

However, a number of disease-associated rearrangements are not explained readily by either the NAHR or simple NHEJ recombinational mechanisms. To elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for nonrecurrent rearrangements, we focused on the duplications associated with the genomic disorder Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). PMD is an X-linked recessive dysmyelinating disorder caused most frequently (∼60%–70%) by nonrecurrent duplication of the dosage-sensitive proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene but also by nonrecurrent PLP1 deletion or point mutations (Inoue et al., 1999Inoue K.

PLP1 rearrangement breakpoint junction analyses reveal microhomology or a lack of homology (Inoue et al., 2002Inoue K. Osaka H. Thurston V.C. Clarke J.T.R. Yoneyama A. Rosenbarker L. Bird T.D. Hodes M.E. Shaffer L.G. Lupski J.R. Genomic rearrangements resulting in PLP1 deletion occur by nonhomologous end joining and cause different dysmyelinating phenotypes in males and females.Am. J. Hum.

Hum. Genet. 2005; 77: 966-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) characteristic of nonrecurrent rearrangement junctions; as reported in the literature, such products of recombination are consistent with NHEJ repair. However, other genomic rearrangement mechanisms requiring microhomology are also possible. We performed high-resolution oligonucleotide (oligo) array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and breakpoint sequence analyses of PMD-associated PLP1 nonrecurrent duplications. To our knowledge, there have been no such combined analyses performed to date on any genomic disorder due to nonrecurrent duplications. From our analyses, we identified the extent of genomic gain/loss and determined junction sequences in PMD patients with different-sized (∼200 kb to ∼7 Mb) genomic rearrangements. To our surprise, we uncovered interspersed stretches of DNA of normal copy number or triplicated but contained within duplicated sequence and sequence complexity at the junctions. These findings suggest parsimoniously an alternative mechanism involving errors of DNA replication, instead of the more generally considered meiotic recombination mechanisms (NAHR and NHEJ). Our model of replication Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS) can explain the complex duplication and deletion rearrangements associated with PMD and potentially other nonrecurrent rearrangements of the human genome. By semiquantitative multiplex PCR analyses, using our previously published BAC array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data (Lee et al., 2006aLee J.A. Inoue K. Cheung S.W. Shaw C.A. Stankiewicz P. Lupski J.R. Role of genomic architecture in PLP1 duplication causing Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2250-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as a starting point, we delineated PLP1 duplication boundaries effectively for all patients studied (Table 1). From the positions of the furthest-apart primers that detected a DNA duplication (i.e., primers closest to the duplication boundaries and contained within the duplicated region), we calculated the approximate size of the duplicated region(s) for each patient (Table 1) with greater resolution than possible by BAC array CGH analysis. The precise locations of those breakpoints were narrowed to within ∼160 bp to 64 kb (Table 1).Table 1Junction Analysis of Selected PLP1 Duplications from Patients with PMDPatient (BAB#)Rearrang.

Long-range PCR was attempted initially, under the assumption of direct or tandem duplication (Inoue et al., 1999Inoue K. Osaka H. Imaizumi K. Nezu A. Takanashi J.-i. Arii J. Murayama K. Ono J. Kikawa Y. Mito T. et al.Proteolipid protein gene duplications causing Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease: molecular mechanism and phenotypic manifestations.Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), on eight selected patient samples for which there was no evidence of complex rearrangement by previous methods (Lee et al., 2006aLee J.A. Inoue K. Cheung S.W. Shaw C.A. Stankiewicz P. Lupski J.R. Role of genomic architecture in PLP1 duplication causing Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2250-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The furthest-apart semiquantitative multiplex PCR primers (outward-facing relative to reference sequence) that detected a duplicated genomic sequence were used to amplify duplication junctions (Table S1 available online). Junction sequence was successfully amplified and sequenced for two patients, BAB1258 and 1264. No significant homology was found within 2 kb to either side of these junctions in the reference human genome sequence by BLAST2 analysis. For the remaining six patients (BAB1707, 2448, 1301, 1290, 1275, and 1327) for whom no duplication junction amplification product was detected, we performed genomic Southern blot analysis (Table S2 and Figure S1) to confirm junction location. Changes in the sizes of the restriction digest fragments relative to those predicted by the reference sequence were observed, reflecting (1) the addition or deletion of sequence at a novel junction, (2) the relative position of the breakpoint to the nearest restriction site, or (3) polymorphisms (i.e., RFLPs) at the restriction sites. Enrichment of novel restriction fragments followed by inverse, TOPO linker-mediated, VISA, and DOP PCR methodologies (See Supplemental Experimental Procedures) did not allow us to identify the breakpoints for these remaining six patients. We designed a custom Agilent array consisting of 44,000 (44K) oligos tiling an ∼10 Mb genomic region including PLP1, at a resolution of ∼1 interrogating oligo every 500 bp. By this analysis we determined that the majority of our patients may have undergone complex rearrangements. We found evidence for the expected simple tandem duplications as well as interrupted duplications in which stretches of duplicated DNA were punctuated by stretches of DNA with no copy-number alteration (Figure 1). Further, as observed by other groups (Wolf et al., 2005Wolf N.I. Sistermans E.A. Cundall M. Hobson G.M. Davis-Williams A.P. Palmer R. Stubbs P. Davies S. Endziniene M. Wu Y. et al.Three or more copies of the proteolipid protein gene PLP1 cause severe Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.Brain. 2005; 128: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), copy-number changes suggestive of triplicated or quadruplicated sequences contained within duplicated segments, for which the log2 (Cy3/Cy5) ratios approached 1.6 and 2.0, respectively, rather than the expected 1.0 for duplicated regions, were identified (Figure S2). These data are summarized in Figure 2. Because interrogating oligos were designed to exclude repeat-masked DNA, some coverage gaps exist for which no copy-number information could be obtained. Nevertheless, the genome resolution enabled by oligo array CGH analysis was significantly greater than that achieved previously by BAC array CGH (Lee et al., 2006aLee J.A. Inoue K. Cheung S.W. Shaw C.A. Stankiewicz P. Lupski J.R. Role of genomic architecture in PLP1 duplication causing Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2250-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and semiquantitative multiplex PCR methodologies. This analysis revealed rearrangements more complex than simple tandem duplications in at least 11 of 17 (65%) patients tested.Figure 2Comparison of Complex Genomic Rearrangements Involving PLP1Show full captionSummary of X chromosome rearrangements including PLP1 (red circle); left, patient numbers.

Figure not drawn to scale; approximate positions given in megabases (Mb) relative to PLP1. However, once oligo array CGH was performed and long-range PCR was attempted based on more refined copy-number boundary delineation, we experienced similar difficulty in amplifying across duplication junctions, except for patient BAB2448 (discussed below). Despite our high-resolution analysis, for the majority of patients amplification of the rearrangement junctions was not achieved, making simple tandem duplications improbable and suggesting complex rearrangements in these patients. Overall, our success rate (3/17 = 18%) of effectively sequencing novel PLP1 duplication junctions is similar to that of other groups (Woodward et al., 2005Woodward K.J. Cundall M. Sperle K. Sistermans E.A. Ross M. Howell G. Gribble S.M. Burford D.C. Carter N.P. Hobson D.L. et al.Heterogeneous duplications in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease suggest a mechanism of coupled homologous and nonhomologous recombination.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 77: 966-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). From our junction analysis, we conclude that the rearrangement in patient BAB1258 may be a simple tandem duplication (Figures 3A and 3B), as has been identified for most sequenced PLP1 duplications (Inoue et al., 1999Inoue K. Osaka H. Imaizumi K. Nezu A. Takanashi J.-i. Arii J. Murayama K. Ono J. Kikawa Y.

Genet. 2005; 77: 966-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further, two base pairs of microhomology were identified at this junction, consistent with NHEJ repair as has been proposed previously for PLP1 rearrangements (Inoue et al., 2002Inoue K. Osaka H. Thurston V.C. Clarke J.T.R. Yoneyama A. Rosenbarker L. Bird T.D. Hodes M.E. Shaffer L.G. Lupski J.R.

Hum. Genet. 2005; 77: 966-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By oligo array CGH analysis, we determined that there is an interrupted duplication that occurred in patient BAB2448, as there are three duplicated segments that flank smaller segments with no copy-number alteration. Centromeric to telomeric, we observed a ∼200 kb duplicated segment, followed by ∼9 kb with no copy-number change, an ∼170 kb duplicated segment, an ∼15 kb segment with no copy-number change, and finally a 20 kb duplicated segment. Overall, the duplications span ∼420 kb and appear to be complex. One junction was identified for this patient, with five base pairs of microhomology (Table S3A; Figures 3C and 3D). Visually, it appears that a DNA replication fork “skipped backward” and then “skipped forward” along the chromosome (Figure 3E), similar to the proposed mechanism for the rearrangement in patient BAB1264 (see below). The duplication rearrangement that occurred in patient BAB1264 also appears to be complex, as additional short sequences, or “junctional” sequences, were found at the duplication junction; a total of three junctions were identified for this patient (Figure 4). Interestingly, these junctional sequences (32 bp and 215 bp) were found to have 100% shared identity to regions contained within the duplicated segment. More interesting are the order and direct orientation, with respect to the positive strand, of these two junctional sequences, as graphically illustrated in Figure 4C. Visually, it appears that a DNA replication fork skipped backward along the chromosome. Two or three base pairs of microhomology were identified at these junctions. The striking assembly of unexpected additional sequences from discreet genomic positions at the duplication junction in patient BAB1264 and the complex rearrangement in patient BAB2448 are difficult to explain by either an NAHR or simple NHEJ recombinational mechanism. We reanalyzed the rearrangement of one previously published patient with a complex PLP1 deletion (Inoue et al., 2002Inoue K. Osaka H. Thurston V.C. Clarke J.T.R. Yoneyama A. Rosenbarker L. Bird T.D. Hodes M.E. Shaffer L.G. Lupski J.R. Genomic rearrangements resulting in PLP1 deletion occur by nonhomologous end joining and cause different dysmyelinating phenotypes in males and females.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 838-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For this patient, two junctions were previously sequenced, revealing two base pairs of microhomology at each with some additional unexpected sequences in an inverted orientation (discussed below). From these data, we predicted that there was at least one remaining junction to be sequenced, as the distal boundary of the deletion had not been identified yet at the sequence level. Thus, a higher-resolution analysis of this genomic region was applied. Oligo array CGH analysis was performed on the DNA of this patient's carrier mother (H150), who harbors an identical genomic rearrangement to her son. Such an analysis yields the same copy-number results, as the mother's DNA is normalized to a female control. In this family, we confirmed the deletion of ∼190 kb and also identified that it is followed by a stretch of ∼9 kb with no copy-number change and duplications (∼80 kb and ∼110 kb) interrupted by a short stretch of DNA for which there is no copy-number change (Figures 5A and 5B). Furthermore, we were able to reinterpret the junctions previously reported based on our new findings. Previously, the proximal (centromeric) breakpoint at the start of the ∼190 kb deletion was found to be joined to a 34 bp segment that normally maps ∼760 kb distal (telomeric) to PLP1, but in an inverted orientation; this was followed by another junction with a stretch of DNA of at least 5 kb in length that normally maps ∼640 kb distal to PLP1, also in an inverted orientation. Based on NCBI build 35, a more recent version of the draft sequence than that available when an analysis of patient H152 was originally published, we found that this ≥5 kb stretch of DNA currently maps ∼393 kb distal to PLP1 and aligns to the distal end of the duplication identified by our oligo array CGH analysis. In other words, this ≥5 kb DNA segment is actually part of an ∼110 kb duplication. A graphical illustration of the rearrangement for this family is found in Figures 5C and 5D. The genomic region surrounding PLP1 contains complex genomic architecture, such as abundant LCRs of different sizes (∼1–122 kb) with high sequence identity and in various orientations (Inoue et al., 1999Inoue K.

Accordingly, we sought to determine whether such complex architecture may play a role in replication fork stalling and template switching. We examined the genomic positions where the proposed template switching has occurred in our patient cohort and superimposed these locations on the regional genome architecture. Most occur in proximity to LCR-PMDs (i.e., LCR-PMDA, B, C, D, and E2), where a replisome may encounter complex architecture (Figure 6A). It appears that the proposed FoSTeS events may preferentially occur within or adjacent to complex genomic architecture that has symmetrical features that may enable cruciform structures to form, suggesting that these events may be stimulated by LCRs. We suggest that the unusual genome architecture surrounding PLP1 may confuse the DNA replication machinery, causing one or multiple replication fork stalling and switching events before resuming replication on the original DNA template. In the vicinity of these LCR-PMDs there are also various reported CNVs (Database of Genomic Variants, http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/) including duplications and inversions (Lee et al., 2006bLee J.A.

As the genomic boundaries of these CNVs do not coincide with those of the copy-number changes and FoSTeS event locations identified for the patients in our cohort (Figure 6A), and as the rearrangements were ascertained by virtue of the conveyed PMD phenotype, these patient-associated complex rearrangements cannot be explained by benign CNVs.

It is a tumor suppressor gene originally isolated from Drosophila and recently isolated from mice and humans. Drosophila or mice mutant for LATS develop tumors in various tissues. Recent studies in Drosophila demonstrate that LATS is a central player of an emerging tumor suppressor pathway called the Hippo-LATS/Warts pathway that suppresses tumor growth by regulating cell proliferation, cell growth, and cell death. Although tremendous progress has been made toward understanding the roles of LATS in tumorigenesis, the kinase substrates of LATS or downstream target proteins mediating LATS function remain largely unknown. In this study, we have provided convincing evidence that the LATS1 tumor suppressor can bind to and phosphorylate transcription regulator and oncogene YAP in vitro and in vivo. We have also identified HX(R/H/K)XX(S/T) as the consensus phosphorylation sequence for LATS/Ndr kinase substrates. Significantly, we have discovered that LATS1 inactivates YAP oncogenic function by suppressing its transcription regulation of cellular genes via sequestration of YAP in the cytoplasm after phosphorylation of YAP. Finally, by using microarray analysis, we have also identified many oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes up-regulated or down-regulated by YAP. These research findings will have profound impacts on our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the LATS tumor suppressor and the emerging Hippo-LATS/Warts pathway.

Two mammalian homologs of fly LATS, LATS1 and LATS2, were later identified and were shown to be functionally conserved as tumor suppressors by regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis (3Tao W.

Most recently, through genetic studies in Drosophila, fly LATS has been identified as a central player in mediating an emerging tumor suppressing pathway called the Hippo-LATS/Warts pathway, including several tumor suppressor genes, fat, merlin, expanded, hippo, RASSF, LATS/warts, salvador, and MATS, and an oncogene called yokie (9Harvey K.

Interestingly, mammalian homologs for all of the components of the Hippo-LATS/Warts pathways do exist (FATJ for fat, NF2/merlin for merlin, FRMD6 for expanded, RASSF1A for RASSF, mst1/2 for hippo, LATS1/2 for LATS/warts, hWW45 for salvador, MOB1A/B for MATS, and YAP for yokie), and it has also been shown that some of the mammalian homologs, such as merlin/NF2, LATS1/2, RASSF1A, and YAP, function in the same way as their Drosophila counterparts (6Yang X.

However, it remains unclear whether a similar Hippo-LATS/Warts signaling pathway exists and functions in mammals. Sequence analysis of LATS indicates that LATS encodes a Ser/Thr kinase that belongs to the Ndr kinase subgroup of the AGC kinase family. The Ndr kinase members include budding yeast dbf2/20 and cbk1, fission yeast orb6 and sid2, Caenorhabditis elegans sax-1, Drosophila trc and LATS/warts, and mammalian LATS1, LATS2, Ndr1, and Ndr2 kinases, which are involved in the regulation of morphogenesis, cell division, cell survival, centrosome duplication, and neural outgrowth and dendrite tilling (27Hergovich A. Cornils H. Hemmings B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; (Epub ahead of print)PubMed Google Scholar).

Identification of these substrates and characterization of their interactions with Ndr kinases will be crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanism of their functions. Recently, Yokie was identified as a novel kinase substrate and downstream target of Drosophila LATS. Drosophila LATS can suppress cell proliferation and cell growth by phosphorylating and inhibiting Yokie function (15Huang J. Wu S. Barrera J. Matthews K. Pan D. Cell. 2005; 122: 421-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which LATS phosphorylates and inactivates Yokie remains unknown. Recently, the human homolog of Yokie, YAP, was identified as an oncogene in breast and liver tumorigenesis (25Overholtzer M. Zhang J. Smolen G.A. Muir B. Li W. Sgroi D.C. Deng C.X. Brugge J.S.

Overexpression of YAP induced transformation of mammary cells and tumor formation in mice (25Overholtzer M. Zhang J. Smolen G.A. Muir B. Li W. Sgroi D.C. Deng C.X. Brugge J.S. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl.

However, whether and how human LATS1 and LATS2 phosphorylate and regulate YAP function remains to be determined. In addition, although YAP was identified as a transcription co-activator and oncogene in mammalian cells, the downstream genes regulated by YAP during YAP-induced transformation have not been identified. In this study, we have discovered that LATS1 can interact with and phosphorylate YAP both in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, we have provided convincing evidence that LATS1 can negatively regulate transcription regulation and transformation functions of YAP by inhibiting its nuclear translocation via phosphorylation of multiple sites in YAP. By using peptide kinase assays, we have also identified the consensus phosphorylation sequence for LATS1 and Ndr1 kinase substrates. Our findings clearly indicate that LATS/Ndr has substrate specificity similar to those of other AGC kinase members.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000U Inverted Fluorescent Microscope. Peptides, Antibodies, Co-immunoprecipitation, Protein Fractionation, and Western Blot—All the peptides used in this study were synthesized by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to Myc (Roche Applied Science), FLAG (Sigma), α-tubulin (Sigma), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were 9E10, M2, B-5-1-2, and F2, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HA (Y11) and YAP (H125) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit α-LATS2 polyclonal antibody (BL2213) was purchased from Benthyl Laboratories, Inc. Mammalian cell protein extraction, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractionation, and co-immunoprecipitation were as described (8Yang X. Yu K.P. Hao Y. Li D.-M. Stewart R. Insogna K. Xu T. Nat.

Yu K.P. Hao Y. Li D.-M. Stewart R. Insogna K. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For the GST pull-down assay, about 50-200 μg of protein lysate expressing LATS1/2-FLAG, Ndr1/2-FLAG, or YAP-HA was mixed with 10 μg of GST (control) or LATS1 or YAP GST fusion proteins on beads and incubated at 4 °C with rotating for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 1× proteinase inhibitor), resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using either α-FLAG or α-HA antibody. Lentivirus Production, Purification, Titration, and Infection—One day before transfection, 5 × 106 293T cells were plated on a 150-mm plate coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Then 7.5 μg of LATS1-Myc-WPI or YAP-HA-WPI or Mst2-FLAG-WPI transfer vector were mixed with 5.6 μg of PAX (packing) and 1.9 μg of MD2G (envelope) plasmids and 37.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was added drop-wise into each plate. The medium was replaced with 18 ml of OPTI-MEM I medium (serum-free) containing 10 mm sodium butyrate (demethylation of plasmids to increase gene expression) 20-24 h after transfection. Two days after transfection, the media containing lentivirus were collected, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and concentrated using a Centricon-20 ultrafiltration column (Millipore Corp.). For virus titration, 4 × 104 HeLa cells were plated into each well of a 24-well plate. One day after plating, 8 μg/ml Polybrene and a series dilution of lentivirus were added into each well. GFP-positive cells (cells containing lentivirus) and GFP-positive plus GFP-negative cells were then counted under a fluorescent and light microscope, respectively. The percentage of GFP-positive cells was calculated. The virus titer was calculated according to the following formula: transduction units/ml = (cell number at the time of infection) × (percentage of GFP-positive cells) × (dilution factor). For infection of MCF10A or HeLa cells with lentivirus, 4 × 105 cells were plated into each well of a 6-well plate 1 day prior to infection. One day after incubation at 37 °C, cell numbers were counted, and YAP, Mst2, or LATS1 lentivirus was then added together with 8 μg/ml of Polybrene into each well at a multiplicity of infection of 2. Two days after infection, the cells were either collected for protein analysis or microarray analysis or expanded to be used for soft agar assays (see below). RNA Interference Knockdown of LATS—A TriFECTa kit containing a Dicer substrate siRNA duplex targeting human LATS1 or LATS2 mRNA and a negative control siRNA with scrambled sequence absent in the human genome were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Transfection of HeLa cells with 10 nm siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four days post-transfection, protein was extracted, and knockdown of LATS1 and LATS2 was confirmed by Western blot. For immunostaining of YAP after LATS knockdown, HeLa cells were replated into a well of a 24-well plate containing a coverslip coated with fibronectin. The cells were subject to immunostaining using rabbit α-YAP polyclonal antibody after they were cultured at 37 °C overnight. RNA Isolation, Microarray Analysis and Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription (qRT)-PCR—MCF10A cells grown in a 6-well plate were infected with lentivirus expressing vector (control) or YAP-HA with a multiplicity of infection of 2. Duplicate MCF10A cells in different wells of a 6-well plate (biological replicate) were infected with YAP lentivirus. Two days after infection, total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to a standard protocol. To clear up residual genomic DNA, total RNA was further cleaned using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The quality of RNA is examined by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (version B/02.02) analysis. For microarray analysis, 250 ng of total RNA were labeled with either Cy3-CTP or Cy5-CTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subsequently amplified with the Low RNA Input Linear Amplification kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs were labeled, amplified, and used for microarrays as the following: Array 1, Control/Cy3-CTP, YAP-1/Cy5-CTP; Array 2, Control/Cy3-CTP, YAP-2/Cy5-CTP (biological replicate); Array 3, YAP-1/Cy3-CTP, Control/Cy5-CTP (flip color). About 825 ng of each Cy3- or Cy5-labeled complementary RNA were mixed and hybridized to a 4×44K whole human genome oligonucleotide (60-mer) array (Agilent) at 65 °C for 17 h in a microarray rotating oven (SciGene). The slides were washed and subsequently scanned on an Agilent Microarray Scanner G2565BA. Scanned images were analyzed with the Agilent Feature Extraction Program (version 9.1). YAP up-regulated and down-regulated genes were selected according to the following selection criteria. Only those genes whose transcription had changed more than 2-fold (log ratio ≥0.3 or ≤-0.3) in 2 of 3 microarrays with a p value of <0.0001 were further evaluated. GeneOntology analysis in GeneTools (available on the World Wide Web) and a Pubmed gene search were used to identify the functions of each differentially expressed gene. The SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) was used for real time qRT-PCR to quantify the level of each differentially expressed gene identified from microarray analysis. In brief, triplicates of 0.2 μg of total RNA extracted from MCF10A cells infected with lentivirus expressing vector (MCF10A-control) or YAP (MCF10A-YAP) were mixed with SuperScript III RT/Platinum, 2× SYBR Green reaction mix, and gene-specific forward and reverse primers in 25 μl. RT-PCR was run at 1 cycle of 50 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 40 °C for 1 min using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. 18 S rRNA was used as internal control of RNA amounts in each sample. The mRNA level of each gene in MCF10A-YAP cells relative to that in MCF10A-control cells was calculated as the following formula: 2-(YAPΔCt - ControlΔCt), where ΔCt = cellular gene average Ct - rRNA average Ct. The mean and S.D. were calculated from Ct values of triplicate real time RT-PCRs for each RNA sample. Kinase Assays—COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type (WT) or kinase-dead (KD) LATS-FLAG or Ndr-FLAG alone or together with Mst2-Myc were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer supplement with 1 mm DTT and 1× phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma). For an in vitro immunoprecipitation-kinase assay, 100 μg of protein lysate was mixed with 2 μg of α-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody together with Protein G beads and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed twice with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, 1 mm DTT; once for 10 min with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT at 4 °C (rotating); and twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 1× phosphatase inhibitor. The washed beads were then mixed with 2 μg of YAP-GST substrates in a kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1× phosphatase inhibitor, 2 mm DTT, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 7 μl of 5× SDS sample dye, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, stained with 1% Ponceau S for visualization of fusion protein substrates, and exposed to autoradiograph film for 0.5-2 h. To test phosphorylation of YAP by LATS1 in vivo, YAP-HA was transfected alone or together with LATS1-FLAG/Mst2-Myc into COS-7 cells. The cells were lysed as described above. Ten μg of cell lysate was untreated or treated with 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 1 h and subjected to Western blot analysis using α-HA antibody. For in vitro peptide kinase assays, the precipitated and washed beads were mixed with a 3 mm concentration of each peptide in a kinase buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mix was spotted on a P81 circle filter paper (Whatman) and washed four times with 1% phosphoric acid, dried, and subjected to cpm radioactivity counting. P81 spotted with reaction mix without peptide was used as background control. The relative kinase activity of specific peptide is calculated as the percentage of cpm for this peptide relative to the cpm for wild-type YAP-S127 peptide. Protein Fractionation and Soft Agar Assays—Protein fractionation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and soft agar assays were as described (8Yang X. Yu K.P. Hao Y. Li D.-M. Stewart R. Insogna K. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 32Yang X. Chernenko G. Hao Y. Ding Z. Pater M.M. Pater A. Tang S.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Colony numbers were counted using the colony count program in the Gel Doc EQ system (Bio-Rad). Interaction of LATS1 and YAP in Vivo and in Vitro—We first used co-immunoprecipitation assays to examine whether LATS1 interacted with YAP in vivo. FLAG-tagged LATS1 and HA-tagged YAP expression vectors were transfected either alone or together into COS-7 cells. When cell lysates were precipitated with α-HA antibody, LATS1-FLAG was found in the YAP-HA immune complex (Fig. 1A). To eliminate the possibility that LATS1 interaction with YAP is due to their high level of expression in the cells, we also examined the interaction of endogenous LATS1 with YAP in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells expressing high levels of both LATS1 and YAP. Interestingly, endogenous LATS1 was detected in the immune complex precipitated with α-YAP antibody (Fig. 1B). Next, we used a GST pull-down assay to examine whether LATS1 directly interacted with YAP in vitro. As expected, LATS1-FLAG was able to bind strongly to YAP-GST in vitro (Fig. 1C). We also examined whether other members of the Ndr kinase family in mammals, LATS2, Ndr1, and Ndr2, interacted with YAP. Like LATS1, LATS2-FLAG was able to bind to YAP-GST, whereas both Ndr1 and Ndr2 were unable to interact with YAP-GST (Fig. 1C), suggesting that LATS1 and LATS2 are the only two members of the Ndr kinase family in mammals that interact with YAP. Since LATS and Ndr are conserved only in their C-terminal kinase domain, this suggests that LATS may interact with YAP with its N-terminal domain. To confirm this possibility and further understand the molecular mechanism of LATS-YAP interaction, we attempted to map the domains in both LATS and YAP responsible for their interactions. YAP belongs to Group I of the WW domain proteins that bind their partners through their WW domains to PPXY, PPRXXP, or PPPPP motifs in their binding partner (33Ingham R.J. Colwill K. Howard C. Dettwiler S. Lim C.S. Yu J. Hersi K. Raaijmakers J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Taylor L. Yeung B. Vassilovski G. Amin M. Chen F. Matskova L. Winberg G. Ernberg I. Linding R. O'Donnell P. Starostine A. Keller W. Metalnikov P. Stark C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7092-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). LATS1 contains two PPXY (373PPXY376 and 556PPXY559) motifs and two PPPPP motifs (236PPPPP240 and 247PPPPP251) within a P-stretch region (Fig. 2A). To examine which motif is responsible for its binding to YAP, we first performed a GST pull-down assay using cell lysate expressing YAP-HA and GST fusion proteins purified from bacteria expressing a series of LATS1 deletions. Only the region between aa 526 and 655 in LATS1, which is immediately upstream of the kinase domain and covers the PPPY559 motif, interacted with YAP (Fig. 2B). Mutation of Tyr to Phe at aa 559 in LATS526-655 completely abolished its binding to YAP (Fig. 2C), indicating that the PPPY559 motif in LATS1 is responsible for its interaction with YAP. To map the regions in YAP responsible for its interacting with LATS1, we first performed a GST pull-down assay using cell lysate expressing LATS1-FLAG and GST fusion proteins purified from bacteria expressing a series of YAP deletions. As expected, only the region (aa 150-300) covering two WW domains in YAP bound to LATS1-FLAG (Fig. 2, A and D). To determine which WW domain in YAP is responsible for its binding to LATS1, we created YAP150-300 mutants with mutations that disrupt single (ΔWW1 (W199A/P202A) or ΔWW2 (W258A/P261A)) or double (ΔWW1-2 (W199A/P202A/W258A/P261A)) WW domains. Only disruption of both WW domains in YAP abrogated its binding to LATS1 (Fig. 2, A and E). In conclusion, our results suggest that LATS1 binds to both WW domains of YAP through its PPPY559 motif. Phosphorylation of YAP by LATS1—We used an immunoprecipitation-kinase assay to examine whether YAP is a substrate of LATS1 kinase. LATS1-WT-FLAG or LATS1-KD-FLAG was transfected alone or together with Mst2-Myc into COS-7 cells. LATS1-WT-FLAG or LATS1-KD-FLAG was precipitated from cell lysates expressing these constructs and subject to kinase assay using YAP-GST as a substrate. Although precipitated LATS1-KD-FLAG has no activity toward YAP-GST in vitro, LATS1-WT-FLAG can phosphorylate YAP-GST with low activity (Fig. 3A). Since it has been shown recently that Mst2, the mammalian homolog of Drosophila Hippo, can phosphorylate and activate LATS1 kinase activity (34Chan E.H. Nousiainen M"
https://openalex.org/W1963586813,"Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) in humans and experimental animals are often associated with varying degrees of spontaneous functional recovery during the first months after injury. Such recovery is widely attributed to axons spared from injury that descend from the brain and bypass incomplete lesions, but its mechanisms are uncertain. To investigate the neural basis of spontaneous recovery, we used kinematic, physiological and anatomical analyses to evaluate mice with various combinations of spatially and temporally separated lateral hemisections with or without the excitotoxic ablation of intrinsic spinal cord neurons. We show that propriospinal relay connections that bypass one or more injury sites are able to mediate spontaneous functional recovery and supraspinal control of stepping, even when there has been essentially total and irreversible interruption of long descending supraspinal pathways in mice. Our findings show that pronounced functional recovery can occur after severe SCI without the maintenance or regeneration of direct projections from the brain past the lesion and can be mediated by the reorganization of descending and propriospinal connections. Targeting interventions toward augmenting the remodeling of relay connections may provide new therapeutic strategies to bypass lesions and restore function after SCI and in other conditions such as stroke and multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2054723193,"Deviations in basal Ca2+ levels interfere with receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial function. While defective basal Ca2+ regulation has been linked to various diseases, the regulatory mechanism that controls basal Ca2+ is poorly understood. Here we performed an siRNA screen of the human signaling proteome to identify regulators of basal Ca2+ concentration and found STIM2 as the strongest positive regulator. In contrast to STIM1, a recently discovered signal transducer that triggers Ca2+ influx in response to receptor-mediated depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, STIM2 activated Ca2+ influx upon smaller decreases in ER Ca2+. STIM2, like STIM1, caused Ca2+ influx via activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel Orai1. Our study places STIM2 at the center of a feedback module that keeps basal cytosolic and ER Ca2+ concentrations within tight limits."
https://openalex.org/W2003629248,"Obesity is a major health problem. Although heritability is substantial, genetic mechanisms predisposing to obesity are not very well understood. We have performed a genome wide association study (GWA) for early onset (extreme) obesity.a) GWA (Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 comprising 440,794 single nucleotide polymorphisms) for early onset extreme obesity based on 487 extremely obese young German individuals and 442 healthy lean German controls; b) confirmatory analyses on 644 independent families with at least one obese offspring and both parents. We aimed to identify and subsequently confirm the 15 SNPs (minor allele frequency > or =10%) with the lowest p-values of the GWA by four genetic models: additive, recessive, dominant and allelic. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FTO (fat mass and obesity associated gene) within one linkage disequilibrium (LD) block including the GWA SNP rendering the lowest p-value (rs1121980; log-additive model: nominal p = 1.13 x 10(-7), corrected p = 0.0494; odds ratio (OR)(CT) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-2.27; OR(TT) 2.76, 95% CI 1.88-4.03) belonged to the 15 SNPs showing the strongest evidence for association with obesity. For confirmation we genotyped 11 of these in the 644 independent families (of the six FTO SNPs we chose only two representing the LD bock). For both FTO SNPs the initial association was confirmed (both Bonferroni corrected p<0.01). However, none of the nine non-FTO SNPs revealed significant transmission disequilibrium.Our GWA for extreme early onset obesity substantiates that variation in FTO strongly contributes to early onset obesity. This is a further proof of concept for GWA to detect genes relevant for highly complex phenotypes. We concurrently show that nine additional SNPs with initially low p-values in the GWA were not confirmed in our family study, thus suggesting that of the best 15 SNPs in the GWA only the FTO SNPs represent true positive findings."

https://openalex.org/W2029387074,"The Pou domain containing transcription factor Oct4 is a well-established regulator of pluripotency in the inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocyst as well as in embryonic stem cells. While it has been shown that the Oct4 gene is inactivated through a series of epigenetic modifications following implantation, recent studies have detected Oct4 activity in a variety of somatic stem cells and tumor cells. Based on these observations it has been suggested that Oct4 may also function in maintaining self-renewal of somatic stem cells and, in addition, may promote tumor formation. We employed a genetic approach to determine whether Oct4 is important for maintaining pluripotency in the stem cell compartments of several somatic tissues, including the intestinal epithelium, bone marrow (hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages), hair follicle, brain, and liver. Oct4 gene ablation in these tissues revealed no abnormalities in homeostasis or regenerative capacity. We conclude that Oct4 is dispensable for both self-renewal and maintenance of somatic stem cells in the adult mammal.

The transcriptional regulator Oct4 is a Pou domain containing protein expressed in pluripotent embryonic cells and cells of the germline where its inactivation results in loss of pluripotency and apoptosis, respectively (Kehler et al., 2004Kehler J.

Upon induction of differentiation, the Oct4 locus undergoes a series of repressive epigenetic modifications mediated by the histone methyltransferase G9a and the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a/b (Feldman et al., 2006Feldman N. Gerson A. Fang J. Li E. Zhang Y. Shinkai Y. Cedar H. Bergman Y. G9a-mediated irreversible epigenetic inactivation of Oct-3/4 during early embryogenesis.Nat.

Recent studies have, however, shown that Oct4 is active in a variety of somatic stem cell compartments and in cultured multipotent somatic progenitor cells, where it has been suggested to function in a manner analogous to its role in ES cells (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Consistent with this possibility is the observation that ectopic expression of Oct4 in mice harboring a single-copy, doxycycline-inducible transgene is sufficient to prevent differentiation of intestinal epithelium while concomitantly stimulating expansion of the progenitor cell compartment (Hochedlinger et al., 2005Hochedlinger K.

In addition to these tissues, a number of studies have reported Oct4 expression in primary tumors, transformed cells, amniotic fluid, and umbilical cord blood (see Table S1 for references). Given its expression in a variety of normal tissues and transformed cells, it has been suggested that Oct4 may not only be crucial for the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic cells but may also play an important role for the self-renewal of somatic stem cells and in maintaining tissue homeostasis. The goal of the current study was to test this hypothesis by deleting Oct4 from somatic stem cell compartments in vivo. To investigate a possible function of Oct4 expression in somatic cells, we used a Cre-lox based recombination approach to achieve tissue-specific inactivation of a conditional Oct4 allele (Oct4-2lox, Figure 1A) (Kehler et al., 2004Kehler J. Tolkunova E. Koschorz B. Pesce M. Gentile L. Boiani M. Lomeli H. Nagy A. McLaughlin K.J. Scholer H.R. Tomilin A. Oct4 is required for primordial germ cell survival.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Oct4-2lox mice were crossed to mice carrying tissue-specific or inducible Cre transgenes to inactivate Oct4 in organs that have a well-defined somatic stem cell population. We deleted Oct4 in the intestine, bone marrow, brain, liver, and hair follicles because Oct4 expression has previously been documented in these tissues (Table S1). The Cre transgenes that were used to achieve cell-type-specific deletion of Oct4 in these tissues are described in Table 1.Table 1Cre-Expressing Mouse Lines Used for Tissue-Specific Oct4 DeletionCre Transgene/Affected TissueTemporal Induction of Oct4 ExcisionExcision EfficiencyVillin-CreER/intestinal epitheliumTamoxifen inducible∼100% (el Marjou et al., 2004el Marjou F.

Recombination of the Oct4-2lox allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Weight gain was monitored in adult mice for a period of 9 months, with no differences observed between control (Oct41lox/+, transgenic) and Oct4 mutant (Oct41lox/1lox, transgenic) mice (Figure S1). Histological analysis revealed a normal tissue architecture containing differentiated cell types (Paneth and goblet cells), a normal distribution of proliferating cells marked by Ki67 expression, and an absence of any Oct4-positive cells in the crypts (Figure S1). In order to test the regenerative capacity of intestinal crypt progenitor cells in the absence of Oct4, mice were subjected to a 14 Gy dose of γ irradiation. This resulted in widespread apoptosis and cell death coupled with a growth arrest within 3 days. Five days after γ irradiation, intestinal progenitor cells became highly proliferative in the presence or absence of Oct4, giving rise to new crypts that reestablished a normal intestinal epithelium by the eighth day after irradiation (Figures 1C–1E). In order to exclude the possibility that a small number of progenitor cells escaped recombination and were responsible for the observed regeneration and maintenance of the intestinal epithelium, we performed PCR analysis of the Oct4 genomic locus. This analysis revealed no evidence of nonrecombined Oct4-2lox alleles in the newly generated tissue (Figure 1F). Finally, we examined Oct4 gene expression throughout the time course of epithelial recovery after irradiation and found little to no Oct4 mRNA. Oct4 expression in the intestine was found to be 105 times lower in comparison to ES cells (Figure 1G). Further purification of crypt progenitor cells by EDTA-based fractionation of intestinal epithelium followed by gene expression analysis revealed no preference for Oct4 expression at the base of the crypt (Figure S1). These findings indicate that Oct4 function is not required for maintenance of the intestinal stem cell niche. In order to examine the effects of Oct4 deletion in the bone marrow, we employed an interferon-inducible Mx1-Cre transgene (Table 1) (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, Schneider et al., 2003Schneider A. Zhang Y. Guan Y. Davis L.S.

Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: F411-F417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We confirmed that activation of Mx1-Cre resulted in 100% recombination in the whole marrow by PCR analysis (Figure 2A). Subsequent separation of mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells confirmed recombination in both cell lineages (data not shown). MSCs known to give rise to cells of chondrogenic, adipogenic, myogenic, and osteogenic lineages (Keating, 2006Keating A. Mesenchymal stromal cells.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) were derived from both control and mutant bone marrow. These cells, as well as multipotent subpopulations of MSCs, have been the most frequently cited source of Oct4 expression in somatic tissues (Table S1). The proliferative capacity and potential for lineage commitment of MSCs were addressed using in vitro colony formation assays, osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation assays. Individual MSCs derived from both control and Oct4 mutant MSCs were able to proliferate to form clonal colonies (Figure 2B). Upon reaching confluence, these cells underwent osteogenic differentiation in the presence of ascorbic acid and inorganic phosphate, forming multilayered nodules containing mineralized extracellular matrix hallmarks of mature osteoblasts (Figure 2D). No Oct4-positive cells were observed during colony formation (Figure 2C). Gene expression analysis throughout the time course of osteogenic lineage commitment revealed no significant Oct4 gene activity in whole marrow, proliferating MSCs, or in differentiated osteoblasts (Figure 2E). Similarly, Oct4 mutant MSCs were able to activate Sox9 gene expression and enter the chondrogenic lineage in BMP-treated micromass cultures (Figure 2F and Figure S2). Oct4 function was addressed in the well-defined HSC (Kondo et al., 2003Kondo M. Wagers A.J. Manz M.G. Prohaska S.S. Scherer D.C. Beilhack G.F. Shizuru J.A. Weissman I.L. Biology of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors: implications for clinical application.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 759-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Examination of the peripheral blood circulation of control and Oct4 mutant mice 5, 12, and 35 days after Mx1-Cre induced recombination revealed no deficiency in the ability of Oct4 mutant mice to maintain white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), or platelet counts at control levels throughout the experiment (Figures 3A and 3B). Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow for monocyte, B cell, and granulocyte lineages at 12 and 35 days after recombination showed little difference in the representation of these cell types between control and Oct4 mutant animals (Figure 3C and data not shown). Furthermore, Oct4 deletion did not affect the lineage-negative, c-kit+, sca1+ population of HSCs in the bone marrow (Figure 3D) (Camargo et al., 2006Camargo F.D. Chambers S.M. Drew E. McNagny K.M. Goodell M.A. Hematopoietic stem cells do not engraft with absolute efficiencies.Blood. 2006; 107: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of Flt3-negative long-term HSCs and Flt3-positive short-term HSCs showed no variation in these populations in the absence of Oct4 (data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of flow-sorted HSCs, common lymphoid progenitors, granulocytes, and monocytes revealed no preference for Oct4 expression in stem cells, and expression in all of these cell types was negligible in comparison to ES cells (Figure S2). PCR analysis for the 2-lox and recombined 1-lox Oct4 alleles 8 weeks after Mx1-Cre activation verified the persistence of Oct4 null cells in the marrow, ruling out potential functional contribution of any cells escaping Cre-mediated recombination (Figure 3E). Ultimately, we tested the regenerative potential of the HSCs by performing a competitive reconstitution assay in which equal numbers of either control or Oct4 mutant marrow cells bearing a CD45.1 cell surface antigen were isolated 5 days after Mx1-Cre activation and coinjected along with CD45.2 competitor cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. The CD45.1 and CD45.2 cells were allowed to compete for reestablishment of the recipient's hematopoietic system, and the relative contribution of each donor cell was assessed (Figure 3F). We found no significant differences in the ability of control or Oct4 mutant cells to repopulate the ablated hematopoietic systems of recipient animals. Moreover, the observed reconstitution was stable over time, demonstrating that HSCs lacking functional Oct4 alleles fully retain long-term pluripotency. While a clearly defined stem cell niche has not been identified in the liver, several candidate progenitor cells have been described (Walkup and Gerber, 2006Walkup M.H. Gerber D.A. Hepatic stem cells: in search of.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Oct4 has been observed in liver-derived stem cells (Beltrami et al., 2007Beltrami A.P. Cesselli D. Bergamin N. Marcon P. Rigo S. Puppato E. D'Aurizio F. Verardo R. Piazza S. Pignatelli A. et al.Multipotent cells can be generated in vitro from several adult human organs (heart, liver and bone marrow).Blood. 2007; (in press. Published online May 24, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-11-055566Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To test whether Oct4 functions in liver regeneration, we performed partial hepatectomies after inactivation of Oct4 using Mx1-Cre (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, Schneider et al., 2003Schneider A. Zhang Y. Guan Y. Davis L.S.

Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: F411-F417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Two months after removal of 75% of the liver, both control and Oct4 mutant mice were able to fully regenerate lost tissue. The newly generated liver was histologically normal, containing mature hepatocytes, bile ducts, and vascularization (Figure 4B). In addition, Oct4 protein was undetectable by immunostaining and little to no Oct4 mRNA was expressed in the regenerated liver (Figures 4C and 4D). As in the intestinal epithelium, the newly regenerated liver of Oct4 mutant mice lacked nonrecombined Oct4-2lox alleles (Figure 4E), demonstrating that cells lacking functional Oct4 alleles are capable of tissue regeneration. The Oct4 zebrafish ortholog spiel ohne grenzen (spg) has been shown to be necessary for formation of the mid- and hindbrain (Belting et al., 2001Belting H.G. Hauptmann"

These first genome-wide maps of exosome substrates will aid in illuminating new fundamental components and regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptomes. The exosome is an evolutionarily conserved macromolecular complex that mediates numerous reactions of 3′–5′ RNA processing and degradation and is essential for viability (Estevez et al., 2003Estevez A.M. Lehner B. Sanderson C.M. Ruppert T. Clayton C. The roles of intersubunit interactions in exosome stability.J. Biol.

Loss of any individual subunit of its nine-component core is lethal in S. cerevisiae and causes near-identical profiles of RNA-processing defects (Allmang et al., 1999aAllmang C. Kufel J.

Moreover, X-ray crystallographic analysis of the human exosome indicates that all nine core subunits are required for its integrity (Liu et al., 2006Liu Q. Greimann J.C. Lima C.D. Reconstitution, activities, and structure of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The salient feature of the exosome core is the hexameric ring defined by heterodimers of the RNase PH domain-type proteins RRP41-RRP45, MTR3-RRP42, and RRP43-RRP46. These heterodimers are bridged on one side by three subunits containing S1 and KH domains: RRP40 links RRP45 and RRP46, RRP4 interacts with RRP41 and RRP42, and CSL4 contacts MTR3 and RRP43. Surprisingly, all six RNase PH-type proteins in yeast and human complexes are catalytically inactive and serve to mediate interactions with RRP44 (Dis3), a 3′–5′ hydrolytic RNase responsible for most if not all of the catalytic activity of the yeast exosome (Dziembowski et al., 2007Dziembowski A.

In contrast, the RRP41 exosome subunit in the plant lineage retained its catalytic competence (Chekanova et al., 2000Chekanova J.A. Shaw R.J. Wills M.A. Belostotsky D.A. Poly(A) tail-dependent exonuclease AtRrp41p from Arabidopsis thaliana rescues 5.8 S rRNA processing and mRNA decay defects of the yeast ski6 mutant and is found in an exosome-sized complex in plant and yeast cells.J.

Furthermore, RRP44 is stably associated with the core complex in yeast and Drosophila but not in human and T. brucei (Chen et al., 2001Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J.

These observations hint at a yet to be explored diversity of structure-function relationships in the exosome complex. Many auxiliary factors interact with the exosome and facilitate its functions. Most of its cytoplasmic activities, such as homeostatic mRNA turnover, decay of unstable mRNAs, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, as well as the degradation of the mRNA fragments derived from endonucleolytic cleavage by RISC or from no-go decay, are mediated by the SKI2/SKI3/SKI8 complex and the SKI7 protein (reviewed in Houseley et al., 2006Houseley J. LaCava J. Tollervey D. RNA-quality control by the exosome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The exosome also has numerous targets in the nucleus. The nuclear exosome is remarkably versatile and is able to carry out precise 3′ end processing of the 5.8S rRNA precursor (Allmang et al., 1999aAllmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P.

Although the exosome is positioned at the nexus of cellular RNA transactions, the extent of conservation of structure-function relationships and the roles of its individual subunits across the phylogenetic spectrum remain unknown. Additionally, elucidation of the mechanistic basis of exosome essentiality is hampered by its functional versatility. Furthermore, exosome substrates have yet to be comprehensively identified in any system, as even the most extensive datasets available only address its nuclear-specific functions and/or are based on microarray platforms that are not genome wide and/or not strand specific (Davis and Ares, 2006Davis C.A.

Here, we present evidence for a unique subfunctionalization of the individual subunits of the plant exosome core and widespread oligoadenylation- and exosome-mediated RNA quality-control pathways in plants. Further, we report the first high-resolution genome-wide map of exosome targets. These targets include multiple classes of stable structural RNAs, a select subset of mRNAs, primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) processing intermediates, tandem repeat-associated siRNA precursor species, as well as numerous noncoding RNAs, many of which can only be revealed through repressing the exosome. Previously, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis thaliana RRP4 and RRP41 proteins physically interact and reside in a high-molecular-weight complex in planta (Chekanova et al., 2000Chekanova J.A.

To elucidate its composition, we generated transgenic plants expressing either TAP-tagged RRP4 or RRP41 at physiological levels in rrp4-1 or rrp41-1 mutant plants, respectively. TAP-tagged RRP4 and RRP41 fully rescued the lethal phenotypes of their corresponding null alleles. TAP-tagged complexes were purified, and polypeptides shared between RRP4-TAP and RRP41-TAP samples but absent from the wild-type (WT) sample were subjected to MALDI and MS/MS analyses. Nine polypeptides corresponding to known subunits of the exosome core were identified: S1 and/or KH domain-containing subunits RRP4, RRP40A, and CSL4 as well as the RNase PH-type subunits RRP41, RRP42, RRP43, RRP45B, RRP46, and MTR3 (Figure 1 and Table S1 available online). In the case of subunits encoded by duplicated genes, only RRP40A and RRP45B were identified. This may be due to differences in the expression patterns and/or levels between the members of these gene pairs (Hooker et al., 2007Hooker T.S. Lam P. Zheng H. Kunst L.

On the other hand, the absence of RRP44, which is responsible for most if not all of the catalytic activity of the core exosome in yeast and humans, may reflect a genuine species-specific difference in the functional architecture of the exosome since the Arabidopsis RRP41 subunit is unique in retaining its full catalytic activity (Chekanova et al., 2000Chekanova J.A. Shaw R.J. Wills M.A. Belostotsky D.A. Poly(A) tail-dependent exonuclease AtRrp41p from Arabidopsis thaliana rescues 5.8 S rRNA processing and mRNA decay defects of the yeast ski6 mutant and is found in an exosome-sized complex in plant and yeast cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33158-33166Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine the consequences of losing specific exosome components on plant development, we characterized transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional alleles in several core subunits of the Arabidopsis exosome. In yeast, the CSL4 subunit is essential for viability (Allmang et al., 1999bAllmang C. Petfalski E. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Mitchell P.

Zhang K. Mutations synthetically lethal with cep1 target S. cerevisiae kinetochore components.Genetics. 1998; 149: 73-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and X-ray crystallographic analysis of the human exosome predicts that all of its core subunits are critical to maintaining structural integrity and functionality of the complex (Liu et al., 2006Liu Q. Greimann J.C. Lima C.D. Reconstitution, activities, and structure of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, we found that neither integrity nor function of the Arabidopsis exosome was significantly compromised by loss of CSL4. First, neither csl4-1 nor csl4-2 (a confirmed null allele) mutant plants manifested any discernible phenotype (Figure S1). Second, size fractionation demonstrated that the Arabidopsis exosome complex lacking CSL4 remained nearly intact (Figure 1C). Furthermore, tiling microarray analyses (below) revealed that loss of CSL4 affects only a subset of exosome targets (Figure S2 and Tables S2 and S3). In contrast, Arabidopsis RRP41 was essential for development of the female gametophyte, an eight-celled haploid structure derived from the primary product of female meiosis. While the rrp41-1 mutant allele was normally transmitted through the male parent, it was not transmitted through the female (n = 194), and selfed rrp41/RRP41 heterozygotes produced seeds and aborted ovules in a 1:1 ratio (Figures 2A and S3; three independent rrp41 alleles showed identical phenotypes). Furthermore, the resulting progeny segregated 1:1 for WT and heterozygous plants. The mutant female gametophytes arrested (n = 422) after the first mitosis (two-nucleate stage, 43.1%; Figures 2B and 2C) and less frequently at one-nucleate (1.4%), four-nucleate (3.3%), or later stages (3.0%). Finally, loss of RRP4 resulted in an additional unique phenotype. Specifically, rrp4-1 mutant seeds arrested at early stages of embryogenesis (Figures 2D and S4A–S4E). By the time WT progeny seeds of rrp4-1/RRP4 plants reached the heart or torpedo stages of embryogenesis, 30% of the rrp4-1/rrp4-1 progeny contained two-cell embryos, 0.5% undivided zygotes, and 3% had embryos at the early globular stage (n = 393). Analysis of stage-specific markers confirmed that rrp4-1 seed morphology faithfully reflects their developmental timing (Figures S4F and S4G). The rrp4-1 mutant endosperm developed to varying degrees but never past the cellularization stage (Figures S4B–S4D). These phenotypes cosegregated with the T-DNA genetic lesion, which was confirmed to be a null mutation using an SNP-based assay (Figure 2E), and were fully rescued by the WT and TAP-tagged RRP4 transgenes. In light of the recent findings that loss of the Arabidopsis mRNA decapping complex results in seedling lethality (Goeres et al., 2007Goeres D.C. Van Norman J.M. Zhang W. Fauver N.A. Spencer M.L. Sieburth L.E. Components of the Arabidopsis mRNA decapping complex are required for early seedling development.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1549-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2006Xu J. Yang J.Y. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Arabidopsis DCP2, DCP1, and VARICOSE form a decapping complex required for postembryonic development.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3386-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the phenotype of rrp4-1 mutant seeds suggests a more general function for RRP4 in postzygotic development, which is consistent with its broad substrate range revealed by tiling microarray analyses (below). In summary, the distinctiveness of the phenotypes of csl4, rrp4, and rrp41 mutant plants and their associated molecular signatures (below) indicate that the individual subunits in the Arabidopsis exosome core make nonequivalent contributions to its integrity and function. These findings set the plant exosome complex apart from those analyzed so far in other systems. To address the functions of RRP4 and RRP41 during vegetative growth, we engineered an estradiol-inducible RNAi (iRNAi) system (see Experimental Procedures). Growing these transgenic plants on estradiol-containing medium induced the RNAi-mediated knockdown of RRP4 (rrp4iRNAi) or RRP41 (rrp41iRNAi) mRNA, resulting in growth arrest (Figure 2F) and subsequent death of seedlings. Importantly, arrest was preceded by accumulation of 3′-underprocessed 5.8S rRNA species (Figure 2G). This molecular phenotype is indicative of exosome malfunction (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome: a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonucleases.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and was never observed in WT plants exposed to estradiol (neither is growth inhibition). These results show that Arabidopsis RRP4 and RRP41 are essential for postembryonic growth and validate the conditional iRNAi knockdown system as a useful approach for investigating their functions in vivo. To comprehensively identify exosome targets in Arabidopsis and gain additional insights into the apparent subfunctionalization of its core subunits, we implemented iRNAi in conjunction with whole-genome tiling microarrays. To minimize changes in gene expression that did not result directly from exosome depletion, we selected the earliest time point of estradiol treatment corresponding to the accumulation of underprocessed 5.8S rRNA species, but before growth retardation. Oligo(dT)-primed targets prepared from RNA samples from plants containing empty vector, rrp4iRNAi, or rrp41iRNAi constructs grown with or without estradiol were used to interrogate oligonucleotide tiling arrays. Therefore, the array signals should correspond exclusively to polyadenylated RNA species. Moreover, to rule out the possibility of spurious internal priming events, we employed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) to map the polyadenylation sites in a subset of targets (Figure S9) as well as compared the relative change in expression between poly(A)+ and total RNA fractions for selected targets (Figures 3C, S5B, S5C, S5H, and S8). We used the TileMap algorithm, which utilizes a two-state hidden Markov model based on probe-level t statistics (Ji and Wong, 2005Ji H. Wong W.H. TileMap: create chromosomal map of tiling array hybridizations.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), to identify genomic regions showing statistically significant changes. Expression data from arrays hybridized with targets from rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi plants that had been estradiol-treated were compared against the corresponding mock (DMSO)-treated samples, as well as against the empty-vector line treated with estradiol. We identified a total of 1612 genomic regions exhibiting increased levels of polyadenylated RNA upon the depletion of RRP4 (rrp4iRNAi) and RRP41 (rrp41iRNAi), while only about 1/10 as many regions showed downregulation (Figures 2H and 2I; Tables S2 and S3). Depleting an exoribonucleolytic complex should cause increased accumulation of its target RNAs, thus the overwhelming majority of expression changes in RRP4- and RRP41-depleted seedlings most likely represent direct effects. In contrast, when we conducted a similar analysis of csl4-2 mutant versus wild-type (Ws) plants, upregulation was no longer a predominant trend (Figure S2). Thus, the constitutive absence of CSL4 likely results in many secondary effects. This observation raises a general concern applicable to transcriptome studies using constitutive loss-of-function mutants and, conversely, emphasizes the value of conditional alleles like rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi. At the same time, it is notable that the overlap in the upregulated RNA targets among the csl4-2, rrp4iRNAi, and rrp41iRNA samples is highly significant, while the overlap in spectra of downregulated RNAs is negligible (Figure S2). Hence, the majority of upregulated RNA targets in csl4-2 seedlings constitute a direct molecular signature of the CSL4-less exosome. Remarkably, many of the exosome targets upregulated in rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi samples were unaffected in the csl4-2 seedlings, including both nuclear-confined species (e.g., miRNA precursors, Figure 5) as well as cytoplasmic RNAs (e.g., spliced mRNAs, Figure 4). Therefore, the CSL4-less exosome is fully active on some of the exosome substrates in both cellular compartments. In addition, these data represent a valuable resource for narrowing down which of the exosome targets are essential for viability, via subtracting the csl4-2 upregulated dataset from the rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNA analyses. For example, the 7S pre-rRNA processing defect in the csl4-2 seedlings was as severe as in the RRP4- and RRP41-depleted seedlings (Figure 2G), and yet csl4-2 mutant plants are phenotypically indistinguishable from WT. A global comparative overview of similarities and differences in the expression changes among the csl4-2, rrp4iRNAi, and rrp41iRNA lines can be found in Figure S2 and Tables S2–S11 and on the accompanying website (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/exosome). The following major classes of Arabidopsis exosome direct targets were defined by tiling microarray analysis of rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi plants: (1) small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs; 9 snRNA genes from both rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi; Table S4); (2) the majority of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) encoded in the genome (83 and 96 snoRNA genes from rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi samples, respectively; Table S5); (3) a select subset of tRNA genes (20 and 14, respectively; Table S6); (4) an upregulated subset of Arabidopsis mRNAs (205 and 266 mRNAs, respectively; Table S7); (5) a subset of mRNAs that extend beyond their annotated 3′ end, indicative of 3′-processing defects (29 from both rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi; Table S8); (6) a subset of specific pri-miRNA genes (12 from rrp4iRNAi and 11 from rrp41iRNAi; Table S9); (7) a large class of previously uncharacterized noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); many of these ncRNAs overlap with repetitive elements and small RNA (smRNA)-generating loci (210 and 156 ncRNAs, respectively; Table S10); and (8) a distinct class of previously undetected polyadenylated transcripts that map exclusively to the 5′ ends of known protein-coding mRNAs and hence may possess regulatory potential (52 from both rrp4iRNAi and rrp41iRNAi; Table S11). Notably, while the overlap in the spectra of upregulated target RNAs revealed by the depletions of RRP4 and RRP41 was highly significant (∼64%), the extent of differences between them corroborates the notion of subfunctionalization of the subunits in the Arabidopsis exosome core (for example see Figure 4). Taken together, these results circumscribe a complex spectrum of Arabidopsis exosome targets that spans RNAP I, II, III, and possibly RNAP IV transcripts and includes nuclear-restricted RNAs (e.g., pri-miRNAs), cytoplasmic RNAs (e.g., spliced mRNAs), as well as RNAs distributed between the two compartments. Interestingly, our array analyses identified appreciable amounts of polyadenylated RNA signals across the rDNA repeat unit even under normal conditions, which were dramatically upregulated upon depletion of RRP4 or RRP41 (Figure 3). This increased and expanded signal corresponded largely to polyadenylated pre-rRNA precursors. For example, northern analysis targeting the sequences just downstream of 5.8S rRNA revealed an increase in a polyadenylated, 3′-underprocessed species of ∼2.4 kb (Figure 3C, top) that included both the 18S and 5.8S mature rRNA regions, while neither the nonpolyadenylated precursor (Figure 3C, bottom) nor the levels of mature rRNAs (data not shown) were affected. Furthermore, two major clusters of polyadenylation sites identified by 3′-RACE were both located outside of the boundaries of the mature rRNA (Figure S9). These findings parallel observations in yeast, where targeting of pre-rRNA species for degradation by the exosome is mechanistically linked to their oligoadenylation by the TRAMP complex (Kadaba et al., 2004Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Anderson J.

In addition, both tiling array and qPCR analyses revealed increased accumulation of poly(A)+ RNAs in the intergenic spacer region (IGS, Figures 3A and 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2153453282,The environment significantly influences the dynamic expression and assembly of all components encoded in the genome of an organism into functional biological networks. We have constructed a model for this process in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 through the data-driven discovery of regulatory and functional interrelationships among ∼80% of its genes and key abiotic factors in its hypersaline environment. Using relative changes in 72 transcription factors and 9 environmental factors (EFs) this model accurately predicts dynamic transcriptional responses of all these genes in 147 newly collected experiments representing completely novel genetic backgrounds and environments—suggesting a remarkable degree of network completeness. Using this model we have constructed and tested hypotheses critical to this organism's interaction with its changing hypersaline environment. This study supports the claim that the high degree of connectivity within biological and EF networks will enable the construction of similar models for any organism from relatively modest numbers of experiments.

Since it was shown that 50-kHz calls can serve as indices of the animal's positive subjective state, they have received increasing experimental attention, and have successfully been used to study neurobiological mechanisms of positive affect. However, it is likely that such calls do not only reflect a positive affective state, but that they also serve a communicative purpose. Actually, rats emit the highest rates of 50-kHz calls typically during social interactions, like reproductive behavior, juvenile play and tickling. Furthermore, it was recently shown that rats emit 50-kHz calls after separation from conspecifics. The aim of the present study was to test the communicative value of such 50-kHz calls. In a first experiment, conducted in juvenile rats situated singly on a radial maze apparatus, we showed that 50-kHz calls can induce behavioral activation and approach responses, which were selective to 50-kHz signals, since presentation of 22-kHz calls, considered to be aversive or threat signals, led to behavioral inhibition. In two other experiments, we used either natural 50-kHz calls, which had been previously recorded from other rats, or artificial sine wave stimuli, which were identical to these calls with respect to peak frequency, call length and temporal appearance. These signals were presented to either juvenile (Exp. 2) or adult (Exp. 3) male rats. Our data clearly show that 50-kHz signals can induce approach behavior, an effect, which was more pronounced in juvenile rats and which was not selective to natural calls, especially in adult rats. The recipient rats also emitted some 50-kHz calls in response to call presentation, but this effect was observed only in adult subjects. Together, our data show that 50-kHz calls can serve communicative purposes, namely as a social signal, which increases the likelihood of approach in the recipient conspecific."
https://openalex.org/W2005019868,"The centromere is a chromatin region that serves as the spindle attachment point and directs accurate inheritance of eukaryotic chromosomes during cell divisions. However, the mechanism by which the centromere assembles and stabilizes at a specific genomic region is not clear. The de novo formation of a human/mammalian artificial chromosome (HAC/MAC) with a functional centromere assembly requires the presence of alpha-satellite DNA containing binding motifs for the centromeric CENP-B protein. We demonstrate here that de novo centromere assembly on HAC/MAC is dependent on CENP-B. In contrast, centromere formation is suppressed in cells expressing CENP-B when alpha-satellite DNA was integrated into a chromosomal site. Remarkably, on those integration sites CENP-B enhances histone H3-K9 trimethylation and DNA methylation, thereby stimulating heterochromatin formation. Thus, we propose that CENP-B plays a dual role in centromere formation, ensuring de novo formation on DNA lacking a functional centromere but preventing the formation of excess centromeres on chromosomes.

However, roles of CENP-B for centromere assembly have been controversial. Studies in fission yeast show that homologs of CENP-B play a role in forming pericentromeric heterochromatin adjacent to kinetochores (Nakagawa et al., 2002Nakagawa H. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J.

Moreover, in CENP-B knockout mouse cells, functional kinetochores are maintained without CENP-B (Hudson et al., 1998Hudson D.F. Fowler K.J. Earle E. Saffery R. Kalitsis P. Trowell H. Hill J.

CENP-B is not detected on the Y chromosome centromere or in “neocentromeres,” rare functional centromeres in chromosomal arm regions. The neocentromere has no significant centromeric DNA sequence or CENP-B, but includes most other centromeric proteins including CENP-A (Choo, 2001Choo K.H. Domain organization at the centromere and neocentromere.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 165-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to investigate the intriguing role of CENP-B in de novo centromere assembly. To this end, BAC constructs carrying human alphoid DNA with wild-type or mutant CENP-B boxes were transfected into wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) or CENP-B-deficient MEFs with or without exogenous CENP-B. The stability and initial/stable chromatin structure of the input alphoid DNA was then assessed using immuno-FISH and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The following experiments examine de novo assembly of functional centromeric chromatin in wild-type and CENP-B-deficient MEFs (see Figure S1A available online). The chromatin assembly substrate for these experiments was a BAC construct carrying a 60 kb fragment of synthetic human alphoid DNA containing 32 tandem copies of the 11-mer unit with wild-type (pWTR11.32Bsr) or mutant CENP-B boxes (pMTR11.32Bsr) (Figure 1A). BAC DNA constructs were transfected into MEFs, selected for resistance to Blasticidin S (Bs) and transformants were analyzed by FISH using probes for α21-I alphoid DNA and BAC vector and by immunofluorescence using antibodies to CENP-B and CENP-A. The results are shown in Figures 1A–1C and Table S1. Alphoid DNA BAC with wild-type CENP-B boxes formed stable centromeric minichromosomes at the rate of 5.2% (3/56 cell lines in two independent experiments) as the predominant fates. While this efficiency is lower than that observed with the same construct in human HT1080 cells (∼30% of cell lines) (Ohzeki et al., 2002Ohzeki J. Nakano M. Okada T. Masumoto H. CENP-B box is required for de novo centromere chromatin assembly on human alphoid DNA.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), artificial chromosomes in MEFs have similar centromeric chromatin assembly. Endogenous murine CENP-A, CENP-B, and CENP-C proteins assembled on the human alphoid DNA, and mouse centromeric minor satellite and pericentromeric major satellite DNA did not colocalize with the nascent centromeres, as indicated by immuno-FISH analysis (Figures 1C and S3A). This result indicates that de novo centromere assembly occurs in wild-type MEFs on BAC constructs carrying human alphoid DNA. However, de novo centromere and artificial chromosome assembly does not occur in CENP-B-deficient MEFs (Figures 1A and 1B, Table S1, p < 0.05) or in wild-type MEFs carrying alphoid DNA BAC with mutant CENP-B boxes (Figure 1A and Table S1). The mitotic stability of the mouse artificial chromosomes was examined in MEFs cultured under nonselective conditions (Figure 1D). This was done by performing FISH analysis of wild-type MEFs carrying a nonintegrated alphoid BAC with wild-type CENP-B boxes (+/+ AC1 cells) in the presence and absence of Bs over approximately 50 population doublings. The results showed high stability of the mouse artificial chromosome with a loss rate per cell division (R) of 0.0025; this result confirms the conclusion that functional centromeres form de novo on the transfected BACs as stable artificial chromosomes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to determine whether CENP-A nucleosomes assembled on extrachromosomal (i.e., maintaining as an artificial chromosome) or chromosomally-integrated human alphoid DNA. The analysis was performed as shown in Figures 2A and 2B using competitive PCR. The multiplicity of the alphoid BAC DNA was measured before starting the analysis, as shown in Table 1. +/+ AC1 cells, carrying the extrachromosomal alphoid DNA with wild-type CENP-B boxes, and +/+ Int M1 cells, carrying chromosomally-integrated alphoid DNA with mutant CENP-B boxes (Figure S3B), were mixed in equal amounts, fixed, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated using antibody to CENP-B, CENP-A or normal IgG. The relative recovery of alphoid DNA with wild-type or mutant CENP-B-boxes was then measured by competitive PCR. The results show that the alphoid DNA with a wild-type CENP-B box was enriched 24-fold or 25-fold after immunoprecipitation with anti-CENP-A or anti-CENP-B antibodies, respectively (Figure 2Bb). This indicates that assembly of mouse CENP-A chromatin occurs on human alphoid DNA with wild-type CENP-B boxes but not on mutant CENP-B boxes, as expected. Control experiments showed no change in the ratio of mutant and wild-type alphoid DNA when the samples were immunoprecipitated with normal IgG (Figure 2Bb) or in CENP-B deficient MEFs (−/− Int W1 cell) (Figures 1B and 2Bd). However, the wild-type alphoid DNA fragment was enriched 2- to 4-fold in CENP-B+/+ cells with chromosomally-integrated alphoid DNA (+/+ Int W1 cell) (Figure 1B and Figure 2Bc). Thus, CENP-A and CENP-B assembled with very low efficiency on wild-type alphoid DNA integrated in a mouse chromosome, and with much higher efficiency on extrachromosomal alphoid DNA. The high level of CENP-A assembly on extrachromosomal alphoid BAC with wild-type CENP-B boxes (+/+ AC1 cell) and the low or no CENP-A assembly on chromosomally-integrated alphoid DNA (+/+ Int W1 cell or −/− Int W1 cell) were confirmed by ChIP and real-time PCR analysis (Figure 2C) referenced by positive (centromeric minor satellite DNA) and negative (pericentromeric major satellite DNA) mouse endogenous controls. These data establish that de novo assembly of CENP-A chromatin occurs on extrachromosomal human alphoid DNA in MEFs. However, this reaction requires functional CENP-B and functional (wild-type) CENP-B boxes in human alphoid DNA and is enhanced by an extrachromosomal location of the heterologous centromeric DNA. Integration of the centromere competent alphoid DNA into an ectopic chromosomal site caused fairly strong suppression in the assembly of CENP-A chromatin. The assembly of CENP-A chromatin was examined at early time points after DNA transfection using a sensitive modified ChIP assay called transient ChIP. In this assay, centromere assembly was examined on a chimeric BAC construct containing 60 kb human alphoid DNA with wild-type CENP-B boxes adjacent to 60 kb alphoid DNA with mutant CENP-B boxes (Figure 3A). Here, the mutant alphoid DNA served as an internal negative control. The competence of this chimeric alphoid BAC to form de novo centromere assembly was initially tested in human HT1080 cells showing high-efficiency artificial chromosome formation as a control. After transfection, cells were cultured under nonselective conditions and competitive ChIP analysis was carried out after 1–4 days. The results showed that CENP-B assembled on alphoid DNA with wild-type CENP-B boxes within 1 day after transfection, and that wild-type alphoid DNA was enriched 8- to 10-fold in CENP-B immunoprecipitates. CENP-A assembly was also detectable on the third and fourth days after transfection, with 2- to 3-fold enrichment of wild-type alphoid DNA in CENP-A immunoprecipitates (Figure 3B). Other experiments showed that the chimeric alphoid BAC (mutant and wild-type CENP-B boxes) and the wild-type alphoid BAC formed stable human artificial chromosomes with similar efficiency in human HT1080 cells (data not shown). Transient ChIP with the chimeric alphoid BAC was then carried out in CENP-B+/+ and CENP-B−/− MEFs. The results showed that CENP-A and CENP-B assembled on alphoid DNA with wild-type CENP-B boxes within 1 day after transfection into CENP-B+/+ MEFs. Wild-type alphoid DNA was enriched 3.5-fold and 2.0-fold in CENP-A and CENP-B immunoprecipitates, respectively. In contrast, wild-type alphoid DNA was not enriched and CENP-B/A assembly was not detected in CENP-B−/− cells up to 4 days after transfection (Figures 3D and 3E). The lower enrichment of CENP-B assembly on alphoid DNA in CENP-B+/+ MEFs may be due to one-eleventh lower level of CENP-B expression in CENP-B+/+ MEFs compared to that in HT1080 cells (data not shown). To try to complement the defect in centromere assembly in CENP-B-deficient cells, an expression plasmid encoding GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged CENP-B was cotransfected into CENP-B−/− cells with the chimeric alphoid BAC. Immuno detection confirmed that GFP-tagged CENP-B was expressed and localized to the centromere in CENP-B−/− and CENP-B+/+ cells ( Figures 3C and 4B). Overexpression of GFP-tagged CENP-B increased the efficiency of CENP-A and CENP-B assembly on wild-type alphoid DNA dramatically. Wild-type alphoid DNA was enriched 16- to 30-fold in CENP-A and CENP-B immunoprecipitates in CENP-B−/− and CENP-B+/+ MEFs, when the cells coexpressed GFP-CENP-B (Figure 3D). Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that a deletion mutant of amino acids 10-25 of CENP-B failed to bind to the CENP-B box (Figure 4A; Yoda et al., 1992Yoda K. Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Muro Y. Okazaki T. A human centromere protein, CENP-B, has a DNA binding domain containing four potential alpha helices at the NH2 terminus, which is separable from dimerizing g activity.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1413-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here, two DNA binding competent and one DNA binding-defective variants of CENP-B were coexpressed as GFP fusion proteins in CENP-B-defective MEFs, and their ability to support de novo centromere assembly on human alphoid DNA was tested. The three CENP-B variants were full-length CENP-B-GFP, N-ter CENP-B-GFP (including the N-terminal 139 amino acids of CENP-B fused to GFP) and Δ10–25 CENP-B-GFP. Fluorescence microscopy showed that CENP-B-GFP and N-ter CENP-B-GFP colocalized with CENP-A at centromeres in CENP-B−/− MEFs, while CENP-B (Δ10–25) localized to the whole nucleus (Figure 4B). In addition, expression of full-length or N-ter CENP-B supported assembly of CENP-A and CENP-B on human alphoid DNA in CENP-B−/− MEFs, while expression of CENP-B (Δ10–25) did not (Figures 4C and 4D). These results indicated that binding of CENP-B to the CENP-B box is necessary for de novo assembly of centromeric chromatin on human alphoid DNA in MEFs. It should be noted that assembly of CENP-A on human alphoid DNA is dependent on the presence of a functional N-terminal DNA binding domain of CENP-B. This result suggests that the DNA binding domain may play a direct role in recruiting CENP-A to the centromeric satellite DNA and/or in de novo assembly of CENP-A nucleosomes. In +/+ Int W1 MEFs, human alphoid DNA with wild-type CENP-B boxes is stably integrated in mouse chromosomal DNA. Figure 2 shows that assembly of CENP-A and CENP-B on alphoid DNA was suppressed in these cells. Moreover, CENP-A, and CENP-B level on input alphoid DNA decreased toward 4 days after transfection in mouse cells, whereas CENP-B level was maintained and CENP-A level increased after transfection in human HT1080 cells (Figure 3E). Here, we investigated the possibility that epigenetic modifications of chromosomally integrated alphoid DNA, including the CENP-B boxes, might play a role in suppressing de novo centromere assembly at these sites. We confirmed that mouse and human CENP-B have identical specificities for CENP-B box binding and dimer formation (Figure S5), which is consistent with the level of amino acid sequence homology in the N-terminal DNA binding domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain of human and mouse CENP-B (Figure 4A). The 9 bp core of the CENP-B box, which includes two CpG sites, is also 100% conserved in human and mouse DNA (Masumoto et al., 1989Masumoto H. Masukata H. Muro Y. Nozaki N. Okazaki T. A human centromere antigen (CENP-B) interacts with a short specific sequence in alphoid DNA, a human centromeric satellite.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar; Figure S2). In vitro studies showed that methylation of the CpG sites in the CENP-B box inhibits CENP-B binding (Tanaka et al., 2005aTanaka Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. CpG methylation of the CENP-B box reduces human CENP-B binding.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, partial methylation, even hemimethylation of one CpG of the CENP-B box, also inhibits CENP-B binding (Figure S5). Therefore, it seemed possible that methylation of alphoid DNA in MEFs could influence its ability to form de novo centromeric chromatin. Here, CpG methylation in chromosomal and nonchromosomal alphoid DNA was examined with methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme Aci I, which cuts within the CENP-B box (Figure 5A). The results show that chromosomally integrated alphoid DNA in +/+ Int W1 cells was hypermethylated, but extrachromosomal alphoid DNA in +/+ AC1 cells was not (Figure 5B). Interestingly, chromosomally-integrated alphoid DNA was hypomethylated in CENP-B−/− MEFs (i.e., −/− Int W1 cells; Figure 5B). The result was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of genomic DNA with anti-5meC (Figure S6 and Table 1). These results suggest that CpG methylation may negatively regulate CENP-B binding to the CENP-B box and assembly of CENP-A chromatin. However, neither CpG hypermethylation nor CENP-A assembly occurs on alphoid DNA in CENP-B−/− cells.Table 1CENPs and H3-K9me3 Assemblies on Introduced Alphoid BAC DNAsChromosomal Event/ Cell LineCENP-B Allele in MEFInput Alphoid DNA, CENP-B Box (W) or Mutant Box (M)CENPs AssembliesaRelative level of CENP-A, CENP-B and H3K9me3 assembly was determined by ChIP analyses and shown; −, no assembly, ±; very low; +, low; ++, medium; +++, high; ++++, very high.

The amount of histone H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) in alphoid DNA was also investigated using ChIP and real-time PCR. These experiments revealed a high level of H3K9me3 modification in chromosomally-integrated alphoid DNA in +/+ Int W1 cells, or in extrachromosomal alphoid DNA in +/+ AC1 cells, and a low level of H3K9me3 modification in integrated alphoid DNA in −/− Int W1 cells (Figure 5C). We also examined H3K9me3 modification in other independent cell lines and found that hyper H3K9me3 modification occurred in chromosomally integrated alphoid DNA in CENP-B+/+ MEFs. In contrast, this reaction did not occur in CENP-B−/− MEFs (Figure S7B and Table 1). Thus, the presence of endogenous CENP-B is required to induce active assembly of CENP-A chromatin or a suppressed and inactive state at ectopic sites. In contrast, in the absence of CENP-B, human centromere competent satellite DNA assumes to be neither in an active state (assembly of CENP-A and CENP-B) nor in an inactive/suppressed chromatin state (hyper CpG methylation and H3K9me3 hypermodification) efficiently. The CpG hypomethylation and lack of H3K9me3 modification at chromosomal alphoid DNA in CENP-B−/− MEFs led us to compare the effects of N-ter CENP-B-GFP and full-length CENP-B-GFP on DNA and chromatin modifications in these cells. CENP-A assembly occurred at a low level in cells expressing both polypeptides (Figures 5D"
https://openalex.org/W2073075035,"We report an unexpected role for Tel2 in the expression of all mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinases (PIKKs). Although Tel2 was identified as a budding yeast gene required for the telomere length maintenance, we found no obvious telomeric function for mammalian Tel2. Targeted gene deletion showed that mouse Tel2 is essential in embryonic development, embryonic stem (ES) cells, and embryonic fibroblasts. Conditional deletion of Tel2 from embryonic fibroblasts compromised their response to IR and UV, diminishing the activation of checkpoint kinases and their downstream effectors. The effects of Tel2 deletion correlated with significantly reduced protein levels for the PI3K-related kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad3 related (ATR), DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit ataxia (DNA-PKcs). Tel2 deletion also elicited specific depletion of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), suppressor with morphological effect on genitalia 1 (SMG1), and transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP), and curbed mTOR signaling, indicating that Tel2 affects all six mammalian PIKKs. While Tel2 deletion did not alter PIKK mRNA levels, in vivo pulse labeling experiments showed that Tel2 controls the stability of ATM and mTOR. Each of the PIKK family members associated with Tel2 in vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that Tel2 binds to part of the HEAT repeat segments of ATM and mTOR.

ATM is crucial for the response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), whereas ATR is activated by replication stress and certain DNA repair intermediates. Mutations in ATM cause ataxia telangiectasia, while a mutation in ATR results in Seckel syndrome. DNA-PKcs promotes nonhomologous end joining and the diminished V(D)J recombination resulting from DNA-PKcs deficiency is responsible for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in mice. SMG1 is required for the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) mRNA surveillance pathway (Conti and Izaurralde, 2005Conti E. Izaurralde E.

TRRAP is involved in the regulation of gene expression as a component of histone acetyltransferase complexes (Herceg and Wang, 2005Herceg Z. Wang Z.Q.

The sixth mammalian PIKK, mTOR, integrates environmental cues, mitogenic signals, and nutrient availability to control cell growth (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004Hay N. Sonenberg N. Upstream and downstream of mTOR.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway is frequently altered in human cancer (Shaw and Cantley, 2006Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C.

Here we report a link between all six mammalian PIKKs and Tel2 (official gene symbol TELO2, also referred to as hCLK2), the mammalian ortholog of the budding yeast TEL2 gene. Along with TEL1, TEL2 was identified in the first screen for yeast mutants with altered telomere length (Lustig and Petes, 1986Lustig A.J. Petes T.D. Identification of yeast mutants with altered telomere structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1986; 83: 1398-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cells that harbor mutant alleles of tel1 or tel2 undergo telomere attrition for ∼150 generations but ultimately maintain their telomeres at a stable short length. Gene cloning revealed that TEL1 is the budding yeast ortholog of ATM (Greenwell et al., 1995Greenwell P.W. Kronmal S.L. Porter S.E. Gassenhuber J. Obermaier B. Petes T.D.

TEL2 was found to be an essential gene, but the TEL2 ORF lacked obvious conserved motifs that might suggest a molecular function (Runge and Zakian, 1996Runge K.W. Zakian V.A. TEL2, an essential gene required for telomere length regulation and telomere position effect in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3094-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The conservation of TEL2 in Drosophila melanogaster suggested that its function may not be limited to telomere maintenance, since Drosophila and other dipterans lack the canonical telomerase-based telomere system (Pimpinelli, 2005Pimpinelli S. Drosophila Telomeres.in: de Lange T. Lundblad V. Blackburn E. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2005: 433-464Google Scholar). Hypomorphic alleles of the C. elegans TEL2 ortholog (Clk-2/Rad-5) show pleiotropic phenotypes, including an extended life span (Lakowski and Hekimi, 1996Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Determination of life-span in Caenorhabditis elegans by four clock genes.Science. 1996; 272: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and hypersensitivity to DNA damage (Hartman and Herman, 1982Hartman P.S. Herman R.K. Radiation-sensitive mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1982; 102: 159-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but no significant telomere-length changes. Recent reports have suggested a role for human and fission yeast Tel2 in the response to replication stress (Jiang et al., 2003Jiang N. Benard C.Y. Kebir H. Shoubridge E.A. Hekimi S.

Tel2 is required for activation of the mrc1-mediated replication checkpoint.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5346-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have used gene targeting in mouse cells to determine the function of Tel2 and show that it controls the stability of all PIKKs proteins, thus potentially explaining the pleiotropic nature of the phenotypes of Tel2 mutations. Guided by the work on budding yeast Tel2, we initially explored the possibility that the human and mouse Tel2 orthologs might have telomere-related functions (Figure S1). Using Flag-tagged human Tel2 (Figures 1A and 1B), we asked whether Tel2 can localize to chromosome ends. Indirect immunofluorescence (IF) showed that ectopically expressed Tel2 localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure S1C), in agreement with the absence of canonical subcellular localization signals from the Tel2 ORF. However, IF and ChIP analysis failed to provide evidence for a telomeric localization of either ectopically expressed Tel2 or the endogenous protein (Figures S1C–S1E). In addition, shRNA knockdown of Tel2 or overexpression of full-length Tel2 or truncated Tel2 had no significant effect on telomere-length homeostasis in human tumor cell lines or the shortening rate of telomeres in primary human fibroblasts (data not shown). Finally, cells with diminished Tel2 did not show accumulation of 53BP1 or γ-H2AX at their telomeres (data not shown), which is a hallmark of telomere deprotection (Takai et al., 2003Takai H. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. DNA damage foci at dysfunctional telomeres.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1549-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Although these results did not exclude a function for Tel2 at telomeres, they raised the possibility that Tel2 might have other functions in mammalian cells. To address the function of Tel2, we used targeted gene deletion in the mouse. Mouse Tel2 mRNA appeared to be ubiquitously expressed (Figure S1F) and encodes an ORF starting in the second exon that predicts a 840 aa protein with a molecular weight (MW) of 93 kDa. Our targeting strategy deleted the third exon of the Tel2 gene (Figures 1A and 1B), resulting in a shift in the reading frame at amino acid (aa) 116 into a non-Tel2 ORF that terminates 52 amino acids downstream. Heterozygous Tel2DEL/+ mice were viable, fertile, and healthy, suggesting that the truncated protein is either not expressed or has no deleterious effects. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from Tel2DEL/+ embryos grew normally and showed the expected 2-fold reduction in Tel2 protein levels (Figure 1C). Consistent with the lethality of Tel2 deficiency in yeast and C. elegans (Benard et al., 2001Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S.

Tel2 also appeared to be essential in ES cells (Figure S2). When double-targeted Tel2TARGET/FLOX ES cells carrying two conditional Tel2 alleles were treated with Cre to induce Tel2 deficiency, the cells arrested (Figures S2A–S2D), and we were unable to isolate Tel2 null clones from Tel2TARGET/FLOX ES cell cultures in which Cre was expressed (Figure S2E). To study the cellular consequence of Tel2 deficiency, we prepared Tel2DEL/FLOX MEFs from which Tel2 could be deleted by transduction of a self-deleting Cre retrovirus (H&R Cre) (Silver and Livingston, 2001Silver D.P.

Brocard J. Mascrez B. LeMeur M. Metzger D. Chambon P. Ligand-activated site-specific recombination in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A noninvasive genetic/pharmacologic strategy for visualizing cell morphology and clonal relationships in the mouse.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2314-2322PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Cre recombinase using either system removed the floxed allele efficiently ( Figures 2A and 4D and see below). Tel2 protein became undetectable by 4 days after H&R Cre infection of the Tel2DEL/FLOX MEFs (Figure 2A). Similarly, the Tel2 protein disappeared within 2 to 3 days after induction of R26Cre-ER with OHT (see below, Figure 4E). Cells lacking the Tel2 gene initially grew normally but arrested after 3 to 4 days with a 2N or 4N DNA content, reduced S and M phase index, and a flattened senescence-like morphology (Figures 2B–2E, S3A, and S3B and data not shown). This cell-cycle arrest phenotype was due to loss of Tel2 since ectopic expression of either mouse or human Tel2 cDNA rescued the growth defect (Figures 2C, 2D, S3A, and S3B). The cell-cycle arrest of Tel2-deficient cells did not appear to be due to a DNA-damage response since the nuclei did not contain DNA-damage foci (data not shown) and the phenotype was not affected by abrogation of the p53 pathway (Figure 2B). The arrest was also not accompanied by induction of CDK inhibitors such as p21, p27, and p16 (Figure 3A). There was also no evidence for upregulation of p53, consistent with the lack of p21 induction upon Tel2 deletion. Interestingly, in cells lacking Tel2, the basal level of phosphorylation of p53 on serine 18 was diminished, and the steady-state levels of p53 and p21 were slightly but reproducibly reduced (Figure 3A). As this reduction in basal p53 activation could be explained if the Tel2-deficient cells had a diminished response to intrinsic DNA damage, we tested their ability to respond to exogenously induced genotoxic stress. Whereas control cells showed the expected IR-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 and a concomitant increase in p53 serine 18 phosphorylation, Tel2-deficient cells failed to show this response and also lacked the ability to upregulate p21 after IR (Figure 3B). These results suggested that the slight reductions in p53 and p21 were due to diminished Chk2 signaling in the Tel2 null cells. Interestingly, the cells were also defective in the induction of Chk1 phosphorylation after UV treatment (Figure 3C), suggesting that Tel2-deficient cells might be generally compromised in their ability to respond to DNA damage. Whereas Tel2 deficiency affected the DNA-damage signaling pathways, IR-induced DNA damage did not appear to alter the localization of human or mouse Tel2 (Figure S1G and data not shown) nor did IR affect the migration of mouse Tel2 protein in SDS/PAGE (Figure 3B and data not shown). To further address the effect of Tel2 on the DNA-damage response, we evaluated the status of the ATM kinase in Tel2-deficient cells. Immunoblots revealed that the deletion of Tel2 resulted in a striking reduction in abundance of ATM protein (Figure 4A). Quantification of the data indicated that the residual ATM levels were less than 10% of the controls (data not shown). The lowered abundance of ATM protein was a specific consequence of Tel2 deletion, since the effect was negated by expression of mouse Tel2 from a retroviral vector (Figure 4B). Whereas ATM levels depended on Tel2, the converse was not the case: Atm−/− MEFs had normal Tel2 levels (Figure 4C). The diminished Chk1 phosphorylation in UV-treated Tel2-deficient cells (Figure 3C) suggested that Tel2 might also affect the ATR kinase. Indeed, the steady-state level of ATR was strongly diminished upon deletion of Tel2 using the R26Cre-ER system (Figures 4D and 4E). The effect of Tel2 on ATM and ATR was specific since Rif1, a large protein with HEAT repeats involved in the DNA-damage response (Xu and Blackburn, 2004Xu L. Blackburn E.H. Human Rif1 protein binds aberrant telomeres and aligns along anaphase midzone microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Silverman et al., 2004Silverman J. Takai H. Buonomo S.B. Eisenhaber F. de Lange T. Human Rif1, ortholog of a yeast telomeric protein, is regulated by ATM and 53BP1 and functions in the S-phase checkpoint.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2108-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was not affected by Tel2 deletion (Figures 4A and S4A). Moreover, the levels of eight other proteins (Smc1, Rent1, MCM2, NBS1, PTEN, PCNA, PARP, Raptor) were not affected by Tel2 deletion (Figure S4A). We next queried the other four mammalian PIKKs: mTOR, DNA-PKcs, SMG1, and TRRAP. Each of these PIKKs were affected showing significantly diminished abundance in cells lacking Tel2 (Figure 4E). Quantitative immunoblotting indicated that mTOR, DNA-PKcs, and SMG1 were reduced to ∼20% of the control cells (data not shown). The kinetics by which ATM, mTOR, and DNA-PKcs dissipated was similar, whereas the response was somewhat slower for ATR, SMG1, and TRRAP (Figure 4E). As expected, the reduction in mTOR expression affected the signaling by this PIKK as evident from the reduced phosphorylation of the mTOR target p70-S6K on Thr389 (Figures 4F and 4G). Thus, Tel2 deletion from MEFs had a specific effect on the abundance of all mammalian PIKKs with functional consequences for at least three of the PIKK signaling pathways. We used several other approaches to confirm the effect of Tel2 depletion on the steady-state level of PIKKs. First, we used an shRNA-mediated knockdown system in mouse ES cells that allowed reduction of Tel2 expression through a doxycyclin-inducible shRNA (Figure 4H and I) (Seibler et al., 2007Seibler J. Kleinridders A. Kuter-Luks B. Niehaves S. Bruning J.C. Schwenk F. Reversible gene knockdown in mice using a tight, inducible shRNA expression system (.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e54Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In these cells, the effect of Tel2 loss on the expression of the ATM and mTOR kinases was confirmed. The ES clone shTel2#4 showed the strongest Tel2 knockdown and the greatest loss of ATM and mTOR protein (Figure 4I and data not shown), suggesting that the reduction in the levels of these two PIKKs correlated with the efficiency of Tel2 depletion. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of human Tel2 in hTERT-immortalized BJ fibroblasts resulted in lowered levels of the ATM kinase, indicating that Tel2 controls PIKK expression in human cells as well (Figure 4J). Finally, we determined whether the observed depletion of the PIKK proteins was a secondary effect of changes in the cell cycle progression of Tel2-deficient cells. One observation arguing against this possibility is that in MEFs the reduction in ATM levels was already evident at day 3 after Tel2 deletion (Figure 4E), at which time the cultures still proliferate at the same rate as the controls (Figure 2C and data not shown). When Tel2-deficient cells stop proliferating, they show diminished entry into S phase and arrest with a 2N- and 4N-DNA content (Figure 2B). We therefore asked whether the lowered PIKK levels could be explained from reduced progression through S phase by examining the levels of ATM and mTOR in quiescent cells. However, human fibroblasts that were arrested in G0 through contact inhibition or serum starvation showed no reduction in ATM and mTOR protein levels (Figure S4B). In order to determine the mechanism whereby Tel2 controls the expression of the PIKKs, we examined the effect of Tel2 deficiency on PIKK mRNA levels. Northern blotting revealed that Tel2 deletion did not significantly alter the abundance of the mRNAs for ATM, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, ATR, SMG1, or TRRAP over a period of up to 5 days after deletion of Tel2 (Figure 5A). Additional analysis using other probes to detect the mRNAs and semiquantitative RT-PCR for ATM confirmed that the reduced PIKK levels after Tel2 deletion were not due to lowered mRNA levels (Figure S5 and data not shown). To test whether Tel2 affected the synthesis or stability of the ATM and mTOR kinases, cells were pulse labeled with 35S-methionine and -cysteine and protein extracts were harvested at various time points after a chase with unlabeled amino acids (Figure 5B). The ATM and mTOR kinases were isolated by immunoprecipitation, and their abundance was quantified by autoradiography. Consistent with the largely unaltered mRNA levels, both ATM and mTOR were synthesized at close to normal rates. Three days after Cre treatment, the incorporation of labeled amino acids into ATM and mTOR was 70% and 90% of control cells, respectively. A 260 kDa control protein in the ATM IPs showed a similar reduction in synthesis rate in Tel2-deficient cells (80% of the rate in wild-type control cells). This minor decrease is most likely due to diminished protein synthesis associated with the depletion of mTOR. Tel2 had a profound effect on the stability of ATM and mTOR. In Tel2-proficient control cells, the half-lives of ATM and mTOR were approximately 8 and 18 hr, respectively. In contrast, in the Tel2-depleted cells the half-lives of ATM and mTOR were drastically reduced to 1.5 and 2 hr, respectively (Figures 5C and 5D). As a control, we determined the half-life of the 260 kDa protein in the ATM IPs, which was 4 hr in both the control cells and Tel2-deficient cells. Together the results suggested that the reduction of PIKK protein level was primarily due to the destabilization of PIKKs in absence of Tel2. Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin did not increase the levels of the PIKKs in Tel2-deficient cells (Figures S6A–S6C), and we have not been able to detect ubiquitylated intermediates. Future experiments will have to address the degradation pathway of the PIKKs in Tel2-deficient cells. We considered the possibility that Tel2 might behave like a (co)chaperone for the PIKKs and therefore asked whether Tel2 deletion resulted in mislocalization and/or aggregation of its client proteins. IF analysis did not reveal an altered subcellular distribution of the residual ATM and mTOR in Tel2-deficient cells, and there was no indication of aberrant protein aggregation (Figure S7A). We also tested whether the effect of Tel2 deletion was similar to that of geldanamycin, an inhibitor of Hsp90. Although ATM and DNA-PKcs levels were diminished upon treatment with the geldanamycin analog 17-AAG, neither mTOR nor SMG1 were affected (Figure S7B). Since the effects of 17-AAG and Tel2 deletion are distinct, we consider it unlikely that Tel2 acts as an Hsp90 cochaperone. As Tel2 affected the stability of ATM and mTOR and presumably the other PIKKs, we examined the possibility that Tel2 might be associated with these proteins. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that Tel2 is associated with at least two PIKKs. A dual Flag- and [HA]2-tagged Tel2 protein (FH2-Tel2) was expressed in HeLa S3 cells and sequentially immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag and anti-HA antibody conjugated beads followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of associated proteins. This analysis revealed DNA-PKcs and ATR in the Tel2 complex (Figure 6A). ATR was also identified as a Tel2-associated protein by Boulton and colleagues (Collis et al., 2007Collis S.J. Barber L.J. Clark A.J. Martin J.S. Ward J.D. Boulton S.J. HCLK2 is essential for the mammalian S-phase checkpoint and impacts on Chk1 stability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis showed that ATM, mTOR, and SMG1 were also present in the Tel2 complex derived from HeLa cells (Figure 6B), although their abundance was too low for their detection by MALDI-TOF. A number of control proteins, including Chk2 and PARP1, and several shelterin components were not recovered in association with Flag-Tel2 (Figure 6B and data not shown). The interaction between Tel2 and the PIKKs was also detected for the endogenous proteins (Figure 6C). Endogenous human ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR, and TRRAP were recovered in IPs of the endogenous Tel2 but not in the IP of a control protein (TRF1) (Figure 6C). As an additional negative control, we found that PI3K-γ was not recovered with Tel2. Tel2 also did not show a detectable association with several PIKK-interacting proteins. We were unable to detect ATRIP, Nbs1, or Raptor in the Tel2 IPs (Figure 6C and data not shown), and the expression of Raptor and Nbs1 were unaffected by Tel2 deletion (Figure S4A). Finally, we confirmed the interaction between Tel2 and the PIKKs in mouse cells. Endogenous mouse mTOR and ATM could be coimmunoprecipitated with myc-tagged Tel2 expressed in MEFs, whereas a control protein (MCM2) was not recovered (Figure 6D). MEFs infected with the empty vector served as a control and showed that the recovery of mTOR and ATM in the myc IPs is dependent on Tel2 expression. Collectively, these results indicate that Tel2 can interact with each of the six mammalian PIKKs. Since our mass spectrometry analysis did not reveal potential factors that might mediate the interaction of Tel2 with the PIKKs, we set out to determine whether Tel2 can bind PIKKs directly. Fragments of the ATM kinase were fused to GST and used to pull down Tel2 produced in insect cells (Figure 6E). TRF1 served as a negative control. Tel2 bound to a fragment representing the middle of the HEAT-repeat region (aa 830–1290) as well as to a fragment from the C terminus of ATM representing the kinase domain and the FATC region (aa 2680–3056). Tel2 also bound to a portion of HEAT-repeat region of mTOR (aa 400–806) but did not show a specific interaction with the kinase domain or the FATC region of mTOR (Figure 6F). The ability of Tel2 to bind mTOR directly was further ver"

Open table in a new tab To date most progress in structural studies of nuclear RNA polymerases has been made for Pol II, culminating in the refined atomic structures of the 10-subunit core (Cramer et al., 2001Cramer P.

Structural basis of transcription: RNA polymerase II at 2.8 angstrom resolution.Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) and the complete enzyme (Armache et al., 2005Armache K.-J.

For Pol III, a 17 Å electron microscopy (EM) structure (Fernandez-Tornero et al., 2007Fernandez-Tornero C. Bottcher B. Riva M. Carles C. Steuerwald U. Ruigrok R.W. Sentenac A. Muller C.W. Schoehn G.

Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (for comparability, EM resolutions throughout this paper generally refer to a Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.5). For Pol I, the overall shape and dimensions were first revealed by EM analysis of two-dimensional crystals (Schultz et al., 1993Schultz P. Celia H. Riva M. Sentenac A. Oudet P. Three-dimensional model of yeast RNA polymerase I determined by electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2601-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequent cryo-EM at 34 Å resolution visualized a stalk containing A14/43, and densities for A49 and A34.5 over the central cleft (Bischler et al., 2002Bischler N. Brino L. Carles C. Riva M.

USA. 2002; 99: 14670-14675Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Later EM analysis with cryo-negative staining at 22 Å confirmed the stalk but not the location of A49 and A34.5 (De Carlo et al., 2003De Carlo S. Carles C. Riva M. Schultz P. Cryo-negative staining reveals conformational flexibility within yeast RNA polymerase I.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we integrate structural biology methods to establish the complete subunit architecture and domain organization of Pol I. In addition, we define functional roles for subunits A49, A34.5, and A12.2, and report an intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of Pol I. The results uncover conserved and specific structural and functional principles in eukaryotic RNA polymerases and enable a detailed structure-function analysis of rRNA transcription. To study the Pol I structure in detail, we established a large-scale purification protocol for the complete 14-subunit endogenous enzyme from S. cerevisiae that relies on an initial precipitation step (Gerber et al., 2007Gerber J. Reiter A. Steinbauer R. Jakob S. Kuhn C.-D. Cramer P. Griesenbeck J. Milkereit P. Tschochner H. Site-specific phosphorylation of yeast RNA polymerase I.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; (in press.

Pol I preparations were monodisperse, comprised all subunits in a stoichiometric manner, contained single particles according to EM with negative staining, and enabled collection of high-quality cryo-EM data (Figure 1). The cryo-EM reconstruction with 46,056 particles led to a map at 11.9 Å resolution (Experimental Procedures, Figures 1D and 1E). The crystal structure of the 10-subunit Pol II core was placed into the EM map as a rigid body by fitting the 5 common subunits, which occupy equivalent positions on the polymerases' surfaces (Jasiak et al., 2006Jasiak A.J. Armache K.J. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Cramer P. Structural biology of RNA polymerase III: subcomplex C17/25 X-ray structure and 11 subunit enzyme model.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A perfect fit of the common subunits confirmed the high quality of the map (Figures 2A and 2B). Many regions of the homologous subunits fitted the map equally well, but strong deviations were also observed, in particular at the polymerase clamp and foot (Cramer et al., 2001Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Structural basis of transcription: RNA polymerase II at 2.8 angstrom resolution.Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) (Figures 2D and 2E). The clamp had swung inwards, entirely closing off the cleft (Figures 1E and 1F). This is the predominant state of the enzyme under our EM conditions (Experimental Procedures). To explain differences between the EM map and the Pol II core structure, we constructed a homology model for the Pol I core. Modeling was achieved as for the Pol III core (Jasiak et al., 2006Jasiak A.J. Armache K.J. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Cramer P. Structural biology of RNA polymerase III: subcomplex C17/25 X-ray structure and 11 subunit enzyme model.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but was complicated by the weaker sequence conservation between Pol II and Pol I subunits (Table 1). We identified regions of conserved fold in cycles of sequence alignment, model construction, detection of incorrect internal contacts, realignment of the erroneous sequence stretches, and construction of an improved model (Figures 2C and S1, Experimental Procedures). In the Pol I core model, well-conserved regions cluster around the active site, and peripheral regions are divergent (Figure S1). However, some peripheral Pol I domains, such as the jaw and lobe, resemble in shape the Pol II domains, suggesting that their folds are conserved despite divergent sequences. The predicted conservation of Pol II folds is far less in Pol I (60.8% overall, Table 1) than in Pol III (83.4% for an 11-subunit model [Jasiak et al., 2006Jasiak A.J. Armache K.J. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Cramer P. Structural biology of RNA polymerase III: subcomplex C17/25 X-ray structure and 11 subunit enzyme model.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar]). Inspection of the EM map after placement of the core model confirmed the expected conservation of the active center, including the bridge helix, but also identified many structural features that create a Pol I-specific surface. The clamp shows two insertions near zinc site 7 (“clamp knob”) and an extended, structurally different clamp head (Figures 1E and 2E). The dock domain shows density for a predicted (Chen and Hahn, 2003Chen H.T. Hahn S. Binding of TFIIB to RNA polymerase II: Mapping the binding site for the TFIIB zinc ribbon domain within the preinitiation complex.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) Pol I-specific 14-residue extension (Figures 2C and 2E). In AC40, two surface elements differ from Rpb3 (Figures 2C and 2E). The foot domain has a divergent sequence, is 62 residues shorter, and has a different shape than in Pol II (Figures 2C and 2E). The jaw region contains 93 additional residues (Figure 2C), which are not conserved among fungi and lack EM density, showing they are mobile. A12.2 occupies the location of the Pol II core subunit Rpb9 and is thus a structural counterpart of Rpb9, not TFIIS (Figure 2B). After assigning EM densities to the Pol I core, a stalk-like density remained at the expected location for A14/43 that was much smaller than the structure of Rpb4/7 (Figures 1E, 2A, and S3). Since the weak sequence similarity between A14/43 and Rpb4/7 or C17/25 did not allow for homology modeling, we determined the crystal structure of A14/43 (Experimental Procedures). Partial proteolysis of a recombinant A14/43 heterodimer and bioinformatics revealed four mobile regions in A14/43 that were dispensable for dimerization (Figures 3A and S4). An A14/43 variant lacking the mobile regions crystallized and enabled structure determination at 3.1 Å resolution (Figure 3B and Table S1). The overall structure of A14/43 resembles its counterparts Rpb4/7 (Armache et al., 2005Armache K.-J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. Structures of complete RNA polymerase II and its subcomplex Rpb4/7.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), C17/25 (Jasiak et al., 2006Jasiak A.J. Armache K.J. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Cramer P. Structural biology of RNA polymerase III: subcomplex C17/25 X-ray structure and 11 subunit enzyme model.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the archaeal RpoF/E (Todone et al., 2001Todone F. Brick P. Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Onesti S. Structure of an archaeal homolog of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II RPB4/RPB7 complex.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), except that A14 lacks the HRDC domain present in all counterparts (Figures 3B and S4). The N-terminal tip domain of A43 shows RMS deviations in Cα atom positions of 2.2–2.5 Å, whereas the C-terminal OB domain is more divergent. A14 forms two helices that pack on the A43 tip domain (Figures 3B and S4). In Pol II, the Rpb4/7 complex interacts with the core enzyme via two loops, the A1-K1 loop, which forms a conserved contact of Rpb4/7-like subcomplexes with their cognate core enzymes, and the tip loop, which may confer specificity to the interaction in the different RNA polymerases (Armache et al., 2005Armache K.-J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. Structures of complete RNA polymerase II and its subcomplex Rpb4/7.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Jasiak et al., 2006Jasiak A.J. Armache K.J. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Cramer P. Structural biology of RNA polymerase III: subcomplex C17/25 X-ray structure and 11 subunit enzyme model.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To dock the A14/43 structure into the EM map, we modeled the conserved contact between an invariant proline residue in the A1-K1 loop (P51 in A43, Figures 3B and 3D) and the common core subunit Rpb6 (Armache et al., 2005Armache K.-J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. Structures of complete RNA polymerase II and its subcomplex Rpb4/7.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Jasiak et al., 2006Jasiak A.J. Armache K.J. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Cramer P. Structural biology of RNA polymerase III: subcomplex C17/25 X-ray structure and 11 subunit enzyme model.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The tip domain and the tip-associated domain of the A14/43 structure fitted well to the EM map, and the lack of an HRDC domain could in part explain the smaller EM density (Figure 3C). However, the peripheral OB domain of A43 was not revealed in the EM density (Figure 3C), suggesting a high degree of mobility. Consistently, the OB domain shows slightly higher B factors in the crystal structure, although it is involved in crystal contacts (Figure S5), and normal mode analysis of the Pol II crystal structure shows that the OB domain is the most flexible region of the enzyme (not shown). The A43 tip loop contains a specific ten-residue insertion that may confer specificity to the interaction between A14/43 and the Pol I core (Figure S4). The A43 tip loop is flexible in the crystal structure (Figures 3B and S4), but is likely folded upon binding to the Pol I core, as observed for Pol II (Armache et al., 2005Armache K.-J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. Structures of complete RNA polymerase II and its subcomplex Rpb4/7.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Subunit A43 forms an essential bridge to the conserved Pol I initiation factor Rrn3 (Milkereit and Tschochner, 1998Milkereit P. Tschochner H.

The recruitment of RNA polymerase I on rDNA is mediated by the interaction of the A43 subunit with RRN3.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5473-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Rrn3 was shown by EM to colocalize with A43 (Peyroche et al., 2000Peyroche G. Milkereit P. Bischler N. Tschochner H. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Riva M. The recruitment of RNA polymerase I on rDNA is mediated by the interaction of the A43 subunit with RRN3.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5473-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and binds other initiation factors to recruit Pol I to the rDNA promoter. The A43-Rrn3 interaction is conserved in human (Yuan et al., 2002Yuan X. Zhao J. Zentgraf H. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Grummt I. Multiple interactions between RNA polymerase I, TIF-IA and TAFI subunits regulate preinitiation complex assembly at the ribosomal gene promoter.EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and S. pombe (Imazawa et al., 2005Imazawa Y.

The fission yeast protein Ker1p is an ortholog of RNA polymerase I subunit A14 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is required for stable association of RRN3p and RPA21 in RNA polymerase I.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11467-11474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In a Pol I variant that is defective for Rrn3 interaction (rpa43-6 [Peyroche et al., 2000Peyroche G. Milkereit P. Bischler N. Tschochner H. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Riva M. The recruitment of RNA polymerase I on rDNA is mediated by the interaction of the A43 subunit with RRN3.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5473-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar]), two out of three altered A43 residues map near conserved residues on the upstream surface of A14/43 (Figure 3D). Thus Rrn3 binds to A14/43 from the upstream side (Figure 1E). Additional Pol I-specific surfaces in the vicinity include the extended dock domain and the clamp knob, which together with A14/43 create a specific upstream face for Pol I initiation complex assembly (Figure 1, Figure 2). Differential initiation factor interactions and promoter specificity of the three polymerases may generally result from differently structured dock domains, clamps, and Rpb4/7-like subcomplexes, which all constitute initiation factor binding sites. Rpb4/7 is required for Pol II initiation (Edwards et al., 1991Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. Two dissociable subunits of yeast RNA polymerase II stimulate the initiation of transcription at a promoter in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C17/25 binds to the Pol III initiation factor TFIIIB (Ferri et al., 2000Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Siaut M. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Conesa C. Sentenac A.

A mutation in the C31 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase III affects transcription initiation.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and to the initiation factor TFIIIC (Hsieh et al., 1999Hsieh Y.J. Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. The TFIIIC90 subunit of TFIIIC interacts with multiple components of the RNA polymerase III machinery and contains a histone-specific acetyltransferase activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7697-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Since the surfaces, flexibility, and in vivo function of the HRDC domains differ in Rpb4/7 and C17/25 (Jasiak et al., 2006Jasiak A.J. Armache K.J. Martens B. Jansen R.P. Cramer P.

Cell. 2006; 23: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the absence of an HRDC domain in A14/43 is likely functionally significant. After assigning EM densities to the Pol I core and A14/43, one additional large density remained on the enzyme surface that was assigned to the Pol I-specific subunits A49 and A34.5 (Figure 1E). To confirm this assignment, we dissociated subunits A49 and A34.5 from Pol I with the use of urea (Huet et al., 1975Huet J. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Dissociation of two polypeptide chains from yeast RNA polymerase A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 3034-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), purified the resulting 12-subunit variant Pol I ΔA49/34.5 (previously called Pol A∗ [Huet et al., 1975Huet J. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Dissociation of two polypeptide chains from yeast RNA polymerase A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 3034-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar]), and solved its structure by cryo-EM at 25 Å resolution (Figures 4A and 4B; Experimental Procedures). The structure was similar to the complete Pol I, except that the density assigned to A49 and A34.5 was lacking (Figure 4B). In addition, there was a minor change in the clamp conformation, which however represents an average clamp position and is unlikely to result from the absence of A49/34.5 (Experimental Procedures). Density assigned to A49 and A34.5 is located near the enzyme funnel, the external domain 1, a conserved core loop with a Pol I-specific insertion (corresponding to loop α16-β20 of the Pol II pore domain), and A12.2. This is consistent with loss of A49 when Pol I is purified from A12.2 deletion strains (Van Mullem et al., 2002Van Mullem V. Landrieux E. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. Rpa12p, a conserved RNA polymerase I subunit with two functional domains.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate the structure and function of A49 and A34.5, we searched for weak homologies with HHpred (Soding et al., 2005Soding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Local homologies were detected between A49 and RAP74, the large subunit of the Pol II-associated factor TFIIF, and between A34.5 and RAP30, the small TFIIF subunit (Figure S6 and Experimental Procedures). Consistently, the N-terminal regions of A49 and A34.5 were predicted to contain β strands consistent with the fold of the RAP74-RAP30 dimerization module (Gaiser et al., 2000Gaiser F. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Novel dimerization fold of RAP30/RAP74 in human TFIIF at 1.7 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and hydrophobic core residues in this fold were predicted to be conserved (Figures 4C and S6). Consistent with these predictions, bacterial coexpression of A49 and A34.5 enabled isolation of a stoichiometric A49/34.5 heterodimer (Figure 4D and Experimental Procedures) and alanine point mutations in three diffe"

In addition, many of the genes and pathways described here, e.g. those involved in signal transduction and sulfur metabolism, have been identified previously within the epsilon subdivision only in S. denitrificans, W. succinogenes, Sulfurovum, and/or Nitratiruptor, or are unique to the subdivision. In addition, the analyses indicated also that a substantial proportion of the A. butzleri genome is devoted to growth and survival under diverse environmental conditions, with a large number of respiration-associated proteins, signal transduction and chemotaxis proteins and proteins involved in DNA repair and adaptation. To investigate the genomic diversity of A. butzleri strains, we constructed an A. butzleri DNA microarray comprising 2238 genes from strain RM4018. Comparative genomic indexing analysis of 12 additional A. butzleri strains identified both the core genes of A. butzleri and intraspecies hypervariable regions, where <70% of the genes were present in at least two strains. Conclusion/Significance The presence of pathways and loci associated often with non-host-associated organisms, as well as genes associated with virulence, suggests that A. butzleri is a free-living, water-borne organism that might be classified rightfully as an emerging pathogen. The genome sequence and analyses presented in this study are an important first step in understanding the physiology and genetics of this organism, which constitutes a bridge between the environment and mammalian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2049505878,"Background During acute infection and inflammation, dramatic shifts in tissue metabolism are typical, thereby resulting in profound tissue hypoxia. Therefore, we pursued the hypothesis, that tissue hypoxia may influence innate immune responses by transcriptional modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLRs) expression and function. Methodology/Principal Findings We gained first insight from transcriptional profiling of murine dendritic cells exposed to hypoxia (2% oxygen for 24 h). While transcript levels of other TLRs remained unchanged, we found a robust induction of TLR2 (2.36±0.7-fold; P<0.05) and TLR6 (3.46±1.56-fold; P<0.05). Additional studies in different cells types and cell-lines including human dendritic cells, monocytic cells (MM6), endothelia (HMEC-1) or intestinal epithelia (Caco-2) confirmed TLR2 and TLR6 induction of transcript, protein and function during hypoxia. Furthermore, analysis of the putative TLR2 and TLR6 promoters revealed previously unrecognized binding sites for HIF-1, which were shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to bind the pivotal hypoxia-regulating transcription factor HIF-1alpha. Studies using loss and gain of function of HIF-1 confirmed a critical role of HIF-1alpha in coordinating TLR2 and TLR6 induction. Moreover, studies of murine hypoxia (8% oxygen over 6 h) showed TLR2 and TLR 6 induction in mucosal organs in vivo. In contrast, hypoxia induction of TLR2 and TLR6 was abolished in conditional HIF-1α mutant mice. Conclusions/Significance Taking together, these studies reveal coordinated induction of TLR2 and TLR6 during hypoxia and suggest tissue hypoxia in transcriptional adaptation of innate immune responses during acute infection or inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2027267546,"The symmetric core of the nuclear pore complex can be considered schematically as a series of concentric cylinders. A peripheral cylinder coating the pore membrane contains the previously characterized, elongated heptamer that harbors Sec13-Nup145C in its middle section. Strikingly, Sec13-Nup145C crystallizes as a hetero-octamer in two space groups. Oligomerization of Sec13-Nup145C was confirmed biochemically. Importantly, the numerous interacting surfaces in the hetero-octamer are evolutionarily highly conserved, further underlining the physiological relevance of the oligomerization. The hetero-octamer forms a slightly curved, yet rigid rod of sufficient length to span the entire height of the proposed membrane-adjacent cylinder. In concordance with the dimensions and symmetry of the nuclear pore complex core, we suggest that the cylinder is constructed of four antiparallel rings, each ring being composed of eight heptamers arranged in a head-to-tail fashion. Our model proposes that the hetero-octamer would vertically traverse and connect the four stacked rings."
https://openalex.org/W2151805419,"Background Empirical data showing the clear benefits of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for HIV prevention are needed to encourage implementation of lactation support programs for HIV-infected women in low resource settings among whom replacement feeding is unsafe. We conducted a prospective, observational study in Lusaka, Zambia, to test the hypothesis that EBF is associated with a lower risk of postnatal HIV transmission than non-EBF. Methods and Results As part of a randomized trial of early weaning, 958 HIV-infected women and their infants were recruited and all were encouraged to breastfeed exclusively to 4 months. Single-dose nevirapine was provided to prevent transmission. Regular samples were collected from infants to 24 months of age and tested by PCR. Detailed measurements of actual feeding behaviors were collected to examine, in an observational analysis, associations between feeding practices and postnatal HIV transmission. Uptake of EBF was high with 84% of women reporting only EBF cumulatively to 4 months. Post-natal HIV transmission before 4 months was significantly lower (p = 0.004) among EBF (0.040 95% CI: 0.024–0.055) than non-EBF infants (0.102 95% CI: 0.047–0.157); time-dependent Relative Hazard (RH) of transmission due to non-EBF = 3.48 (95% CI: 1.71–7.08). There were no significant differences in the severity of disease between EBF and non-EBF mothers and the association remained significant (RH = 2.68 95% CI: 1.28–5.62) after adjusting for maternal CD4 count, plasma viral load, syphilis screening results and low birth weight. Conclusions Non-EBF more than doubles the risk of early postnatal HIV transmission. Programs to support EBF should be expanded universally in low resource settings. EBF is an affordable, feasible, acceptable, safe and sustainable practice that also reduces HIV transmission providing HIV-infected women with a means to protect their children's lives.

https://openalex.org/W2091155023,"The majority of the BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative disorders express the mutant JAK2, JAK2V617F. Previously we showed that constitutive activation of this oncogenic JAK2 mutant in Ba/F3 or 32D cells requires coexpression of a cognate homodimeric cytokine receptor, such as the EpoR. However, overexpression of JAK2V617F in Ba/F3 cells renders them cytokine-independent for growth in the absence of an exogenous cytokine receptor. Here, we demonstrated that JAK2V617F domains required for receptor association are essential for cytokine-independent growth by overexpressed JAK2V617F, suggesting JAK2V617F is binding to an unknown endogenous cytokine receptor(s) for its activation. We further showed that disruption of EpoR dimerization by coexpressing a truncated EpoR disrupted JAK2V617F-mediated transformation, indicating that EpoR dimerization plays an essential role in the activation of JAK2V617F. Interestingly, coexpression of JAK2V617F with EpoR mutants that retain JAK2 binding but are defective in mediating Epo-dependent JAK2 activation due to mutations in a conserved juxtamembrane motif does lead to cytokine-independent activation of JAK2V617F.

The Janus family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases are key mediators of cytokine receptor signaling and play a central role in hematopoiesis and immune responses. In mammals there are four Janus kinases (JAKs), 2The abbreviations used are:JAKJanus kinaseEpoerythropoietinEpoRerythropoietin receptorEBPEpo-binding proteinEMPEpo mimetic peptideHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are:JAKJanus kinaseEpoerythropoietinEpoRerythropoietin receptorEBPEpo-binding proteinEMPEpo mimetic peptideHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent protein. JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2. JAKs contain seven highly conserved domains named JAK homology (JH) domains 1–7. The C-terminal JH1 domain is a functional tyrosine kinase that becomes activated following cytokine stimulation (1Yamaoka K. Saharinen P. Pesu M. Holt V.E. 3rd Silvennoinen O. O'Shea J.J.

JAK2 is essential for signaling by receptors for growth hormone, prolactin, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, and interleukin-5; major downstream signal transduction effectors are the STAT5, Ras/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways (1Yamaoka K.

Similar to JAK2V617F, these mutations lead to constitutive JAK activation and cytokine-independent growth of hematopoietic cell lines. The JH2 pseudokinase domain represents a key negative regulator of JAK kinase activity, and its disruption has been increasingly recognized as a cause of many myeloproliferative disorders and other hematopoietic malignancies. Using the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 and 32D cell lines, we showed that expression of JAK2V617F confers factor-independent growth only in cells coexpressing homodimeric type 1 cytokine receptors such as the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), thrombopoietin receptor, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. Not surprisingly, coexpression of these cytokine receptors is also required for the constitutive phosphorylation and thus activation of JAK2 and STAT5. By coexpressing JAK2V617F together with EpoR mutants, we demonstrated that EpoR provides an essential scaffold for JAK2V617F; we hypothesized that two molecules of JAK2V617F, each bound to the cytoplasmic domain of a homodimeric EpoR, phosphorylates and transactivates each other. Furthermore, (phospho-)tyrosines in the cytosolic domain of the EpoR are essential for the phosphorylation of STAT5 through activated JAK2V617F and for the maximal Epo-independent cell proliferation (20Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y. Zarnegar S. Gilliland D.G. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18962-18967Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We concluded that JAK2 V617F transduces oncogenic signals only in conjunction with cognate cytokine receptors, in a cytokine-independent version of its normal signaling mechanisms. In this respect JAK2V617F is quite different from other constitutively active mutant cytoplasmic kinases such as the TEL-JAK2 or BCR/ABL oncoproteins (7Lacronique V. Boureux A. Valle V.D. Poirel H. Quang C.T. Mauchauffe M. Berthou C. Lessard M. Berger R. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A. Science. 1997; 278: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 21Ren R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), which do not require binding to any receptor for kinase activation and phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins. This finding also provided a molecular basis for the prevalence of JAK2V617F in diseases of myeloid cells that express cognate homodimeric type I cytokine receptors, and for the overlapping clinical observations in these diseases. Other groups confirmed our finding that expression of JAK2V617F in Ba/F3 cells does not trigger factor-independent growth unless a homodimeric cytokine receptor is coexpressed (22Bumm T.G. Elsea C. Corbin A.S. Loriaux M. Sherbenou D. Wood L. Deininger J. Silver R.T. Druker B.J. Deininger M.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11156-11165Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the same cytokine receptor dependence has been shown in 32D cells (20Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y. Zarnegar S. Gilliland D.G. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18962-18967Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, some reports showed that expression of JAK2V617F alone (i.e. without coexpression of a cytokine receptor) could transform Ba/F3 cells, and co-expressing EpoR only increased the extent of JAK2V617F phosphorylation and its transformation potential (10James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41893-41899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here we resolve this controversy. We show that expression in Ba/F3 cells of JAK2V617F at levels commensurate with those of endogenous JAK2 leads to factor-independent growth only if a homodimeric cytokine receptor is coexpressed. In contrast, overexpression of JAK2V617F at levels 10-fold that of the endogenous JAK2 does lead to factor-independent growth without coexpression of a cytokine receptor. Likely, JAK2V617F is binding to some unknown endogenous cytokine receptor(s), because JAK2 domains required for receptor association, JH3-JH7, are essential for cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells overexpressing JAK2V617F, and an Y119E mutation in the JH7 domain that eliminates the receptor association of JAK2 (24Funakoshi-Tago M. Pelletier S. Matsuda T. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4763-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), also disrupts JAK2V617F-mediated constitutive growth in Ba/F3 cells. Using Ba/F3 cells that express JAK2V617F at a low level, comparable to endogenous JAK2, we further showed that disruption of EpoR dimerization attenuated cytokine-independent growth, indicating that EpoR dimerization plays an essential role in the activation of JAK2V617F. Furthermore, we showed that coexpression of JAK2V617F with EpoR mutants in a conserved juxtamembrane domain that retain JAK2 binding but are defective in Epo-dependent JAK2 activation, do exhibit cytokine-independent signaling and cell proliferation. This indicates that key EpoR residues essential for Epo-dependent activation of JAK2 are not essential for JAK2V617F activation. Our work suggests that the structure of the constitutively activated JAK2V617F is likely to be different from that of an Epo-activated wild-type JAK2. This raises the possibility that it could be specifically targeted by small molecule therapeutics. Expression Vectors—The murine JAK2 cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector MSCV-Neo. The JAK2V617F mutation was generated in MSCV-Neo using site-directed mutagenesis (Quikchange-XL, Stratagene) and confirmed by full-length DNA sequencing (20Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y.

JH1–2 and JH1–2V617F were generated by PCR amplification of the DNA segments between codon 535 (methionine) and the stop codon in JAK2 and JAK2V617F cDNAs and then cloned into the same MSCV-IRES-GFP vector. JH1–2 cDNA were also fused with the TEL part (codon 1–316) of a human TEL-JAK2 cDNA (6Schwaller J. Frantsve J. Aster J. Williams I.R. Tomasson M.H. Ross T.S. Peeters P. Van Rompaey L. Van Etten R.A.

To assess factor-independent growth, cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and cultured in the absence of Epo and IL-3 for 5 days. The number of viable cells was determined by Trypan Blue exclusion at different time points. In cells expressing wild-type or mutant EpoRs, their responses to Epo stimulation was measured by incubating cells with various concentration of Epo. The number of viable cells was determined at the end of the 3-day incubation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Ba/F3 cells stably expressing JAK2 or EpoR were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) with sodium vanadate and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Proteins in these lysates were either immunoprecipitated with antibodies against JAK2 (Upstate) or STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) first, or directly separated through SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting were performed after transferring the SDS-PAGE to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis: anti-JAK2 (polyclonal antibody, Upstate), anti-STAT5 (c-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-tyrosine (4G10) (Upstate), anti-phospho-JAK2 (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-STAT5 (Cell Signaling), anti-EpoR (m-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (HA11, Covance), peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences). High Expression of JAK2V617F Circumvents the Requirement for an Ectopic Cytokine Receptor—In our previous work we introduced murine JAK2V617F into IL-3 dependent murine Ba/F3 cells using retroviruses generated from the MSCV-JAK2V617F-Neo vector. In the G418-selected cells, we observed no cytokine-independent growth unless a homodimeric cytokine receptor such as the EpoR was coexpressed. This observation supported the notion that cytokine receptors serve as scaffolds for the constitutive activation of JAK2 V617F, and its ability to transform Ba/F3 cells (20Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y. Zarnegar S. Gilliland D.G. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18962-18967Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, others reported that exogenous expression of EpoR only enhances the transformation of Ba/F3 cells by JAK2V617F, but is not essential (10James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41893-41899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To clarify this critical difference, we infected Ba/F3 cells with MSCV-JAK2-IRES-GFP and MSCV-JAK2V617F-IRES-GEP vector-based retroviruses, similar to those used in the contrary studies (10James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W. Nature. 2005; 434: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar), and sorted for GFP-positive cells. We named these cells Ba/F3-JAK2(GFP) and Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(GFP) to differentiate them from the G418-selected Ba/F3 cells derived from the MSCV-JAK2V617F-Neo vectors, to which we refer as Ba/F3-JAK2(Neo) and Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(Neo) cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(Neo) cells require the co-expression of EpoR for factor-independent proliferation, while Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(GFP) cells proliferate independently of coexpression of EpoR. The growth rate of Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(GFP) cells is similar to that of the Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(Neo) cells co-expressing EpoR. We suspected that differences in JAK2V617F expression levels account for this discrepancy, and thus we compared the amount of JAK2 protein in these cells by Western blotting with an anti-JAK2 antibody (Fig. 1B). Ba/F3-JAK2(Neo) and Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(Neo) cells contained roughly twice the amount of JAK2 protein of parental Ba/F3 cells, indicating that the ectopic JAK2 and JAK2V617F were expressed at levels close to that of endogenous JAK2. In contrast, the ectopic JAK2 and JAK2V617F proteins were expressed at levels about 10-fold that of endogenous JAK2 in Ba/F3-JAK2(GFP) and BA/F3-JAK2V617F-GFP cells. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1B, we could not detect EpoR protein in any of the Ba/F3 cells unless EpoR was ectopically introduced. The same number of mouse fetal liver cells (FLC) were used as positive control for EpoR expression, and the levels of exogenous EpoR expression in the Ba/F3 cells were about 10-fold that in the fetal liver cells. We do not know why the MSCV-IRES-GFP and MSCV-Neo vectors express such different amounts of encoded protein. We hypothesize that the high JAK2V617F level in Ba/F3-JAK2V617F(GFP) cells allows it to signal through binding to the cytosolic domain of the endogenous IL-3 receptor or another perhaps unknown cytokine receptor that is expressed at a low level. Considering that JAK2V617F has to compete with the endogenous wild-type JAK2 for receptor association, a 10-fold increase in JAK2V617F protein level may allow JAK2V617F to saturate the limited number of endogenous cytokine receptors in Ba/F3 cells, and generate enough signal to support cytokine-independent proliferation. JAK2 Domains Essential for Receptor Association Are Required for JAK2V617F-mediated Activation—JAK2 associates with the membrane-proximal segment of cytokine receptors through its JH3 to JH7 domains (3Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A truncated JAK2 without its JH3 to JH7 domains fails to bind to cytokine receptors and the JH1 kinase domain remains inactive due to inhibition by the JH2 pseudokinase domain (2Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A fusion of this truncated JAK2 with the dimerization domain of the TEL transcription factor, mimicking the oncogenic TEL-JAK2 protein, does lead to constitutive activation and factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells (6Schwaller J. Frantsve J. Aster J. Williams I.R. Tomasson M.H. Ross T.S. Peeters P. Van Rompaey L. Van Etten R.A. Ilaria Jr., R. Marynen P. Gilliland D.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5321-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To further test the hypothesis that high expression levels of JAK2V617F allow it to signal through endogenous cytokine receptors, we removed the JH3 to JH7 domains of JAK2 that are responsible for receptor binding. We named this truncated JAK2 protein, containing residues 535–1129, as JH1–2. We then introduced the V617F mutation to this protein (named JH1–2V617F), and inserted these coding sequences into the overexpressing MSCV-IRES-GFP vector. We also used an in-frame fusion of the N terminus of human TEL (residues 1–316) and JH1–2, named TEL-JAK2, as a positive control that should exhibit factor-independent cell proliferation. When introduced in Ba/F3 cells using the MSCV-IRES-GFP vector-based retroviruses, both JH1–2 and JH1–2V617F were expressed at even higher levels than full-length JAK2V617F (Fig. 2A). In contrast to full-length JAK2V617F, JH1–2V617F could not support cytokine-independent growth. However, when the same JH1–2 region was fusion to the TEL oligomerization domain, the resulting TEL-JAK2 fusion protein did transform Ba/F3 cells to growth factor independence (Fig. 2B). We next determined whether any of these mutant JAK2 proteins are capable of constitutive auto-phosphorylation, and more importantly if elevated expression of these mutants can activate the major downstream signaling protein STAT5 that is normally recruited by cytokine receptors. To this end Ba/F3 cells expressing JAK2, JAK2V617F, JH1–2, JH1–2V617F, or TEL-JAK2, in the MSCV-IRES-GFP vector-based retroviruses, were starved for 4 h without IL-3. Activation of JAK2 was detected by Western blot with an antibody specifically recognizing the phosphorylated activation loop tyrosines (Tyr-1007, Tyr-1008) (Fig. 2C). Starved parental Ba/F3 cells and IL-3-treated Ba/F3 cells were used as controls. STAT5 proteins in IL-3 starved cells were immunoprecipitated, and phospho-STAT5 were probed by Western blot with 4G10 (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2C showed that, following starvation of growth factors, only JAK2V617F and TEL-JAK2 were phosphorylated in the activation loop, indicating their activation. Consequently, only cells expressing JAK2V617F and TEL-JAK2 showed constitutive phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 2D). Thus, while constitutive activation of overexpressed JAK2V617F can occur in the absence of coexpression of the EpoR or other cytokine receptor, this activation requires the presence of the JH3 to JH7 domains, suggesting that association of JAK2V617F to some endogenous cytokine receptor is required for its constitutive activation. Published results (2Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) taken together with our data on the reconstructed TEL-JAK2, indicate that deleting the JH3 to JH7 domains does not compromise the potential kinase activity of the JH1 domain. The loss of JAK2 activation in the deletion mutants would be the consequence of deleting the segments"
https://openalex.org/W2110260644,"The FtsK/SpoIIIE family of ATP-dependent DNA transporters mediates proper chromosome segregation in dividing bacteria. In sporulating Bacillus subtilis cells, SpoIIIE translocates much of the circular chromosome from the mother cell into the forespore, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Using a new assay to monitor DNA transport, we demonstrate that the two arms of the chromosome are simultaneously pumped into the forespore. Up to 70 molecules of SpoIIIE are recruited to the site of DNA translocation and assemble into complexes that could contain 12 subunits. The fusion of the septal membranes during cytokinesis precedes DNA translocation and does not require SpoIIIE, as suggested by analysis of lipid dynamics, serial thin-section electron microscopy, and cell separation by protoplasting. These data support a model for DNA transport in which the transmembrane segments of FtsK/SpoIIIE form linked DNA-conducting channels across the two lipid bilayers of the septum."
https://openalex.org/W2067997771,"Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is the morphological hallmark of a rare familial or sporadic unclassified heart disease of heterogeneous origin. NVM results presumably from a congenital developmental error and has been traced back to single point mutations in various genes. The objective of this study was to determine the underlying genetic defect in a large German family suffering from NVM. Twenty four family members were clinically assessed using advanced imaging techniques. For molecular characterization, a genome-wide linkage analysis was undertaken and the disease locus was mapped to chromosome 14ptel-14q12. Subsequently, two genes of the disease interval, MYH6 and MYH7 (encoding the α- and β-myosin heavy chain, respectively) were sequenced, leading to the identification of a previously unknown de novo missense mutation, c.842G>C, in the gene MYH7. The mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid in the myosin subfragment-1 (R281T). In silico simulations suggest that the mutation R281T prevents the formation of a salt bridge between residues R281 and D325, thereby destabilizing the myosin head. The mutation was exclusively present in morphologically affected family members. A few members of the family displayed NVM in combination with other heart defects, such as dislocation of the tricuspid valve (Ebstein's anomaly, EA) and atrial septal defect (ASD). A high degree of clinical variability was observed, ranging from the absence of symptoms in childhood to cardiac death in the third decade of life. The data presented in this report provide first evidence that a mutation in a sarcomeric protein can cause noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2091876427,"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is closely associated with important pathologies including stroke, seizures and migraine. The mechanisms underlying SD in its various forms are still incompletely understood. Here we describe SD-like events in an invertebrate model, the ventilatory central pattern generator (CPG) of locusts. Using K+ -sensitive microelectrodes, we measured extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) in the metathoracic neuropile of the CPG while monitoring CPG output electromyographically from muscle 161 in the second abdominal segment to investigate the role K+ in failure of neural circuit operation induced by various stressors. Failure of ventilation in response to different stressors (hyperthermia, anoxia, ATP depletion, Na+/K+ ATPase impairment, K+ injection) was associated with a disturbance of CNS ion homeostasis that shares the characteristics of CSD and SD-like events in vertebrates. Hyperthermic failure was preconditioned by prior heat shock (3 h, 45°C) and induced-thermotolerance was associated with an increase in the rate of clearance of extracellular K+ that was not linked to changes in ATP levels or total Na+/K+ ATPase activity. Our findings suggest that SD-like events in locusts are adaptive to terminate neural network operation and conserve energy during stress and that they can be preconditioned by experience. We propose that they share mechanisms with CSD in mammals suggesting a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W2065163644,"Background Research aimed at developing vaccines against infectious diseases generally seeks to induce robust immune responses to immunodominant antigens. This approach has led to a number of efficient bacterial and viral vaccines, but it has yet to do so for parasitic pathogens. For malaria, a disease of global importance due to infection by Plasmodium protozoa, immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites uniquely leads to long lasting sterile immunity against infection. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP), an important component of the sporozoite's surface, remains the leading candidate antigen for vaccines targeting the parasite's pre-erythrocytic stages. Difficulties in developing CSP-based vaccines that reproduce the levels of protection afforded by radiation-attenuated sporozoites have led us to question the role of CSP in the acquisition of sterile immunity. We have used a parasite transgenic for the CSP because it allowed us to test whether a major immunodominant Plasmodium antigen is indeed needed for the induction of sterile protective immunity against infection. Methodology/Main Findings We employed a P. berghei parasite line that expresses a heterologous CSP from P. falciparum in order to assess the role of the CSP in the protection conferred by vaccination with radiation-attenuated P. berghei parasites. Our data demonstrated that sterile immunity could be obtained despite the absence of immune responses specific to the CSP expressed by the parasite used for challenge. Conclusions We conclude that other pre-erythrocytic parasite antigens, possibly hitherto uncharacterised, can be targeted to induce sterile immunity against malaria. From a broader perspective, our results raise the question as to whether immunodominant parasite antigens should be the favoured targets for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2049526812,"Apolipoprotein AII (apoAII) transgenic (apoAIItg) mice exhibit several traits associated with the insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, including IR, obesity, and a marked hypertriglyceridemia. Because treatment of the apoAIItg mice with rosiglitazone ameliorated the IR and hypertriglyceridemia, we hypothesized that the hypertriglyceridemia was due largely to overproduction of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver, a normal response to chronically elevated insulin and glucose. We now report in vivo and in vitro studies that indicate that hepatic fatty acid oxidation was reduced and lipogenesis increased, resulting in a 25% increase in triglyceride secretion in the apoAIItg mice. In addition, we observed that hydrolysis of triglycerides from both chylomicrons and VLDL was significantly reduced in the apoAIItg mice, further contributing to the hypertriglyceridemia. This is a direct, acute effect, because when mouse apoAII was injected into mice, plasma triglyceride concentrations were significantly increased within 4 h. VLDL from both control and apoAIItg mice contained significant amounts of apoAII, with ∼4 times more apoAII on apoAIItg VLDL. ApoAII was shown to transfer spontaneously from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to VLDL in vitro, resulting in VLDL that was a poorer substrate for hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase. These results indicate that one function of apoAII is to regulate the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, with HDL serving as a plasma reservoir of apoAII that is transferred to the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in much the same way as VLDL and chylomicrons acquire most of their apoCs from HDL.

Hypertriglyceridemia is an integral component of the phenotype of several disease states, including type 2 diabetes, familial combined hyperlipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome, and it is likely to be one of several contributing factors underlying the increased atherosclerosis associated with these complex diseases. Hypertriglyceridemia has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for the development of premature atherosclerosis, although the mechanisms involved are unclear (23Sharrett A.R.

It is known that larger, more triglyceride-rich VLDL (VLDL1) are the precursors for the more atherogenic small dense LDL (25Packard C.J. Demant T. Stewart J.P. Bedford D. Caslake M.J. Schwertfeger G. Bedynek A. Shepherd J. Seidel D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 305-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, intermediate density lipoproteins, or remnant lipoprotein particles, which also derive from the catabolism of VLDL, are also pro-atherogenic (26Mahley R.W. Huang Y.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 94-98Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hypertriglyceridemia also increases the availability of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), which can dramatically alter metabolism in several tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose, inducing additional metabolic changes such as obesity and insulin resistance. It is noteworthy that the plasma levels of FFA are increased under conditions in which apoAII is elevated, both in mice and humans (9Warden C.H. Daluiski A. Bu X. Purcell-Huynh D.A. De Meester C. Shieh B.H. Puppione D.L. Gray R.M. Reaven G.M. Chen Y.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10886-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While type 2 diabetes is clearly associated with hypertriglyceridemia, the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. Hypertriglyceridemia can increase the availability of fatty acids to various tissues, primarily skeletal muscle and adipose, after hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase. Mice that have a muscle-specific overexpression of lipoprotein lipase develop skeletal muscle insulin resistance as a consequence of increased fatty acids taken up from plasma triglycerides (27Ferreira L.D. Pulawa L.K. Jensen D.R. Eckel R.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, insulin resistance can occur as a result of hypertriglyceridemia. On the other hand, chronic increases in plasma insulin concentrations and fatty acids, as would occur in obesity and type 2 diabetes, have been demonstrated to cause hypertriglyceridemia through increased production of VLDL by the liver (28Ginsberg H.N.

In this scheme, which currently enjoys widespread acceptance with respect to the etiology of hypertriglyceridemia associated with type 2 diabetes, increased FFA released from the adipose tissue are cleared by the liver, and due to chronic exposure to insulin, VLDL synthesis is increased. We previously demonstrated that mice, which overexpress mouse apoA-II, exhibit a marked hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and increased plasma FFA, as well as insulin resistance, increased adiposity, and increased atherosclerosis (3Castellani L.W.

Treatment of the apoAIItg mice with an insulinsensitizing PPARγ agonist ameliorated the insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia (20Castellani L.W. Gargalovic P. Febbraio M. Charugundla S.

This suggested that the hypertriglyceridemia was mostly a consequence of the insulin resistance, consistent with the hypothesis described above. In their early development, PPARγ agonists were believed to act primarily by reducing insulin resistance in adipose tissue. However, it is now known that PPARγ agonists also have additional direct effects on other tissues, including liver and skeletal muscle (34Brunmair B. Gras F. Neschen S. Roden M. Wagner L.

Therefore, the possibility that treatment with PPARγ agonists reduced hypertriglyceridemia first and that insulin resistance was ameliorated as a consequence could not be ruled out.

Understanding the mechanisms through which apoAII increases plasma triglycerides is thus relevant to the understanding of several important human diseases. In the present study we demonstrate that, although overproduction of triglycerides by the liver contributes to the hypertriglyceridemia in the apoAIItg mice, the primary underlying cause is a decrease in the rates of both VLDL and chylomicron clearance. This decreased clearance does not appear to be due to changes in lipase activity in the apoAIItg mice but rather to the fact that elevated apoAII makes the lipoproteins a poorer substrate for lipolytic activity. Administration of mouse apoAII produced a rapid increase in plasma VLDL triglyceride concentrations in vivo. This effect was consistent with in vitro experiments where apoAII was transferred from HDL to VLDL, which subsequently was a poorer substrate for hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase. We conclude that the effects of mouse apoAII overexpression on hypertriglyceridemia appear to represent an acute response to increased plasma apoAII concentrations, as well as a chronic indirect effect that requires the development of insulin resistance. Although the hypertriglyceridemia and increased FFA may contribute to the IR syndrome in this model, our results suggest that factors other than the increased plasma FFA and triglycerides may initiate the skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Animals—Transgenic mice containing multiple copies of the mouse apoAII gene on a C57BL/6J background, were produced as described previously (5Warden C.H. Hedrick C.C. Qiao J.H. Castellani L.W. Lusis A.J. Science. 1993; 261: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 6Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All animals were housed 3-4 to a cage, maintained at 24 °C on a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provided Harlan-Teklad rodent chow (6% fat) and water ad libitum. The care of the mice, as well as all procedures used in this study, was done in accordance with NIH animal care guidelines. ApoAIItg animals used in the present study were males homozygous for the apoAII transgene, expressing plasma apoAII concentrations that were on average 5-fold higher than the age matched male C57BL/6J mice that were used as the controls. The apoAII transgene was also bred onto an apoEko background to investigate potential interactions of apoAII and apoE in the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Lipid Analyses—Plasma was collected from mice that were fasted overnight and bled 2-3 h after the beginning of the light cycle from the retro-orbital plexus under isoflorane anesthesia. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and FFA concentrations were determined in triplicate as described previously (6Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J.

HDL was isolated by precipitation of VLDL and LDL with heparin and manganese chloride (51Puppione D.L. Charugundla S. Lipids. 1994; 29: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An external control sample with known analyte concentration was run in each plate to ensure accuracy. The lipid composition of ultracentrifugally isolated VLDLs was also determined by the lipid assays described above, as well as analysis of their phospholipid content (phospholipid C kit #433-36201, Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Our laboratory participates in the Centers for Disease Control Lipid Standardization program (Laboratory ID# LSP-251), undergoing quarterly certification by the Centers for Disease Control. In Vivo Rates of VLDL Secretion—Rates of in vivo VLDL secretion were determined using tyloxapol (Triton WR-1339) to inhibit VLDL clearance from the plasma, as described previously (52Soler-Argilaga C. Russell R.L. Heimberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, following an overnight fast a 15% solution of tyloxapol in 0.9% NaCl was injected (100 mg/kg body wt) via the tail vein. Immediately following administration of tyloxapol, a 50-μl blood sample was drawn from the retro-orbital plexus, and subsequent plasma samples were obtained at the 30-min and 1-h time points. Triglyceride concentrations were determined in plasma samples as described above. Hepatic Fatty Acid Oxidation in Liver Sections—Following an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized with isoflorane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The left caudal lobe of the liver was rapidly excised, and fresh liver sections of uniform thickness (averaging ∼0.06 g) were obtained using a Stadie-Riggs microtome. The liver sections were weighed and immediately incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in Krebs-Henseleit buffer under 95% O2:5% CO2, that contained 5.5 mm glucose, 3% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm oleate, and [U-14C]palmitic acid (2.5 μCi/ml). The average time from sacrificing the animals to getting the liver section into the buffer was <2 min. Rates of FA oxidation were assessed by determining 14CO2 trapped in hyamine hydroxide-saturated filter paper as described previously (53Olubadewo J. Morgan D.W. Heimberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 938-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglyceride Secretion from Liver Sections—Liver sections were obtained and incubated essentially as described above for determining rates of fatty acid oxidation, except that media were collected following a 2-h incubation period. Total lipids were extracted using the method of Folch et al. (54Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following extraction, the lipid classes were separated by TLC, and the radioactivity in the triglyceride fraction was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (55Castellani L.W. Wilcox H.C. Heimberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in media triglycerides represents VLDL secretion. Hepatic Lipogenesis—Liver sections were obtained and incubated essentially as described above, except that 3H2O (0.5 mCi/vessel) was used as the radioactive tracer and incubations were carried out for 1 h (56Lowenstein J.M. Brunengraber H. Wadke M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Media and tissue were then collected and total lipids extracted as described above. Total lipid isolates were then hydrolyzed in an acid/acetonitrile solution as described previously, and the lipids were re-extracted and dried under nitrogen (55Castellani L.W. Wilcox H.C. Heimberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The sample was then separated by TLC and radioactivity in the fatty acid fraction determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (55Castellani L.W. Wilcox H.C. Heimberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Acute Effects of ApoAII on VLDLs in Vivo—Apolipoproteins AI and AII were isolated from delipidated apoAIItg mouse HDL using a Sephacryl 200 column as described previously (57LeBoeuf R.C. Puppione D.L. Schumaker V.N. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5063-5070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HDL from the apoAIItg mice contained approximately equal amounts of apoAI and apoAII, which eluted as two separate peaks (57LeBoeuf R.C. Puppione D.L. Schumaker V.N. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5063-5070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein composition of the individual fractions of apoAI and apoAII were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and Western blotting. Fractions of apoAI and apoAII, which were at least 96% pure were then dialyzed against PBS containing dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine to aid in solubility as the urea was removed. Following dialysis the protein content of each preparation was determined. 4 mg of either the apoAI or apoAII was then administered via tail vein injection to C57BL/6J control mice that had been fasted overnight. Mice were bled from the retro-orbital plexus under isoflorane anesthesia just prior to injection and at 4 h post-injection. Plasma triglycerides, glucose, and insulin concentrations were then determined. The remaining plasma samples for each respective group (apoAI-injected and apoAII-injected) were then pooled, the VLDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation, and the protein content was determined by Western blot analysis as described below. Chylomicron/Retinyl Palmitate Clearance Studies—Mice were fasted for 4 h, beginning at 5:00 a.m. Beginning at 9:00 a.m., 5000 IU of retinyl palmitate (all-trans) or vehicle alone (corn oil) was administered by oral gavage (100 μl). A zero time bleed was obtained from the retro-orbital plexus just prior to administration of the retinyl palmitate, and subsequent bleeds followed at 1, 2, 4, and 10 h post gavage. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides were determined as described above. Plasma levels of retinyl esters were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography on a 250 × 4.6 mm Beckman Ultrasphere C18 column (58Mills J.L. Tuomilehto J. Yu K.F. Colman N. Blaner W.S.

Retinyl esters were separated in a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile:methanol:dichloromethane (70:15:15, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min and detected by UV absorbance at 325 nm. Retinyl acetate was used as an internal standard. Retinyl ester standards were synthesized from authentic all-trans-retinol and the corresponding fatty acyl chloride (60Blaner W.S. Obunike J.C.

The reported plasma retinyl ester concentrations represent the sum of individual retinyl ester concentrations (retinyl linoleate, retinyl oleate, retinyl palmitate, and retinyl stearate). All extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography procedures were carried out under N2 and reduced light to prevent oxidation of the compounds. Plasma samples (25-200 μl) were denatured with an equal volume of absolute ethanol containing known amounts of retinyl acetate and then extracted into hexane. Following phase separation, the hexane extract was evaporated under a stream of N2, and the residue was resuspended in benzene for injection onto the high-performance liquid chromatography column. The lower limit of detection for retinyl esters was 2 ng/ml (61Burger H. Kovacs A. Weiser B. Grimson R. Nachman S. Tropper P. van Bennekum A.M. Elie M.C. Blaner W.S. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1997; 14: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In Vitro Rates of VLDL Hydrolysis—VLDL (d < 1.0063) were isolated from plasma of overnight fasted control and apoAIItg mice by ultracentrifugation as described previously (3Castellani L.W. Navab M.

The VLDL were then washed and concentrated using a centricon-10 micro-concentrator, and VLDL total protein and triglyceride concentrations were determined. VLDL at a final triglyceride concentration of 90 mg/dl was then incubated with isolated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (Sigma bovine milk LPL) at a final concentration of 24 μg/ml. Total volume in each reaction was 50 μl, and 4 tubes for each time point were incubated at 37 °C for 20, 40, 60, 120, and 180 min. At the end"
https://openalex.org/W1978860052,"Tetraploidy constitutes an adaptation to stress and an intermediate step between euploidy and aneuploidy in oncogenesis. Tetraploid cells are particularly resistant against genotoxic stress including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, we designed a strategy to preferentially kill tetraploid tumor cells. Depletion of checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1) by siRNAs, transfection with dominant-negative Chk1 mutants or pharmacological Chk1 inhibition killed tetraploid colon cancer cells yet had minor effects on their diploid counterparts. Chk1 inhibition abolished the spindle assembly checkpoint and caused premature and abnormal mitoses that led to p53 activation and cell death at a higher frequency in tetraploid than in diploid cells. Similarly, abolition of the spindle checkpoint by knockdown of Bub1, BubR1 or Mad2 induced p53-dependent apoptosis of tetraploid cells. Chk1 inhibition reversed the cisplatin resistance of tetraploid cells in vitro and in vivo, in xenografted human cancers. Chk1 inhibition activated p53-regulated transcripts including Puma/BBC3 in tetraploid but not in diploid tumor cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that, in tetraploid tumor cells, the inhibition of Chk1 sequentially triggers aberrant mitosis, p53 activation and Puma/BBC3-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1990709929,"Background Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is a putative schizophrenia susceptibility gene involved extensively in central nervous system development as well as cancer invasion and metastasis. Using a B lymphoblast cell model, we previously demonstrated impairment in NRG1α-mediated migration in cells derived from patients with schizophrenia as well as effects of risk alleles in NRG1 and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a second gene implicated both in schizophrenia susceptibility and in cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we examine cell adhesion, an essential component process of cell motility, using an integrin-mediated cell adhesion assay based on an interaction between ICAM-1 and the CD11a/CD18 integrin heterodimer expressed on lymphoblasts. In our assay, NRG1α induces lymphoblasts to assume varying levels of adhesion characterized by time-dependent fluctuations in the firmness of attachment. The maximum range of variation in adhesion over sixty minutes correlates strongly with NRG1α-induced migration (r2 = 0.61). NRG1α-induced adhesion variation is blocked by erbB2, PI3K, and Akt inhibitors, but not by PLC, ROCK, MLCK, or MEK inhibitors, implicating the erbB2/PI3K/Akt1 signaling pathway in NRG1-stimulated, integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In cell lines from 20 patients with schizophrenia and 20 normal controls, cells from patients show a significant deficiency in the range of NRG1α-induced adhesion (p = 0.0002). In contrast, the response of patient-derived cells to phorbol myristate acetate is unimpaired. The COMT Val108/158Met genotype demonstrates a strong trend towards predicting the range of the NRG1α-induced adhesion response with risk homozygotes having decreased variation in cell adhesion even in normal subjects (p = 0.063). Conclusion/Significance Our findings suggest that a mechanism of the NRG1 genetic association with schizophrenia may involve the molecular biology of cell adhesion."

Only a few gene sequences can be recognized as being homologous to genes in other organisms and, in particular, in other tailed phages, indicating that φKZ represents a distant branch of the Myoviridae family. The φKZ genome encodes two peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes, gp144 (product of gene number 144) and gp181. The gp144 enzyme can cleave peptidoglycans that belong to the “A1γ” peptidoglycan chemotype or family (7Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in Gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa (8Paradis-Bleau C. Cloutier I. Lemieux L. Sanschagrin F. Laroche J. Auger M. Garnier A.

The direct cross-linking that occurs in A1γ peptidoglycans and the full acetylation of N-glucosamine are required for successful hydrolysis by gp144 (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K. Lavigne R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1334-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan cleavage activity of gp144 is 143 times greater than the activity of hen egg white lysozyme (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K. Lavigne R.

Lavigne R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1334-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). gp144 and gp181 consist of 260 and 2237 amino acids, corresponding to calculated molecular masses of 28.8 and 245.8 kDa, respectively. There is 52% sequence identity between the 190-residue C-terminal domain of gp144 and an internal domain of gp181 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, these domains have sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of family 1 lytic transglycosylases (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2006; 71: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of products of peptidoglycan degradation by gp144 confirmed that this protein is a lytic transglycosylase (8Paradis-Bleau C. Cloutier I. Lemieux L. Sanschagrin F.

In lytic transglycosylases, there is only one acidic residue, typically a glutamic acid, in the vicinity of the substrate cleavage site (12Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 52: 78-84Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas hen egg white lysozyme possesses a catalytic dyad of Glu and Asp (15Blake C.C.F. Koenig D.F. Mair G.A. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Sarma V.R. Nature. 1965; 206: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). According to the proposed reaction mechanism of lytic transglycosylases (see Fig. 2) (13Höltje J.V. Mirelman D.

In the next step of the reaction, the glutamate residue abstracts the C-6 hydroxyl group proton in the muramoyl oxazolinium ion intermediate, leading to the formation of 1,6-anhydromuramic acid (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Reaction catalyzed by lytic transglycosylases.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2006; 71: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), gp144 has a peptidoglycan-binding domain in its N-terminal region (Fig. 1) (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K. Lavigne R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1334-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that gp144 evolved as gene fusion of a cell wall-binding domain and a transglycosylase catalytic domain. Experiments with the N-terminal domain fused to green fluorescent protein confirmed that this domain can bind bacterial cell walls (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K. Lavigne R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1334-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains probably have an independent peptidoglycan-binding function. Like φKZ, the bacteriophage T4 has two peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes that are employed by the virus at different stages of its life cycle (16Matthews B.W. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4178-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Kanamaru S. Leiman P.G. Kostyuchenko V.A. Chipman P.R. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Arisaka F. Rossmann M.G.

Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2356-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The larger of these two enzymes is a part of the T4 cell-puncturing device and is used by the phage to locally digest the cell wall during the infection process. The other smaller enzyme (called the T4 lysozyme or endolysin) causes cell lysis and release of the phage progeny in conjunction with another virally encoded protein called “holin.” Holin is a protein that creates lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane through which the endolysin passes to gain access to the peptidoglycan cell wall. However, exhaustive searches did not identify a typical holin sequence in the φKZ genome (8Paradis-Bleau C. Cloutier I. Lemieux L. Sanschagrin F. Laroche J. Auger M. Garnier A. Levesque R.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 266: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By analogy to T4, the smaller of the two peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes in φKZ, gp144 is probably the endolysin, whereas the larger gp181 is probably located in the center of the phage baseplate and forms the cell-puncturing device. The presence of gp181 (but not gp144) in the φKZ tail was confirmed by a mass spectrometry study (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K. Lavigne R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1334-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), although immunoblot analysis suggested that gp144 might also be attached to the phage tail (11Miroshnikov K.A. Faizullina N.M. Sykilinda N.N. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2006; 71: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism has shown that gp144 has mostly α-helical structure (8Paradis-Bleau C. Cloutier I. Lemieux L. Sanschagrin F. Laroche J. Auger M. Garnier A. Levesque R.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 266: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although there is a large decrease in the α-helical content when the protein interacts with dimyristoylphosphatidyl-glycerol, one of the major components of bacterial plasma membranes. This indicates that gp144 can interact with the host membrane, suggesting that holin might not be necessary to allow gp144 to reach the peptidoglycan. Endolysins with multiple domains or “modules” occur in bacteriophages that infect Gram-positive bacteria (19Loessner M.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), but unlike gp144, these proteins have their peptidoglycan-binding domains in the C-terminal region. Endolysins of bacteriophages that infect Gram-negative cells are single-module proteins. However, gp144 from φKZ and gp188 from bacteriophage EL are exceptions to this rule (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K. Lavigne R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1334-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here we report a 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure of gp144 and its complex with chitotetraose, a tetramer of NAG. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The DNA encoding φKZ gp144 was cloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites (11Miroshnikov K.A. Faizullina N.M. Sykilinda N.N. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2006; 71: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The plasmid vector produced the gp144 protein with an N-terminal six-histidine affinity purification tag and Gly-Ser-Ile linker between the tag and the first methionine of gp144. The pQE-30 vector has a T5 promoter under the control of two lac operators and an ampicillin resistance gene. A selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative of gp144 was expressed in Escherichia coli to facilitate the crystal structure determination. The B834 Met autotroph strain of E. coli was transformed by two plasmids: the pQE-30 vector and the pREP4-lacI plasmid containing the lac repressor and kanamycin resistance genes. The cells were first grown in 2YT medium at 37 °C to A600 = 0.3 and then centrifuged and transferred to modified M9 medium containing SeMet and all other amino acids at a concentration of 40 μg/ml, Kao and Michayluk vitamin solution (Sigma), 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown to A600 = 0.6. gp144 expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted from the column by 200 mm imidazole. The purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purified gp144 was a mixture of monomers, dimers, and trimers (11Miroshnikov K.A. Faizullina N.M. Sykilinda N.N. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2006; 71: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The oligomerization was probably caused by the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds involving some of the three cysteines in the N-terminal domain. Dithiothreitol was added to the protein solution to obtain a concentration of 5 mm. The addition of dithiothreitol caused the dissociation of the dimers and trimers, resulting in monomeric gp144. Crystallization and Data Collection—The initial crystallization screening was performed using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C with Hampton Crystal Screens 1 and 2 (20Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Drops containing 1 μl of protein at 10 mg/ml were mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 100 μl of reservoir solution. The protein crystallized in 2 m ammonium sulfate, 2% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals appeared in ∼1 day. The presence of dithiothreitol in the protein solution was important for crystallization. The optimized crystallization conditions were 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 1.2% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, and 60 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5. Subsequently, crystals were grown in hanging drops formed by mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution. The crystals were hexagonal prisms with a maximum dimension of ∼0.4 mm. X-ray data sets were collected from flash-frozen crystals at 100 K. Before freezing, the crystals were washed for a few seconds in a cryo-protectant solution that was obtained from the crystal growth solution by adding glycerol to obtain a 15% (v/v) concentration. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion diffraction data were collected to 2.5-Å resolution using the SeMet protein crystals at the General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team beamline 23-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The crystals of the SeMet protein were soaked for ∼36 h in solution containing 4 mg/ml chitotetraose, 2 m ammonium sulfate, 2% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.5, to determine the structure of the protein complexed with the chitotetraose (NAG)4. The diffraction data from the crystals of the complex were collected to a resolution of 2.6 Å with Rigaku R-AXIS-IV home diffraction equipment. The data sets were processed with the program HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The program TRUNCATE (22French S.

The fold is clearly divided into two α-helical domains, corresponding to residues 1-70 (the peptidoglycan-binding domain) and residues 71-260 (the catalytic domain). Structure of the N-terminal Domain—The N-terminal domain consists of a three-helix bundle (helices 1-3). Part of the N-terminal His tag region is visible in the electron density map (Fig. 3A). The four visible His tag residues plus two residues of the linker connecting the His tag to gp144 form an α-helix and are in contact with α-helix 3. The Ser and Ile residues in the linker are in contact with a symmetry-related molecule, suggesting that the His tag with its linker might be important for crystallization. There are three unpaired cysteine residues, two of which are accessible from the solvent and could form intermolecular disulfide bonds, accounting for the gp144 oligomers in purified protein solution. As anticipated, the structure of the gp144 N-terminal domain is similar to the N-terminal putative peptidoglycan-binding domain of the d-Ala-d-Ala-cleaving carboxypeptidase from Streptomyces albus G (Protein Data Bank code 1lbu) (36Dideberg O.

Like φKZ gp144 and d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase, these multimodular proteins have, in addition to their catalytic domain, another domain at either their N or C terminus. The function of these domains is presumably for binding to peptidoglycan substrates. Indeed, the N-terminal domain of gp144 can bind the cell wall peptidoglycans of many Gram-negative bacteria (9Briers Y. Volckaert G. Cornelissen A. Lagaert S. Michiels C.W. Hertveldt K. Lavigne R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1334-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase has repeats in its amino acid sequence that were hypothesized to be involved in peptidoglycan binding (38Ghuysen J.-M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Joris B. Shockman G.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Asp31-Thr38 and Asp54-Thr61 in the N-terminal domain of gp144 were found to have similar sequences to the repeating sequences in d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase and are situated near the molecular surface. The root mean square difference between equivalent backbone atoms in these two regions of gp144 is only 0.47 Å. On the molecular surface of gp144, these regions are involved in formation of small grooves and are therefore possible sites for peptidoglycan binding (Fig. 3B). Domains with a structure similar to the N-terminal region of gp144 but with no identifiable sequence similarity occur in human matrix metalloproteinases (39Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U.

The matrix metalloproteinases degrade extracellular matrix proteins and are thought to play a role in tumor invasion and arthritis (41Kohn E.C. Liotta L.A.

Structure of the Catalytic Domain—The C-terminal catalytic domain of gp144 (residues 70-260) has been defined to include the proline-rich N-terminal region consisting of Pro71-Ala83 (Fig. 3A). The region Thr91-Thr213 of the gp144 C-terminal domain has significant structural similarity to the catalytic domains of family 1 lytic transglycosylases (12Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 291: 877-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation between 96 equivalenced C-α atoms of gp144 and Slt70 is 1.5 Å (Fig. 5A). The transglycosylase family has structural similarity to lysozymes and especially to goose lysozyme (45Grütter M.G. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1983; 303: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which has a larger C-terminal region compared with hen egg white lysozyme (15Blake C.C.F. Koenig D.F. Mair G.A. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Sarma V.R. Nature. 1965; 206: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). A larger C-terminal region also occurs in T4 lysozyme, where it is involved in binding of the peptide component of peptidoglycan. Lytic transglycosylase family 1 has four consensus sequence motifs (I-IV), with the catalytic Glu residue being a part of motif I (14Scheurwater E. Reid C.W. Clarke A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol.

Vernon C.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Springer, Heidelberg, Germany2006: 745-772Google Scholar). Substrate cleavage occurs between NAM bound in subsite D and NAG bound in subsite E. The structure of gp144 complexed with the chitotetraose showed the NAG residues bound in subsites A-D (Figs. 5 and 7), although because of disorder, the orientation of the residue in subsite D is not clearly defined (see “Materials and Methods”). There is no significant difference between the structures of gp144 in the free and complexed forms. As in the original structure of hen egg white lysozyme (15Blake C.C.F. Koenig D.F. Mair G.A. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Sarma V.R. Nature. 1965; 206: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), the natural substrate for gp144 has NAM residues at sites B and D, whereas the chitotetraose molecule has NAG at these sites. The peptide covalently bound to the NAM residue at site D can be involved in interactions with gp144. Thus, the natural substrate is probably bound tighter to gp144 than is chitotetraose. The lack of complementarity of NAG to subsite D probably explains the disorder of the NAG residue at this subsite. However, no such effect seems to occur at subsite B. The orientation of the NAG residue at site B in the gp144-chitotetraose complex suggests that an associated peptide bound to an equivalent NAM residue would be unlikely to interact with gp144. Interactions of NAG and NAM sugar residues at site B with gp144 would be similar, indicating why the NAG residue at site B is well ordered in the gp144-chitotetraose complex. The catalytic residue of gp144 (Glu115) is located between sugar-binding subsites D and E, with no other acidic residues in the proximity of these subsites, in agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism (Fig. 2). The structure of Slt70 was determined in complex with the 1,6-anhydromuropeptide (NAG-anhydro-NAM-l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid) (44Asselt van E.J. Thunnissen A.-M.W.H. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 877-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The NAG residue was found in subsite E, forming hydrogen bonds with three hydrophilic residues (Gln477, Glu478, and Gln496). Two of these residues (Glu115 and Gln134) are conserved in φKZ gp144. The NAM residue of the anhydromuropeptide that would have been expected to bind to subsite F does not interact with the Slt70 molecule. Instead, the peptide covalently bound to this NAM residue binds to Slt70, although none of these residues are conserved in φKZ gp144. Apparently, subsite E (but not subsite F) is well conserved between gp144 and the typical lytic transglycosylase Slt70. The structure of Thr213-Lys243 of gp144 has a fold different from that of Slt70 (Fig. 5A) or any other lysozyme structure. These residues, together with Phe201-Arg209, form a groove on the molecular surface of gp144. The groove is close to subsite D, a NAM-binding site. The structure of (NAG)4 complexed with gp144 suggests that an associated peptide covalently bound to an equivalent NAM residue would be in a suitable position to bind to the surface groove of gp144 (Fig. 3B). The high sequence similarity between gp144 and the transglycosylase domain of φKZ gp181 (Fig. 1) made it possible to build a homology model of this domain. The model suggested that the structures of the gp181 and gp144 transglycosylase domains and, in particular, their substrate-binding sites are very similar. gp181 is most probably involved in formation of the φKZ cell-puncturing device, and its function can be compared with that of gp5 in bacteriophage T4 (17Kanamaru S. Leiman P.G. Kostyuchenko V.A. Chipman P.R. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Arisaka F. Rossmann M.G. Nature. 2002; 415: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). T4 gp5 has a lysozyme domain followed by a 186-residue C-terminal β-helix domain, which forms a membrane-puncturing needle. The transglycosylase domain in gp181 is also followed by an ∼180-residue C-terminal domain, which might be involved in the formation of a needle-like structure visible in the cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the φKZ tail (4Fokine A. Battisti A.J. Bowman V.D. Efimov A.V. Kurochkina L.P. Chipman P.R. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Rossmann M.G. Structure. 2007; 15: 1099-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The secondary structure prediction suggests the presence of long helices in the gp181 C-terminal domain. Thus, the φKZ membrane-puncturing needle might have a coiled-coil structure as in bacteriophage P22 (47Tang L. Marion W.R. Cingolani G. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Johnson J.E. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The structure of the φKZ endolysin (gp144) reported here might be useful for the development of new antibacterial reagents for preventing and treating P. aeruginosa infections. Such an antibiotic would function by destroying the peptidoglycan cell wall in Gram-negative bacteria. However, to do so, the outer membrane must first be disrupted to permit access of gp144 molecules to the cell wall. The phage accomplishes the disruption by a using a needle-shaped molecule as a cell-puncturing device (17Kanamaru S. Leiman P.G. Kostyuchenko V.A. Chipman P.R. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Arisaka F. Rossmann M.G. Nature. 2002; 415: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Clinically, it might be possible to apply a solution of gp144 in conjunction with a substance that permeabilizes the outer bacterial membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1991178273,"Cre recombinase is extensively used to engineer the genome of experimental animals. However, its usefulness is still limited by the lack of an efficient temporal control over its activity. We have recently developed a conceptually new approach to regulate Cre recombinase, that we have called Dimerizable Cre or DiCre. It is based on splitting Cre into two inactive moieties and fusing them to FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein) and FRB (binding domain of the FKBP12-rapamycin associated protein), respectively. These latter can be efficiently hetero-dimerized by rapamycin, leading to the reinstatement of Cre activity. We have been able to show, using in vitro approaches, that this ligand-induced dimerization is an efficient way to regulate Cre activity, and presents a low background activity together with a high efficiency of recombination following dimerization. To test the in vivo performance of this system, we have, in the present work, knocked-in DiCre into the Rosa26 locus of mice. To evaluate the performance of the DiCre system, mice have been mated with indicator mice (Z/EG or R26R) and Cre-induced recombination was examined following activation of DiCre by rapamycin during embryonic development or after birth of progenies. No recombination could be observed in the absence of treatment of the animals, indicating a lack of background activity of DiCre in the absence of rapamycin. Postnatal rapamycin treatment (one to five daily injection, 10 mg/kg i.p) induced recombination in a number of different tissues of progenies such as liver, heart, kidney, muscle, etc. On the other hand, recombination was at a very low level following in utero treatment of DiCrexR26R mice. In conclusion, DiCre has indeed the potentiality to be used to establish conditional Cre-deleter mice. An added advantage of this system is that, contrary to other modulatable Cre systems, it offers the possibility of obtaining regulated recombination in a combinatorial manner, i.e. induce recombination at any desired time-point specifically in cells characterized by the simultaneous expression of two different promoters."

In all cases there is only one d-amino acid residue present, and it is near the N terminus in the case of the frog and platypus peptides, but it is near the C terminus in the case of spider venom peptides. In the latter, the third amino acid residue from the C terminus is in the d-form (4Heck S.D. Siok C.J. Krapcho K.J. Kelbaugh P.R. Thadeio P.F. Welch M.J. Williams R.D. Ganong A.H. Kelly M.E.

The presence of the l-to-d-amino acid residue isomerase has been reported in several cases where peptides that contain the corresponding d-amino acid have been isolated and characterized.

Because the peptides that contain all l-residues and those with a d-residue elute at significantly different times (on the order of minutes) in reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), a convenient assay was developed for the peptide isomerase. Earlier we reported d-amino acid isomerization in small N-terminal peptides derived from DLP-2/DLP-4 (IMFFEMQ and ImFFEMQ; where the lowercase letter denotes the d-form of the amino acid residue) (12Torres A.M.

In this study we showed that only the first three amino acid residues were absolutely required for peptide isomerase activity on potential substrates. To increase their solubility in aqueous buffers, we appended a short peptide consisting of three polar d-amino acid residues (srs). We chose these residues to be d-type on the supposition that they would be stable in the presence of l-specific carboxypeptidases. We report here on our systematic study of the substrate specificity of platypus venom peptide isomerase using a set of 26 synthetic hexapeptides; and we also propose a plausible mechanism for l-to-d isomerization.

Open table in a new tab Peptide Synthesis—Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis methodology was used for all peptides. Typically, 2-chloro(chlorotrityl) resin (0.1 mmol, 68 mg) was swollen in dry dimethylformamide (DMF) for 2 h. The solvent was drained, and a solution of the appropriate amino acid (2 ml, 1 mm) in DMF, containing 100 ml of N,N-diisopropylethylamine, was added to the resin. The suspension was mixed thoroughly and maintained at room temperature for 2 h with occasional manual shaking. The solvent was drained again, and the resin was washed with DMF, followed by removal of the Fmoc group by treating it twice (1 min each) with a 50% solution of piperidine in DMF. The next amino acid (1 mm) was activated with 0.5 m 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylu-roniumhexafluorophosphate in DMF (800 μl), and 75 μl of N,N-diisopropylethylamine was then added. The solution was vortex-mixed and then added to the de-protected amino acid on the resin. The contents of the reaction vessel were stirred with a steady stream of bubbled dry nitrogen. After 10 min, a small quantity of the resin was removed and tested for coupling yield. This cycle was repeated until the required chain assembly was achieved. After completion of chain assembly, the resin was washed with DMF followed by dichloromethane and dried under nitrogen. A known amount of the resin was taken in a reaction vessel, and the peptide was cleaved from the resin with simultaneous removal of the side chain protecting groups of the amino acids using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, water, and triisopropylsilane in the ratio 95:2.5:2.5 as a cleavage reagent. After 2 h the suspension was filtered to remove the resin, and the cleavage reagent was evaporated with a steady stream of dry nitrogen. Ice-cold diethyl ether was added to precipitate the peptide. The peptide was collected and purified by HPLC and then characterized by MS (Table 1). Venom Gland Extracts—Venom glands were dissected from deceased animals after tying the ducts with ligatures. The glands were finely sliced and the ligatures removed, and the tissue was placed in 50 ml of ice-cold 1% (w/v) trehalose solution. The sample was homogenized with a Bamix cutter using short bursts of cutting (∼5 s) to ensure that the temperature remained low and avoided enzyme denaturation. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min and at 5 °C; solid material separated by the centrifugation was discarded, and the supernatant was decanted and passed through a 0.2-μm Minisart filter (Sartorious, Göttingen, Germany) to avoid clogging the HPLC column. The filtrate was dispensed into 1.5-ml Eppendorf (North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia) centrifuge tubes and frozen and stored at –80 °C for later use. Isomerase Assay—The platypus gland extract (previously frozen) containing all the peptides was fractionated into two fractions by centrifugal ultrafiltration using an Amicon (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) Ultrafree-MC device with 30-kDa nominal molecular weight cutoff. 100 μl of gland extract was added to the filter cup followed by addition of 30 μl of PBS and spun at 3000 × g for 5 min. The filtrate was retained for further isolation of the proteins. The peptide isomerase-active retentate that contained components with nominal Mr > 30,000 was washed twice by reconstituting it with 2 volumes of 50 mm phosphate containing 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (PBS) at pH 7.4, and then repeating the ultrafiltration. Finally, the retentate was reconstituted to the original volume with 50 mm PBS. In a typical experiment, 20 μl of fractionated venom gland extract, 10 μl of peptide solution (1 mg ml–1, 50% A and B), and 10 μl of 100 mm EDTA were incubated at 37 °C in a water bath. Aliquots for assaying peptide isomerase with our HPLC method were withdrawn at 0, 2, 4, and 20 h for each peptide solution. New Assay—For isomerization studies, 1 mg ml–1 solutions of each peptide was prepared in 50% v/v acetonitrile. A 20-μl aliquot of this solution was mixed with 10 μl of 100 mm EDTA and 10 μl of the gland extract. The progress of the reaction was measured by HPLC at 0-, 2-, and 4-h intervals. The enzymatic reaction was recorded in each direction, l-to-d, and d-to-l; and when the reaction occurred, it appeared to reach equilibrium within 20 h. Short Natural and “Designer” Sequences—It was found in our earlier studies that two 12-residue peptides (IMFFEMQsrsrs) and (ImFFEMQsrsrs) derived from the N terminus of DLP-4 and DLP-2, respectively, were effective substrates of the isomerase (12Torres A.M. Tsampazi M. Tsampazi C. Kennett E.C. Belov K. Geraghty P.C. Bansal P. Alewood P.F. Kuchel P.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1587-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These peptides were designed by appending a solubilizing peptide incorporating an all-d-amino-acids peptide (srsrs) to the C terminus of the 7-residue N terminus segment (IMFFEMQ). The heptapeptide as such was insoluble in any solvent that was suitable for further studies of the peptide isomerase. The addition of srsrs also made the heptapeptide stable to the action of carboxypeptidases (data not shown). To establish the minimum number of amino acid residues required for peptide isomerase activity, and to investigate the range of specificity of the enzyme, we chemically engineered shorter peptides as substrates, including only three amino acid residues from DLP. Thus, IMFsrs and ImFsrs and 26 other mutant peptides (combinatorial variants) were synthesized using Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis methodology (see under “Materials and Methods”). Remarkably, these peptide pairs showed significant differences in their HPLC retention times (Table 1); thus they formed the basis of a subsequent HPLC method for monitoring the activity of the peptide isomerase. IMFsrs in the presence of the peptide isomerase under our standard assay conditions (see under “Materials and Methods”) showed readily detectable conversion to ImFsrs; this interpretation was based on the product having exactly the same retention time as synthetic ImFsrs (Fig. 1A). Similarly, ImFsrs was isomerized to IMFsrs (Fig. 1A), but notably the reaction in this reverse direction was relatively slow (Table 2). This is consistent with the mature venom having more of the d-containing DLP-2 than l-containing DLP-4 (12Torres A.M. Tsampazi M. Tsampazi C. Kennett E.C. Belov K. Geraghty P.C. Bansal P. Alewood P.F. Kuchel P.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1587-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the notion that it is resistant to proteolytic cleavage in the venom.TABLE 2l-to-d and d-to-l isomerization of mutant peptides at 4 h of incubation (RP-HPLC assay)Isomerization reaction4-h incubation at 37 °C, ratio of peak areasRelative rateaRate is relative to the most rapid conversion.IMFsrs → ImFsrsIMFsrs:ImFsrs53:470.79ImFsrs → IMFsrsImFsrs:IMFsrs82:180.31INleFsrs → InleFsrsINleFsrs:InleFsrs41:591.0InleFsrs → INleFsrsInleFsrs:INleFsrs87:130.22IFFsrs → IfFsrsIFFsrs:IfFsrs59:410.69IfFsrs → IFFsrsIfFsrs:IFFsrs87:130.22IIFsrs → IiFsrsIIFsrs:IiFsrs100:00IiFsrs → IIFsrsIiFsrs:IIFsrs100:00ILFsrs → IlFsrsILFsrs:IlFsrs100:00IlFsrs → ILFsrsIlFsrs:ILFsrs100:00IVFsrs → IvFsrsIVFsrs:IvFsrs100:00IvFsrs → IVFsrsIvFsrs:IVFsrs100:00a Rate is relative to the most rapid conversion. Open table in a new tab Substrate Specificity—To explore the range of substrate specificity, synthetic mutants of DLP peptides were made by replacing the Met residue with either l-or d-amino acids; these were Abu, Ala, His, Ile, Leu, Nle, Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Val instead of Met. All mutants were purified with HPLC and characterized by MS (Table 1). The presence of d-amino acid residues (srs) at the C terminus prevented the carboxypeptidase activity. Specificity Mapping Based on DLP-4, Long Side Chains—The importance of the length of the side chain of substrates on the isomerase activity was identified for the mutants in which Met was replaced by Nle or nle. For these two cases the isomerization reaction was relatively faster, for l-to-d than to d-to-l, under identical assay conditions (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the conversion rate of l-to-d was greater (Table 2, 41:59) over a period of 4 h than for the hexapeptide with a Met residue (Table 2, 53:47), or indeed for the whole native peptide, but for d-to l-isomerization there was little difference. In a similar manner, peptide isomerase was assayed with mutant peptides that contained Phe in place of Met (Tables 1 and 2; Fig. 1C). In these cases as well, the isomerization from l-to-d was faster than from d-to-l (Table 2). In summary, both of the peptide pairs (InleFsrs and InleFsrs) and (IFFsrs and IfFsrs) were active substrates of the peptide isomerase with the conversion rate of INleFsrs to InleFsrs being the fastest of all the tested peptides (Table 1, right-hand column). Specificity Mapping Based on DLP-4, Long Side Chains That Are Polar—Lys and Tyr have long side chains that are similar in length to Met and Phe, but unlike the latter they carry polar groups on the terminal carbon. Although tyrosine is simply the 4-hydroxy-substituted benzene derivative of Phe the mutant peptides, IYFsrs and IyFsrs were not substrates for the peptide isomerase. After 4 h of incubation with the isomerase, no change was observed by the HPLC-based assay. Similarly, on incubating IKFsrs with peptide isomerase, under the standard assay conditions, no conversion to IkFsrs was observed after 4 h (HPLC). From these two examples we concluded that the active site of the peptide isomerase does not effectively interact with polar moieties and therefore the binding sub-site for the second amino acid residue may be hydrophobic. Specificity Mapping Based on DLP-4, β-Branched Chains—The β-branched category of synthetic mutant peptides that we studied included ILFsrs, IIFsrs, and IVFsrs and their d-counterparts. In all three cases isomerization did not occur (Fig. 2, A–C) under the standard assay conditions. Thus the peptide isomerase was not active with peptides incorporating β-branched amino acid residues. Therefore, the steric characteristics of the second amino acid also play an important role in the isomerization reaction. Specificity Mapping Based on DLP-4, Short Straight Chains—Peptides having short one- and two-carbon side chains at the α-carbon were synthesized. Ala, containing a methyl group at the α-carbon, and Abu, with a two-carbon chain, CH3CH2-, at the α-carbon were incorporated into IAFsrs, and its d-variant IaFsrs, and I(Abu)Fsrs. Under the standard assay conditions with peptide isomerase, no isomerization was detected. Specificity Mapping Based on OvCNPa—The first three amino acid residues of OvCNPa are LLH. We noted that His shares aromatic character with the Phe of IMF, but it is also polar and basic. So peptides were synthesized that reflected the anionic character at position 3 and not the aromatic character. A sub-set of peptides based on LLH with the added solubilizing (srs) tripeptide was synthesized: the native LLHsrs and its d-counterpart LlHsrs. A two-substitution l-d pair was made corresponding to DLP-1, FVQsrs, and FvQsrs in which the branched chain leucine was replaced by the smaller branched chain valine, and the anionic imidazole of histidine was replaced by the neutral amino acid residue glutamine. None of these peptides showed any isomerization under standard assay conditions. The finding that isomerization of FVQsrs did not occur was consistent with the fact that only one isomer of DLP-1 has been observed in the platypus venom (15Torres A.M. Tsampazi M. Kennett E.C. Belov K. Geraghty D.P. Bansal P.S. Alewood P.F. Kuchel P.W. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2007; 32: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that these peptides are also nonsubstrates. Specificity Mapping Based on OvCNPa, Partial Chimera with DLP-2/4—Full-length DLP-4 and DLP-2 were modified at their respective N termini, with LLH and LlH, as occur naturally at the N terminus of OvCNPa and OvCNPb, respectively. Under standard assay conditions, significant but very slow isomerization took place with both variants. Such slow isomerization has also been reported for the full-length OvCNPa and OvCNPb (12Torres A.M. Tsampazi M. Tsampazi C. Kennett E.C. Belov K. Geraghty P.C. Bansal P. Alewood P.F. Kuchel P.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1587-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Clearly these results indicate that for the second L in LLH to become isomerized to its d-form, a longer peptide sequence or a structurally different one than simply srs needs to be attached. Tryptophan-containing Hexapeptides—Tryptophan has a side chain with both aromatic and polar character. LLH of the OvCNPs and the IMF of DLP-2/4 have aromatic ring side chains in position 3, whereas one variant of the second class, which turned out to be a substrate, was IFFsrs. Therefore, to explore the range of characteristics accepted by the enzyme, two types of mutant peptides were made with Trp; one by replacing Met and other by replacing Phe of IMFsrs with Trp. Thus IMWsrs and its counterpart ImWsrs were synthesized; and under standard assay conditions no interconversion of the isomers occurred. Similarly, the peptides IWFsrs and IMHsrs were nonsubstrates. Although Trp is aromatic, it is bulkier than either His or Phe; it carries a fused pyrrole ring that renders it polar and basic and that projects the benzene ring laterally. Thus we concluded that the angular disposition of the benzene ring relative to the peptide backbone is important for positioning the peptide in the active site at position 2. However, in IMHsrs, the polar His next to the Met is not accommodated in the correct orientation as in IMFsrs; and note that LLHsrs was not a substrate but the full-length OvCNPa, which has LLH at its N terminus is. Therefore, another requirement for a hexapeptide to be a substrate is that the third amino acid must have a benzene ring at the α-carbon. Frog Venom Peptide—The peptide isomerase isolated from skin secretions of the frog Bombina variegata converts l-Ile to d-Ile at position 2 in a heptapeptide IIGPVGC-amide that is derived from the natural substrate (10Jilek A. Mollay C. Tippelt C. Grassi J. Mignogna G. Mullegger J. Sander V. Barra D. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4235-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The frog enzyme, however, does not act upon the heptapeptide (LLHDHPC) that is based on the N terminus of platypus OvCNPa (10Jilek A. Mollay C. Tippelt C. Grassi J. Mignogna G. Mullegger J. Sander V. Barra D. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4235-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Conversely, we investigated the action of platypus peptide isomerase on the peptide from the frog secretion that has the N-terminal sequence IIG. Two peptides IIGsrs and IiGsrs were synthesized. In our standard HPLC-based assay there was no isomerization of either peptide. We conclude that the platypus and frog enzymes have different active site configurations that would be consistent with what appears to be quite different fold structures based on preliminary chromatographic isolation procedures (16Dooley C.T. Chung N.N. Wilkes B.C. Schiller P.W. Bidlack J.M. Pastenak G.W. Houghten R.A. Science. 1994; 266: 2019-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Differences were explored further by adding reagents that are at least partially selective for amino acid side chains that could be involved in the isomerization reaction. Treatment of venom gland extract with 2.5 mm hydroxylamine that covalently modifies pyridoxal phosphate groups in enzymes such as transaminases (14Volkmann R.A. Heck S.D. Jolles P. d-Amino Acids in Sequence of Secreted Peptides of Multicellular Organisms. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1998: 57-71Google Scholar) had no effect on the platypus peptide isomerase activity. Thus it appears that this cofactor is unlikely to be present in or near the active site. Isomerase activity was not inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or iodoacetamide. These findings appear to rule out the presence of a serine-protease-like reactive triad or the involvement of an –SH group of Cys in the active site. However, the peptide isomerase was inhibited by diethyl pyrocarbonate that modifies histidine residues. This suggests the involvement of an imidazole moiety of at least one histidine in catalysis, as has been reported for the peptide isomerase from the frog (14Volkmann R.A. Heck S.D. Jolles P. d-Amino Acids in Sequence of Secreted Peptides of Multicellular Organisms. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1998: 57-71Google Scholar). The platypus venom peptides OvCNPb and DLP-2 both contain a d-amino acid residue at position 2, whereas their counterparts OvCNPa and DLP-4 have all l-amino acid residues (8Torres A.M. Menz I. Alewood P.F. Bansal P. Lahnstein J. Gallagher C.H. Kuchel P.W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Torres A.M. Tsampazi M. Tsampazi C. Kennett E.C. Belov K.

Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Definitive evidence for this isomerization was provided by unambiguous chemical synthesis of all peptides, including those with d-amino acids (8Torres A.M. Menz I. Alewood P.F. Bansal P. Lahnstein J. Gallagher C.H. Kuchel P.W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Across all phyla, peptides synthesized on ribosomes contain in the first instance l-forms of amino acids, so the presence of a d-amino acid residue is most likely to be due to post-translational modification without residue excision and replacement. We proposed that as with the frog skin toxin the platypus peptides undergo post-translational isomerization via the peptide isomerase (8Torres A.M. Menz I. Alewood P.F. Bansal P. Lahnstein J.

https://openalex.org/W1981136463,"Background Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is thought to promote speciation in bacteria, though well-defined examples have not been put forward. Methodology/Principle Findings We examined the evolutionary history of the genes essential for a trait that defines a phylogenetic order, namely fruiting body development of the Myxococcales. Seventy-eight genes that are essential for Myxococcus xanthus development were examined for LGT. About 73% of the genes exhibit a phylogeny similar to that of the 16S rDNA gene and a codon bias consistent with other M. xanthus genes suggesting vertical transmission. About 22% have an altered codon bias and/or phylogeny suggestive of LGT. The remaining 5% are unique. Genes encoding signal production and sensory transduction were more likely to be transmitted vertically with clear examples of duplication and divergence into multigene families. Genes encoding metabolic enzymes were frequently acquired by LGT. Myxobacteria exhibit aerobic respiration unlike most of the δ Proteobacteria. M. xanthus contains a unique electron transport pathway shaped by LGT of genes for succinate dehydrogenase and three cytochrome oxidase complexes. Conclusions/Significance Fruiting body development depends on genes acquired by LGT, particularly those involved in polysaccharide production. We suggest that aerobic growth fostered innovation necessary for development by allowing myxobacteria access to a different gene pool from anaerobic members of the δ Proteobacteria. Habitat destruction and loss of species diversity could restrict the evolution of new bacterial groups by limiting the size of the prospective gene pool."
https://openalex.org/W2057474725,"Background In response to liver injury, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation causes excessive liver fibrosis. Here we show that activation of RSK and phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on Thr217 in activated HSC is critical for the progression of liver fibrosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Chronic treatment with the hepatotoxin CCl4 induced severe liver fibrosis in C/EBPβ+/+ mice but not in mice expressing C/EBPβ-Ala217, a non-phosphorylatable RSK-inhibitory transgene. C/EBPβ-Ala217 was present within the death receptor complex II, with active caspase 8, and induced apoptosis of activated HSC. The C/EBPβ-Ala217 peptides directly stimulated caspase 8 activation in a cell-free system. C/EBPβ+/+ mice with CCl4-induced severe liver fibrosis, while continuing on CCl4, were treated with a cell permeant RSK-inhibitory peptide for 4 or 8 weeks. The peptide inhibited RSK activation, stimulating apoptosis of HSC, preventing progression and inducing regression of liver fibrosis. We found a similar activation of RSK and phosphorylation of human C/EBPβ on Thr266 (human phosphoacceptor) in activated HSC in patients with severe liver fibrosis but not in normal livers, suggesting that this pathway may also be relevant in human liver fibrosis. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that the RSK-C/EBPβ phosphorylation pathway is critical for the development of liver fibrosis and suggest a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2047098699,"Schizophrenia is often associated with emotional blunting—the diminished ability to respond to emotionally salient stimuli—particularly those stimuli representative of negative emotional states, such as fear. This disturbance may stem from dysfunction of the amygdala, a brain region involved in fear processing. The present article describes a novel animal model of emotional blunting in schizophrenia. This model involves interfering with normal fear processing (classical conditioning) in rats by means of acute ketamine administration. We confirm, in a series of experiments comprised of cFos staining, behavioral analysis and neurochemical determinations, that ketamine interferes with the behavioral expression of fear and with normal fear processing in the amygdala and related brain regions. We further show that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine, but not the typical antipsychotic haloperidol nor an experimental glutamate receptor 2/3 agonist, inhibits ketamine's effects and retains normal fear processing in the amygdala at a neurochemical level, despite the observation that fear-related behavior is still inhibited due to ketamine administration. Our results suggest that the relative resistance of emotional blunting to drug treatment may be partially due to an inability of conventional therapies to target the multiple anatomical and functional brain systems involved in emotional processing. A conceptual model reconciling our findings in terms of neurochemistry and behavior is postulated and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2066230907,"Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are molecular targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the most used medication worldwide. However, the COX enzymes are not the sole molecular targets of NSAIDs. Recently, we showed that two NSAIDs, diclofenac and meclofenamate, also act as openers of Kv7.2/3 K(+) channels underlying the neuronal M-current. Here we designed new derivatives of diphenylamine carboxylate to dissociate the M-channel opener property from COX inhibition. The carboxylate moiety was derivatized into amides or esters and linked to various alkyl and ether chains. Powerful M-channel openers were generated, provided that the diphenylamine moiety and a terminal hydroxyl group are preserved. In transfected CHO cells, they activated recombinant Kv7.2/3 K(+) channels, causing a hyperpolarizing shift of current activation as measured by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. In sensory dorsal root ganglion and hippocampal neurons, the openers hyperpolarized the membrane potential and robustly depressed evoked spike discharges. They also decreased hippocampal glutamate and GABA release by reducing the frequency of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents. In vivo, the openers exhibited anti-convulsant activity, as measured in mice by the maximal electroshock seizure model. Conversion of the carboxylate function into amide abolished COX inhibition but preserved M-channel modulation. Remarkably, the very same template let us generating potent M-channel blockers. Our results reveal a new and crucial determinant of NSAID-mediated COX inhibition. They also provide a structural framework for designing novel M-channel modulators, including openers and blockers."

https://openalex.org/W2156080539,"Despite recent advances in our understanding the pathophysiology of trauma, the basis of the predisposition of trauma patients to infection remains unclear. A Drosophila melanogaster/Pseudomonas aeruginosa injury and infection model was used to identify host genetic components that contribute to the hyper-susceptibility to infection that follows severe trauma. We show that P. aeruginosa compromises skeletal muscle gene (SMG) expression at the injury site to promote infection. We demonstrate that activation of SMG structural components is under the control of cJun-N-terminal Kinase (JNK) Kinase, Hemipterous (Hep), and activation of this pathway promotes local resistance to P. aeruginosa in flies and mice. Our study links SMG expression and function to increased susceptibility to infection, and suggests that P. aeruginosa affects SMG homeostasis locally by restricting SMG expression in injured skeletal muscle tissue. Local potentiation of these host responses, and/or inhibition of their suppression by virulent P. aeruginosa cells, could lead to novel therapies that prevent or treat deleterious and potentially fatal infections in severely injured individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2067822453,"Angiogenesis has been recently described as a novel component of inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. The level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been found increased in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis mucosa. To question whether a pro-inflammatory Escherichia coli could regulate the expression of VEGF in human intestinal epithelial cells, we examine the response of cultured human colonic T84 cells to infection by E. coli strain C1845 that belongs to the typical Afa/Dr diffusely adhering E. coli family (Afa/Dr DAEC).VEGF mRNA expression was examined by Northern blotting and q-PCR. VEGF protein levels were assayed by ELISA and its bioactivity was analysed in endothelial cells. The bacterial factor involved in VEGF induction was identified using recombinant E. coli expressing Dr adhesin, purified Dr adhesin and lipopolysaccharide. The signaling pathway activated for the up-regulation of VEGF was identified using a blocking monoclonal anti-DAF antibody, Western blot analysis and specific pharmacological inhibitors.C1845 bacteria induce the production of VEGF protein which is bioactive. VEGF is induced by adhering C1845 in both a time- and bacteria concentration-dependent manner. This phenomenon is not cell line dependent since we reproduced this observation in intestinal LS174, Caco2/TC7 and INT407 cells. Up-regulation of VEGF production requires: (1) the interaction of the bacterial F1845 adhesin with the brush border-associated decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) acting as a bacterial receptor, and (2) the activation of a Src protein kinase upstream of the activation of the Erk and Akt signaling pathways.Results demonstrate that a Afa/Dr DAEC strain induces an adhesin-dependent activation of DAF signaling that leads to the up-regulation of bioactive VEGF in cultured human intestinal cells. Thus, these results suggest a link between an entero-adherent, pro-inflammatory E. coli strain and angiogenesis which appeared recently as a novel component of IBD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2035354935,"Initiation of a protective immune response to infection by the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is mediated in part by host factors that promote interactions between immune cells and C. neoformans yeast. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) contributes positively to pulmonary host defenses against a variety of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in part by promoting the recognition and phagocytosis of these pathogens by alveolar macrophages. In the present study we investigated the role of SP-A as a mediator of host defense against the pulmonary pathogen, C. neoformans. Previous studies have shown that SP-A binds to acapsular and minimally encapsulated strains of C. neoformans. Using in vitro binding assays we confirmed that SP-A does not directly bind to a fully encapsulated strain of C. neoformans (H99). However, we observed that when C. neoformans was incubated in bronchoalveolar fluid, SP-A binding was detected, suggesting that another alveolar host factor may enable SP-A binding. Indeed, we discovered that SP-A binds encapsulated C. neoformans via a previously unknown IgG dependent mechanism. The consequence of this interaction was the inhibition of IgG-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans by alveolar macrophages. Therefore, to assess the contribution of SP-A to the pulmonary host defenses we compared in vivo infections using SP-A null mice (SP-A-/-) and wild-type mice in an intranasal infection model. We found that the immune response assessed by cellular counts, TNFalpha cytokine production, and fungal burden in lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids during early stages of infection were equivalent. Furthermore, the survival outcome of C. neoformans infection was equivalent in SP-A-/- and wild-type mice. Our results suggest that unlike a variety of bacteria, viruses, and other fungi, progression of disease with an inhalational challenge of C. neoformans does not appear to be negatively or positively affected by SP-A mediated mechanisms of pulmonary host defense."
https://openalex.org/W1976651713,"CEA and CEACAM6 are immunoglobulin family intercellular adhesion molecules that are up-regulated without structural mutations in approximately 70% of human cancers. Results in in vitro systems showing tumorigenic effects for these molecules suggest that this correlation could indicate an instrumental role in tumorigenesis. To test whether this applies in vivo, transgenic mice harboring 187 kb of the human genome containing four CEA family member genes including the CEA and CEACAM6 genes were created and their copy numbers increased by mating until colonocyte expression levels reached levels seen in human colorectal carcinomas. The colonocyte surface level of integrin α5 and the activation of AKT increased progressively with the expression levels of CEA/CEACAM6. Colonic crypts showed a progressive increase in colonocyte proliferation, an increase in crypt fission, and a strong inhibition of both differentiation and anoikis/apoptosis. All transgenic mice showed massively enlarged colons comprising a continuous mosaic of severe hyperplasia, dysplasia and serrated adenomatous morphology. These results suggest that up-regulated non-mutated adhesion molecules could have a significant instrumental role in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1986163586,"A green ciliate Paramecium bursaria, bearing several hundreds of endosymbiotic algae, demonstrates rotational microtubule-based cytoplasmic streaming, in which cytoplasmic granules and endosymbiotic algae flow in a constant direction. However, its physiological significance is still unknown. We investigated physiological roles of cytoplasmic streaming in P. bursaria through host cell cycle using video-microscopy. Here, we found that cytoplasmic streaming was arrested in dividing green paramecia and the endosymbiotic algae proliferated only during the arrest of cytoplasmic streaming. Interestingly, arrest of cytoplasmic streaming with pressure or a microtubule drug also induced proliferation of endosymbiotic algae independently of host cell cycle. Thus, cytoplasmic streaming may control the algal proliferation in P. bursaria. Furthermore, confocal microscopic observation revealed that a division septum was formed in the constricted area of a dividing paramecium, producing arrest of cytoplasmic streaming. This is a first report to suggest that cytoplasmic streaming controls proliferation of eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050929507,"Aging may be accompanied by a low grade chronic up-regulation of inflammatory mediators. A variety of endogenous locally released mediators as well as inflammatory cells have been reported in the human oral cavity. The aim of this investigation was to determine the presence of different classes of inflammatory mediators in human saliva and correlate the levels with age.Unstimulated whole buccal salivary samples were obtained in the morning from 94 healthy volunteers within 30 minutes after waking. None of the participants had taken aspirin in the week prior to the saliva collection. Lysozyme activity, eicosanoid levels (prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4)) and MMP-9 activity were measured. The antimicrobial activity (lysozyme activity) was not correlated with age whereas PGE(2) levels were markedly correlated with age (r = 0.29; P<0.05; n = 56). Saliva from healthy subjects (< or =40 years) compared with data derived from older volunteers (>40 years) demonstrated a significant increase in the mean values for PGE(2) and MMP-9 activity with age. In addition, significant correlations were observed between LTB(4) and PGE(2) (r = 0.28; P<0.05; n = 56) and between LTB(4) levels and MMP-9 activity in smokers (r = 0.78; P<0.001; n = 15).The presence of significant levels and activity of inflammatory mediators in saliva suggests that the oral cavity of healthy subjects may be in a constant low state of inflammation associated with age."
https://openalex.org/W2073127302,"The AP-2 complex is a key factor in the formation of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). AP-2 sorts and packages cargo membrane proteins into CCVs, binds the coat protein clathrin, and recruits numerous other factors to the site of vesicle formation. Structural information on the AP-2 complex and biochemical work have allowed understanding its function on the molecular level, and recent studies showed that cycles of phosphorylation are key steps in the regulation of AP-2 function. The complex is phosphorylated on both large subunits (α- and β2-adaptins) as well as at a single threonine residue (Thr-156) of the medium subunit μ2. Phosphorylation of μ2 is necessary for efficient cargo recruitment, whereas the functional context of the large subunit phosphorylation is unknown. Here, we show that the subunit phosphorylation of AP-2 exhibits striking differences, with calculated half-lives of <1 min for μ2, ∼25 min for β2, and ∼70 min for α. We were also able to purify a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the μ2 subunit. The enzyme is a member of the protein phosphatase 2A family and composed of a catalytic Cβ subunit, a scaffolding Aβ subunit, and a regulatory Bα subunit. RNA interference knock down of the latter subunit in HeLa cells resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated adaptors and altered endocytosis, showing that a specific PP2A holoenzyme is an important regulatory enzyme in CCV-mediated transport.

Although it is obvious that clathrin coat assembly and disassembly need to be tightly regulated both spatially and temporally, little was known until now about the respective mechanisms that control the function of the many factors that are identified. However, increasing evidence suggests that cycles of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation are key events in the regulation of endocytic proteins (1Ungewickell E.J. Hinrichsen L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 417-425Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Indeed, the major endocytic CCV constituents, clathrin and AP-2, are functionally regulated by phosphorylation, as well as other factors including dynamin 1, amphiphysins, synaptojanin, AP180, epsin, and eps15, which are collectively grouped as dephosphins, that become active in their dephosphorylated state (2Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J.

Because AP-2 is a key factor in the formation of CCVs and known for a long time to be phosphorylated, it is an ideal model protein to analyze the functional consequences and regulatory mechanisms of cycles of phosphorylation (3Flett A. Semerdjieva S. Jackson A.P. Smythe E. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2005; 72: 65-70Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The complex is phosphorylated on the medium subunit μ2 at a single threonine residue (Thr-156), which is mediated in vitro by the two kinases AAK1 and GAK (4Olusanya O. Andrews P.D. Swedlow J.R.

Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Both kinases phosphorylate not only μ2 but also the μ1 subunit of the AP-1 complex in vitro, and it is yet unclear whether the two kinases act redundantly or distinctively (9Lee D.W. Zhao X. Zhang F. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4311-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Henderson D.M. Conner S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2698-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Besides this uncertainty, the current data show that phosphorylation of the adaptor μ subunits is a trigger for high affinity binding to YXXΦ sorting signals of cargo membrane proteins (5Ricotta D. Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. von Figura K. Höning S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Höning S. Ricotta D. Krauss M. Spate K. Spolaore B. Motley A.

Although there is no evidence for phosphorylation of the AP-2 σ2 subunit, both large subunits (α- and β2-adaptins) are phosphorylated, but it is not well established which residues are modified. Using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody, Sorkin and coworkers identified an amino-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-6) as a major target site for β2 phosphorylation (12Huang F. Jiang X. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43411-43417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas more recently others have identified Tyr-737 located in the ear domain as an agonist-dependent Src kinase target (13Fessart D.

Not only tyrosine residues have been identified as phosphorylation target sites but also serine/threonine kinases such as the recently identified CVAK104 (14Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21539-21544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) may impact on the phosphorylation status of β2-adaptin. Likewise, α-adaptin is also phosphorylated, but no data are available on the target sites and the involved kinase(s). To get further insight into the role of AP-2 phosphorylation, we used pulse-chase experiments to determine the phosphorylation turnover of the different AP-2 subunits. To our surprise, the phosphorylation half-lives exhibited great differences, ranging from <1 min in the case of μ2 to 25 min for β2 and ∼70 min for the α subunit. In addition, we purified a μ2-dephosphorylating enzyme activity from pig brain to homogeneity. The enzyme was identified as a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and composed of all three subunits that constitute a functional holoenzyme: a catalytic Cβ subunit, a scaffolding Aβ subunit, and a regulatory Bα subunit. Because the latter subunit is assumed to determine intracellular location and substrate specificity, we knocked down the PP2A Bα subunit in HeLa cells by RNAi. In the affected cells, we detected increased levels of μ2 phosphorylation and altered endocytosis of transferrin, showing that a particular PP2A is an important regulatory enzyme in CCV-mediated transport. Reagents and Antibodies—Monoclonal anti-α-adaptin was from Alexis; antibodies against the PP2A subunits were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (rabbit anti-PP2A Cα/β; rabbit anti-PP2A Aα/β; rabbit anti-PP1; rabbit anti-PP2B) and Millipore GmbH (Schwalbach, Germany) (monoclonal anti-Bα). Phosphorylated μ2 was detected with sheep antibodies (kindly provided by Elizabeth Smythe, University of Sheffield, UK) or with serum from a rabbit that was immunized with a synthetic peptide comprising phosphorylated Thr-156. Monoclonal antibodies against clathrin and γ-adaptin were from BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-tubulin was from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies used for Western blotting and fluorochrome-labeled antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Protein phosphatase 1, 2A, and 2B proteins were obtained from Calbiochem. The serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine was from Sigma; the phosphatase inhibitors ocadaic acid and calyculin-A were from Alexis; microcystin-agarose was obtained from Upstate. Cell Culture—HeLa and MDBK cells were grown at 37 °C under standard cell culture conditions at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells derived from transfection with the PP2A B-α RNAi vector were maintained in the presence of 200 μg/ml G-418. Purification of CCVs and Immunoisolation of AP-2—The CCV preparation and the AP-2 purification from them, as well as the 32P labeling of AP-2 and its immunoisolation, were exactly as described (5Ricotta D. Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. von Figura K. Höning S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Fingerhut A. von Figura K. Höning S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5476-5482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In Vitro Dephosphorylation of AP-2—32P-labeled AP-2 (10-15.000 cpm) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C without any further additions (negative control) or with pig brain or HeLa cytosol (5-100 μg) or commercial protein phosphatase (0.05 units/sample) in a final volume of 100 μl. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged, the supernatants were removed, and the immunoadsorbed AP-2 was washed three times with dephosphorylation buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent detection with autoradiography and Western blotting. Purification of an AP-2-Dephosphorylating Enzyme from Pig Brain—Pig brain cytosol obtained from the CCV purification was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (35% final concentration), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min in a JA10 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The derived supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4), followed by centrifugation as described above. The fractionated cytosol was then applied to hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated in buffer A and connected to a Perseptive Vision chromatography work station at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. After sample application, the column was extensively washed for 1 h with buffer A followed by gradient elution using buffer A without ammonium sulfate. The μ2-phosphorylating activity was collected in the third of three peaks eluting at the end of the gradient. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol), followed by strong anion exchange chromatography using a 4.6 × 100-mm Source Q column at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. After washing of the column with 10 column volumes, proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient (0-0.5 m within 15 column volumes). The μ2-dephosphorylating activity eluted in two consecutive fractions at ∼250 mm salt. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B, followed by chromatography on a 4.6 × 100-mm DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The μ2-dephosphorylating activity was collected in two fractions eluting at ∼600 mm salt. Fractions were pooled (2 ml) and concentrated to 200 μl by centrifugation and then applied to size exclusion chromatography using a 7.8 × 300-mm G3000 SWXL column (Toso Haas) equilibrated in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Only one major peak was detectable that contained the μ2-dephosphorylating activity and eluted at a size of ∼200 kDa. The eluted protein sample was kept at 4 °C until further use. Immunoprecipitation of Cellular Adaptors—Pulse-chase experiments were used to immunoprecipitate intracellular phospho-AP-2. In brief, confluent cells on 3-cm dishes were starved in phosphate-free medium followed by incubation with 220 μCi [32P]orthophosphate in 1 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5% serum) for 8.5 h (pulse). Afterward, the labeling medium was removed and the cells were washed and subsequently incubated for the indicated chase periods in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10-fold excess phosphate. Control cells (t = 0 min) were collected after the pulse. All incubations were stopped by transferring the cells on ice and immediately exchanging the medium for ice-cold homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). The cells were scraped in 1 ml of homogenization buffer, collected by centrifugation for 5 min with 500 × g, and then resuspended in 0.5 m Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 nm calyculin, 10 nm okadaic acid, 400 nm cantharidin, 900 nm endothal, protease inhibitors and incubated for 30 min, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g to remove insoluble proteins. AP-2 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants as described (5Ricotta D. Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. von Figura K. Höning S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and resolved by conventional or 6 m urea-containing SDS-PAGE (16Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The subunit-incorporated radioactivity was quantified from the dried gels using a FUJIX BAS 1000. In some experiments AP-1 was precipitated as described above, using monoclonal anti-γ adaptin antibodies. The amount of radioactivity present in the labeling medium before/after the pulse and in the medium after the chase was determined by Cerenkov counting. By subtracting the values, the intracellular radioactivity after the chase was determined. For each experiment, the sums over time of the values of α, β2, and μ2 phosphorylation and intracellular radioactivity were determined. To level these values from different experiments, they were multiplied with a factor so that the corresponding sums in each experiment were the same. Average values and standard deviations were then generated and expressed in percent of the control average values (t = 0 min). Intracellular radioactivity was interpolated with the sum of two e-functions and differentiated, and the differentiation was expressed in percent of control, too. The phosphorylation half-lives were determined as described in the supplemental information. For the data evaluation, Microsoft Excel and R program were used. Data were interpolated with the formulas after the method of least squares using the function “nls” in the R program. Identification of Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—For peptide mass fingerprint analysis, the respective protein bands visible after Coomassie staining were excised, cut in 1-mm small pieces and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Neubauer G. Shevchenko A. Mortensen P. Mann M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), desalted on C18 ZipTIP, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using dihydrobenzoic acid as matrix and two autolytic peptides of trypsin (m/z 842.51 and 2211.10) as internal standards. The mass spectrometric data were used by Mascot search algorithm for protein identification in the NCBInr protein data base. Suppression of PP2A Bα by RNA Interference—A plasmid-based system was used to stably suppress the expression of the PP2A Bα subunit in HeLa cells. The sequence GAACCCACTTCCTGCTTAG starting at position 1667 in the 3′-untranslated region of the human Bα mRNA (NM_002717) was used as a target. In brief, two complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized containing the above target sequence followed by a spacer of nine nucleotides, the target sequence in reverse orientation, and a sequence of five thymidine bases as a terminator of transcription. Both primers were annealed and cloned into the pSHH plasmid (BioCarta) using SalI and XbaI restriction sites. The plasmid, which also confers resistance to G418, was transfected into HeLa cells using Effectene (Qiagen) as a transfection reagent. Single clones were assayed by Western blotting for suppression of the Bα subunit. Three clones in which Bα expression was reduced by more than 80% were used for further analysis. No obvious variation between the clones was noticeable. To rule out unwanted side effects of vector-based RNAi for the PP2A Bα subunit, we also used small interference RNA oligos for the same and an additional target sequence (GTCTCATAGCAGAGGAGAA). For rescue experiments, the coding sequence of the human Bα-cDNA was cloned in-frame into the pCMV-3Tag-6 vector (Stratagene) using HindIII and XhoI restriction sites. The final insert codes for an amino-terminal triple repeat of the FLAG tag (25 amino acids), followed by an additional spacer sequence (30 amino acids) that was found to be essential for detection of the tag sequence. Expression from the vector in HeLa cells was not sensitive to the target sequence of vector-based RNAi and the respective small interference RNA oligos, because the target sequences in the 3′-untranslated region were deleted from the insert. The recombinant 3× FLAG-tagged Bα subunit was detected by using tag-specific monoclonal (GenScript) or polyclonal (Delta Biolabs) antibodies. Integration of the tagged recombinant Bα subunit into PP2A holoenzymes was verified by detection of the PP2A C and A subunits in anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitates and by detection of the recombinant subunit after capture of PP2A using agarose-immobilized microcystin (see supplemental Fig. S1). Endocytosis Experiments—Cells on glass coverslips were serum-starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% serum albumin, washed with PBS, and incubated for 15 min on ice in the presence of 20 μg/ml Alexa 546-conjugated human transferrin (Tf), human Dil-LDL (20 μg/ml), or rhodamine-labeled dextran (2 mg/ml). Afterward, the cells were either immediately fixed and processed for microscopy or first incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to 2 h to monitor internalization. For the biochemical analyses of Tf uptake, we used the biotinylated protein. Parallel samples were incubated on ice with Biotin-Tf for 30 min followed by washing with PBS. Then one sample was collected for subsequent analysis of the total amount of bound Tf. A second sample was left on ice and later subjected to trypsin treatment to control the removal of surface Tf. All other samples were incubated at 37 °C for up to 10 min and then chilled on ice, washed with PBS, and incubated three times for 5 min with trypsin to remove surface Tf. After washing with PBS, 1% serum, the cells of all samples were scraped, collected by centrifugation, and homogenized in PBS, 1% Triton X-100. Subsequently, the biotin-Tf was immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose and detected by Western blotting. A concentration series of biotin-Tf served as a control for the amount of cell-internalized protein. Trypsin treatment was able to remove >95% of all surface Tf. Endocytosis is expressed as the amount of cell-associated biotin-Tf relative to the total amount initially bound on ice. Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded on glass coverslips 1 or 2 days before use. After fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blockage of remaining aldehyde groups with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, the cells were permeabilized using 0.5% saponin in PBS. Incubation with the primary antibodies was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation for 15 min in 10% goat serum and incubation with the fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS and water, the samples were mounted in Fluoromount (DAKO) and analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS-2 AOBS). For quantitative analysis we determined the fluorescence intensity along identical longitudes of plasma membrane profiles in an area of 200 × 200 μm in HeLa and RNAi cells. Miscellaneous—For inhibition of μ2 dephosphorylation by PP2A, a synthetic Thr-phosphorylated peptide was used (CQ148SQITSQVTPGQIGWR162) that resembles the phosphorylation site in the AP-2 μ2 subunit with an additional cysteine at the amino terminus. The equivalent non-phosphorylated peptide and two other non-related peptides were used as controls. The AP-2 Subunits Exhibit Different Phosphorylation Turnover Rates—To gain insight into the phosphorylation turnover of the different AP-2 subunits, cells were labeled with [32P]phosphate for 8.5 h to mark a large pool of proteins. After labeling, AP-2 was either immediately immunoprecipitated (t = 0 min) or the cells were chased for different periods of time in phosphate-rich medium before AP-2 was collected. Subsequent to immunoprecipitation, AP-2 was subjected to SDS and urea-containing SDS-PAGE to resolve α-, β2-, and μ2-adaptins (Fig. 1A). Finally, the incorporated [32P]phosphate was quantified after autoradiography, and the amount of subunit-incorporated phosphate relative to the beginning of the chase (t = 0 min) was plotted together with the export velocity of [32P]inorganic phosphate from the cells (Fig. 1B, red curve). Interestingly, we noticed a faster phosphorylation turnover of μ2 compared with β2 and α-adaptin. To calculate realistic phosphorylation turnover rates from the raw data shown in Fig. 1A, the final mathematical equations had to consider the continuously decreasing probability of 32P-protein rephosphorylation during the chase period (see supplemental information for a detailed description). For the turnover of μ2 phosphorylation we calculated a half-life of less than 1 min, while the two large adaptor subunits exhibited half-lives of ∼25 (β2-adaptin) and ∼70 min (α-adaptin). The calculated phosphorylation half-life of μ2 fits well to the turnover rate of a forming clathrin-coated vesicle (18Ehrlich M. Boll W. Van Oijen A. Hariharan R. Chandran K. Nibert M.L.

The phosphorylation turnover of the two AP-2 large subunits was much slower as compared with the μ2 subunit. In this context it is important to note that we did not discriminate between the potential amino acid residues involved. Using phosphoamino acid analysis, Wilde and Brodsky (20Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated phosphorylation of α- and β2-adaptin only on serine residues whereas phosphorylation of tyrosine or threonine residues was not detectable. However, the pattern of phosphorylation may change upon the status of the cells analyzed. Recent data showed that stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in phosphorylation of β2-adaptin at Tyr-6 close to the amino terminus (12Huang F. Jiang X. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43411-43417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In a similar way, activation of vascular smooth muscle cells by the G-protein-coupled receptor agonist angiotensin II caused Src kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr-737 located in the carboxyl-terminal appendage domain of β2-adaptin (13Fessart D. Simaan M. Zimmerman B. Comeau J. Hamdan F.F. Wiseman P.W. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The authors speculate that β2 phosphorylation in this context is required to release AP-2 from bound β-arrestin; however, the details of this regulation remain unknown. The data presented here for the phosphorylation turnover of the AP-2 subunits were obtained from unstimulated cells and resemble the experimental conditions used by Wilde and Brodsky. Although the functional role of this “basic” phosphorylation remains unclear, it may be of significance for the regulation of AP-2 binding to its many partners (1Ungewickell E.J. Hinrichsen L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 417-425Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the AP-2 large subunits in their flexible, unstructured hinge regions or their appendage domains may directly or indirectly be a prerequisite for the binding to other proteins, or to terminate such binding. Future work will need to address these possibilities on the molecular level. Identification of a μ2-Dephosphorylating Phosphatase—The high affinity binding of μ2 to tyrosine-based sorting signals of membrane proteins requires its phosphorylation at Thr-156, mediated by the adaptor-associated kinase AAK1 and/or the cyclin G-associated kinase (10Henderson D.M. Conner S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2698-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Zhang C.X. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Carreno S. Owen D.J. Smythe E. Drubin D.G. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Lee D.W. Wu X. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In consequence, the regulatory cycle requires an antagonistic phosphatase. To characterize and finally to identify this enzyme we used immunoisolated AP-2 radiolabeled with [32P]phosphate at Thr-156 as a substrate (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Incubation of the labeled AP-2 with cytosol of different origin (e.g. HeLa cells or pig brain) resulted in a signal decrease, indicative of μ2 dephosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Small aliquots of the immunoisolated AP-2 prior and after cytosol incubation were used for the detection of α- and μ2-adaptin and revealed that equal amounts were present, clearly demonstrating that the loss of signal in the autoradiogram was the result of dephosphorylation, ruling out loss of AP-2 in the assay. When the cytosol was preincubated with sodium orthovanadate or EDTA/EGTA, dephosphorylation of μ2 was still effective, arguing against the involvement of a phosphatase dependent on divalent metal ions or a tyrosine phosphatase (not shown). In contrast, calyculin-A, microcystin, and ocadaic acid totally abolished μ2 dephosphorylation at nanomolar concentrations (not shown), indicating that a trimeric protein phosphatase like PP1 or PP2A may be a more likely candidate. Indeed, PP2A was already characterized as the enzymatic activity that mediates dephosphorylation of the μ1 subunit of the AP-1 complex (23Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but no specific enzyme was identified. Because most phosphatases are predominantly cytosolic we used pig brain cytosol as a starting material for the purification of the μ2-dephosphorylating enzyme. Ammonium sulfate precipitation was first used to deplete the cytosol of a substantial number of proteins. Under these conditions, the enzyme remained in the soluble fraction as verified by dephosphorylation of AP-2 using the assay described above. The fractionated cytosol was then applied to hydrophobic interaction chromatography, followed by collection of those fractions that contained μ2-dephosphorylating enzymatic activity. The pooled fractions were further applied to strong and weak anion exchange chromatography and finally to size exclusion chromatography. At this step the μ2-dephosphorylating activity eluted in a single small peak that contained four proteins (Fig. 2B), which were subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting. With Mowse scores ≥200, one of the proteins was identified as actin (Fig. 2C, asterisk); the other three proteins were identified as the Aβ, Bα, and Cβ subunits of PP2A. In conclusion, we succeeded in the first purification of a PP2A holoenzyme that mediates dephosphorylation of the μ2 subunit of AP-2. The purified enzyme preparation was free of any contamination by PP1 or PP2B as verified by Western blotting, whereas each PP2A subunit was unequivocally detected by antibodies"
https://openalex.org/W2071755641,"We showed previously that Theiler's virus, a neurotropic non-enveloped picornavirus of mouse, traffics from the axon of infected neurons into the surrounding myelin. When this traffic is interrupted, as in the shiverer mouse which bears a mutation in the myelin basic protein gene, the virus is unable to persist in the central nervous system. In the present work, we used the Wlds mutant mouse, a strain in which axonal degeneration is considerably slowed down, to show that axon to myelin traffic takes place in the absence of axon degeneration. Our results suggest the existence of a mechanism of transfer of axonal cytoplasm into the myelin which Theiler's virus might exploit to ensure its persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2001732200,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the usability of three diagnostic procedures for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus in clinical samples. Therefore, the FDA cleared CE marked NOW® RSV ELISA, the NucliSENS® EasyQ RSV A+B NASBA, and a literature based inhouse RT-PCR protocol were compared for their relative sensitivities. Thereby, NASBA turned out to be the most sensitive method with a total number of 80 RSV positive samples out of a cohort of 251 nasopharyngeal washings from patients suffering from clinical symptoms, followed by the inhouse RT-PCR (62/251) and ELISA (52/251). Thus, NASBA may serve as a rapid and highly sensitive alternative for RSV diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2011006617,"Background Experimental results evidenced the infectious potential of the dental pulp of animals infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). This route of iatrogenic transmission of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) may exist in humans via reused endodontic instruments if inadequate prion decontamination procedures are used. Methodology/Principal Findings To assess this risk, 10 critical parameters in the transmission process were identified, starting with contamination of an endodontic file during treatment of an infectious sCJD patient and ending with possible infection of a subsequent susceptible patient. It was assumed that a dose-risk response existed, with no-risk below threshold values. Plausible ranges of those parameters were obtained through literature search and expert opinions, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted. Without effective prion-deactivation procedures, the risk of being infected during endodontic treatment ranged between 3.4 and 13 per million procedures. The probability that more than one case was infected secondary to endodontic treatment of an infected sCJD patient ranged from 47% to 77% depending on the assumed quantity of infective material necessary for disease transmission. If current official recommendations on endodontic instrument decontamination were strictly followed, the risk of secondary infection would become quasi-null. Conclusion The risk of sCJD transmission through endodontic procedure compares with other health care risks of current concern such as death after liver biopsy or during general anaesthesia. These results show that single instrument use or adequate prion-decontamination procedures like those recently implemented in dental practice must be rigorously enforced."
https://openalex.org/W1999240253,"The expression of MHC class I genes is repressed in mature neurons. The molecular basis of this regulation is poorly understood, but the genes are particularly rich in CpG islands. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides; mutations in this protein also cause the neurodevelopmental disease called Rett syndrome. Because MHC class I molecules play a role in neuronal connectivity, we hypothesised that MeCP2 might repress MHC class I expression in the CNS and that this might play a role in the pathology of Rett syndrome.We show here that transiently transfected cells expressing high levels of MeCP2 specifically downregulate cell-surface expression of MHC class I molecules in the neuronal cell line N2A and they prevent the induction of MHC class I expression in response to interferon in these cells, supporting our first hypothesis. Surprisingly, however, overexpression of the mutated forms of MeCP2 that cause Rett syndrome had a similar effect on MHC class I expression as the wild-type protein. Immunohistological analyses of brain slices from MECP2 knockout mice (the MeCP2(tm1.1Bird) strain) demonstrated a small but reproducible increase in MHC class I when compared to their wild type littermates, but we found no difference in MHC class I expression in primary cultures of mixed glial cells (mainly neurons and astrocytes) from the knockout and wild-type mice.These data suggest that high levels of MeCP2, such as those found in mature neurons, may contribute to the repression of MHC expression, but we find no evidence that MeCP2 regulation of MHC class I is important for the pathogenesis of Rett syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2083501761,"Thymopentin (TP5) triggers an immune response by contacting with T cells; however the molecular basis of how TP5 achieves this process remains incompletely understood. According to the main idea of immunomodulation, we suppose that it would be necessary for TP5 to form complex with human class II major histocompatibility complex DR molecules (HLA-DR) before TP5 interacts with T cells. The uptake of TP5 by EBV-transformed B cells expressing HLA-DR molecules and the histogram of fluorescence intensities were observed by using fluorescent- labeled TP5, testifying the direct binding of TP5 to HLA-DR. The binding specificity was confirmed by the inhibition with unlabeled TP5, suggesting the recognition of TP5 by HLA-DR. To confirm the interaction between TP5 and HLA-DR, the complex formation was predicted by using various modeling strategies including six groups of trials with different parameters, alanine substitutions of TP5, and the mutants of HLA-DR. The results demonstrated that TP5 and its alanine substitutions assumed distinct conformations when they bound to HLA-DR. The observation further showed that there was flexibility in how the peptide bound within the binding cleft. Also, the molecular analysis supplemented a newly important discovery to the effect of Val anchor on TP5 binding HLA-DR, and revealed the important effects of Glu11 and Asn62 on the recognition of TP5. These results demonstrated the capability of TP5 to associate with HLA-DR in living antigen presenting cells (APC), thereby providing a new and promising strategy to understand the immunomodulation mechanism induced by TP5 and to design potential immunoregulatory polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2038907525,"With new incentives, some governments in Latin America are starting to increase investment in basic and applied research. Although the news is encouraging, scientists in this region still face many challenges ahead. With new incentives, some governments in Latin America are starting to increase investment in basic and applied research. Although the news is encouraging, scientists in this region still face many challenges ahead. After the economic crises of the 1990s in Latin America, when Argentina's economy minister famously advised scientists to go “wash dishes” as a career, science in the region is seeing better times. Boosted by a 5.6% jump in economic growth rate in 2006, with projections of a 20.6% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2008 (http://www.eclac.org/publicaciones/xml/2/29312/lcg2338i.pdf), and motivated by a heartening increase in the number of scientific papers published by Latin American authors, governments (particularly those of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico) are announcing new packages and incentives to foster science and technology. It is hoped that these encouraging developments and the increased focus on science and technology will also benefit the rest of the region. Brazil started to increase investment in science 10 to 15 years ago through several initiatives including one to increase the number of graduate school programs, one to support research centers of excellence (PRONEX), and one that introduced science and technology grants funded by Brazilian companies whose revenues result from the use of natural resources (Fundos Setoriais). However, these initiatives pale in comparison to the announcement last month by Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that his government has earmarked US $22.9 billion (US $1 = R $1.79) to spend on science, technology, and innovation over the next 3 years. His plan focuses on establishing and consolidating a national system for science, technology, and innovation; promoting technological innovation in companies and industry; advancing R&D in disciplines considered to be promising, such as nanotechnology and biotechnology; and promoting science and technology to society. “It's a package like no other. I don't think we ever had something like this in Brazil” says geneticist Mayana Zatz, Dean of Research at the Universidade de São Paulo, who is known for her work on muscular dystrophy and for supporting the use of embryonic stem cells in research. Zatz expects to see “a paradigm shift in the way people see and do science in Brazil.” Says Rafael Roesler, head of the Pharmacology Department at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and a researcher at the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, “transferring knowledge from our labs to industry will be easier now.” For Laila Naoum, a molecular biologist who recently returned to Brazil after spending several years as a postdoc at the Marine Biology Laboratory at Woods Hole in the United States, the new announcement gives her hope for finding a permanent position in a Brazilian university or a place in industry. “When I was in the US, I wished there was some type of bank of opportunities in Brazil for people like me. I think that now more opportunities will be available and finding a position, I hope, will be easier.” Meanwhile, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the new President of Brazil's neighbor Argentina, who took office several weeks ago, has announced the creation of Argentina's first ever Ministry for Science and Technology. Until now, science and technology have been overseen by offices integrated within a much bigger ministry that also included education. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her government are expected to increase investments in science and technology to 1% of GDP by 2010 (in 2006, investment was 0.58% of GDP) (http://www.secyt.gov.ar/plan_bicentenario/documentos_finales/plan_bicentenario_publicacion.pdf). Of that proposed 1% GDP, it is expected that half will be provided by public funds and half by the private sector. Indeed, the new government has already announced a 20% increase in funding for a select list of science and technology projects to be launched in 2008. The new ministry is to be headed by José Lino Barañao, a molecular biologist known for his work with transgenic animals, who was president of the National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion. And his message is clear: science and industry need to talk. “If the link between science and industry is missing, the scientific creativity and knowledge end up giving fruits elsewhere… it's like producing petroleum and then giving it away,” he said in a statement published in Argentina's daily newspaper La Nacion. “Dr. Barañao is an excellent scientist with great experience in administration who has clear ideas about the role of science and technology in a developing country and is well respected by the scientific community,” says Alberto Kornbliht, a professor of molecular and cell biology at Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina and an HHMI International Research Scholar. Nevertheless, the expectations of Argentinian scientists are running high. Says immunologist Gabriel Rabinovich, also at Universidad de Buenos Aires, “We hope that the newly elected President, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, will promote a sustained growth of the scientific community in Argentina. However, much remains to be done in terms of increasing scientific competitiveness in the region and avoiding excessive brain drain of talented South Americans to developed countries. That includes fostering international collaborations, creating stronger ties with industry, giving strong support in the initial phases of independent careers and stimulating public awareness of the importance of scientific knowledge for national development.” However, Rabinovich does point out that “despite serious economic and political challenges, a tradition of fundamental research has always been fostered in Argentina.” Although delighted at the recent announcement, both researchers agree that there remain many challenges ahead for science in Argentina. Perhaps Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's announcement was inspired by the new president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, who, when elected in 2006, promised that innovation and entrepreneurship would be one of the main transformations of her administration. She announced her intention to increase R&D spending by 50%, which means that by 2010 the country should be spending 1% of its GDP on science and technology (http://www.conicyt.cl/573/articles-7931_recurso_1.pdf). Already the number of graduate science fellowships has increased by 112% in 2006 compared to the previous year, and for the first time research grants have been given to young researchers (114 projects total). From 2004 to 2006, the investment in science increased 50% according to a report by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Investigation (CONOCYT). The investment in 2007 is almost twice the amount invested in 2004 (http://www.conicyt.cl/573/article-7395.html). Further North, in Mexico, a 2006 report by the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) shows progress thanks to a special program launched in 2001. The number of students enrolled in science and technology PhD programs increased from 488 in 1994 to 2,009 in 2005, and the number of researchers brought under the umbrella of the National Science and Technology System (in public universities or centers) increased by 62% during the period 2001–2005. The 2001 program had three goals: to establish a state policy on science and technology, to increase capacity, and to improve competitiveness and innovation. To accomplish these goals, the Mexican government passed the Science and Technology Law in 2002, which created a special fund for science and technology, called Sectorial Funds, supported by monies from the ministries and other governmental agencies, as well as from states and districts (mixed funds). The Law stated that Vicente Fox's government would need to invest 1% of the country's GDP in science by the end of his term in 2006. According to a CONACYT report, the investment in R&D in 2005 was still only 0.43% GDP (http://www.siicyt.gob.mx/siicyt/docs/Estadisticas3/Informe2006/Capitulo%205.pdf). Despite the recent good news, Latin America still has a long way to go to catch up with developed countries (Table 1, Table 2). For example, the share of the world's gross expenditure on R&D (GERD) in 2002 by Latin American and Caribbean countries was 2.6, while North America's share was 37 and Asia's share was 31.5 (see Table 1). In 2004, Brazil invested 0.91% of its GDP in R&D, while Mexico invested 0.41%, Argentina 0.44%, and Chile 0.68% (see Table 1). This low investment in R&D has had dramatic consequences for a scientific community that is constantly struggling with unstable financial conditions, limited numbers of grants and low salaries, difficulties importing reagents and equipment, and strong competition for the few permanent positions available at public institutions. Due to the general scarcity of money for science in Latin America, governments and international agencies have strategically funded a few groups of excellence doing research in priority fields for these countries, forming continent-wide and country-wide collaborative networks.Table 1Expenditure on Science and Technology in Latin AmericaExpenditure on Science and Technology as % GDP in 2004ahttp://www.ricyt.edu.ar/indicadores/comparativos/05.xls.Share of World's Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) in 2002bhttp://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/S&T/WdScienceRepTable1.pdf.Total Patent Applications Granted Worldwide in 2005chttp://www.ricyt.edu.ar/indicadores/comparativos/22.xls., dData for 2005 are not available for Brazil; 2004 data are shown.Argentina0.441,798Brazil0.917,047dData for 2005 are not available for Brazil; 2004 data are shown.Chile0.68637Mexico0.418,098Latin America and Caribbean2.621,126North America37.0Asia31.5Europe27.3United States2.7035.0143,806a http://www.ricyt.edu.ar/indicadores/comparativos/05.xls.b http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/S&T/WdScienceRepTable1.pdf.c http://www.ricyt.edu.ar/indicadores/comparativos/22.xls.d Data for 2005 are not available for Brazil; 2004 data are shown.

Open table in a new tab A good example of a longstanding continent-wide collaboration is a network of scientists led by Osvaldo Podhajcer at the Institute Leloir in Argentina, Guillermo Mazzolini at Universidad Austral in Argentina, and Martín Montecino at Universidad de Concepción in Chile. Together they have received US $6 million, principally from the World Bank, to develop new approaches for gene targeting based on functional genomics platforms and new viral vectors that target gastrointestinal cancer, which is a particular problem in Chile, where the disease kills about 25 of every 100,000 persons. “Our collaboration is essential because our groups have complementing skills. Podhajcer's group has expertise in using viral particles as vectors for gene therapy, our group is expert in the analysis of promoters that are tissue-specific, and Mazzolini has great experience in pharmacological toxicity and clinical trials,” says Montecino. He adds that this is the first scientific project in the region involving efforts from two countries to solve a major health problem. Ten years after taking their first steps into genomics research, Brazil and Mexico have built a consolidated network of genome and bioinformatics research centers that have concentrated their efforts on sequencing expressed sequence tags and the genomes of organisms that are of economic or health importance for this region. For example, together with a group in Cuba led by Abel Gonzales Perez at the National Bioinformatics Center, Julio Collado-Vides at the Center for Genomic Sciences at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and Ana Tereza Ribeiro Vasconcelos, head of the Bioinformatics branch at the National Laboratory of Computer Sciences in Brazil, have developed Tractor, a database of computationally predicted transcription factor-binding sites in γ-proteobacterial genomes. The database now contains genome sequences of more than 30 bacterial species, which the group hopes will help in elucidating how bacteria respond to environmental changes at the level of transcriptional regulation. Collado-Vides' group is also collaborating with the US Department of Agriculture and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia to sequence the genome of the tapeworm Taenia solium and of Phaseolus vulgaris, a food staple in Mexico. These projects provide valuable biological information that may help to improve agriculture and health, but the consequences of consolidated genome research networks in the region have other benefits. As Ana Tereza Ribeiro Vasconcelos points out, these networks enable Brazilian scientists “to be trained not only in molecular and sequencing techniques, but also in bioinformatics and computational analysis of biological information.” Likewise, in Mexico, these networks have prompted the launch of a new undergraduate program at UNAM devoted to training personnel in disciplines essential for genomic sciences such as mathematics, statistics, and computer science. “We expect the training to be extended into a PhD program that can be done either here in Mexico or abroad,” says Collado-Vides. Meanwhile, in Brazil, a country-wide network of research centers enabled sequencing of the genome of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which causes a disease of citrus crops that has severe economic ramifications given that Brazil produces 30% of the world's citrus crop. Sequencing of other economically and medically important genomes such as those of sugar cane and the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, has also been completed. The next organism to have its genome sequenced is Anopheles darlingi, which is the vector that transmits malaria in South America. As with most developing regions, brain drain remains a problem. According to a 2007 OECD report, almost 8% of the population living in OECD countries are university-educated people from either South or Central America (http://www.oecd.org/country). Nevertheless, as the opportunities for scientists start to improve across the region, going back home may not be as hard as it sounds. After spending 2 years as a postdoc at the Center of Drug Evaluation and Research of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Rockville, Maryland, Fabio Klamt now has his own research group at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. The secret he reveals is “when abroad, do not lose ties with your institution in Brazil.” Now that he is back home, Klamt also emphasizes that “I want to keep the doors open and not miss new opportunities for collaborating with my previous lab in the US.” Klamt remains confident that “returning home is worthwhile.” The problem of brain drain is particularly aggravated in Mexico, perhaps due to its proximity to the United States. Researchers at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México estimate that of the 2650 graduate students currently abroad and supported by Mexican fellowships, only 150 will return. To address this imbalance, CONACYT has instigated a program to repatriate researchers and supports another program to keep young scientists in Mexico. From 2001 to 2005, the program has resulted in 845 scientists returning to Mexico. For well-established scientists, however, returning home can be a gratifying experience and can also enable research that would not be possible elsewhere. Take Gerardo Jimenez-Sanchez, for example, who returned to Mexico from the United States after spending several years in David Valle's lab at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. He is now director of the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) in Mexico City. The principal goal of the institute is to assemble a genetic map of the Mexican population to discover genetic variants (SNPs) associated with diabetes, obesity, cancer, and heart disease. As Jimenez-Sanchez points out, “modern Mexicans are the result of a mix of more than 65 native Indian groups with Spaniards, leading to a genetic makeup that is different from all other populations.” Initial results from the first genetic map of a Latin American population that analyzed the genomes of 1600 individuals from 11 different states in Mexico indicate that Mexicans have patterns of functional SNPs with different frequencies than those observed in other populations. Jimenez-Sanchez anticipates that “we expect to see dramatic effects when applying pharmacogenomics to the Mexican population.” The genetic map has also attracted the interest of food companies seeking to learn how gene variants affect the way that food is metabolized and the consequences for health. The Swiss company, Nestle, recently set up a US $0.5 million grant to support research and personnel training in nutrigenomics at INMEGEN. Another key problem for scientists in Latin America is importing reagents and equipment. Despite progress seen in specific areas of research, small manufacturers in the region do not have the capacity to produce and deliver reagents and most state-of-the art equipment. Consequently, equipment and consumables must be imported from abroad, thus increasing the costs of such items. Additionally, customs procedures related to transporting and storage of items that need special handling, such as radioactive isotopes, temperature-sensitive molecules, and transgenic and knockout animals, are a logistical nightmare. Not to mention the time it takes to receive imported goods, which can be as long as 1 year for sophisticated equipment or a month for primers that are usually delivered overnight in developed countries. Even worse, the higher prices of imported items are due principally to import duties and customs fees that end up being paid with public funds as most scientific research in Latin America is government funded. A recent survey conducted in Brazil by the Neuroscience and Behavioral Society estimated that, on average, 67% of the final price paid for items bought abroad is spent on importing them. Says Brazilian neuroscientist Roesler in response to the recent announcement from Lula's government of the windfall for Brazilian science, “more money and better funding is always welcome, but if I had to change one thing to improve science in Brazil that would be the bureaucracy associated with importing research goods.” It turns out that Lula is determined to address this problem, stating during his announcement “…so many times a material that in Europe or in the United States takes a week to be delivered, here it would take anywhere from six months to one year…as though it were a car or airplane. There was no sense of priority.” Despite the many challenges ahead, the future for science in Latin America is looking brighter as evidenced by Lula's tongue-in-cheek comment to Science Minister Sergio Rezende after the announcement of Brazil's new science package, “I hope you do not show up in my office asking for money until 2010.” But it will be up to the scientists to make the most of these promising new developments. As Lula points out, “The money is available, now make it happen.”"
https://openalex.org/W2074373329,"Hypophosphatemia occurs in 40 to 60% of patients with acute malaria, and in many other conditions associated with elevations of body temperature. To determine the prevalence and causes of hypophosphatemia in patients with malaria, we retrospectively studied all adults diagnosed with acute malaria during a 12-year period. To validate our findings, we analyzed a second sample of malaria patients during a subsequent 10-year period. Serum phosphorus correlated inversely with temperature (n = 59, r = −0.62; P<0.0001), such that each 1°C increase in body temperature was associated with a reduction of 0.18 mmol/L (0.56 mg/dL) in the serum phosphorus level (95% confidence interval: −0.12 to −0.24 mmol/L [−0.37 to −0.74 mg/dL] per 1°C). A similar effect was observed among 19 patients who had repeat measurements of serum phosphorus and temperature. In a multiple linear regression analysis, the relation between temperature and serum phosphorus level was independent of blood pH, PCO2, and serum levels of potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, albumin, and glucose. Our study demonstrates a strong inverse linear relation between body temperature and serum phosphorus level that was not explained by other factors known to cause hypophosphatemia. If causal, this association can account for the high prevalence of hypophosphatemia, observed in our patients and in previous studies of patients with malaria. Because hypophosphatemia has been observed in other clinical conditions characterized by fever or hyperthermia, this relation may not be unique to malaria. Elevation of body temperature should be added to the list of causes of hypophosphatemia."
