https://openalex.org/W1996761102,"The identification of synaptic partners is challenging in dense nerve bundles, where many processes occupy regions beneath the resolution of conventional light microscopy. To address this difficulty, we have developed GRASP, a system to label membrane contacts and synapses between two cells in living animals. Two complementary fragments of GFP are expressed on different cells, tethered to extracellular domains of transmembrane carrier proteins. When the complementary GFP fragments are fused to ubiquitous transmembrane proteins, GFP fluorescence appears uniformly along membrane contacts between the two cells. When one or both GFP fragments are fused to synaptic transmembrane proteins, GFP fluorescence is tightly localized to synapses. GRASP marks known synaptic contacts in C. elegans, correctly identifies changes in mutants with altered synaptic specificity, and can uncover new information about synaptic locations as confirmed by electron microscopy. GRASP may prove particularly useful for defining connectivity in complex nervous systems.

GRASP may prove particularly useful for defining connectivity in complex nervous systems. After axons have been guided to their targets by long-range and short-range cues, they choose a subset of the available cells as synaptic partners. This process involves identification of appropriate partners, avoidance of incorrect partners, and selection of subcellular regions for synapse formation (Shen, 2004Shen K. Molecular mechanisms of target specificity during synapse formation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Current knowledge of synaptic connectivity has been obtained largely by powerful but labor-intensive methods: electrophysiology of coupled cells or electron microscopy and ultrastructural identification of connected cell types (White et al., 1986White J.G.

Towards neural circuit reconstruction with volume electron microscopy techniques.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Because of the skill and time required for these experiments, the overall connectivity of most nervous systems remains a mystery. A near-complete ultrastructural analysis has been performed only on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where reconstructions of serial-section electron micrographs defined the ∼7000 synapses in the entire nervous system in a project spanning two decades (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the next best-understood circuit described by physiology and anatomy is the vertebrate retina, where ∼50 cell types are interconnected in complex patterns that are still not fully mapped (Wassle and Boycott, 1991Wassle H. Boycott B.B. Functional architecture of the mammalian retina.Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 447-480PubMed Google Scholar, Vaney and Taylor, 2002Vaney D.I. Taylor W.R. Direction selectivity in the retina.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A faster method for analyzing synaptic circuitry would be a great asset for establishing synaptic maps—the anatomical framework for nervous system function. In recent years, the analysis of synaptic specificity has been accelerated by the use of light microscopy and synaptic labels (Ahmari and Smith, 2002Ahmari S.E. Smith S.J. Knowing a nascent synapse when you see it.Neuron. 2002; 34: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A synapse is a stable cell junction with vesicles and active zone proteins localized to the presynaptic site, receptors and a scaffolding matrix localized to the postsynaptic site, and adhesion proteins such as cadherins that can bridge both cells. Double labeling with antibodies to presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins can define their sites of colocalization at synapses (Ahmari and Smith, 2002Ahmari S.E. Smith S.J. Knowing a nascent synapse when you see it.Neuron. 2002; 34: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Genetically encoded fluorescent synaptic proteins such as VAMP::GFP can improve resolution by labeling synaptic structures in a subset of cells or a single cell type (Nonet, 1999Nonet M.L. Visualization of synaptic specializations in live C. elegans with synaptic vesicle protein-GFP fusions.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 89: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, these approaches lose resolution in locations like the mammalian cortex that contain 100,000 synapses or more per cubic millimeter (Binzegger et al., 2004Binzegger T. Douglas R.J. Martin K.A. A quantitative map of the circuit of cat primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8441-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), a density at which the nearest neighbor of a synaptic marker is ambiguous. Thus, in regions where many synapses coexist in a small area, light microscopy fails to provide the resolution needed to identify exact synaptic partners. Other markers that cross synapses, such as lectins or rabies and pseudorabies viruses, are useful for long-range pathway mapping, but some trans-cellular tracers are toxic, many have some degree of cell-type specificity, and most cross to multiple cells in a region, not just synaptic partners (Schwab and Thoenen, 1976Schwab M.E.

Here we describe GRASP, a generalizable method to label a synapse based on the proximity of the presynaptic and the postsynaptic plasma membranes. In CNS synapses, the membranes of two synaptic partners are typically separated by less than 100 nm of extracellular space, a distance that can be spanned by transmembrane proteins expressed by the two cells. We detect proximity by the stable, extracellular assembly of the green fluorescent protein from two complementary fragments expressed on different cells, in the context of transmembrane protein carriers that are either broadly distributed on the plasma membrane or narrowly localized to synaptic regions. Using these different carriers, GRASP can be used to assess nearest neighbors across the cell membrane or the nearest neighbor at a synapse. We confirm the effectiveness of GRASP in vivo using the defined connectivity of the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system as a guide and demonstrate that GRASP can identify synaptic defects in mutants as well as previously uncharacterized details of synaptic locations. To label synapses, or more generally to label adjacent cells, we used complementary fragments of GFP tethered to plasma membrane carrier proteins to detect the proximity of two cell membranes (Figure 1A). The individually nonfluorescent split-GFP fragments assemble into a fluorescent form only when the membranes are sufficiently close to permit carrier proteins to bridge the intercellular gap. This approach is conceptually similar to split-GFP methods for determining intracellular protein-protein interactions in living cells (Ghosh et al., 2000Ghosh I. Hamilton A.D. Regan L.

Combinatorial marking of cells and organelles with reconstituted fluorescent proteins.Cell. 2004; 119: 137-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but modifications were necessary for extracellular GFP assembly. Most split-GFP proteins used for intracellular assembly require exogenous dimerization domains to fold, and indeed, that is the basis of their usefulness as protein interaction monitors (Ghosh et al., 2000Ghosh I. Hamilton A.D. Regan L. Antiparallel leucine zipper-directed protein reassembly: application to the green fluorescent protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5658-5659Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2004Zhang S. Ma C. Chalfie M. Combinatorial marking of cells and organelles with reconstituted fluorescent proteins.Cell. 2004; 119: 137-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In membrane proteins, however, unfolded protein domains activate quality-control pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore destabilize the protein before it reaches the cell surface. A split-GFP system that addresses this concern has been developed and applied in cells and cell lysates (Cabantous et al., 2005Cabantous S. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Protein tagging and detection with engineered self-assembling fragments of green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). One fragment of the split GFP contains the first 214 residues of the exceptionally stable, fast-folding “superfolder” GFP protein (Pedelacq et al., 2006Pedelacq J.D. Cabantous S. Tran T. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Engineering and characterization of a superfolder green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), further evolved to be stable as a protein fragment. This fragment includes ten of the eleven strands of the beta-barrel structure of GFP and will be called spGFP1-10. The second split-GFP fragment consists of just 16 residues, 215–230, which make up the 11th strand of the GFP β-barrel. This second fragment, spGFP11, acts as a small protein tag that can be inserted into many different proteins without affecting their solubility (Cabantous et al., 2005Cabantous S. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Protein tagging and detection with engineered self-assembling fragments of green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Thus, each of these fragments should be soluble, nonfluorescent, and relatively inert in the absence of its complementary fragment. Moreover, superfolder GFP crystallizes as a monomer, suggesting that it should not serve as a nucleation site for further protein aggregation (Pedelacq et al., 2006Pedelacq J.D. Cabantous S. Tran T. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Engineering and characterization of a superfolder green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). For GRASP to act as a transmembrane proximity detector, both fragments should be tethered to the plasma membranes of the test cells. As a potentially inert tether protein, we began with the human T cell protein CD4, a structurally characterized protein whose natural extracellular ligand, the MHC class II protein, is not present in C. elegans. To minimize intracellular interactions, cytosolic domains of CD4 that interact with signaling molecules were deleted, leaving a seven amino acid cytosolic tail; the extracellular domain was also truncated to include only one or two of its four immunoglobulin domains. spGFP1-10 and spGFP11 were separately inserted into extracellular loop regions defined by the crystal structure of CD4 (Ryu et al., 1990Ryu S.E. Kwong P.D. Truneh A. Porter T.G. Arthos J. Rosenberg M. Dai X. Xuong N.H. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Hendrickson W.A. Crystal structure of an HIV-binding recombinant fragment of human CD4.Nature. 1990; 348: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), with GFP11 followed by a glycine-serine linker (Figure 1A). Neither of these CD4::spGFP fragments resulted in detectable GFP fluorescence when individually expressed in C. elegans neurons or muscle (Figure 1 and data not shown). As a stringent test for the extracellular assembly of the tethered split-GFP proteins, cultured cells expressing complementary CD4::spGFP fragments were mixed in vitro. Two different transgenic C. elegans strains were generated; one strain expressed CD4::spGFP1-10 and a nuclear CFP protein under the muscle-specific myo-3 promoter, and the second strain expressed CD4::spGFP11 and a soluble mCherry protein under the myo-3 promoter. Primary myocytes and neurons from both strains were isolated after dissociation of embryos, mixed together, and cultivated overnight (Christensen et al., 2002Christensen M. Estevez A. Yin X. Fox R. Morrison R. McDonnell M. Gleason C. Miller 3rd, D.M. Strange K. A primary culture system for functional analysis of C. elegans neurons and muscle cells.Neuron. 2002; 33: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). GFP fluorescence was undetectable in myocytes from either transgenic strain, although the mCherry and nuclear CFP were readily detectable, but strong GFP fluorescence was observed at the interface of myocytes that expressed mCherry and myocytes that expressed nuclear CFP (Figures 1B–1G). This experiment established that the CD4-tethered spGFP fragments were able to associate, fold, and fluoresce in the extracellular space. To determine whether tethered CD4::spGFP molecules could assemble at extracellular sites in vivo, complementing fragments were expressed in nonoverlapping but adjacent sets of body wall muscle cells. In these in vivo GRASP experiments, the two spGFP fragments were individually injected into different strains, along with mCherry or nuclear CFP markers for the cells of interest, and the single strains were examined to ensure that they did not produce detectable GFP fluorescence. The transgenic strains were then crossed together to generate strains bearing both spGFP transgenes, which were examined for GFP fluorescence. This double-transgenic approach was used because the DNA fragments in a single transgenic array sometimes recombine with each other (Mello and Fire, 1995Mello C. Fire A. DNA transformation.Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), and recombination or interactions between promoters in a single transgenic array had the potential to generate spurious GFP fluorescence. C. elegans body wall muscle is arranged in four quadrants, with each quadrant consisting of two interdigitated rows of medial and lateral myocytes. The him-4 promoter is expressed only in lateral myocytes, while the ace-4 promoter is expressed only in dorsal medial myocytes (Combes et al., 2003Combes D. Fedon Y. Toutant J.P. Arpagaus M. Multiple ace genes encoding acetylcholinesterases of Caenorhabditis elegans have distinct tissue expression.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 497-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001Vogel B.E. Hedgecock E.M. Hemicentin, a conserved extracellular member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, organizes epithelial and other cell attachments into oriented line-shaped junctions.Development. 2001; 128: 883-894PubMed Google Scholar). Differential expression of CD4::spGFP fragments from the him-4 or ace-4 promoters would be predicted to allow GFP assembly only in the dorsal quadrants, at the contacts between the lateral and medial muscle cells. Indeed, in animals expressing both ace-4::CD4::spGFP1-10 and him-4::CD4::spGFP11, GFP fluorescence appeared at the junctions of dorsal medial and lateral muscle cells (Figures 1H–1L). As observed in culture, the GRASP GFP signal in vivo was restricted to sites of cell contact, suggesting that the membrane tethers were intact. The ace-4 promoter is strongly expressed in L1 larvae and downregulated in adults (Combes et al., 2003Combes D. Fedon Y. Toutant J.P. Arpagaus M. Multiple ace genes encoding acetylcholinesterases of Caenorhabditis elegans have distinct tissue expression.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 497-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The muscle cell GRASP GFP signal followed a similar time course, with a strong larval signal that disappeared in adult animals. Although GFP assembly is thought to be irreversible once it occurs (Kerppola, 2006Kerppola T.K. Visualization of molecular interactions by fluorescence complementation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), this observation suggests that the normal turnover of the CD4 tether protein can disrupt the refolded GFP or release it from cells. Weak GFP signals were sometimes observed in internal vesicles, suggesting the internalization of the refolded proteins. To generate markers for synapses, at least one of the two spGFP tether proteins should be localized to synaptic regions. The best-characterized presynaptic transmembrane protein in C. elegans is PTP-3A, a member of the LAR/receptor tyrosine phosphatase family with extracellular Ig repeats and fibronectin type III repeats (Ackley et al., 2005Ackley B.D. Harrington R.J. Hudson M.L. Williams L. Kenyon C.J. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7517-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PTP-3A and related proteins affect synaptic development and morphology in C. elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates (Ackley et al., 2005Ackley B.D. Harrington R.J. Hudson M.L. Williams L. Kenyon C.J. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y.

Drosophila liprin-alpha and the receptor phosphatase Dlar control synapse morphogenesis.Neuron. 2002; 34: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). C. elegans PTP-3A is expressed in many neuronal cell types and in motor neurons is tightly localized to presynaptic active zones through interactions with the extracellular matrix component nidogen and the active zone protein SYD-2/liprin-α (Ackley et al., 2005Ackley B.D. Harrington R.J. Hudson M.L. Williams L. Kenyon C.J. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7517-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PTP-3A::spGFP was generated by inserting the small spGFP11 tag immediately after an artificial signal peptide followed by full-length PTP-3A (Figure 1A). In GRASP experiments, PTP-3A in presynaptic neurons was paired with the delocalized CD4::spGFP1-10 tether on postsynaptic partners. Another potential way to visualize specific synapses between two neurons is to target both GRASP carriers to pre- and postsynaptic sites. To construct such a marker, we searched for transmembrane molecules that are targeted to synapses. In the vertebrate central nervous system, neuroligins are preferentially localized to postsynaptic sites, where they interact with presynaptic neurexins to affect synaptic maturation and function (Craig and Kang, 2007Craig A.M. Kang Y. Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, Varoqueaux et al., 2006Varoqueaux F. Aramuni G.

Neuroligins determine synapse maturation and function.Neuron. 2006; 51: 741-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). C. elegans has a single neuroligin homolog, C40C9.5 (nlg-1), that is widely expressed in the nervous systems (www.wormbase.org). A full-length NLG-1 cDNA was tagged with intact YFP and expressed in different neuronal cell types. Consistent with vertebrate findings, bright punctate staining was observed in dendritic (postsynaptic) regions (Figure 2 and data not shown). Surprisingly, clear punctate staining was also observed in presynaptic regions of each neuronal type. For example, in the DA9 motor neuron, bright NLG-1::YFP puncta were present in the ventral postsynaptic domain, and dimmer puncta were present in the dorsal presynaptic region (Figures 2A and 2B). Puncta were excluded from the synapse-poor region between the cell body and dorsal presynaptic region and from the anterior asynaptic region of the dorsal process. To further study the punctate staining in the presynaptic region, NLG-1::YFP localization was examined in animals expressing the tagged synaptic vesicle protein mCherry::RAB-3 in DA9. In the dorsal axon, NLG-1::YFP puncta partially colocalized with puncta containing mCherry::RAB-3, suggesting that NLG-1::YFP localization is perisynaptic (Figures 2C–2E). Like DA9, AVE interneurons and VA motor neurons have distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic regions. AVE interneurons have a dense postsynaptic region in the nerve ring and a sparse presynaptic region in the ventral nerve cord. VA motor neurons have cell bodies in the ventral nerve cord and extend short dendrites posteriorly and longer axons anteriorly. NLG-1::YFP was present in both presynaptic and postsynaptic regions of each of these neuronal classes, but absent from asynaptic zones of the processes (Figures 2F–2I). NLG-1 thus has the potential to label all synapses made by a single cell, both at presynaptic and at postsynaptic sites. The activities of three different GRASP pairs—CD4:CD4, PTP-3A:CD4, and NLG-1:NLG-1—were compared in a common set of synaptic partners. The AVA command neurons of C. elegans form synapses and gap junctions with VA and DA motor neurons along the entire length of the ventral nerve cord (Figures 3A–3C) (White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the ventral nerve cord of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One member of a GRASP pair was expressed in AVA neurons under either the rig-3 promoter or the flp-18 promoter, which are unique to AVA neurons in the ventral nerve cord (www.wormbase.org), and the other GRASP partner was expressed in VA and DA neurons using the unc-4 promoter, which is limited to VA, DA, and VC motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord (Lickteig et al., 2001Lickteig K.M. Duerr J.S. Frisby D.L. Hall D.H. Rand J.B. Miller 3rd, D.M. Regulation of neurotransmitter vesicles by the homeodomain protein UNC-4 and its transcriptional corepressor UNC-37/groucho in Caenorhabditis elegans cholinergic motor neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When AVA or VA/DA neurons were labeled with the complementary CD4:CD4 GRASP pair, GFP fluorescence was observed along the entire ventral nerve cord (Figures 3D–3F). Labeling appeared uniform along most of the ventral cord, suggesting that the signal resulted from general proximity of axons and not from synapses or gap junctions, which should appear more punctate. No GFP fluorescence was detected with the individual AVA or VA/DA spGFP transgenes (data not shown). When the PTP-3A:CD4 GRASP pair or the NLG-1:NLG-1 GRASP pair were used to label AVA and VA/DA neurons, discrete puncta of GFP fluorescence were visible along the mCherry-labeled VA/DA axons, in contrast with the uniform fluorescence seen with CD4:CD4 GRASP (Figures 3G–3L). The GRASP signals appeared as clusters of ∼10 puncta separated by gaps, as expected if a single cluster represents AVA connections with one motor neuron (White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the ventral nerve cord of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thus, synaptic localization of either one or both spGFP carriers can localize the reconstituted GFP signal to specialized membrane domains. To confirm that GRASP signals were at synapses, and to distinguish between the chemical synapses and the gap junctions made between AVA and VA/DA neurons, a labeled RAB-3 synaptic vesicle protein was expressed in AVA neurons together with the NLG-1 GRASP partner. Most NLG-1 GRASP signals colocalized with RAB-3::mCherry puncta, suggesting that the GRASP signal corresponds to chemical synapses and not gap junctions (Figures 3M–3O). However, some AVA RAB-3::mCherry puncta were not associated with NLG-1 GRASP signals, consistent with the fact that AVA makes synapses onto other neurons in the ventral nerve cord that do not express unc-4. AVA-to-VA synapses have been the subject of extensive genetic studies. A paired-type homeodomain protein, UNC-4, and a Groucho corepressor, UNC-37, are required in VA2-VA10 neurons to specify the correct pattern of presynaptic input from AVA neurons (White et al., 1992White J.G.

The Groucho-like transcription factor UNC-37 functions with the neural specificity gene unc-4 to govern motor neuron identity in C. elegans.Development. 1997; 124: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other properties of VA neurons, including their morphologies, ability to express unc-4, axon guidance, and fasciculation are not affected by unc-4 and unc-37 mutations, nor are synapses from AVA onto the DA neurons affected. In the posterior C. elegans nerve cord, a cluster of synapses from AVA to VA10 is localized between the VA10 cell body and the DA7 cell body (Figures 4A–4C) (White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the ventral nerve cord of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (E. Chen, D. Hall, and D. Chklovskii, personal communication). The majority of synapses between AVA and unc-4-expressing neurons in this small region should be from AVA onto VA10 neurons. A small cluster of NLG-1 GRASP GFP signals was reliably present between VA10 and DA7 in wild-type animals, but was systematically lost in unc-4 and unc-37 mutants, consistent with the loss of AVA-to-VA synapses (Figures 4C–4G). A nearby cluster of GFP puncta behind the VA11 cell body was intact in mutants, as expected based on EM data showing that the unc-4 mutation spares synapses between AVA and VA11 neurons (Figures 4C–4G). These results indicate that GRASP labeling can be used to visualize differences in synaptic connectivity in the ventral nerve cord of wild-type and mutant animals. A different set of genetically characterized synapses, those associated with the egg-laying motor neuron HSN, was analyzed using PTP-3A:CD4 GRASP. HSN forms synapses onto vulval muscles and VC4 and VC5 neurons in the middle of the body near the vulval opening (Figure 5A) (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine HSN synapses onto muscles, the tph-1 promoter was used to express PTP-3A::spGFP11 in HSN, and the myo-3 promoter was used to express CD4::spGFP1-10 in vulval muscles and body wall muscles. Discrete GFP puncta were observed on HSN branches near the vulva, where HSNs synapse onto vulval muscles (Figures 5B–5E). Although body wall muscles lie near HSN in the ventral nerve cord, HSN does not synapse onto them, and no GFP signals were observed there (Figures 5B–5E). The synaptic specificity of HSN is disrupted by mutations in the genes syg-1 and syg-2, which encode transmembrane proteins that are expressed in HSN and in guidepost cells that localize HSN synapse formation, respectively (Shen and Bargmann, 2003Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

Fetter R.D. Bargmann C.I. Synaptic specificity is generated by the synaptic guidepost protein SYG-2 and its receptor, SYG-1.Cell. 2004; 116: 869-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In syg-1 and syg-2 mutants there is a partial loss of HSN synapses near the vulva and the ectopic appearance of anterior synapses onto body wall muscle. Both missing and ectopic synapses were reflected in the pattern of fluorescence using PTP-3A:CD4 GRASP in syg-1 and syg-2 mutants (Figures 5F–5I and data not shown). Quantification of signal intensity demonstrated a 6-fold increase in anterior GRASP fluorescence and a 4-fold decrease in vulval GRASP fluorescence in the syg-1 strain compared to wild-type (Figures 5J and 5K). These results suggest that GRASP accurately recapitulates the underlying synaptic connectivity in wild-type and mutant HSN neurons. HSN synapses onto VC neurons were visualized by pairing the presynaptic PTP-3A partner in HSN with unc-4::CD4::spGFP1-10, which labels VC, VA, and DA neurons. VC axons defasciculate dorsally from the ventral nerve cord near the vulva, so unc-4 signals in this loop are exclusively from VC and not from VA or DA (Figure 5A). As expected from HSN connectivity, GRASP GFP fluorescence was observed only in this loop near the vulva, although HSN runs near many unc-4-expressing neurons in the ventral nerve cord. To our surprise, the GRASP pattern was different from that observed with the vulval muscle myo-3::CD4::spGFP1-10 transgene (Figures 6A–6F). Whereas HSN-to-vulval-muscle fluorescence was strongest at the two branch points or branches of the HSN axon that flank the vulval opening, HSN-to-VC fluorescence was concentrated in the central axon region between the branches. Previous electron microscopic studies of wild-type HSN synapses were consistent with muscle synapses flanking central VC synapses, but only one animal had been reported and the effect was not absolute (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined 2000 serial-section electron micrographs of a second wild-type HSN, scoring the location of 20 synapses onto vulval muscles and VC neurons separately (Figure 6G). This analysis confirmed that HSN-to-VC synapses are centrally located around the vulva and are flanked by HSN-to-vulval muscle synapses. This unexpected detail of HSN connectivity offers a glimpse of the potential of GRASP. Previous experiments in which HSN synapses were labeled with the synaptic vesicle protein SNB-1::GFP were sufficient to show the aberrant anterior synapses and, to a lesser extent, the loss of vulval synapses in syg-1 and syg-2 mutants (Shen and Bargmann, 2003Shen K.

Synaptic specificity is generated by the synaptic guidepost protein SYG-2 and its receptor, SYG-1.Cell. 2004; 116: 869-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was needed to detect the change in postsynaptic partners in syg-1 and syg-2 mutants, but by using GRASP it was possible to infer the change in partner choice by light microscopy. In addition, the fine structure of wild-type HSN synapse localization onto vulval muscles and VCs had been overlooked, but was revealed by GRASP. To confirm that GRASP could differentially label distinct subsets of synapses made on one process, two classes of AIY interneuron synapses were labeled with NLG-1 GRASP. In the nerve ring, the AIY interneuron sends synapses to the RIA interneuron in a small ventral region of its axon and receives synapses from the AFD sensory neuron in the dorsal part of its axon (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine these synapses, NLG-1::spGFP1-10 was expressed in AIY neurons using the ttx-3 promoter, and NLG-1::spGFP11 was expressed either in the RIA neuron using the glr-3 promoter or in the AFD neuron using the gcy-8 promoter (Figures 6H–6K). NLG-1 GRASP exclusively labeled the regions where synapses were expected based on EM reconstruction of AIY (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NLG-1 GRASP between AIY and RIA labeled only the ventral region of the AIY axon, whereas NLG-1 GRASP between AIY and AFD labeled only the dorsal region. The localized GRASP signal between AIY and RIA is distinct from the signal with a generic presynaptic marker for AIY; GFP::RAB-3 labels all AIY synapses, and therefore forms puncta along the entire AIY process (Colon-Ramos et al., 2007Colon-Ramos D.A. Margeta M.A. Shen K. Glia promote local synaptogenesis through UNC-6 (netrin) signaling in C. elegans.Science. 2007; 318: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). GRASP has the potential to greatly increase the ease of synaptic mapping. In these studies, we used a genetically accessible system with a well-defined synaptic map to establish the feasibility and accuracy of the method, but the greatest possibilities lie in more complex systems. Drosophila is the most straightforward system for extending this approach, because many promoter elements and GAL4 lines are available to direct GFP fragments to known cell types (Armstrong et al., 1995Armstrong J.D. Kaiser K. Müller A. Fischbach K.F. Merchant N. Strausfeld N.J. Flybrain, an on-line atlas and database of the Drosophila nervous system.Neuron. 1995; 15: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Drosophila also provides one of the greatest opportunities for anatomical discovery, because the anatomy of the major brain centers is highly complex, with many branched processes packed into small regions, and CNS connectivity is virtually unknown. The application of this system to the optically transparent zebrafish should also be straightforward."
https://openalex.org/W2092533548,"A neuroanatomical principle of striatal organization has been established through which ventral domains, including the nucleus accumbens, exert control over dorsal striatal processes mediated by so-called “spiraling,” striato-nigro-striatal, circuitry. We have investigated the functional significance of this circuitry in the control over a cocaine-seeking habit by using an intrastriatal disconnection procedure that combined a selective, unilateral lesion of the nucleus accumbens core and infusion of a dopamine receptor antagonist into the contralateral dorsolateral striatum, thereby disrupting striato-midbrain-striatal serial connectivity bilaterally. We show that this disconnection selectively decreased drug-seeking behavior in rats extensively trained under a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. These data thereby define the importance of interactions between ventral and dorsal domains of the striatum, mediated by dopaminergic transmission, in the neural mechanisms underlying the development and performance of cocaine-seeking habits that are a key characteristic of drug addiction."

In the developing brain, Satb2 is expressed in cortical neurons that extend axons across the corpus callosum.

In mutant mice, β-galactosidase-labeled axons are absent from the corpus callosum and instead descend along the corticospinal tract. Satb2 mutant neurons acquire expression of Ctip2, a transcription factor that is necessary and sufficient for the extension of subcortical projections by cortical neurons. Conversely, ectopic expression of Satb2 in neural stem cells markedly decreases Ctip2 expression. Finally, we find that Satb2 binds directly to regulatory regions of Ctip2 and induces changes in chromatin structure.

These data suggest that Satb2 functions as a repressor of Ctip2 and regulatory determinant of corticocortical connections in the developing cerebral cortex. Projection neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex comprise two broad classes: those that extend axons within the cortex, including those that cross the corpus callosum to the contralateral hemisphere; and those that form connections with subcortical targets, including the thalamus, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord (McConnell, 1995McConnell S.K. Constructing the cerebral cortex: neurogenesis and fate determination.Neuron. 1995; 15: 761-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). While the latter neurons are located primarily in cortical layers 5 and 6, neurons with cortical and callosal projections are found in all layers but are particularly abundant in layers 2 through 4. During development, neurons in different layers are generated in an orderly inside-first, outside-last procession, and newly postmitotic neurons are specified to adopt the laminar positions characteristic of their birthdays (McConnell, 1995McConnell S.K. Constructing the cerebral cortex: neurogenesis and fate determination.Neuron. 1995; 15: 761-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Neurons with different projection phenotypes can be generated at the same time. For example, layer 5 neurons that form callosal versus subcortical projections migrate and differentiate side-by-side, but their axon trajectories diverge immediately, extending toward the midline and internal capsule, respectively (Koester and O'Leary, 1993Koester S.E.

Brain Res. 1994; 102: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Two genes required for the development of layer 5 subcortical projection neurons are Fezf2 and Ctip2, which encode zinc-finger transcription factors. Both are expressed by developing layer 5 and 6 neurons and show prominent expression in corticospinal motor neurons (CSMNs). In Fezf2 mutant mice, deep-layer neurons are generated and migrate into appropriate positions but fail to express Ctip2 (Chen et al., 2005aChen B. Schaevitz L.R. McConnell S.K.

Chen and S.K.M., unpublished data). These data suggest that Fezf2 and Ctip2 function in a common pathway that is necessary and sufficient for the specification of subcortical projection neurons in cortical layer 5. Despite the progress above, little is understood about how corticocortical (ipsilateral and callosal) projection neurons are specified. One potential regulatory determinant of this cell type is the DNA-binding protein Satb2, which is expressed in a subset of neurons in layers 2 through 5 during differentiation (Britanova et al., 2005Britanova O.

Satb2 functions in B cell differentiation by binding to MAR sequences in and augmenting expression of the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain locus (Dobreva et al., 2003Dobreva G. Dambacher J. Grosschedl R. SUMO modification of a novel MAR-binding protein, SATB2, modulates immunoglobulin mu gene expression.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3048-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Satb2 also regulates osteoblast differentiation and function by repressing Hoxa2 and activating osteoblast-specific gene expression via enhancement of two key determinants of osteoblast differentiation, Runx2 and ATF4 (Dobreva et al., 2006Dobreva G. Chahrour M. Dautzenberg M. Chirivella L. Kanzler B. Farinas I. Karsenty G. Grosschedl R. SATB2 is a multifunctional determinant of craniofacial patterning and osteoblast differentiation.Cell. 2006; 125: 971-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Satb2 in cortical development, we analyzed Satb2-deficient mice in which the bacterial β-galactosidase (LacZ) gene was inserted in-frame with the first ATG codon of Satb2 (Dobreva et al., 2006Dobreva G. Chahrour M. Dautzenberg M. Chirivella L. Kanzler B. Farinas I. Karsenty G. Grosschedl R. SATB2 is a multifunctional determinant of craniofacial patterning and osteoblast differentiation.Cell. 2006; 125: 971-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We find that the axons of Satb2-expressing cortical neurons in heterozygous mice are labeled by β-galactosidase and extend across the corpus callosum. In Satb2 mutants, β-galactosidase+ axons are absent from the corpus callosum and instead descend through the internal capsule and along the corticospinal tract, suggesting that Satb2-deficient callosal neurons adopt a subcortical projection neuron fate. Satb2 mutant neurons acquire expression of Ctip2, which is necessary and sufficient for the elaboration of subcortical axon projections (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D.

Chen and S.K.M., unpublished data). Our data show that Satb2 binds directly to regulatory regions of Ctip2 and represses Ctip2 expression, suggesting that Satb2 functions in normal cortical development to repress Ctip2 and enable the formation of corticocortical connections. Within the telencephalon, Satb2-expressing cells are restricted to the developing cerebral cortex. Consistent with previous reports (Britanova et al., 2005Britanova O. Akopov S. Lukyanov S. Gruss P. Tarabykin V. Novel transcription factor Satb2 interacts with matrix attachment region DNA elements in a tissue-specific manner and demonstrates cell-type-dependent expression in the developing mouse CNS.Eur. J.

Res. 2006; 31: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Satb2-immunoreactive cells were first detected in lateral regions of the cortical plate (CP) at E13.5 (see Figure S1A available online). Both the number of Satb2+ cells and the intensity of staining increased over time, with many immunoreactive cells observed in the CP by E18.5 (Figures S1B–S1E). The number of Satb2+ cells was dramatically reduced by P7 (Figure S1F), when cortical neurons have finished migrating and are refining their axonal projections. To further characterize the subpopulation of Satb2+ cells, E18.5 brains were immunostained for Satb2 and a panel of layer-specific markers. Most Satb2+ cells resided in layers 2 through 4 of the CP, a domain that also expressed the homeodomain protein Cux2 (Figure 1A). The majority of Cux2+ cells coexpressed Satb2, although many Satb2+ cells (particularly those in deeper layers) were Cux2−. A smaller number of Satb2+ cells were present in layer 5 and even fewer in layer 6, layers that are defined by an immunoreactivity for Ctip2 and Tbr1, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C). Little coexpression was observed between Satb2 and these deep-layer markers, with <5% of Satb2+ cells expressing Ctip2 (Figure 1B). Colocalization of Satb2 and the neuron-specific marker MAP2 demonstrated that Satb2+ cortical cells are postmitotic neurons (Figure 1E, insert). No Satb2+ cells were detected in zones of active proliferation, including the Tbr2+ subventricular zone (SVZ; Figure 1D) and the subjacent ventricular zone (VZ). Weak Satb2 immunoreactivity was detected in the intermediate zone (IZ) (Figure 1). These data suggest that Satb2 is not expressed by cortical neurons prior to migration. Satb2-expressing neurons can be detected in Satb2+/lacZ mice (Dobreva et al., 2006Dobreva G. Chahrour M. Dautzenberg M. Chirivella L. Kanzler B. Farinas I. Karsenty G. Grosschedl R. SATB2 is a multifunctional determinant of craniofacial patterning and osteoblast differentiation.Cell. 2006; 125: 971-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) by the presence of β-galactosidase, which is strongly expressed in the CP at E18.5. Immunostaining for Satb2 and β-galactosidase revealed that these proteins are present in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, of the same cells, confirming that LacZ expression recapitulates that of Satb2 (Figure 1E). β-galactosidase immunoreactivity was most prominent in the superficial CP (layer 2/3), in which most cell bodies were labeled, and less prominent in the deep layers, similar to Satb2 staining. In addition, it appeared that β-galactosidase was transported into axons, since the IZ (deep band in Figure 1E), where cortical efferent axons are located, was also labeled. The transport of β-galactosidase into axons in Satb2+/lacZ mice enabled us to trace the projections of Satb2-expressing neurons. Both X-gal staining and immunohistochemistry at E18.5 revealed β-galactosidase+ axons crossing the corpus callosum (Figure 3E and Figure S2). No labeling was observed in the internal or external capsules (Figures 3E–3H), where axons exit the cortex toward subcortical targets, suggesting that Satb2+ neurons form callosal connections. A few labeled axons were visible in the striatum (Figure S2), where some callosal projection neurons form axon collaterals (Wilson, 1987Wilson C.J. Morphology and synaptic connections of crossed corticostriatal neurons in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1987; 263: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Most of the labeled callosal axons were likely derived from deep-layer Satb2+ neurons, since layer 5 cells are the earliest in the CP to extend callosal axons (Ozaki and Wahlsten, 1998Ozaki H.S. Wahlsten D. Timing and origin of the first cortical axons to project through the corpus callosum and the subsequent emergence of callosal projection cells in mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 400: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, some labeled axons may belong to migrating layer 2/3 neurons, which extend axons to the contralateral cortex by E19 in mouse (Auladell et al., 1995Auladell C. Martinez A. Alcantara S. Super H. Soriano E. Migrating neurons in the developing cerebral cortex of the mouse send callosal axons.Neuroscience. 1995; 64: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that Satb2-expressing cortical neurons extend axons to the contralateral cortex. We do not know whether Satb2+ neurons also form ipsilateral corticocortical projections, but this is likely in light of previous findings that many callosal neurons also form local axon branches (Veinante and Deschenes, 2003Veinante P.

Because Satb2 null mice die at birth (Dobreva et al., 2006Dobreva G. Chahrour M. Dautzenberg M. Chirivella L. Kanzler B. Farinas I. Karsenty G. Grosschedl R. SATB2 is a multifunctional determinant of craniofacial patterning and osteoblast differentiation.Cell. 2006; 125: 971-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), tissue was collected from wild-type, Satb2+/−, and Satb2−/− embryos at E18.5. Cresyl violet staining revealed that the Satb2-deficient cortex was organized normally, with a clearly defined VZ, SVZ, IZ, and CP (Figures 2A and 2B). However, mutants exhibited small but significant reductions in cortical thickness at E18.5, with decreases of ∼15% in CP thickness and up to 20% in the width of the IZ (Figure S3). Cell density in the CP and IZ did not differ significantly between genotypes (Satb2+/+ CP, 11,500 ± 500 cells/mm2; IZ, 11,500 ± 500 cells/mm2; n = 3. Satb2−/− CP, 11,500 ± 645; IZ, 11,750 ± 946 cells/mm2; n = 4). These data suggest that the mutant cortices had an overall reduction of ∼15% in the total number of cells compared to wild-type controls. Although the lateral ventricles of Satb2 mutants were somewhat enlarged (cf. Figure 3), we saw no significant difference in the thickness of the proliferative zones (Figure S3).Figure 3Satb2-Expressing Neurons that Normally Project across the Corpus Callosum Extend Axons into Subcortical Regions in the Absence of Satb2Show full caption(A–D) Coronal sections through the brains of wild-type and Satb2 null embryos at E18.5.(A and B) Wild-type brain, highlighting the normal positions of the corpus callosum (arrowheads) and anterior (arrows) and hippocampal (asterisks) commissures.(C and D) Cresyl violet staining of Satb2 mutant brains reveals a severely reduced corpus callosum (arrowhead), whereas the anterior (arrow) and hippocampal (asterisk) commissures are intact.

The decreased thickness of the CP could result from altered proliferation, survival, and/or migration. A direct role of Satb2 in cell proliferation seems unlikely, since Satb2 is not obviously expressed in cortical proliferative zones (Britanova et al., 2005Britanova O. Akopov S. Lukyanov S. Gruss P. Tarabykin V. Novel transcription factor Satb2 interacts with matrix attachment region DNA elements in a tissue-specific manner and demonstrates cell-type-dependent expression in the developing mouse CNS.Eur. J.

Res. 2006; 31: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (see Figure 1). Furthermore, we observed no differences in the number of pyknotic nuclei between wild-type and mutants (data not shown), suggesting that the thinner CP is not due to increased cell death. To assess migration, proliferating cells were labeled with BrdU at E11.5, E13.5, or E15.5, and positions of labeled progeny were assessed on E18.5. Because the mutant cortex was slightly thinner than in controls, we divided the dorsal CP into upper, middle, and lower thirds (Figures 2C and 2D) and counted BrdU+ cells within each subdomain and in the IZ and VZ/SVZ. As expected, since few neurons express Satb2 at E11.5 (Britanova et al., 2005Britanova O. Akopov S. Lukyanov S. Gruss P. Tarabykin V. Novel transcription factor Satb2 interacts with matrix attachment region DNA elements in a tissue-specific manner and demonstrates cell-type-dependent expression in the developing mouse CNS.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 658-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), no differences were observed at E11.5; in both mutant versus wild-type brains, most BrdU+ cells were in the deep CP (Figure 2E). In contrast, cells labeled at E13.5 migrated differently in wild-type versus Satb2−/− embryos, with significantly fewer BrdU+ cells in the upper CP of Satb2−/− brains and a commensurate increase in cells occupying the IZ (Figure 2E). Cells born at E15.5 also showed defective migration, with a significant reduction in BrdU+ cells in the upper and middle CP and an increased fraction in the IZ of mutants at E18.5 (Figure 2E). Sections stained for both BrdU and β-galactosidase following E15.5 BrdU injections revealed that not all BrdU+ cells in the IZ were β-galactosidase+ (Figure 2F), suggesting that at least some defects in migration reflect a cell-nonautonomous role for Satb2. In addition to a modest reduction in cortical thickness, Satb2 mutants displayed striking alterations in axonal connectivity. Cresyl violet-stained coronal sections from E18.5 embryos revealed the apparent absence of the corpus callosum in Satb2 mutants (Figures 3A–3D). Other major forebrain axon tracts such as the anterior and hippocampal commissures (Figures 3C and 3D) appeared normal, suggesting that there were not global defects in midline development. The width of the corpus callosum was similar in Satb2+/− and wild-type brains (wild-type, 128 ± 17 μm; Satb2+/−, 138 ± 9 μm; n = 3), suggesting that callosal connectivity is normal in heterozygotes. To ascertain whether the axons of Satb2-deficient neurons extended across the corpus callosum, β-galactosidase activity was visualized using X-gal histochemistry (Figures 3E–3L) and immunohistochemistry (Figure S2). Although β-galactosidase+ cell bodies were observed in the CP, neither method stained callosal axons in Satb2 mutants (Figure 3I and Figure S2), suggesting that neurons that normally express Satb2 are generated and migrate into the CP but do not project axons to their normal contralateral targets. Failures of callosal development are common in mutant mice (Richards et al., 2004Richards L.J. Plachez C. Ren T. Mechanisms regulating the development of the corpus callosum and its agenesis in mouse and human.Clin. Genet. 2004; 66: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and are often accompanied by the formation of Probst bundles, in which callosal axons accumulate on either side of the midline (Stefanko, 1980Stefanko S.Z. Fasciculus callosus longitudinalis (bundle of Probst) and its relation to the corpus callosum.Patol. Pol. 1980; 31: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar, Ozaki and Wahlsten, 1993Ozaki H.S. Wahlsten D. Cortical axon trajectories and growth cone morphologies in fetuses of acallosal mouse strains.J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 336: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Satb2-deficient mice, however, Probst bundles were not observed using Cresyl violet staining (Figures 3C and 3D), X-gal histochemistry (Figure 3I), or β-galactosidase immunoreactivity (Figure S2), suggesting that Satb2-deficient axons assumed a novel trajectory rather than approaching the callosum and stalling. To visualize these axons, we serially sectioned Satb+/− and mutant brains, then used X-gal histochemistry (Figures 3I–3L) and immunohistochemistry (Figure S2) to reveal β-galactosidase. These experiments revealed large numbers of β-galactosidase+ axons in the internal capsule in Satb2−/− mice (Figures 3I, 3J, and 3L and Figure S2). Labeled axons projected along the path normally traversed by corticospinal axons, descending caudoventrally in the cerebral peduncle and pyramidal tract to roughly the level of the substantia nigra (Figures 3I–3L and Figure S2). We also observed an increased number of β-galactosidase+ axons in the striatum of Satb2 mutants (Figure 3I and Figure S2). In normal animals, many layer 5 subcortical projection neurons form collaterals in the striatum (Reiner et al., 2003Reiner A. Jiao Y. Del Mar N. Laverghetta A.V. Lei W.L.

Neurol. 2003; 457: 420-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), thus we hypothesize that labeled axons in the striatum are collaterals from subcortically projecting axons. β-galactosidase+ axons in Satb2 mutants were also seen in the external capsule (Figures 3I and 3J and Figure S2), a major conduit to the anterior commissure; however, β-galactosidase+ axons did not enter this commissure (Figure S2). The external capsule also contains axons from dorsal cortical neurons that cross the striatum and the internal capsule (Rouiller and Welker, 1991Rouiller E.M. Welker E.

https://openalex.org/W2046165140,"Pyramidal neurons of the neocortex can be subdivided into two major groups: deep- (DL) and upper-layer (UL) neurons. Here we report that the expression of the AT-rich DNA-binding protein Satb2 defines two subclasses of UL neurons: UL1 (Satb2 positive) and UL2 (Satb2 negative). In the absence of Satb2, UL1 neurons lose their identity and activate DL- and UL2-specific genetic programs. UL1 neurons in Satb2 mutants fail to migrate to superficial layers and do not contribute to the corpus callosum but to the corticospinal tract, which is normally populated by DL axons. Ctip2, a gene required for the formation of the corticospinal tract, is ectopically expressed in all UL1 neurons in the absence of Satb2. Satb2 protein interacts with the Ctip2 genomic region and controls chromatin remodeling at this locus. Satb2 therefore is required for the initiation of the UL1-specific genetic program and for the inactivation of DL- and UL2-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1972002859,"Broiler (meat) chickens have been subjected to intense genetic selection. In the past 50 years, broiler growth rates have increased by over 300% (from 25 g per day to 100 g per day). There is growing societal concern that many broiler chickens have impaired locomotion or are even unable to walk. Here we present the results of a comprehensive survey of commercial flocks which quantifies the risk factors for poor locomotion in broiler chickens. We assessed the walking ability of 51,000 birds, representing 4.8 million birds within 176 flocks. We also obtained information on approximately 150 different management factors associated with each flock. At a mean age of 40 days, over 27.6% of birds in our study showed poor locomotion and 3.3% were almost unable to walk. The high prevalence of poor locomotion occurred despite culling policies designed to remove severely lame birds from flocks. We show that the primary risk factors associated with impaired locomotion and poor leg health are those specifically associated with rate of growth. Factors significantly associated with high gait score included the age of the bird (older birds), visit (second visit to same flock), bird genotype, not feeding whole wheat, a shorter dark period during the day, higher stocking density at the time of assessment, no use of antibiotic, and the use of intact feed pellets. The welfare implications are profound. Worldwide approximately 2×1010 broilers are reared within similar husbandry systems. We identify a range of management factors that could be altered to reduce leg health problems, but implementation of these changes would be likely to reduce growth rate and production. A debate on the sustainability of current practice in the production of this important food source is required."

https://openalex.org/W2104192945,"While much has been learned regarding the neural substrates supporting episodic encoding using highly controlled experimental protocols, relatively little is known regarding the neural bases of episodic encoding of real-world events. In an effort to examine this issue, we measured fMRI activity while observers viewed a novel TV sitcom. Three weeks later, subsequent memory (SM) for the narrative content of movie events was assessed. We analyzed the encoding data for intersubject correlations (ISC) based on subjects' subsequent memory (ISC-SM) performance to identify brain regions whose BOLD response is significantly more correlated across subjects during portions of the movie that are successfully as compared to unsuccessfully encoded. These regions include the parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior temporal poles, and the temporal-parietal junction. Further analyses reveal (1) that these correlated regions can display distinct activation profiles and (2) that the results seen with the ISC-SM analysis are complementary to more traditional linear models and allow analysis of complex time course data. Thus, the ISC-SM analysis extends traditional subsequent memory findings to a rich, dynamic and more ecologically valid situation."
https://openalex.org/W2024594848,"Recent clinical studies suggest that several antihypertensive drugs, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, reduced bone fractures. To clarify the relationship between hypertension and osteoporosis, we focused on the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) on bone metabolism. In bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, Ang II (1x10(-6) M) significantly increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive multinuclear osteoclasts. Of importance, Ang II significantly induced the expression of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts, leading to the activation of osteoclasts, whereas these effects were completely blocked by an Ang II type 1 receptor blockade (olmesartan) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors. In a rat ovariectomy model of estrogen deficiency, administration of Ang II (200 ng/kg/min) accelerated the increase in TRAP activity, accompanied by a significant decrease in bone density and an increase in urinary deoxypyridinoline. In hypertensive rats, treatment with olmesartan attenuated the ovariectomy-induced decrease in bone density and increase in TRAP activity and urinary deoxypyridinoline. Furthermore, in wild-type mice ovariectomy with five-sixths nephrectomy decreased bone volume by microcomputed tomography, whereas these change was not detect in Ang II type 1a receptor-deficient mice. Overall, Ang II accelerates osteoporosis by activating osteoclasts via RANKL induction. Blockade of Ang II might become a novel therapeutic approach to prevent osteoporosis in hypertensive patients."

S63del mice also provide an opportunity to explore how cells can dysfunction yet survive in prolonged ER stress—important for neurodegeneration related to misfolded proteins. Myelin protein zero (P0) is the major protein produced by myelinating Schwann cells (Kirschner et al., 2004Kirschner D.A. Wrabetz L. Feltri M.L. The P0 Gene.in: Lazzarini R.A. Myelin Biology and Disorders. Elselvier Academic Press, San Diego2004: 523-545Google Scholar). P0 is a single-pass transmembrane protein, with a large amino-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and a short carboxy-terminal intracellular tail. The protein is encoded by the Mpz gene and synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it undergoes N-glycosylation and formation of one intramolecular disulfide bond. In myelin, P0 is present as tetramers that compact the extracellular appositions of myelin wraps via in trans homophilic interactions (D'Urso et al., 1990D'Urso D. Brophy P.J. Staugaitis S.M.

Accordingly, mice with homozygous disruption of Mpz show uncompaction of myelin in development (Giese et al., 1992Giese K.P. Martini R. Lemke G. Soriano P. Schachner M.

Zielasek J. Toyka K.V. Giese K.P. Schachner M. Protein zero (P0)-deficient mice show myelin degeneration in peripheral nerves characteristic of inherited human neuropathies.Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). More than 100 mutations of P0, many in the ECD, are associated with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (Shy, 2005Shy M.E.

Elselvier Academic Press, San Diego2004: 905-951Google Scholar). Although the specific pathogenetic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, dominant inheritance and widely varying phenotypes suggest that many P0 mutations act through gain of abnormal function (Martini et al., 1995Martini R. Zielasek J. Toyka K.V. Giese K.P. Schachner M. Protein zero (P0)-deficient mice show myelin degeneration in peripheral nerves characteristic of inherited human neuropathies.Nat.

For example, deletion of serine 63 (S63del) or its mutation to a cysteine (S63C) results in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 1B and Dèjèrine-Sòttas syndrome (DSS) in humans, respectively (Hayasaka et al., 1993Hayasaka K.

Transgenic mice expressing both mutant and normal P0 confirm that these mutations produce a gain of abnormal function (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The pathomechanisms are likely to differ between the two mutations, for although S63C is incorporated into myelin, producing packing defects, S63del is retained in the ER. In the ER, membrane proteins are subject to stringent quality control (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar). Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER sequesters chaperones like binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). As an adaptive response, UPR upregulates transcription of chaperones, temporarily attenuates new translation, and activates protein degradation via the proteasome. However, at high levels of ER stress, UPR signaling contributes to apoptosis (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar). For example, deletion of the gene encoding CHOP (CAATT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, a transcription factor active in the UPR) protects cells against apoptosis (Marciniak et al., 2004Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D.

CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Here we report that P0S63del activates a canonical and dose-dependent UPR, including CHOP, and consequentially, demyelination in Schwann cells. ER retention and UPR depend on alteration of the pattern of hydrophobic residues in P0 β strand C, not changes at residue 63, a mechanism potentially shared by another CMT1B mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 64 (Ikegami et al., 1996Ikegami T. Nicholson G. Ikeda H. Ishida A. Johnston H. Wise G. Ouvrier R. Hayasaka K.

Commun. 1996; 222: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ablation of Chop in S63del mice reverses behavioral, electrophysiological, and morphological abnormalities, indicating the UPR as a novel pathogenetic mechanism in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies. Finally, UPR activation is rapidly reversed by reducing mutant protein levels in mutant nerves, suggesting its dosage as a logical therapeutic target. Given that Schwann cell death follows, not precedes demyelination, we propose that the maladaptive UPR and CHOP in S63del nerves produces a novel cellular dysfunction in Schwann cells. P0S63del causes a demyelinating neuropathy via gain of abnormal function, but does not arrive to the myelin sheath (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To characterize potential toxic mechanisms operative outside of myelin, we surveyed protein quality control in S63del nerves. We considered autophagy (lysosomes), proteasomes, and UPR in S63del nerves. LAMP1 staining was slightly expanded but did not reveal the lysosomal aggregates that have been reported for PMP22 mutants, where aggresomes are cleared by autophagy (see Figure S1 available online) (Fortun et al., 2003Fortun J. Dunn Jr., W.A. Joy S. Li J. Notterpek L. Emerging role for autophagy in the removal of aggresomes in Schwann cells.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10672-10680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy did not reveal aggregates or swollen ER (Tsang et al., 2007Tsang K.Y. Chan D. Cheslett D. Chan W.C. So C.L. Melhado I.G. Chan T.W. Kwan K.M. Hunziker E.B. Yamada Y. et al.Surviving endoplasmic reticulum stress is coupled to altered chondrocyte differentiation and function.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e44Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in S63del Schwann cells (Figure S2A). Also, EDEM1, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum activated degradation (ERAD), was expressed at normal levels, preliminarily suggesting limited ERAD and proteasomal involvement (Figure S2B). When expressed in mice of the Mpz null background, P0S63del is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, CMT1B patients have both MPZ WT and S63del alleles. Even when P0S63del was coexpressed with P0wt (Figure 5C), immunostaining on teased fibers showed that P0 was still retained in the ER (Figure 1A). These data, taken together with preliminary evidence that the transcription of BiP and CHOP is upregulated in S63del nerves (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggest that the UPR is an important form of quality control for P0S63del. Therefore, we asked whether P0S63del elicited a full UPR and how the UPR correlated with disease. In mouse, disease severity correlates with MpzS63del mRNA expression (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To examine dose dependence, we exploited mice expressing S63del mRNA at levels of one (S63del-L) or two (S63del-H) endogenous alleles. BiP and CHOP mRNA levels were increased by 5.2- and 2.7-fold in S63del-L and 5.7- and 14.6-fold in S63del-H sciatic nerves, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C). Induction of BiP and CHOP mRNA was tissue and mutation specific. It was not detected in the brain (data not shown) or in nerves of S63C, P0Myc (pathological model of CMT1B; Previtali et al., 2000Previtali S.C. Quattrini A. Fasolini M. Panzeri M.C. Villa A. Filbin M.T. Li W. Chiu S.Y. Messing A. Wrabetz L. Feltri M.L. Epitope-tagged P(0) glycoprotein causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like neuropathy in transgenic mice.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or P0 overexpressor mice (Wrabetz et al., 2000Wrabetz L. Feltri M. Quattrini A. Inperiale D. Previtali S. D'Antonio M.

Schwann cell myelination requires timely and precise targeting of P0 protein.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1009-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). The level of induction was robust, comparable to the levels of BiP and CHOP mRNA acutely induced by tunicamycin (glycosylation inhibitor) in liver (2.5- and 19-fold) (Figures 1B and 1C) or cultured sciatic nerve segments (4- and 10-fold) (Figures 5A and 5B) of normal mice. Induction of BiP and CHOP in S63del and tunicamycin-treated nerves was confirmed by western analysis (Figure 1D). As for mRNA levels, CHOP protein induction was higher in S63del-H mice than in S63del-L mice, in parallel with the ratio of mutant P0S63del to P0wt. CHOP activates transcription of the Downstream Of CHOP genes (DOCs) (Wang et al., 1998Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. Identification of novel stress-induced genes downstream of chop.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Accordingly, DOCs 1 and 6, although not 4, were induced in S63del nerve. Tunicamycin treatment activated DOC4 in NIH 3T3 cells, but not in sciatic nerve, raising the possibility that Schwann cells respond differently to CHOP (Figure 1E). Altogether, these data show that BiP, CHOP, and its target genes are upregulated in S63del nerves to levels comparable to those found when UPR is acutely induced by tunicamycin. Of these, the level of CHOP correlated best with mutant protein level and disease severity. To characterize the UPR in S63del nerves more fully, we analyzed activation of the three arms of the UPR: IRE-1 and PERK kinases and cleavage of ATF6 transcription factor (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar). Activated IRE-1 noncanonically splices the mRNA of the transcription factor X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1), an event specific to UPR (Yoshida et al., 2001Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. XBP1 mRNA is induced by ATF6 and spliced by IRE1 in response to ER stress to produce a highly active transcription factor.Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2706) Google Scholar). The spliced form of XBP-1 was increased by 2.5-, 2.7-, and 5-fold in S63del-L, S63del-H, and tunicamycin-treated nerves, respectively (Figure 2A). Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α and upregulates translation of the transcription factor ATF4 and transcription of ATF3, CHOP, and the oxidoreductin ERO1-Lβ (Jiang et al., 2004Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Activating transcription factor 3 is integral to the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 kinase stress response.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Pagani et al., 2000Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar). Indeed, the levels of eIF2α phosphorylation increased 1.8-fold, and ATF4 3-fold in S63del-L nerves (Figure 2B). Similarly, ATF3 mRNA was induced 2.5-fold in S63del-L, 12.4-fold in S63del-H nerves, and 6.1-fold in tunicamycin-treated liver (Figure 2C). Likewise, ERO1-Lβ was induced in S63del-H nerves and tunicamycin-treated liver to a similar extent (Figure S2C and data not shown). The UPR was activated in Schwann cells, as the transcription factor CHOP, which was undetectable in normal nerves, was localized to the nucleus of S63del Schwann cells (Figure 2D). Finally, dose-dependent ATF6 cleavage was detected in S63del-L and -H nerves (Figure 2E). Thus, P0S63del provokes a dose-dependent activation of IRE-1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways in Schwann cells of S63del nerves, indicating a canonical UPR. In S63del nerves, ER retention of P0S63del and UPR activation suggested protein misfolding. Thus, we performed western analysis for the intramolecular disulfide bond of P0 (Figure 3A). The mobility of P0wt was increased by 3–4 kD under nonreducing conditions, consistent with the presence of a disulfide bond. Nonreduced P0S63del showed a similar shift (arrowhead), but in addition produced a smear, which could represent alternatively folded intermediates. In contrast, another neuropathic mutation at the same residue, P0S63C, which is not retained in the ER, migrated similarly to P0wt. Serine 63 lies in β strand C, characterized by an alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic pattern of residues (Figure 3B) (Shapiro et al., 1996Shapiro L. Doyle J.P. Hensley P. Colman D. Hendrickson W.A. Crystal structure of the extracellular domain from Po, the major structural protein of peripheral nerve myelin.Neuron. 1996; 17: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that deletion of serine 63 altered the disposition of the 4 hydrophobic residues (FWYP) in β strand C (Figure 3B, compare WT and S63del). Therefore, we compared the effect of deleting serine 63 to either deletion of phenylalanine 64 (F64del), conversion of both serine 63 and threonine 65 into phenylalanines (S63F/T65F), substitution of serine 63 with phenylalanine (S63F), or substitution of serine 63 with cysteine (S63C), which alter the disposition of 3, 2, 1, or 0 hydrophobic residues, respectively. P0 was fused at its carboxyl terminus in frame with the discosoma red (DsRed) fluorescent protein. Modification of P0 at the carboxyl terminus does not impair targeting of P0 to the plasma membrane in cells (Shames et al., 2003Shames I. Fraser A. Colby J. Orfali W. Snipes G.J. Phenotypic differences between peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) and myelin protein zero (P0) mutations associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth-related diseases.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or to myelin in transgenic sciatic nerve (M.P., P. Fratta, and L.W., unpublished data). The chimeras were transiently expressed in COS-7 (Figure 3D) or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (data not shown), and the cells were immunostained for the ER resident lectin, calnexin (CNX) (Figure 3D). Both P0wt and P0S63C were targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas P0S63del was confined to the ER, consistent with prior analysis of these mutant P0s in transgenic mice (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, transfected P0MycDsRed was trafficked to the cell membrane (data not shown), just as P0Myc arrives to myelin in transgenic sciatic nerve (Previtali et al., 2000Previtali S.C. Quattrini A. Fasolini M. Panzeri M.C. Villa A. Filbin M.T. Li W. Chiu S.Y. Messing A. Wrabetz L. Feltri M.L. Epitope-tagged P(0) glycoprotein causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like neuropathy in transgenic mice.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), further validating the transfected cells as a model. S63F was trafficked to the cell membrane, whereas F64del and S63F/T65F were mostly retained in the ER. Deletion of glutamic acid 71 in the loop connecting β strands C and C′ did not impair protein trafficking (data not shown). S63del and F64del also induced BiP transcription and XBP-1 splicing in COS-7 cells to levels similar to those obtained upon tunicamycin treatment (Figure 3C). These data suggest that it is not alteration of the side chain at residue 63 but rather a perturbed alignment of hydrophobic residues in β strand C that results in ER retention and activation of the UPR, providing further support for the notion that P0S63del is globally misfolded. S63del nerves are characterized by hypomyelination, demyelinated fibers, and onion bulbs (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A few nascent onion bulbs are detectable at postnatal day 28 (P28) and become evident by 6 months of age. To determine whether the UPR activation preceded or followed the appearance of pathological findings in diseased nerves, we analyzed P0, BiP, and CHOP expression across development. In WT and S63del-L mice, BiP and CHOP mRNAs were immediately upregulated during development, mirroring the robust induction of P0 expression that occurs immediately after birth and peaks around P28 (Figure 4), although CHOP rapidly leveled off and was maintained at a plateau, suggesting more complicated regulation. Similar results were obtained for S63del-H mice (data not shown). Thus, the robust UPR as measured by peak BiP and CHOP levels is associated with the onset of myelin instability, destruction, and failed remyelination marked by onion bulbs. The relative amounts of BiP and CHOP differed between S63del-L and S63del-H mice (Figure 1). Given that BiP chaperone helps cells to fold aberrant proteins (Gething, 1999Gething M.J. Role and regulation of the ER chaperone BiP.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), whereas CHOP may kill overwhelmed cells (Marciniak et al., 2004Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. CHOP induces death by promoting protein synthesis and oxidation in the stressed endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, Zinszner et al., 1998Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), the increased level of CHOP in the face of stable amounts of BiP could represent a transition from a cell survival response in S63del-L to an apoptotic reponse in S63del-H. One prediction of this hypothesis would be that in S63del-L nerves the level of BiP is near maximal and cannot be augmented. Therefore, segments of sciatic nerves were explanted and maintained in culture for 20 hr with or without tunicamycin. At time zero, BiP and CHOP were increased by 3.3- and 3.8-fold in S63del as compared to WT nerves (Figures 5A and 5B). Surprisingly, 20 hr after axotomy, BiP and CHOP expression decreased to levels similar to WT mice, although parallel treatment with tunicamycin induced BiP/CHOP to 3.9/10.4- and 3.8/6.9-fold in WT and mutant mice, respectively. These data indicate that, after axotomy, UPR is almost completely reversed in mutant nerves and is reinduced to similar levels by tunicamycin. Unfortunately, additive effects cannot be addressed after axotomy. One possible explanation was that axotomy of the cultured nerve segments produced acutely decreased mutant P0 (maintainence of Mpz expression depends on axonal signals; Trapp et al., 1988Trapp B.D. Hauer P. Lemke G. Axonal regulation of myelin protein mRNA levels in actively myelinating Schwann cells.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, 20 hr after axotomy, the level of P0wt was partially reduced (Figure 5C, arrow), whereas P0S63del was almost undetectable, also suggesting that P0S63del is less stable (Figure 5C, arrowhead). Similar results were obtained in sciatic nerve segments from S63del mice deleted of endogenous P0, where only mutant P0 is present (S63del−/−). As expected, this effect was transcriptionally mediated, as the level of P0 mRNA was very low at 20 hr after axotomy (Figure 5D), and had fallen significantly already by 6 hr after axon cut (data not shown). Thus, the UPR in S63del nerves is continuously activated by sustained expression of mutant protein. Transcriptional induction of BiP and CHOP can be halted by simply discontinuing mutant transgene expression, indicating that the UPR is reversible in vivo. Of the UPR mediators, the level of CHOP expression correlated best with disease severity. To demonstrate a direct role for the CHOP-dependent arm of the UPR in the pathogenesis of demyelination in S63del nerves, we crossed S63del-L and Chop null mice (Zinszner et al., 1998Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) and analyzed behavior, neurophysiology, and morphology in WT, S63del, Chop null, and S63del/Chop null littermates. Chop null mice show no overt neuromuscular defects (Zinszner et al., 1998Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar; see below). Four-month-old S63del mice had lost one-third to one-half of their motor capacity as compared to WT or Chop null littermates in analysis by accelerating rotarod (Figure 6A) (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Strikingly, S63del/Chop null mice regained completely normal motor capacity in rotarod analysis (Figure 6A). This was accompanied by a partial rescue of electrophysiological and morphological abnormalities. In particular, S63del mice manifest reduced nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and increased F-wave latency (Wrabetz et al., 2006Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. et al.Different intracellular pathomechanisms produce diverse Myelin Protein Zero neuropathies in transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In 6-month-old S63del/Chop null mice, the F-wave latency was significantly improved, even if the NCV did not change. In addition, there were half the number of demyelinated fibers and a trend toward reduction of onion bulbs as compared to S63del mice (Figure 6B and Table 1). Consistent with unchanged NCV, hypomyelination remained (Figure 6B), as we have documented previously in other transgenic mice that overexpress total P0 (Wrabetz et al., 2000Wrabetz L. Feltri M. Quattrini A. Inperiale D. Previtali S. D'Antonio M. Martini R. Yin X. Trapp B. Zhou L. et al.P0 overexpression causes congenital hypomyelination of peripheral nerve."

Sequence analysis revealed a highly significant enrichment of AU-rich element motifs, with AUUUA pentamers present in 96% and UUAUUUAUU nonamers present in 44% of TTP-associated mRNAs. We further show that IL-10 is a novel target regulated by TTP. IL-10 mRNA levels were found to be elevated because of a reduced decay rate in primary macrophages from TTP-/- mice.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Importantly, binding of TTP causes the rapid degradation of its target mRNAs. The first physiological target was identified by the careful analysis of mutant mice lacking TTP. Nullizygous mice develop an inflammatory syndrome characterized by cachexia, spontaneous arthritis, dermatitis, and neutrophilia (2Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D.

The inflammatory features of this syndrome are similar to those observed in TNFα transgenic mice (3Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), and neutralizing antibodies reactive with TNFα prevent most of the inflammatory symptoms in TTP-/- mice (2Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Indeed macrophages derived from TTP-/- mice were found to overexpress TNFα as a consequence of a prolonged mRNA half-life. TTP was shown to specifically bind to the ARE of TNFα mRNA and cause its rapid degradation (4Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of primary cells from TTP-/- mice showed that TTP has additional targets including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor and interleukin-2 (IL-2) mRNA (5Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J.

Immediate early response 3 mRNA has recently been identified as a novel target in TTP-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (7Lai W.S. Parker J.S. Grissom S.F. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9196-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Other possible targets of TTP were suggested by alternative approaches; knock down of TTP via RNA-interference showed that the rapid degradation of 1,4-galactosyltransferase 1, c-myc, cyclin D1, and vasculo-endothelial growth factor mRNA is dependent on TTP (8Gringhuis S.I.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and overexpression studies indicated that IL-3, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2, and TTP mRNA itself may also be destabilized by TTP (12Stoecklin G.

Finally, knock down of TTP in macrophages was shown to cause increased production of IL-6, IL-12, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2, although mRNA stability was not addressed in this study (17Jalonen U. Nieminen R. Vuolteenaho K. Kankaanranta H. Moilanen E. Mediators Inflamm. 2006; 2006: 1-8Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because data base analysis suggests that up to 5-8% of all mRNAs possess putative AREs in their 3′-UTR (18Bakheet T. Williams B.R. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), TTP has the potential to coordinately dampen the expression of a large number of transcripts. Indeed, a recent genome-wide analysis found 250 mRNAs to be stabilized with statistical significance in TTP-/- MEFs (7Lai W.S. Parker J.S. Grissom S.F. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9196-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).The ARE is a loosely defined cis element located in the 3′-untranslated region of many short-lived mRNAs. It was first characterized as a destabilizing element that promotes the degradation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor transcripts (19Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar). The study of additional short-lived mRNAs led to a classification scheme based on the number and spacing of a canonical AUUUA pentamer (20Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Class I AREs (e.g. c-myc, c-fos) have a few scattered pentamers, class II AREs (e.g. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNFα) have a cluster of 4-7 partially overlapping pentamers within a U-rich context, and class III AREs (e.g. c-jun) lack pentamers. The pentamer is critical to the function of class II AREs as point mutations within the pentamer prevent rapid mRNA decay (21Stoecklin G. Hahn S. Moroni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28591-28597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Class II AREs typically have an extended UUAUUUAUU nonamer, and this motif is also the minimal sequence that can effectively induce mRNA decay in reporter systems (22Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The same nonamer also binds to TTP with maximum affinity in vitro (23Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27870-27877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and is, thus, considered a canonical TTP binding site. However, these sequence features are not sufficient to reliably identify short-lived transcripts or predict the binding of destabilizing factors. A global analysis of mRNA decay rates found that only 10-15% of all mRNAs containing typical ARE motifs have a half-life below 2 h (24Yang E. van Nimwegen E. Zavolan M. Rajewsky N. Schroeder M. Magnasco M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1863-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).This situation calls for alternative approaches to identify mRNAs that are regulated at the level of mRNA stability. As an unbiased approach, RNA can be isolated from affinity-purified RNA-binding proteins (RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)) and subjected to genome-scale microarray analysis (RIP-Chip) (25Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 26Keene J.D. Komisarow J.M. Friedersdorf M.B. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This strategy has revealed the spectrum of mRNAs associated with several RNA-binding proteins including HuB, eIF4E, PABP (27Tenenbaum S.A. Carson C.C. Lager P.J. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In this report we have used RIP-Chip to identify transcripts that associate with TTP in macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our results show that the AUUUA pentamer and the UUAUUUAUU nonamer are highly enriched in 3′-UTRs of TTP-associated mRNAs. By analyzing macrophages from TTP-/- mice we confirmed that a subset of TTP-associated mRNAs including IL-10 mRNA is regulated by TTP. The ability of TTP to sequentially suppress the expression of TNFα and IL-10 suggests that its activity may regulate both the activation and the deactivation phase of the inflammatory response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRIP—RAW264.7 cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in RIP buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol and freshly supplemented with 100 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 20 nm okadaic acid, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was cleared from nuclei by centrifugation for 2 min at 2000 × g before the addition of 1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma) and 10 units/ml RNasin (Promega). 10% of the lysate was removed to isolate the input RNA using Trizol-LS (Invitrogen). The remaining lysate was precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 5% (v/v) protein A/G beads (Pierce). Beads were removed by centrifugation, and lysates were incubated with either rabbit-TTP (CARP-3) or rabbit hemagglutinin (HA.11, Covance) antibody (5 μg/ml) for 2 h. 5% (v/v) protein A/G beads were added for another 2 h and washed 8 times with RIP buffer before extraction of RNA using Trizol-LS. RIP using polysome lysis buffer was performed as described earlier (25Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Microarray and Data Analysis—RNA isolated from input as well as IP samples was checked for quality using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer. 50 ng of isolated RNA was converted to labeled fragmented cRNA using the Affymetrix small sample protocol (Version II). Briefly, the RNA was converted to single-stranded cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and the GeneChip T7 promoter primer kit (Affymetrix). The single-stranded cDNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase, and RNase H from Escherichia coli. The double-stranded cDNA was subsequently purified using a cleanup kit from Affymetrix and converted to cRNA by in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript T7 polymerase kit (Ambion). The cRNA was further converted to double-stranded cDNA using a random primed first-strand synthesis and a T7-oligo(dT)-primed second step. This double-stranded cDNA was then cleaned up and in vitro transcribed to biotin-labeled cRNA. 35-200-base fragments were generated by metal-induced hydrolysis and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays. After hybridization, the chip was washed, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin before being scanned. An antibody amplification staining protocol that uses biotinylated goat IgG followed by a second streptavidin-phycoerythrin staining increases the sensitivity of the assay. The chip was then scanned, and images were analyzed qualitatively using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System software. RIP-Chip was repeated three times independently (biological repeats), and the signal intensities were background-corrected and summarized using two independent algorithms, MAS 5.0 (32Liu W.M. Mei R.

Genome Biology. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each transcript, a retention coefficient (RC) was calculated by dividing the signal intensity from the TTP-IP RNA by the signal intensity from the input RNA. A false-positive likelihood was also calculated for each transcript by dividing the signal from the hemagglutinin-IP RNA sample by the signal from the input RNA. A list was assembled with all transcripts that had both RC(gcRMA) and RC(MAS5) values >4, and the average RC was calculated (R analysis script is available on request).3′-UTR Sequence Analysis—Sequences retrieved from the Affymetrix array were blasted on www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST to identify sense-matching full-length cDNAs. 3′-UTRs were defined at their upstream boundary by an annotated coding region and at their downstream boundary by the presence of a polyadenylation site within the last 50 nt of the cDNA, including non-canonical polyadenylation sites as described by Beaudoing et al. (40Beaudoing E. Freier S. Wyatt J.R. Claverie J.M. Gautheret D. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the presence of ≥10 3′-terminal A residues was taken as evidence for a 3′-UTR downstream boundary. In some cases evidence for the 3′-UTR boundaries was obtained from alternative cDNA data base entries. AREs were assessed using an AU score as follows: AU score = 1 (blue in Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S1) if no AUUUA pentamer is present in the 3′-UTR; AU score = 2 (green) if ≥1 AUUUA pentamer but no UUAUUUAUU nonamer is present; AU score = 3 (yellow) if ≥1 UUAUUUAUU nonamer but no AU cluster is present; AU score = 4 (orange) if ≥1 AU cluster is present, defined as a nonamer linked to a pentamer solely by U-residues (e.g. UUAUUUAUUUA or UUAUUUAUUAUUUA).FIGURE 2Distribution of AU-rich elements in the 3′-UTRs of TTP-associated mRNAs. A, RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cells stimulated for 2 h with LPS as in Fig. 1B, and TTP-associated mRNAs were identified by RIP-Chip. From 280 transcripts with RC values >4, a total of 137 full-length sense-matching mRNAs were identified by BLAST analysis, and their 3′-UTRs were analyzed for the presence of AU clusters (orange), UUAUUUAUU nonamers (yellow), AUUUA pentamers (green), or the absence of any of these motifs (blue). B, as a negative control, the 3′-UTRs of the 137 mRNAs with lowest RC values were analyzed in the same way. C, frequency of 3′-UTRs containing either AU clusters, UUAUUUAUU nonamers, AUUUA pentamers, or none of these motifs is plotted for the following groups; TTP-associated mRNAs as described in panel A, negative control mRNAs as described in panel B, mRNAs randomly chosen from the UCSC KnownGene murine mm8 data base (random control), and size-matched sequences of concatenated 3′-UTRs (concatemer control) from the UCSC KnowGene human hg17 assembly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell Culture—RAW264.7 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) as well as 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). COS-7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were isolated from the femur and tibia of wt and TTP-/- C57BL/6 mice and cultured for 7-10 days in macrophage medium containing RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 20 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), essential and non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), 10 mm sodium hydroxide, 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). For BMDM, 5% conditioned medium from L929 cells was added as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating-factor. LPS (L3755 from E. coli 026:B6, Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml to stimulate RAW264.7 cells and at 100 ng/ml to stimulate BMDM. Blocking anti-mouse TNFα antibody (AF-410-NA, R&D Systems) was used at a concentration of 1 and 10 μg/ml. Freshly isolated spleen cells were stimulated with 100 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and 1 μm ionomycin in macrophage medium.Western Blot Analysis—Cytoplasmic lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% polyacrylamide gradient Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) as described previously (41Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Goat α-TTP (sc-8458, Santa Cruz) and goat α-TIAR (sc-1749, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies.Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots were prepared as described previously (42Stoecklin G. Stubbs T. Kedersha N. Wax S. Rigby W.F. Blackwell T.K. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes were generated by PCR using custom reagents (Roche Applied Science), corresponding cDNAs, and the following primer pairs: 5′-glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)/3′-GAPDH for GAPDH, G29/G30 for globin, G78/G79 for S7, G83/G84 for nucleolin (Ncl), G152/G153 for IL-10, G154/G155 for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), G198/G199 for RAN, and G254/G255 for IL-15. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were generated by SP6 in vitro transcription using custom reagents (Roche Applied Science), and cDNA templates were generated with the following primer pairs: G314/G316 for TNFα, G366/G390 for ubiquitin specific peptidase 46 (Usp46), G370/G392 for Kelch-like protein 2 (Klhl2), G376/G395 for teratocarcinoma expressed protein (Tera), G380/G397 for AK166182, G382/G398 for TNF receptor-associated factor-2-binding protein (T2BP), G386/G400 for Gm561, and G388/G401 for eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). All primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S2.Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid pTet-7B and pTet-7B-TNF-ARE have been described previously (42Stoecklin G. Stubbs T. Kedersha N. Wax S. Rigby W.F. Blackwell T.K. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). For pTet-7B-IL-10-UTR, the murine IL-10 3′-UTR was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers G192 and G193 and ligated as a BamHI - BglII fragment into the BglII site of pTet-7B. For pTet-7B-RAN-UTR, the murine RAN 3′-UTR was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers G228 and G229 and ligated as a NheI-BglII fragment into the NheI-BglII sites of pTet-7B-IL-10-UTR. For pTet-7B-IL15-UTR, the murine IL15 3′-UTR was first amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers G196 and G197 followed by secondary PCR using primers G226 and G227. The product was ligated as a NheI-BglII fragment into the NheI-BglII sites of pTet-7B-IL-10-UTR. For pTet-7B-LIF-UTR, the murine LIF 3′-UTR was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers G245 and G249. After secondary PCR with primers G232 and G262, the LIF 3′-UTR was ligated as a XbaI-BglII fragment into the NheI-BglII sites of pTet-7B-IL-10-UTR. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S2.MTT Assay—L929 cells were grown over night in 96-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells per well, and medium containing recombinant mouse TNFα (554589, BD Pharmingen) or TNFα-containing supernatants were added together with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D for another 24 h. After the addition of MTT (25 μg/ml) for 4 h, cells were lysed in 4% SDS/10% dimethyl formamide over night. Spectrophotometric absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a microtiter plate reader.RESULTSRNA Immunoprecipitation of TTP-associated mRNA—With the aim of isolating TTP along with its associated mRNAs, RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated for 2 h with LPS to induce the expression of TTP. Importantly, stimulation by LPS also induces and stabilizes many ARE-containing mRNAs, which may be advantageous for their isolation. We first tested an EDTA-containing polysome lysis buffer that has been successfully used to isolate mRNAs associated with HuB, eIF4E, and PABP (27Tenenbaum S.A. Carson C.C. Lager P.J. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). TTP was immunoprecipitated using CARP-3 antibody (43Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Diegel R.J. Fava R.A. Rigby W.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) from the cytoplasmic lysate, yet recovery of TTP after IP was poor, and TNFα as a TTP-associated mRNA (4Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could not be detected in the IP material (Fig. 1A). Because TTP is a zinc-finger protein and, therefore, requires zinc ions for structural integrity, we next tested a lysis buffer lacking EDTA (Fig. 1B). With this method, TTP was recovered efficiently after IP along with TNFα mRNA, whereas neither TTP nor TNFα mRNA was recovered with a control hemagglutinin antibody. Another ARE-binding protein, TIAR (44Gueydan C. Droogmans L. Chalon P. Huez G. Caput D. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2322-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), was not immunoprecipitated with the TTP antibody. In contrast to TNFα mRNA, neither ribosomal 18 S/28 S RNA nor nucleolin mRNA (which does not contain an ARE) were detected in the IP material. We concluded that this method could efficiently and specifically isolate TTP-associated mRNAs. It is important to note, however, that this technique does not distinguish between mRNAs bound to TTP directly and mRNAs bound indirectly via other RNA-binding proteins that may interact with TTP.FIGURE 1Immunoprecipitation of TTP-associated mRNA. A, RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated for 2 h with LPS (10 μg/ml) before lysis in EDTA-containing polysome lysis buffer. IP was carried out with TTP antibody or hemagglutinin (HA) antibody as negative control. Recovery of TTP protein was monitored by Western blot analysis (upper panel), and TTP-associated TNFα mRNA was visualized by Northern blot analysis (lower panel). B, RNA immunoprecipitation was carried out as in panel A except that EDTA-free RIP buffer was used for lysis. Specificity of the IP was addressed by Western blot analysis of TTP and TIAR as an unrelated RNA-binding protein. 18 S and 28 S RNA were visualized using ethidium bromide staining, and TNFα mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis together with Ncl mRNA that does not contain an ARE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of TTP-associated mRNAs by RIP-Chip—We next performed RIP-Chip analysis to identify TTP-associated mRNAs on a genome-wide scale. RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated for 2 h with LPS, and RNA was isolated from both the cytoplasmic lysate (input) and the material immunoprecipitated with the TTP antibody (TTP-IP). To account for losses during the IP procedure, 10 times more lysate was used for the IP than for the input. The two RNA pools were converted into biotinylated cRNA and hybridized with Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays.RIP-Chip analysis of TTP was repeated three times, and the signal intensities were calculated using two independent algorithms (specified under “Experimental Procedures”). For each transcript, a RC was calculated by dividing the signal intensity from the TTP-IP by the signal intensity from the input RNA. From the 280 probe sets with average RC values >4, a total number of 137 sense-matching full-length mRNAs could be retrieved by BLAST analysis. These mRNAs were compiled in a final list of TTP-associated mRNAs (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1).AREs Are Overrepresented among TTP-associated mRNAs—Because the known target mRNAs of TTP contain recognizable AREs, we first examined the 3′-UTRs of the TTP-associated mRNAs for the presence of characteristic ARE motifs. An AU score was applied that distinguishes four categories (color-coded in Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1); presence of an AU cluster (orange), presence of ≥1 UUAUUUAUU nonamer (yellow), presence of ≥1 AUUUA pentamer (green), absence of AUUUA pentamers (blue). Among the TTP-associated mRNAs, the nonamer sequence, which is considered a canonical TTP binding site (23Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2017973613,"<h2>Summary</h2> In complex visual scenes, linking related contour elements is important for object recognition. This process, thought to be stimulus driven and hard wired, has substrates in primary visual cortex (V1). Here, however, we find contour integration in V1 to depend strongly on perceptual learning and top-down influences that are specific to contour detection. In naive monkeys, the information about contours embedded in complex backgrounds is absent in V1 neuronal responses and is independent of the locus of spatial attention. Training animals to find embedded contours induces strong contour-related responses specific to the trained retinotopic region. These responses are most robust when animals perform the contour detection task but disappear under anesthesia. Our findings suggest that top-down influences dynamically adapt neural circuits according to specific perceptual tasks. This may serve as a general neuronal mechanism of perceptual learning and reflect top-down mediated changes in cortical states."
https://openalex.org/W2150988781,"Attributing behavioral outcomes correctly to oneself or to other agents is essential for all productive social exchange. We approach this issue in high-functioning males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using two separate fMRI paradigms. First, using a visual imagery task, we extract a basis set for responses along the cingulate cortex of control subjects that reveals an agent-specific eigenvector (self eigenmode) associated with imagining oneself executing a specific motor act. Second, we show that the same self eigenmode arises during one's own decision (the self phase) in an interpersonal exchange game (iterated trust game). Third, using this exchange game, we show that ASD males exhibit a severely diminished cingulate self response when playing the game with a human partner. This diminishment covaries parametrically with their behaviorally assessed symptom severity, suggesting its value as an objective endophenotype. These findings may provide a quantitative assessment tool for high-functioning ASD."
https://openalex.org/W1987874837,"Background Infestations of the parasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis, commonly referred to as sea lice, represent a major challenge to commercial salmon aquaculture. Dependence on a limited number of theraputants to control such infestations has led to concerns of reduced sensitivity in some sea lice populations. This study investigates trends in the efficacy of the in-feed treatment emamectin benzoate in Scotland, the active ingredient most widely used across all salmon producing regions. Methodology/Principal Findings Study data were drawn from over 50 commercial Atlantic salmon farms on the west coast of Scotland between 2002 and 2006. An epi-informatics approach was adopted whereby available farm records, descriptive epidemiological summaries and statistical linear modelling methods were used to identify factors that significantly affect sea lice abundance following treatment with emamectin benzoate (SLICE®, Schering Plough Animal Health). The results show that although sea lice infestations are reduced following the application of emamectin benzoate, not all treatments are effective. Specifically there is evidence of variation across geographical regions and a reduction in efficacy over time. Conclusions/Significance Reduced sensitivity and potential resistance to currently available medicines are constant threats to maintaining control of sea lice populations on Atlantic salmon farms. There is a need for on-going monitoring of emamectin benzoate treatment efficacy together with reasons for any apparent reduction in performance. In addition, strategic rotation of medicines should be encouraged and empirical evidence for the benefit of such strategies more fully evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2001751957,"Extracytoplasmic function or ECF sigma factors are the most abundant class of alternative sigma factors in bacteria. Members of the rpoE subclass of ECF sigma factors are implicated in sensing stress in the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and are required for virulence in many pathogens. The best-studied member of this family is rpoE from Escherichia coli, encoding the σE protein. σE has been well studied for its role in combating extracytoplasmic stress, and the members of its regulon have been largely defined. σE is required for viability of E. coli, yet none of the studies to date explain why σE is essential in seemingly unstressed cells. In this work we investigate the essential role of σE in E. coli by analyzing the phenotypes associated with loss of σE activity and isolating suppressors that allow cells to live in the absence of σE. We demonstrate that when σE is inhibited, cell envelope stress increases and envelope integrity is lost. Many cells lyse and some develop blebs containing cytoplasmic material along their sides. To better understand the connection between transcription by σE and cell envelope integrity, we identified two multicopy suppressors of the essentiality of σE, ptsN and yhbW. yhbW is a gene of unknown function, while ptsN is a member of the σE regulon. Overexpression of ptsN lowers the basal level of multiple envelope stress responses, but not that of a cytoplasmic stress response. Our results are consistent with a model in which overexpression of ptsN reduces stress in the cell envelope, thereby promoting survival in the absence of σE."
https://openalex.org/W2075429769,"Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species display relatively static genomes and 99.9% nucleotide sequence identity. Studying the evolutionary history of such monomorphic bacteria is a difficult and challenging task. Principal Findings We found that single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of DNA repair, recombination and replication (3R) genes in a comprehensive selection of M. tuberculosis complex strains from across the world, yielded surprisingly high levels of polymorphisms as compared to house-keeping genes, making it possible to distinguish between 80% of clinical isolates analyzed in this study. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that a large number of these polymorphisms are potentially deleterious. Site frequency spectrum comparison of synonymous and non-synonymous variants and Ka/Ks ratio analysis suggest a general negative/purifying selection acting on these sets of genes that may lead to suboptimal 3R system activity. In turn, the relaxed fidelity of 3R genes may allow the occurrence of adaptive variants, some of which will survive. Furthermore, 3R-based phylogenetic trees are a new tool for distinguishing between M. tuberculosis complex strains. Conclusions/Significance This situation, and the consequent lack of fidelity in genome maintenance, may serve as a starting point for the evolution of antibiotic resistance, fitness for survival and pathogenicity, possibly conferring a selective advantage in certain stressful situations. These findings suggest that 3R genes may play an important role in the evolution of highly clonal bacteria, such as M. tuberculosis. They also facilitate further epidemiological studies of these bacteria, through the development of high-resolution tools. With many more microbial genomes being sequenced, our results open the door to 3R gene-based studies of adaptation and evolution of other, highly clonal bacteria."

Methods and Findings We report that activation of PKA by 3-isobutyl-1 methyl xanthine (IBMX) and forskolin enhances adipogenesis, the gene expression of PPARγ2 and LPL, and downregulates the gene expression of Runx2 and osteopontin, markers of osteogenesis. PKA activation also decreases the ratio of Receptor Activator of the NF-κB Ligand to Osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) gene expression – the key factors of osteoclastogenesis. All these effects are mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway by suppressing leptin, and may contribute to PKA stimulators-induced in vivo bone loss in developing zebrafish. Conclusions Using MSCs, the center of a newly proposed bone metabolic unit, we identified cAMP/PKA signaling, one of the many signaling pathways that regulate bone homeostasis via controlling cyto-differentiation of MSCs and altering RANKL/OPG gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2006794383,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an aerobic, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacterium widespread in the environment. S. maltophilia Sm777 exhibits innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, this bacterium tolerates high levels (0.1 to 50 mM) of various toxic metals, such as Cd, Pb, Co, Zn, Hg, Ag, selenite, tellurite and uranyl. S. maltophilia Sm777 was able to grow in the presence of 50 mM selenite and 25 mM tellurite and to reduce them to elemental selenium (Se0) and tellurium (Te0) respectively. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed cytoplasmic nanometer-sized electron-dense Se0 granules and Te0 crystals. Moreover, this bacterium can withstand up to 2 mM CdCl2 and accumulate this metal up to 4% of its biomass. The analysis of soluble thiols in response to ten different metals showed eightfold increase of the intracellular pool of cysteine only in response to cadmium. Measurements by Cd K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy indicated the formation of Cd-S clusters in strain Sm777. Cysteine is likely to be involved in Cd tolerance and in CdS-clusters formation. Our data suggest that besides high tolerance to antibiotics by efflux mechanisms, S. maltophilia Sm777 has developed at least two different mechanisms to overcome metal toxicity, reduction of oxyanions to non-toxic elemental ions and detoxification of Cd into CdS."
https://openalex.org/W2026391528,"Certain bacterial two-component sensor kinases possess a histidine-containing phosphotransfer (Hpt) domain to carry out a multistep phosphotransferring reaction to a cognate response regulator. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 contains three genes that encode proteins with an Hpt domain but lack a kinase domain. To identify the sensor kinase coupled to these Hpt proteins, a phosphorelay profiling assay was performed. Among the 12 recombinant orphan sensor kinases tested, 4 of these sensors (PA1611, PA1976, PA2824, and RetS) transferred the phosphoryl group to HptB (PA3345). The in vivo interaction between HptB and each of the sensors was also confirmed using the bacterial two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, the phosphoryl groups from these sensors all appeared to be transferred via HptB to PA3346, a novel phosphatase consisting of an N-terminal receiver domain and a eukaryotic type Ser/Thr phosphatase domain, and resulted in a significant increase of its phosphatase activity. The subsequent reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed an operon structure of hptB-PA3346–PA3347, suggesting a coordinate expression of the three genes to carry out a signal transduction. The possibility was supported by the analysis showing PA3347 is able to be phosphorylated on Ser-56, and this phosphoryl group could be removed by PA3346 protein. Finally, analysis of PA3346 and PA3347 gene knock-out mutants revealed that these genes are associated with bacterial swarming activity and biofilm formation. Together, these results disclose a novel multistep phosphorelay system that is essential for P. aeruginosa to respond to a wide spectrum of environmental signals.

Together, these results disclose a novel multistep phosphorelay system that is essential for P. aeruginosa to respond to a wide spectrum of environmental signals. Most bacteria possess multiple sets of two-component regulatory systems (2CSs), 2The abbreviations used are:2CSstwo-component regulatory systemsα-RNAPα-subunit of RNA polymeraseDIFMUP6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphateMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightPP2Cprotein phosphatase 2CRTreverse transcriptionX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. which are used for the reception of and response to environmental challenges (1Bijlsma J.J. Groisman E.A. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 359-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Typical 2CSs are composed of a sensor and a response regulator. The sensor is normally a transmembrane histidine kinase that detects a specific environmental stimulus and auto-phosphorylates a conserved histidine residue within its transmitter domain. The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred from the histidine residue to an aspartic acid on the cognate regulator, which then activates the expression of genes required for countering the environmental stress. In addition to this basic “His → Asp” type of phosphotransfer mechanism, more complex multistep phosphorelay 2CSs also exist, in which the sensor harbors two extra domains as follows: a receiver domain containing a phosphor-accepting Asp and a Hpt domain. The most well characterized examples of the complex type 2CS are the anaerobic regulator ArcAB of Escherichia coli (2Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and virulence-associated regulator BvgAS of Bordetella spp. (3Akerley B.J. Cotter P.A. Miller J.F.

An intermediate group of sensors are known as the hybrid sensors. The hybrid-type sensors, which contain a kinase and a receiver domain but lack an Hpt domain, are believed to require another protein to provide the Hpt domain for their signal transduction (Fig. 1) (4Rogov V.V. Bernhard F. Lohr F. Dotsch V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1035-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Takeda S. Fujisawa Y. Matsubara M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). An example of such a system has been demonstrated in E. coli, in which the hybrid sensor RcsC is dependent on YojN, an Hpt domain-containing protein, to signal and activate the response regulator RcsB (5Takeda S. Fujisawa Y. Matsubara M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Lai Y.C. Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 788-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Another example was found recently in yeast, in which YPD1, also an Hpt module protein, could transfer phosphoryl groups from sensor kinase SLN1 to two downstream response regulatory proteins, SSK1 and SKN7 (7Janiak-Spens F. Cook P.F. West A.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Xu Q. Porter S.W. West A.H.

These findings suggest that Hpt module-containing proteins function as intermediate transducers in multistep phosphorelay reactions (5Takeda S. Fujisawa Y. Matsubara M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative pathogen causing many acute and chronic infections, particularly in hospitalized individuals. The bacterium is responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality in patients afflicted with cystic fibrosis (11Winstanley C. Kaye S.B. Neal T.J. Chilton H.J. Miksch S. Hart C.A. J. Med.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 4329-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The bacterium is also ubiquitous in the environment and is well known for its multidrug resistance. The strong capability of the bacterium to adapt to different environments might be partly explained by the presence of more than 60 sets of 2CSs (13Rodrigue A. Quentin Y. Lazdunski A. Mejean V. Foglino M. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 498-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J.

A total of 12 hybrid-type kinases and 3 putative Hpt-module proteins have been annotated among the large number of 2CS proteins (Fig. 1). It is not clear, however, whether these hybrid sensors can indeed transmit the phosphoryl signal to the Hpt proteins. Furthermore, unlike the operon organization of most of the 2CS genes, the majority of the hybrid sensor genes does not link to a response regulator-encoding gene. Additionally, eight “orphan” response regulator genes, which do not link to any sensor gene, were also found in the P. aeruginosa genome (Fig. 1) (13Rodrigue A. Quentin Y. Lazdunski A. Mejean V. Foglino M. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 498-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J.

Mol. Evol. 2004; 59: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These orphan response regulators are therefore good candidates for receiving signals from the Hpt proteins. We have demonstrated in a previous report that 1 of the 12 hybrid sensors, encoded by PA1611, is capable of transferring a phosphoryl group to 1 of the 3 Hpt proteins (16Lin C.T. Huang Y.J. Chu P.H. Hsu J.L. Huang C.H. Peng H.L. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We here extend the study to identify the multistep phosphorelay pathways among these sensor kinases, Hpt proteins, and orphan response regulators by performing in vitro phosphotransfer reactions systematically. In addition, we further evaluated the functional roles of the signaling pathway mediated by HptB. Our results reveal how these 2CS members are organized into complex signaling regulatory pathways, allowing P. aeruginosa to respond to a variety of different environmental signals flexibly and efficiently. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. All P. aeruginosa mutants used in this study were derived from wild type strain PAO1. Both E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains were propagated in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar at 37 °C. The concentrations of antibiotics used for selection of recombinant E. coli were 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and/or 5 μg/ml tetracycline, whereas 400 μg/ml carbenicillin and/or 50 μg/ml tetracycline were used for the selection of P. aeruginosa derivatives.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains or plasmidsDescriptionsRefs. or sourceStrains E. coliNovaBlue (DE3)endA1 hsdR17 supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA96 relA1 lac [F′ proAB lacIqZΔM15Tn10]NovagenXL-1 BlueMRF′ K, Δ(mcrA) 183Δ[(mcr CB-hsdSMR-mrr) 173 endA1 supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA96 relA1 lac (F′ proAB lacIq Z ΔM15 Tn5(Kmr))]Novagen P. aeruginosaPAO1Nonmucoid wild type strainLaboratory stockMPA45PAO1 ΔhptB16Lin C.T.

Contaminating DNA was eliminated from the RNA samples with RNase-free DNase (Promega). cDNA was reverse-transcribed from RNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR was carried out at 95 °C for 1 min, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min per cycle for 30 cycles, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min, and the reaction products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The primers used in this study are listed in the supplemental Table S1. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of His-tagged Proteins—The recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out essentially as described (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). All restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and were used at the conditions suggested by the supplier. To generate recombinant proteins containing an N-terminal His6 tag, the coding region for each of the desired proteins was first amplified by PCR, cloned into an expression vector (pET30a or pET100), and transformed into E. coli Novablue (DE3). The transformants were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 mm NaCl), and disrupted on ice by ultrasonication. After centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove debris, the clarified cell lysate was loaded onto a nickel-charged column (Amersham Biosciences) and washed, and the His6-tagged proteins were then eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The compositions of wash and elution buffers, as well as the chromatography procedure, were essentially as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol), and their concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad kit. In Vitro Phosphorelay Assays—The signal transduction between the sensors and the Hpt proteins and between the Hpt proteins and the orphan regulators was tested by in vitro phosphorelay assays. The composition of the phosphorelay reaction was as described previously (16Lin C.T. Huang Y.J. Chu P.H. Hsu J.L. Huang C.H. Peng H.L. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at a final concentration of 2.5 μm. For autophosphorylation of the sensor, 1 μm of recombinant sensor protein was used, and the reaction was performed at 25 °C for 30 min. Phosphorelay from sensors to different Hpt proteins was performed by adding 1 μm of purified HptA, HptB, or HptC protein to the autokinase reaction mixture. The phosphorylation of response regulators was performed by incubating the purified regulator protein of interest (1 μm) in the reaction buffer with sensor kinase PA2824 and HptB at 25 °C for 30 min to allow for autophosphorylation of the sensor protein, and later at 37 °C for 30 min to allow for phosphorelay to HptB, and then finally to the regulator. In the reverse phosphorelay assay, a 32P-phosphorylated HptB was first prepared by using PA1611 sensor kinase as stated above. The sensor protein with no detectable autokinase activity was then added individually to the mixtures with excess ATP (0.5 mm) and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. All the phosphorelay reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation pattern was visualized by autoradiography. All phosphorelay assays were performed independently at least three times. Bacterial Two-hybrid Assay—DNA fragments encoding C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of hybrid sensors (PA1611, PA1976, PA2824, and RetS) and full-length HptB were cloned, respectively, at the 3′ end of genes encoding λ-CI repressor protein domain carried on pTRG vector and α-subunit RNA polymerase (α-RNAP) domain on pBT vector as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The resulting gene fusion constructs, pTRG-1611, pTRG-1976, pTRG-2824, pTRG-RetS, and pBT-HptB, were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The positive controls used were pTRG-GAL11P and pBT-LGF2 (Stratagene). Derivatives of pTRG and pBT were co-transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ Kan cells and selected on LB plates supplemented with 250 μg/ml carbenicillin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Then single colonies were patched on X-gal indicator plates (LB-agar plates supplemented with 350 μg/ml carbenicillin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml X-gal, 0.2 mm phenylethyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and 20 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) for 17–24 h at 37 °C. Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of PA3347 Protein in Vitro—The open reading frame of PA3347 was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-5X-1 and overexpressed as an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The recombinant PA3347 protein was purified through a Glutathione-Superflow column under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The purified fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to the phosphorylation assay. The P. aeruginosa cell lysate used for phosphorylation of the GST-PA3347 protein was prepared from exponentially grown bacteria by ultrasonication on ice followed by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Approximately 2.4 μm purified GST-PA3347 fusion protein was incubated with 10 mg of prepared lysate and 0.15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C for 1 h, precipitated with Glutathione-Superflow beads, and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein phosphatase activity of PA3346 was determined by incubation of the purified PA3346 protein with phosphorylated PA3347 at 37 °C for 30 min. When indicated, 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) or 50 mm EDTA was included in the reaction as a control. All reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Construction of GST-PA3347 Site-specific Mutations—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are provided in the supplemental material. In Vitro Phosphatase Activity Assays of PA3346—To detect phosphatase activity of phosphorylated PA3346, 5 μg of PA3346 purified from E. coli was preincubated with 1 μg of sensor (PA2824) and 1 μg of HptB in 50 μl of buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 μm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C and then 5 min at 37 °C. The fluorogenic compound 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DIFMUP) and its dephosphorylated standard 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl were purchased from Molecular Probes. For kinetic analysis, the DIFMUP stock solution was prediluted in reaction buffer and added to the reaction mixture to initiate the reaction at 25 °C. Fluorescent excitation of hydrolyzed DIFMUP and the standard DIFMU were measured at 355 nm, and emission was detected at 460 nm in a fluorescence plate reader (VITOR3, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Construction of Isogenic Mutants—The allelic exchange strategy was used to generate gene-specific mutants in P. aeruginosa. DNA fragments ∼1 kb in size flanking both sides of PA3346 and PA3347 were PCR-amplified by specific primer pairs (supplemental Table S1) and cloned into the suicide vector pEX18Tc. The generated plasmids were mobilized from E. coli SM10 into P. aeruginosa PAO1 through conjugation. The tetracycline-resistant transconjugants were selected positively with 5% sucrose for loss of the vector. PA3346 and PA3347 deletion mutants were verified by PCR and Southern blotting analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). Complementation of the gene defects was performed by cloning DNA fragments comprising either the PA3346 or the PA3347 open reading frame with an N-terminal His tag sequence into the shuttle vector pMMB66 to result in pMMB46 and pMMB47, which were then mobilized into the mutant bacteria by conjugation. Bacteria Motility Assays—The plates for the swarming assay contained M8 medium base supplemented with 0.5% Bacto-Agar, 0.02% glucose, and 0.5% casamino acids (18Kohler T. Curty L.K. Barja F. van Delden C. Pechere J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5990-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The bacterial strains to be tested were transferred from an overnight culture plate using a sterile toothpick and incubation was done at 37 °C for the swarming assay. The assays were performed independently at least three times. Biofilm Formation Assay—Biofilm formation was assayed in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates. Bacterial strains to be tested were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth and diluted 1:50 in fresh media into the 96-well plates the next morning. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for different times without shaking. The extent of biofilm formation was determined by staining with 1% crystal violet as described previously (16Lin C.T. Huang Y.J. Chu P.H. Hsu J.L. Huang C.H. Peng H.L. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and expressed as the absorbance at 595 nm. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of P. aeruginosa Hybrid Sensors—As the first step toward elucidating the signaling pathways exerted by the 12 hybrid-type sensors, we cloned all the genes encoding these sensors (listed in Fig. 1), overexpressed them with a terminal His6 fusion in E. coli, and purified the gene products. To eliminate potential insolubility problems, the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the sensors were removed. The remaining C-terminal cytoplasmic regions containing the His-containing transmitter and the Asp-containing receiver domain are predicted to possess auto-phosphorylation activity, as well as the ability to transfer the phosphoryl group to the corresponding response regulators (19Yamamoto K. Hirao K. Oshima T. Aiba H. Utsumi R. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1448-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). All the sensor proteins, with the exception of PA1992, which did not yield sufficient quantities for subsequent study, could be purified to apparent homogeneity in soluble form by a single step affinity chromatography (data not shown). Sensor Proteins PA1611, PA1976, and PA2824 Phosphorylate HptB—To identify the relationships between the three Hpt proteins and the hybrid-type sensor histidine kinases, the phosphotransfer profiling assay (20Skerker J.M. Prasol M.S. Perchuk B.S. Biondi E.G. Laub M.T. Plos Biol. 2005; 3: e334Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) was employed. In the assay, the purified sensor proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP to assess their autophosphorylation activity, and five of the tested sensors (PA1611, PA1976, PA2177, PA2583, and PA2824) showed varying degrees of autophosphorylation (Fig. 2, A–E, 1st lane). The phosphorylated sensor proteins were incubated with an Hpt protein, and the transfer of the phosphoryl group was examined by autoradiography (Fig. 2, A–E). The results showed that sensors PA1611, PA1976, and PA2824 could transfer a phosphoryl group specifically to HptB but not to either HptA or HptC (Fig. 2, A–C). Both sensors PA2177 and PA2583 were unable to phosphorylate any of the Hpt proteins in vitro despite their relatively high auto-kinase activity (Fig. 2, D and E). Sensors were purified and tested in three independent assays. RetS (PA4856) Also Interacts with HptB—To investigate whether any of the sensor proteins incapable of autophosphorylation could interact with HptB, a reverse phosphorylation experiment was performed as described (21Biondi E.G. Skerker J.M. Arif M. Prasol M.S. Perchuk B.S. Laub M.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 386-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem.

Phosphorylated HptB, prepared with [γ-32P]ATP and sensor PA1611, was used in this study as the phosphoryl group donor. In five independent assays, the appearance of a phosphorylated RetS band accompanied with a significant reduction of isotope signal of HptB (Fig. 3) could be detected indica"
https://openalex.org/W2081736462,"Visual information is transmitted to the brain by roughly a dozen distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) defined by a characteristic morphology, physiology, and central projections. However, our understanding about how these parallel pathways develop is still in its infancy, because few molecular markers corresponding to individual RGC types are available. Previously, we reported a secretory protein, SPIG1 (clone name; D/Bsp120I #1), preferentially expressed in the dorsal region in the developing chick retina. Here, we generated knock-in mice to visualize SPIG1-expressing cells with green fluorescent protein. We found that the mouse retina is subdivided into two distinct domains for SPIG1 expression and SPIG1 effectively marks a unique subtype of the retinal ganglion cells during the neonatal period. SPIG1-positive RGCs in the dorsotemporal domain project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), superior colliculus, and accessory optic system (AOS). In contrast, in the remaining region, here named the pan-ventronasal domain, SPIG1-positive cells form a regular mosaic and project exclusively to the medial terminal nucleus (MTN) of the AOS that mediates the optokinetic nystagmus as early as P1. Their dendrites costratify with ON cholinergic amacrine strata in the inner plexiform layer as early as P3. These findings suggest that these SPIG1-positive cells are the ON direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Moreover, the MTN-projecting cells in the pan-ventronasal domain are apparently composed of two distinct but interdependent regular mosaics depending on the presence or absence of SPIG1, indicating that they comprise two functionally distinct subtypes of the ON DSGCs. The formation of the regular mosaic appears to be commenced at the end of the prenatal stage and completed through the peak period of the cell death at P6. SPIG1 will thus serve as a useful molecular marker for future studies on the development and function of ON DSGCs."
https://openalex.org/W2038109864,"The supply of transfusable red blood cells (RBCs) is not sufficient in many countries. If erythroid cell lines able to produce transfusable RBCs in vitro were established, they would be valuable resources. However, such cell lines have not been established. To evaluate the feasibility of establishing useful erythroid cell lines, we attempted to establish such cell lines from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.We developed a robust method to obtain differentiated cell lines following the induction of hematopoietic differentiation of mouse ES cells and established five independent hematopoietic cell lines using the method. Three of these lines exhibited characteristics of erythroid cells. Although their precise characteristics varied, each of these lines could differentiate in vitro into more mature erythroid cells, including enucleated RBCs. Following transplantation of these erythroid cells into mice suffering from acute anemia, the cells proliferated transiently, subsequently differentiated into functional RBCs, and significantly ameliorated the acute anemia. In addition, we did not observe formation of any tumors following transplantation of these cells.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show the feasibility of establishing erythroid cell lines able to produce mature RBCs. Considering the number of human ES cell lines that have been established so far, the intensive testing of a number of these lines for erythroid potential may allow the establishment of human erythroid cell lines similar to the mouse erythroid cell lines described here. In addition, our results strongly suggest the possibility of establishing useful cell lines committed to specific lineages other than hematopoietic progenitors from human ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010679521,"Cerebellar basket cells inhibit postsynaptic Purkinje cells in a rapid and precise manner. To investigate the mechanisms of transmitter release underlying this rapid inhibition, Ca(2+) uncaging was employed to measure the intracellular Ca(2+) dependence of transmitter release and the kinetics of synaptic vesicle pool transitions in immature basket cell synapses at room temperature. Vesicle release properties distinct from those previously observed at excitatory synapses were seen, including a relatively high intracellular Ca(2+) sensitivity of vesicle fusion, rapid vesicle pool mobilization with few reluctant vesicles, and vesicle replenishment driven by unusually high Ca(2+) levels from both local and residual Ca(2+) sources during action potential trains. These results suggest that inhibitory basket cell synapses are optimized for rapid and precise temporal and spatial Ca(2+) coordination of synaptic vesicle fusion and replenishment, which may contribute to the unique physiology of inhibitory synaptic transmission, including phasic release during action potential trains and tonic release by residual intracellular Ca(2+)."
https://openalex.org/W2002118607,"Intact LINE-1 elements are the only retrotransposons encoded by the human genome known to be capable of autonomous replication. Numerous cases of genetic disease have been traced to gene disruptions caused by LINE-1 retrotransposition events in germ-line cells. In addition, genomic instability resulting from LINE-1 retrotransposition in somatic cells has been proposed as a contributing factor to oncogenesis and to cancer progression. LINE-1 element activity may also play a role in normal physiology.Using an in vitro LINE-1 retrotransposition reporter assay, we evaluated the abilities of several antiretroviral compounds to inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition. The nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTIs): stavudine, zidovudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and lamivudine all inhibited LINE-1 retrotransposition with varying degrees of potencies, while the non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine showed no effect.Our data demonstrates the ability for nRTIs to suppress LINE-1 retrotransposition. This is immediately applicable to studies aimed at examining potential roles for LINE-1 retrotransposition in physiological processes. In addition, our data raises novel safety considerations for nRTIs based on their potential to disrupt physiological processes involving LINE-1 retrotransposition."
https://openalex.org/W2026453191,"World records (WR) in sports illustrate the ultimate expression of human integrated muscle biology, through speed or strength performances. Analysis and prediction of man's physiological boundaries in sports and impact of external (historical or environmental) conditions on WR occurrence are subject to scientific controversy. Based on the analysis of 3263 WR established for all quantifiable official contests since the first Olympic Games, we show here that WR progression rate follows a piecewise exponential decaying pattern with very high accuracy (mean adjusted r2 values = 0.91±0.08 (s.d.)). Starting at 75% of their estimated asymptotic values in 1896, WR have now reached 99%, and, present conditions prevailing, half of all WR will not be improved by more than 0,05% in 2027. Our model, which may be used to compare future athletic performances or assess the impact of international antidoping policies, forecasts that human species' physiological frontiers will be reached in one generation. This will have an impact on the future conditions of athlete training and on the organization of competitions. It may also alter the Olympic motto and spirit."
https://openalex.org/W2012940693,"Background Acne vulgaris afflicts more than fifty million people in the United State and the severity of this disorder is associated with the immune response to Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Systemic therapies for acne target P. acnes using antibiotics, or target the follicle with retinoids such as isotretinoin. The latter systemic treatment is highly effective but also carries a risk of side effects including immune imbalance, hyperlipidemia, and teratogenicity. Despite substantial research into potential new therapies for this common disease, vaccines against acne vulgaris are not yet available. Methods and Findings Here we create an acne vaccine targeting a cell wall-anchored sialidase of P. acnes. The importance of sialidase to disease pathogenesis is shown by treatment of a human sebocyte cell line with recombinant sialidase that increased susceptibility to P. acnes cytotoxicity and adhesion. Mice immunized with sialidase elicit a detectable antibody; the anti-sialidase serum effectively neutralized the cytotoxicity of P. acnes in vitro and P. acnes-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in human sebocytes. Furthermore, the sialidase-immunized mice provided protective immunity against P. acnes in vivo as this treatment blocked an increase in ear thickness and release of pro-inflammatory macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2) cytokine. Conclusions Results indicated that acne vaccines open novel therapeutic avenues for acne vulgaris and other P. acnes-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2042370745,"Lactate has long been regarded as an end product of anaerobic energy production and its fate in cerebral metabolism has not been precisely delineated. In this report, we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of a human astrocytic cell line (CCF-STTG1) to consume lactate and to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. 13C-NMR and HPLC analyses aided in the identification of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cyle metabolites and ATP in the astrocytic mitochondria incubated with lactate. Oxamate, an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), abolished mitochondrial lactate consumption. Electrophoretic and fluorescence microscopic analyses helped localize LDH in the mitochondria. Taken together, this study implicates lactate as an important contributor to ATP metabolism in the brain, a finding that may significantly change our notion of how this important organ manipulates its energy budget."

Enabled by an extensive proteome database developed over six years, we have experimentally verified the expression of proteins predicted from genomic ortholog comparisons among 17 environmental and pathogenic bacteria. More exclusive relationships were observed among the expressed protein content of phenotypically related bacteria, which is indicative of the specific lifestyles associated with these organisms. Although genomic studies can establish relative orthologous relationships among a set of bacteria and propose a set of ancestral genes, our proteomics study establishes expressed lifestyle differences among conserved genes and proposes a set of expressed ancestral traits."
https://openalex.org/W2089759898,"Background The lactogenic hormones prolactin (PRL) and placental lactogens (PL) play central roles in reproduction and mammary development. Their actions are mediated via binding to PRL receptor (PRLR), highly expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), yet their impact on adipocyte function and metabolism remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings PRLR knockout (KO) newborn mice were phenotypically characterized in terms of thermoregulation and their BAT differentiation assayed for gene expression studies. Derived brown preadipocyte cell lines were established to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in PRL signaling on BAT function. Here, we report that newborn mice lacking PRLR have hypotrophic BAT depots that express low levels of adipocyte nuclear receptor PPARγ2, its coactivator PGC-1α, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and the β3 adrenoceptor, reducing mouse viability during cold challenge. Immortalized PRLR KO preadipocytes fail to undergo differentiation into mature adipocytes, a defect reversed by reintroduction of PRLR. That the effects of the lactogens in BAT are at least partly mediated by Insulin-like Growth Factor-2 (IGF-2) is supported by: i) a striking reduction in BAT IGF-2 expression in PRLR KO mice and in PRLR-deficient preadipocytes; ii) induction of cellular IGF-2 expression by PRL through JAK2/STAT5 pathway activation; and iii) reversal of defective differentiation in PRLR KO cells by exogenous IGF-2. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that the lactogens act in concert with IGF-2 to control brown adipocyte differentiation and growth. Given the prominent role of brown adipose tissue during the perinatal period, our results identified prolactin receptor signaling as a major player and a potential therapeutic target in protecting newborn mammals against hypothermia."
https://openalex.org/W2107877455,"Chemical modification to improve biopharmaceutical properties, especially oral absorption and bioavailability, is a common strategy employed by pharmaceutical chemists. The approach often employs a simple structural modification and utilizes ubiquitous endogenous esterases as activation enzymes, although such enzymes are often unidentified. This report describes the crystal structure and specificity of a novel activating enzyme for valacyclovir and valganciclovir. Our structural insights show that human valacyclovirase has a unique binding mode and specificity for amino acid esters. Biochemical data demonstrate that the enzyme hydrolyzes esters of α-amino acids exclusively and displays a broad specificity spectrum for the aminoacyl moiety similar to tricorn-interacting aminopeptidase F1. Crystal structures of the enzyme, two mechanistic mutants, and a complex with a product analogue, when combined with biochemical analysis, reveal the key determinants for substrate recognition; that is, a flexible and mostly hydrophobic acyl pocket, a localized negative electrostatic potential, a large open leaving group-accommodating groove, and a pivotal acidic residue, Asp-123, after the nucleophile Ser-122. This is the first time that a residue immediately after the nucleophile has been found to have its side chain directed into the substrate binding pocket and play an essential role in substrate discrimination in serine hydrolases. These results as well as a phylogenetic analysis establish that the enzyme functions as a specific α-amino acid ester hydrolase.

VACVase catalyzes the hydrolytic activation of two clinically important antiviral nucleoside prodrugs, valacyclovir and valganciclovir (Fig. 1a), resulting in l-valine and their corresponding active drugs acyclovir and ganciclovir. Both acyclovir and ganciclovir are polar molecules and are poorly absorbed with low oral bioavailability of 10-20% (8de Miranda P. Blum M.R. J. Antimicrob.

Given the potential importance of VACVase as a target for oral prodrug design, especially for improved oral absorption of polar candidate drugs, the molecular characteristics of this esterase, including its specificity, classification, and mechanisms of catalysis and recognition, need to be elucidated. In the present report our specificity analysis indicated that VACVase is a highly specific α-amino acid ester hydrolase. Crystal structures of the enzyme, two mutants, and a complex with a product analogue combined with biochemical data revealed the key elements in catalysis and substrate recognition. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of VACVase—The gene encoding the mature form of human VACVase (NCB accession number NM_004332, first 60 coding nucleotides excluded) was amplified by standard PCR methodology using the plasmid pET-BPHL (7Kim I.

The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and KpnI and inserted into the corresponding site of the expression vector pET17b. After ligation, the plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli NovaBlue cells. Sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the desired gene insert, pET17b-VACVase, was transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were then grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Protein expression was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm). Purification of VACVase was performed at 4 °C with all buffers containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell pellets were suspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (buffer A), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged (25,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant was loaded onto an S strong cation exchange column and washed with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm reached the base line. VACVase was eluted with an isocratic flow of 90 mm NaCl in buffer A. (NH4)2SO4 was added to the pooled active fractions to a final concentration of 25%. The resulting protein solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column equilibrated with 25% (NH4)2SO4 in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and eluted with a reverse linear gradient of 25% to 0% (NH4)2SO4 in the same buffer over 8 column volumes. Fractions containing VACVase were collected, dialyzed against 2 liters of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for 16 h, and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. The selenomethionine form of the enzyme was expressed in the methionine auxotroph E. coli B834(DE3) cells grown in MOPS minimal medium supplemented with 75 mg/liter of dl-selenomethionine. The protein was purified by the same procedures used for the native enzyme except that all buffers contained 5 mm dithiothreitol. Generation of VACVase Mutants—Point mutations were introduced by PCR using a pair of complementary mutagenic primers. Oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation were synthesized by Invitrogen. The methylated wild-type plasmid template pET-VACVase was digested using the DpnI endonuclease, and the nicked plasmid DNA containing the desired mutation was transformed into NovaBlue competent cells. Sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutants were expressed and purified using the same procedures as for the wild-type enzyme. Enzyme Assays—The standard esterase activity against valacyclovir was measured with 4 mm valacyclovir in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in a 300-μl reaction mixture at 37 °C. After preincubation for 3 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and quenched with an equal volume of 10% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The initial rate was determined by measuring product appearance by HPLC. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the release of 1 μmol of acyclovir per min at 37 °C. The effect of nonenzymatic hydrolysis of substrates was corrected through control reactions. Measurements were carried out in triplicates. Various other esters were tested as potential substrates of VACVase using the standard esterase assay method unless otherwise stated. The initial rate was determined by measuring substrate disappearance by HPLC. The concentration of the ester compounds was 4 mm unless otherwise specified. The concentrations of substrates or products in the assay mixture were determined using a Waters HPLC system on a reverse phase column with water and acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) as the mobile phase and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples were eluted with either a linear gradient or an isocratic flow. The UV absorbance of the column effluent was monitored at 254 nm for acyclovir, 257 nm for the substrates containing a benzyl group, 270 nm for l-Asn p-nitrobenzyl ester, 275 nm for l-Tyr benzyl ester, 278 nm for l-Trp methyl ester, and 220 nm for l-Met methyl ester. Crystallization and Data Collection—Protein crystals were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. 2 μl of VACVase solution was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 12-16% PEG4000, 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7.0), and 0.1 m MnSO4 and equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution. Selenomethionine-substituted proteins were crystallized similarly with 5 mm dithiothreitol in the reservoir solution. Crystals were cryoprotected by soaking for 1 min in a cryo solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol in reservoir solution followed by flash-cooling under liquid nitrogen. To obtain the VACVase-l-tyrosine amide (TYC) complex, crystals of native VACVase were transferred to a stabilizing solution containing 18% PEG4000, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.0), and 60 mm MnSO4 and then soaked with 50 mm TYC for 10 h before cryoprotection. Synchrotron data collection was performed at 100 K under a nitrogen stream on a Mar165 CCD detector at COM-CAT or a Mar300 CCD detector at GM/CA-CAT of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected to 2.05 Å at wavelengths corresponding to the inflection point (λi), high energy remote (λh), low energy remote (λl), and peak point (λp) of the selenium x-ray absorbance spectrum from a single crystal of selenomethionine-labeled VACVase.

Ogata C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Five selenium sites expected for one VACVase molecule were found using the anomalous difference Patterson method as implemented in CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Heavy atom parameters were refined, and multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phases were calculated and improved by density modification with CNS. The high quality experimental map and the known selenium sites allowed unambiguous tracing of the protein backbone and most of the side chains using O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The initial model of selenomethionine VACVase was used as a starting point for the refinement against the native data set using CNS, with the quality of the model cross-validated by using 5% of randomly selected test set. The structures of S122A and D123N mutants and the VACVase-TYC complex were determined by molecular replacement with CNS using the structure of native VACVase as the search model. TYC coordinates, topology, and parameter files were modified from those of l-tyrosine obtained from the HICUP server. The stereochemistry of the final models was analyzed with PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Substrate Specificity of VACVase—VACVase is synthesized in the cell as a precursor protein with a leader sequence of 20 residues (7Kim I. Chu X.Y.

The mature form of human VACVase (residues 21-274) was overexpressed, purified, and used in this study. We first carried out detailed analysis on its substrate specificity. The ability of VACVase to hydrolyze not only valacyclovir and valganciclovir but also the amino acid ester prodrugs of a range of nucleoside analogues prompted us to examine the role of an α-amino group in the substrates. As shown in Table 2, the enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed benzyl esters of l-Phe and l-Ala; however, its activity toward β-amino acid esters was 3 orders of magnitude lower than toward the corresponding α-amino acid esters (barely measurable). Furthermore, the enzyme can neither hydrolyze benzyl esters with corresponding α-hydroxyl acyl moieties (benzyl (S)-(-)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate and l-lactic acid benzyl ester) nor hydrolyze benzyl esters with aliphatic or aromatic acyl moieties (3-phenylpropionic acid ethyl ester and benzyl propionate). Additionally, the enzyme exhibited no activity for esters with a blocked α-amino group (N-acetyl-l-Phe ethyl ester), further supporting that the α-amino group is required for activity.TABLE 2Substrate specificity of human VACVaseCompoundSpecific activityUnits/mgRequirement for the α-amino groupl-Phe benzyl ester358.3 ± 34.83-Amino-3-phenylpropionic acid ethyl ester0.6 ± 0.2Benzyl (S)-(—)-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionateaAssayed at 2 mm.−b−, No detectable activity.3-Phenylpropionic acid ethyl esteraAssayed at 2 mm.−N-Acetyl-l-Phe ethyl ester−l-Ala benzyl ester1367.7 ± 94.3β-Ala benzyl ester1.8 ± 0.3l-Lactic acid benzyl ester−Benzyl propionateaAssayed at 2 mm.−Specificity towards the amino acyl groupValacyclovir103.7 ± 2.7l-Ala benzyl ester1367.7 ± 94.3l-Gly benzyl ester849.4 ± 25.1l-Pro benzyl ester5148.4 ± 215.5l-Leu benzyl ester635.0 ± 23.9l-Val benzyl ester156.3 ± 7.4l-Met methyl ester156.2 ± 12.3l-Phe benzyl ester358.3 ± 34.8l-Tyr benzyl ester41.4 ± 0.9l-Trp methyl ester35.3 ± 2.0l-Ser benzyl ester484.3 ± 30.0l-Asn p-nitrobenzyl ester−l-Asp benzyl ester−Specificity towards the leaving groupl-Phe benzyl ester358.3 ± 34.8l-Phe ethyl ester75.3 ± 3.1l-Phe t-butyl ester−a Assayed at 2 mm.b −, No detectable activity. Open table in a new tab To gain further insight into the specificity of VACVase for the acyl moiety, a range of α-amino acid esters (mostly benzyl esters) were investigated (Table 2). Surprisingly, the enzyme showed fairly broad specificity against the amino acid side chains. Of the amino acid esters examined, the l-Pro ester was most efficiently hydrolyzed followed by the small amino acid esters, l-Gly and l-Ala esters. The hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid esters were also efficiently hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Compared with the l-Phe ester, the activities for the l-Tyr and l-Trp esters were significantly lower. Interestingly, the l-Asn ester is not a substrate for the enzyme, in contrast to the l-Ser ester, which was hydrolyzed very efficiently. Furthermore, the enzyme showed no activity for the ester with a negatively charged amino acid side chain, l-Asp benzyl ester. Previously, it has been shown that VACVase hydrolyzed the 5′ l-Val ester of floxuridine more efficiently than the 3′ l-Val ester, suggesting that the enzyme prefers a primary alcohol leaving group to a secondary one (17Kim I. Song X. Vig B.S. Mittal S. Shin H.C. Lorenzi P.J. Amidon G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 1: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To gain more insight into the specificity for the alcohol leaving group, three l-Phe esters were tested (Table 2). Compared with the l-Phe benzyl ester, the activity for the l-Phe ethyl ester was significantly lower, whereas the tertiary alcohol ester of l-Phe, l-Phe t-butyl ester, was not a substrate for the enzyme. Thus, the enzyme has a preference for a primary alcohol leaving group but appears to have no major constraints on the nature of the primary alcohol as amino acid esters with various leaving groups ranging from the small methyl group to the larger nucleoside analogues are all efficiently hydrolyzed by the enzyme. These specificity analyses demonstrated that VACVase is a specific α-amino acid ester hydrolase that prefers small, hydrophobic, and aromatic side chains and does not have a stringent requirement for the leaving group other than preferring a primary alcohol. Overall Structure of VACVase—VACVase, the S122A and D123N mutants, and its complex with the product analogue TYC were all crystallized in the space group P62 with one protein molecule per asymmetric unit. The native structure was determined to 1.75 Å by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method (Table 1), and the other structures were determined by molecular replacement. These various structures have essentially the same conformation, with their Cα atoms superposing to within 0.3 Å. VACVase contains 8 β-strands and 13 α-helices, which form two domains, an α/β hydrolase domain and a cap domain (Fig. 2, a-c). The α/β hydrolase domain consists of a central eight-stranded, twisted β sheet flanked by 5 α-helices. The cap domain is inserted between β6 and αD, and “sits” on top of the loop regions of the α/β hydrolase domain, mimicking a cap. It consists of 3 helices, with helices H1 and H3 in antiparallel orientation and helix H2 oriented ∼90° to H1 and H3. Between the two domains lies a cavity system containing a cave-like pocket with a single opening and a large open groove extending from the pocket mouth (Fig. 2b). Residues in the α/β hydrolase domain, especially those forming the central β sheet, exhibit lower B-factors compared with the cap domain, consistent with the function of this domain in providing a stable structural frame for the catalytic machinery. The relatively high B-factors of the cap domain suggest that it is more flexible, which is required for its function in substrate recognition as observed in other α/β hydrolases (18Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 26Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J.

Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) revealed dozens of other α/β hydrolases as structural homologues, of which 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase (BphD) from Rhodococcus sp. (28Nandhagopal N. Yamada A. Hatta T. Masai E. Fukuda M. Mitsui Y. Senda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is the closest, with a root mean square deviation of 2.8 Å over 230 aligned Cα atoms. BphD is involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds in the meta-cleavage pathway (28Nandhagopal N. Yamada A. Hatta T. Masai E. Fukuda M. Mitsui Y. Senda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is capable of breaking a C-C bond. Another interesting homologue is the tricorn-interacting aminopeptidase F1 (29Goettig P. Groll M. Kim J.S. Huber R. Brandstetter H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5343-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with a root mean square deviation of 3.1 Å over 193 aligned Cα atoms. The α/β hydrolase domains among the three enzymes are strikingly similar; however, their cap domains exhibit high structural variation (supplemental Fig. 1). A further DALI search with the Cα atoms of the VACVase cap domain did not result in any significant structural homologue, suggesting that the cap domain has a novel fold. The Crystallographic Dimer and Metal Ions—A notable feature of VACVase is its oligomeric state and the associated metal ions observed in the crystal structure. The enzyme appears to be a dimer formed between two crystallographic symmetry-related protomers and is held together by close symmetric interactions of residues from helices G3, αD, αB, and the loops between helices H3 and G3 and helices G3 and αD (supplemental Fig. 2a). The dimer interface buries a surface area of 1046 Å2 (5% of the total surface of the dimer) and is not contiguous. In fact, the interface interactions are mostly polar, involving hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, with the cavities of the interface filled with water molecules (supplemental Fig. 2, b and c). An interesting feature of the dimer interface is a metal ion located on the 2-fold axis. This ion is shared between the two monomers and is coordinated by two symmetry-related Asp residues (Asp-204) from each monomer. It is further coordinated by four water molecules clearly observed in the electron density map (supplemental Fig. 2b). Initially the metal ion in the dimer interface was built as a manganese ion since it is a component of the crystallization solution. Upon refinement, however, Mn2+ displayed a negative difference electron density peak. Replacing the metal to Mg2+ eliminated the negative peak. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of a Mn2+ cation with fractional occupancy, several lines of evidence suggest that a Mg2+ cation is more reasonable interpretation. The refined bond lengths between the ion and its coordinating oxygen atoms (2.09, 2.04, and 2.05 Å) are similar to the average values calculated from crystal structures of magnesium-containing proteins in the Protein Data Bank and small molecules in the Cambridge Structural Data base (30Harding M.M.

Previous studies indicate that dLGN interneurons inhibit TC neurons by releasing GABA from both axons and dendrites. However, the mechanisms controlling GABA release are poorly understood. Here, using simultaneous whole-cell recordings from interneurons and TC neurons and two-photon calcium imaging, we find that synchronous activation of multiple retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) triggers sodium spikes that propagate throughout interneuron axons and dendrites, and calcium spikes that invade dendrites but not axons. These distinct modes of interneuron firing can trigger both a rapid and a sustained component of inhibition onto TC neurons. Our studies suggest that active conductances make LGN interneurons flexible circuit-elements that can shift their spatial and temporal properties of GABA release in response to coincident activation of functionally related subsets of RGCs."
https://openalex.org/W2049654621,"The objectives of this non-randomized, non-blinded, dose-escalating Phase I clinical trial were to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of ICC-1132 formulated with Alhydrogel (aluminum hydroxide) in 51 healthy, malaria-naive adults aged 18 to 45 years. ICC-1132 (Malariavax) is a recombinant, virus-like particle malaria vaccine comprised of hepatitis core antigen engineered to express the central repeat regions from Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein containing an immunodominant B [(NANP)3] epitope, an HLA-restricted CD4 (NANPNVDPNANP) epitope and a universal T cell epitope (T*) (amino acids 326—345, NF54 isolate). We assessed an Alhydrogel (aluminum hydroxide)-adjuvanted vaccine formulation at three ICC-1132 dose levels, each injected intramuscularly (1.0 mL) on study days 0, 56 and 168. A saline vaccine formulation was found to be unstable after prolonged storage and this formulation was subsequently removed from the study. Thirty-two volunteers were followed for one year. Local and systemic adverse clinical events were measured and immune responses to P. falciparum and hepatitis B virus core antigens were determined utilizing the following assays: IgG and IgM ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence against P. falciparum sporozoites, circumsporozoite precipitin (CSP) and transgenic sporozoite neutralization assays. Cellular responses were measured by proliferation and IL-2 assays. Local and systemic reactions were similarly mild and well tolerated between dose cohorts. Depending on the ICC-1132 vaccine concentration, 95 to 100% of volunteers developed antibody responses to the ICC-1132 immunogen and HBc after two injections; however, only 29—75% and 29—63% of volunteers, respectively, developed malaria-specific responses measured by the malaria repeat synthetic peptide ELISA and IFA; 2 of 8 volunteers had positive reactions in the CSP assay. Maximal transgenic sporozoite neutralization assay inhibition was 54%. Forty-seven to seventy-five percent demonstrated T cell proliferation in response to ICC-1132 or to recombinant circumsporozoite protein (rCS) NF-54 isolate. This candidate malaria vaccine was well tolerated, but the vaccine formulation was poorly immunogenic. The vaccine may benefit from a more powerful adjuvant to improve immunogenicity.

https://openalex.org/W1977532365,"Background In the Drosophila germ line, repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) ensure genomic stability by silencing endogenous transposable elements. This RNA silencing involves small RNAs of 26-30 nucleotides that are mainly produced from the antisense strand and function through the Piwi protein. Piwi belongs to the subclass of the Argonaute family of RNA interference effector proteins, which are expressed in the germline and in surrounding somatic tissues of the reproductive apparatus. In addition to this germ-line expression, Piwi has also been implicated in diverse functions in somatic cells. Principal Findings Here, we show that two LTR retrotransposons from Drosophila melanogaster, ZAM and Idefix, are silenced by an RNA silencing pathway that has characteristics of the rasiRNA pathway and that specifically recognizes and destroys the sense-strand RNAs of the retrotransposons. This silencing depends on Piwi in the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. Interestingly, this silencing is active in all the somatic tissues examined from embryos to adult flies. In these somatic cells, while the silencing still involves the strict recognition of sense-strand transcripts, it displays the marked difference of being independent of the Piwi protein. Finally, we present evidence that in all the tissues examined, the repression is controlled by the heterochromatic COM locus. Conclusion Our data shed further light on the silencing mechanism that acts to target Drosophila LTR retrotransposons in somatic cells throughout fly development. They demonstrate that different RNA silencing pathways are involved in ovarian versus other somatic tissues, since Piwi is necessary for silencing in the former tissues but is dispensable in the latter. They further demonstrate that these pathways are controlled by the heterochromatic COM locus which ensures the overall protection of Drosophila against the detrimental effects of random retrotransposon mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1969351946,"Mitochondrial NAD(+)-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are key regulators of flux through biosynthetic and oxidative pathways in response to cellular energy levels. Here we present the first structures of a eukaryotic member of this enzyme family, the allosteric, hetero-octameric, NAD(+)-specific IDH from yeast in three forms: 1) without ligands, 2) with bound analog citrate, and 3) with bound citrate + AMP. The structures reveal the molecular basis for ligand binding to homologous but distinct regulatory and catalytic sites positioned at the interfaces between IDH1 and IDH2 subunits and define pathways of communication between heterodimers and heterotetramers in the hetero-octamer. Disulfide bonds observed at the heterotetrameric interfaces in the unliganded IDH hetero-octamer are reduced in the ligand-bound forms, suggesting a redox regulatory mechanism that may be analogous to the ""on-off"" regulation of non-allosteric bacterial IDHs via phosphorylation. The results strongly suggest that eukaryotic IDH enzymes are exquisitely tuned to ensure that allosteric activation occurs only when concentrations of isocitrate are elevated."
https://openalex.org/W2032700586,"Background The Mitotic Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (MSAC) is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that ensures the correct segregation of chromosomes by restraining cell cycle progression from entering anaphase until all chromosomes have made proper bipolar attachments to the mitotic spindle. Its malfunction can lead to cancer. Principle Findings We have constructed and validated for the human MSAC mechanism an in silico dynamical model, integrating 11 proteins and complexes. The model incorporates the perspectives of three central control pathways, namely Mad1/Mad2 induced Cdc20 sequestering based on the Template Model, MCC formation, and APC inhibition. Originating from the biochemical reactions for the underlying molecular processes, non-linear ordinary differential equations for the concentrations of 11 proteins and complexes of the MSAC are derived. Most of the kinetic constants are taken from literature, the remaining four unknown parameters are derived by an evolutionary optimization procedure for an objective function describing the dynamics of the APC:Cdc20 complex. MCC:APC dissociation is described by two alternatives, namely the “Dissociation” and the “Convey” model variants. The attachment of the kinetochore to microtubuli is simulated by a switching parameter silencing those reactions which are stopped by the attachment. For both, the Dissociation and the Convey variants, we compare two different scenarios concerning the microtubule attachment dependent control of the dissociation reaction. Our model is validated by simulation of ten perturbation experiments. Conclusion Only in the controlled case, our models show MSAC behaviour at meta- to anaphase transition in agreement with experimental observations. Our simulations revealed that for MSAC activation, Cdc20 is not fully sequestered; instead APC is inhibited by MCC binding."

Human phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) has a similar sequence (ABS-1) in its N-terminal region. In the present study, we found that ALG-2 interacts with PLSCR3 expressed in HEK293 cells in a Ca2+-dependent manner by co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused ALG-2 and an overlay assay using biotin-labeled ALG-2. The GST fusion protein of an alternatively spliced isoform of ALG-2, GST-ALG-2ΔGF122, pulled down green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused PLSCR3 but not GFP Alix. Deletion of a region containing ABS-1 was not sufficient to abrogate the binding. A second ALG-2-binding site (ABS-2) was essential for interaction with ALG-2ΔGF122. Real-time interaction analyses with a surface plasmon resonance biosensor using synthetic oligopeptides and recombinant proteins corroborated direct Ca2+-dependent binding of ABS-1 to ALG-2 and that of ABS-2 to ALG-2 as well as to ALG-2ΔGF122. The sequence of ABS-2 contains multiple prolines and two phenylalanines, among which Phe49 was found to be critical, because its substitution with Ala or Tyr caused a loss of binding ability by pulldown assays using oligopeptide-immobilized beads. ALG-2-interacting proteins were classified into two groups based on binding ability to ALG-2ΔGF122: (i) isoform-non-interactive (ABS-1) types, including Alix, annexin A7, annexin A11, and TSG101 and (ii) isoform-interactive (ABS-2) types including PLSCR3, PLSCR4 and Sec31A. GST-pulldown assays using single amino acid-substituted ALG-2 mutants revealed differences in binding specificities between the two groups, suggesting structural flexibility in ALG-2-ligand complex formation.

The sequence of ABS-2 contains multiple prolines and two phenylalanines, among which Phe49 was found to be critical, because its substitution with Ala or Tyr caused a loss of binding ability by pulldown assays using oligopeptide-immobilized beads. ALG-2-interacting proteins were classified into two groups based on binding ability to ALG-2ΔGF122: (i) isoform-non-interactive (ABS-1) types, including Alix, annexin A7, annexin A11, and TSG101 and (ii) isoform-interactive (ABS-2) types including PLSCR3, PLSCR4 and Sec31A. GST-pulldown assays using single amino acid-substituted ALG-2 mutants revealed differences in binding specificities between the two groups, suggesting structural flexibility in ALG-2-ligand complex formation. ALG-2 is a 22-kDa calcium-binding protein possessing five serially repetitive EF-hand motifs, and it belongs to the penta-EF-hand (PEF) 2The abbreviations used are:PEFpenta-EF-handABSALG-2-binding sitebio-biotin-labeledBSAbovine serum albuminCBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione-S-transferasePLSCRphospholipid scramblaseSPRsurface plasmon resonancepAbpolyclonal antibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyFc1-2, -3, Flow cell nos. 1–3TBSTris-buffered salineCaMcalmodulin. protein family (1Maki M.

Acta. 2002; 1600: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Based on differences in the primary structures of EF1, mammalian PEF proteins are classified into two groups: group I (ALG-2 and peflin) and group II (typical calpains, including the small subunit, sorcin and grancalcin) (2Maki M. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Ohkouchi S. Shibata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Homologs of group I PEF proteins have been found not only in vertebrates but also widely in eukaryotes, including lower animals, plants, fungi, and protists (3Ohkouchi S. Nishio K. Maeda M. Hitomi K. Adachi H. Maki M. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, group II PEF proteins are restricted to the animal kingdom and are thought to have diverged during the evolution of animals (4Jekely G. Friedrich P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ALG-2 forms a homodimer or a heterodimer with peflin through their EF5 regions (5Kitaura Y. Matsumoto S. Satoh H. Hitomi K. Maki M.

Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), ALG-2-deficient mice develop normally with no obvious abnormalities in the immune system (8Jang I.K. Hu R. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Gu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4094-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, potential physiological roles of ALG-2 in regulation of ER-stress-induced apoptosis (9Rao R.V. Poksay K.S. Castro-Obregon S. Schilling B. Row R.H. del Rio G. Gibson B.W. Ellerby H.M.

This cytoplasmic 95-kDa protein is now recognized as a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular functions, including endosomal sorting, retrovirus budding, actin cytoskeleton assembly, signal transduction, and apoptosis (see Refs. 15Dikic I.

We and others previously identified an ALG-2-binding site in the C-terminal proline-rich region in Alix (19Shibata H. Yamada K. Mizuno T. Yorikawa C. Takahashi H. Satoh H. Kitaura Y. Maki M. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Trioulier Y. Torch S. Blot B. Cristina N. Chatellard-Causse C. Verna J.M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2046-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Results of analyses of amino acid-substituted mutants and deletion mutants of Alix suggested that a potential polyproline II-helix containing four tandem PXY repeats is an ALG-2-interacting core motif (801-PPYPTYPGYPGY-812), in which Ala substitutions of either all four Pro or Tyr residues and Phe substitutions of all four Tyr residues abolished the binding ability (19Shibata H. Yamada K. Mizuno T. Yorikawa C. Takahashi H. Satoh H. Kitaura Y. Maki M. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Generally, Pro-rich regions often serve as domains for either specific protein-protein interaction or rapid but nonspecific interaction via their sticky arms extending out from the rest of the protein molecules (21Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 22Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Both sorcin and ALG-2 bind to the presumably extended or disordered N-terminal Pro-rich regions of annexins A7 and A11 (23Brownawell A.M. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22182-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Satoh H. Shibata H. Nakano Y. Kitaura Y. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Satoh H. Nakano Y. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). While exact binding sites for ALG-2 have not been determined yet, the N-terminal ∼30 residues that are rich in Pro, Gly and Tyr but have no charged residues in annexin A11 are sufficient for binding to sorcin (23Brownawell A.M. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22182-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Neither annexin A7 nor annexin A11, however, possesses the four tandem PXY repeats found in Alix. Instead, both annexins have GYPP repeats in sorcin-binding regions. One conspicuous difference between sorcin and ALG-2 for annexin A7 binding is the requirement of N-terminal non-PEF regions: the N-terminal domain of sorcin is essential (26Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Mattei B. Noegel A.A. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but that of ALG-2 is dispensable (25Satoh H. Nakano Y. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ALG-2 binding motifs remain to be clarified. In this study, we found that phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) is a novel ALG-2-interacting protein, and we identified two binding sites, designated ABS (ALG-2-binding site)-1 and ABS-2, in its N-terminal Pro-rich region. Although ABS-1 resembles the Alix PXY-repeat motif, ABS-2 does not conform to the canonical sequence and does not contain Tyr. ABS-2 possesses a unique binding property: it interacts with an alternatively spliced ALG-2 isoform, ALG-2ΔGF122, and other single amino acid-substituted ALG-2 mutants, with which ABS-1 and Alix do not interact. An ABS-2-oligopeptide-immobilized column has been proved to be useful for rapid one-step affinity purification of untagged recombinant ALG-2 proteins, including ALG-2ΔGF122. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ALG-2-interacting proteins can be classified into two groups based on the binding ability to ALG-2ΔGF122. Differences in binding specificities to other ALG-2 mutants suggest structural flexibility in ALG-2-ligand complex formation. Materials—Untagged, biotin-tagged, and phosphorylated synthetic oligopeptides were obtained from Biosynthesis (Lewis-ville, TX). Rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (pAb) and anti-apoptosis inducing factor pAb were purchased from Abcam (#ab1998, Cambridge, UK). Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of anti-GFP (B2) and anti-annexin VII (A-1) and goat anti-annexin XI pAb (N-17) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse mAbs of anti-α-tubulin (clone DM1A), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and anti-Lamp-1 were from Sigma, Chemicon, and Pharmingen, respectively. Anti-TSG101 mAb (4A10) and anti-Sec31A mAb (clone 32) were from Gene Tex (San Antonio, TX) and BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), respectively. Streptavidin-peroxidase was obtained from Rockland Immunochemicals (Philadelphia, PA). Preparations of rabbit anti-ALG-2 pAb and anti-Alix pAb were described previously (27Maki M. Yamaguchi K.

Commun. 2007; 353: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Anti-PLSCR3 antiserum was raised in rabbits using GST-fused PLSCR3 N-terminal Pro-rich region protein as antigen. Sulfosuccinimidyl N-(d-biotinyl)-6-aminohexanoate was purchased from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan). Plasmid Constructions—Human cDNAs for PLSCR1, PLSCR3, and PLSCR4 were cloned from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech) (for PLSCR3) or a Human Fetus Marathon-Ready™ cDNA library (Clontech) (for PLSCR1 and PLSCR4) by the PCR method using a proofreading thermostable PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) (see supplemental materials). pGFP-Alix was described previously (29Katoh K.

Alanine-substituted mutants of GST-fused human ALG-2 at various amino acid residues were created by the PCR-based mutagenesis method (see supplemental materials). Construction of an Escherichia coli expression plasmid of N-terminally truncated ALG-2 that lacks the hydrophobic and Pro/Gly-rich region, pET3d-des3-23ALG-2 (previous name: pET3d-ALG-2ΔN23), was described previously (25Satoh H. Nakano Y. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the produced protein was re-named des3-23ALG-2 in this study. Construction of a plasmid for GST-fused protein of an alternatively spliced ALG-2 isoform that lacks Gly121-Phe122 (designated GST-ALG-2ΔGF122) was described previously (30Katoh K. Suzuki H. Terasawa Y. Mizuno T. Yasuda J. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other constructs are described in the supplemental materials. Establishment of PLSCR3-expressing Cell Line—A PLSCR3 cDNA fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of pIRES1neo (Clontech), and the resultant expression vector was used for transfection of HEK293 subcloned cells designated YS14 (28Shibata H. Suzuki H. Yoshida H. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). G418-resistant cells were isolated by cylinder cloning and further screened for constant expression of PLSCR3 by Western blotting using anti-PLSCR3 antibody. Subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation was performed essentially as described previously (28Shibata H. Suzuki H. Yoshida H. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GST-ALG-2 Pulldown, Bio-ALG-2 Overlay, and Co-immunoprecipitation—Pulldown assays using GST-ALG-2 and its mutant proteins were performed as described previously (28Shibata H. Suzuki H. Yoshida H. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Katoh K. Suzuki H. Terasawa Y. Mizuno T. Yasuda J. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using the cleared lysate of HEK293 cells untransfected or transfected with respective expression vectors of GFP-fused proteins. An overlay assay using bio-ALG-2 was carried out as described previously (30Katoh K. Suzuki H. Terasawa Y. Mizuno T. Yasuda J. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using the immunoprecipitates of anti-GFP pAb from the cleared lysate of HEK293 cells that had been transfected with pGFP-PLSCR3 or an empty pEGFP vector. Alternatively, immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence or absence of Ca2+, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-ALG-2 pAb essentially as described previously (19Shibata H. Yamada K. Mizuno T. Yorikawa C. Takahashi H. Satoh H. Kitaura Y. Maki M. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Specific conditions for incubation with antibodies are described in the supplemental materials. Pulldown Assay of des3-23ALG-2 with Mutant Oligopeptide-immobilized Sepharose Beads—Each synthetic oligopeptide (0.2 mg) dissolved in 0.1 ml of the coupling buffer (0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5 m NaCl) was immobilized to a 0.2-ml bed volume of NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A binding assay was performed by incubating 10 μl of beads in a total volume of 50 μl in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 10 μg each of des3-23ALG-2, bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, and α-lactalbumin by mixing with MicroMixer E-36 (Taitec, Japan) at room temperature for 30 min. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, and pelleted beads were washed with 0.4 ml of binding buffer three times. The unbound fraction (first supernatant) and bound fraction (beads) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) and relative amounts of proteins were estimated by densitometric analysis using the free imaging software (Scion Image Beta 4.02) available from Scion. Affinity Purification of Recombinant ALG-2 Proteins—Lys-tagged ABS-2 oligopeptide (k-ABS-2: kQVPAPAPGFALFP-SPGPVA; k, extraneous Lys for facilitating cross-linking) was immobilized to a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences). Affinity purification of recombinant ALG-2 proteins from E. coli was carried out by a method similar to that used for purification of recombinant PEF domain proteins of the calpain subunits (31Yang H.Q. Ma H. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18977-18984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Takano E. Ma H. Yang H.Q. Maki M. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with some modifications (supplemental materials). Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Real-time interaction analysis was performed at 25 °C using an SPR biosensor, BIAcore2000 system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). N-terminally biotin-labeled oligopeptides of ABS-1 (bio-ABS-1: bio-qGYAPSPPPPYPVTPGYPEPA; q, extraneous Gln for adjusting N-terminal residue with bio-ABS-2) and ABS-2 (bio-ABS-2: bio-QVPAPAPGFALFPSPGPVA) that had been dissolved in water (10 mg/ml) were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml with HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20), and each peptide was captured on flow cell no. 2 (Fc2) and no. 3 (Fc3) of a streptavidin (SA)-immobilized sensor chip, respectively, by running over the respective flow cell at the flow rate of 10 μl/min for 120 s. Flow cell no. 1 (Fc1) was used as a reference. For interaction analysis, the flow rate was maintained at 50 μl/min. A solution of analyte (full-length or truncated ALG-2 protein of either wild-type or ΔGF122 isoform) was diluted with HBS-CP (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.005% surfactant P20) to 100 nm and injected. After keeping the flow over the immobilized sensor surface for 180 s, the sensor surface was washed with the running buffer for 180 s. To regenerate the sensor surfaces after each measuring cycle, analytes were completely dissociated from the immobilized ligand by injecting 50 μl of HBS-EP supplemented with EDTA to 10 mm. For analysis of Ca2+ concentration dependence, HBS-P (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20) was used as a running buffer. Analytes, diluted with HBS-P, were adjusted to varying concentrations of CaCl2. COINJECT mode was used to avoid transient wash of the sensor surface with HBS-P after the end of analyte injection. Plate Assay of ALG-2-binding to Phosphorylated ABS-1 Oligopeptide—Varying amounts (11–183 pmol) of ABS-1 (KGYAPSPPPPYPVTPGYPEPA) and Thr21-phosphorylated ABS-1 (KGYAPSPPPPYPV-pT-PGYPEPA, ABS-1-pT) oligopeptides were dissolved in 0.1 ml of 100 mm Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.6) and immobilized to a 96-well Nunc Immobilizer™ Amino plate (Nunc A/S, Denmark) according to the provided instruction manual for 1 h at room temperature. The unreacted surface was inactivated with 10 mm ethanolamine (pH 8.3) for 1 h, followed by washing with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and blocking with TBS containing 3% BSA. Purified recombinant ALG-2 was labeled with biotin in vitro using sulfosuccinimidyl N-(d-biotinyl)-6-aminohexanoate (Biotin-AC5 Sulfo-OSu) as described previously (33Wormmeester J. Stiekema F. Groot C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A solution (0.1 ml) of 120 nm biotin-labeled ALG-2 (bio-ALG-2) in binding buffer TBS-C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA was added to the wells, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the wells had been washed with 0.3 ml of TBS-C containing 0.1% Tween 20, bound bio-ALG-2 was reacted with SA-peroxidase for 1 h. The wells were washed once with TBS-C containing 0.1% Tween 20 and three times with TBS-C. Colorimetric peroxidase reaction was carried out using 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine and 0.003% H2O2 in 0.1 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate-100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), and the reaction products were measured with a plate reader (BiotrakII reader, GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences) at 492 nm. PXY Repeat Sequence in the Pro-rich Region of PLSCR3—The ALG-2-binding sequence in Alix (Alix-ABS) contains four tandem repeats of PXY (Fig. 1). To identify novel ALG-2-binding proteins, we searched a human protein data base (SwissProt) with the BLAST program “Search for Short, Nearly Exact Matches” on the Internet (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) using PPYPTYPGYPGY (an essential sequence in Alix for efficient ALG-2 binding) as a query sequence. The top ten high score sequences were derived from the following proteins (scores and SwissProt accession numbers indicated in parentheses): PDCD6-interacting protein (Alix/AIP1/Hp95) (45.2, Q8WUM4), transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing protein 1 (RECS1 protein homolog) (30.3, Q969X1), annexin A11 (27.4, P50995), PLSCR3 (27.4, Q9NRY6), annexin A7 (25.7, P20073), homeobox protein Nkx-2.5 (25.7, P52952), NFATc4 (25.2, Q14934), EYA2 (25.2, O00167), TSG101 (24.8, Q99816), and SCAMP4 (24.8, Q969E2). In this study, we selected PLSCR3 as the most possible candidate protein for in vitro ALG-2 binding analyses because of the absence of a gap in the aligned PXY-repeat sequence (Fig. 1B). Analyses of Interaction between ALG-2 and PLSCR3—We performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay by overexpressing GFP-fused PLSCR3, GFP-Alix (positive control), and GFP (negative control), respectively, in HEK293 cells. The expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP pAb. As shown in Fig. 2A, specific bands corresponding to ALG-2 were detected with anti-ALG-2 pAb in the immunoprecipitates of GFP-Alix and GFP-PLSCR3 in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+ but not in the presence of a Ca2+-chelator, EGTA (2 mm). No ALG-2 bands were detected in the immunoprecipitates of GFP in either condition. In a separate experiment, we performed an overlay assay using biotin-labeled ALG-2 (bio-ALG-2) as a probe. As shown in Fig. 2B, the immunoprecipitate of GFP-PLSCR3, but not that of GFP, presented a specific band, suggesting a direct physical interaction between ALG-2 and PLSCR3. To investigate whether ALG-2 associates with endogenous PLSCR3, human lymphoma cell lines such as Raji and Jurkat and rat fat cells were first analyzed for expression of PLSCR3. Endogenous PLSCR3 protein, however, was not detected with our rabbit anti-PLSCR3 antiserum. Then, we established a PLSCR3-expressing HEK293 cell line (HEK293/Scr3) as shown in Fig. 2C. Using this stable cell line as an alternative source of endogenous PLSCR3, we performed subcellular fractionation by the differential centrifugation method to obtain PLSCR3-enriched fraction. Fig. 2D shows a representative result of the fractionation in the presence of 10 μm CaCl2 under incomplete cell disruption condition as indicated by the presence of anti-apoptosis inducing factor (mitochondrial inter-membrane space protein), Lamp-1 (late endosome/lysosome protein), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cytosolic protein) in the 600 × g pellets (P0.6) in addition to their expected fractions of either 10,000 × g pellets (P10) or 100,000 × g supernatant (S100). In agreement with previous studies (5Kitaura Y. Matsumoto S. Satoh H. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14053-14058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Shibata H. Suzuki H. Yoshida H. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), ALG-2 was recovered mostly in the P0.6 fraction when the lysis buffer containing Ca2+ was used, but faint bands corresponding to ALG-2 were detected in the P10 and P100 fractions. PLSCR3 was detected more in the P10 fraction than in the P0.6 fraction. PLSCR3 was extracted from the P10 fraction with the buffer-containing detergent (0.2% Nonidet P-40) and either 100 μm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA, and then the supernatant was subjected to a co-immunoprecipitation assay using anti-ALG-2 pAb for immunoprecipitation and anti-PLSCR3 pAb for Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2E, PLSCR3 was detected in the immunoprecipitates by anti-ALG-2 pAb (α-ALG-2) but not by control IgG. Two ALG-2-binding Sites in the Pro-rich Region of PLSCR3— To further analyze the interaction between human ALG-2 and PLSCR3, GST-pulldown assays were performed using GST-fused ALG-2 of wild-type and previously constructed mutants. ALG-2E47A/114A is a calcium-binding defective mutant (34Lo K.W. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which was shown to bind neither Alix (19Shibata H. Yamada K. Mizuno T. Yorikawa C. Takahashi H. Satoh H. Kitaura Y. Maki M. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) nor TSG101 (30Katoh K. Suzuki H. Terasawa Y. Mizuno T. Yasuda J. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Western blot analysis using anti-GFP mAb, a GFP-PLSCR3 band was not detected in the pelleted bead fraction (pulldown products) of GST-ALG-2E47A/114A in the presence or absence of Ca2+ in the binding buffer (Fig. 3A). ALG-2ΔGF122 corresponds to a naturally occurring alternatively spliced isoform of human ALG-2 lacking Gly121Phe122, which was first reported in mice (35Tarabykina S. Moller A.L. Durussel I. Cox J.

Consistent with the previous report that the isoform did not interact with Alix by the yeast two-hybrid assay (35Tarabykina S. Moller A.L. Durussel I. Cox J. Berchtold M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10514-10518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), GST-ALG-2ΔGF122 did not pull down GFP-Alix, but, surprisingly, it pulled down GFP-PLSCR3 (Fig. 3B). Because the initially predicted ABS in the Pro-rich region of PLSCR3 has a PXY repeat and resembles the Alix-ABS, we speculated that PLSCR3 contains an additional ABS that is capable of binding to ALG-2ΔGF122. To corroborate this hypothesis, we constructed a deletion mutant of GFP-PLSCR3 lacking residues 12–27 in the Pro-rich region (designated GFP-PLSCR3ΔABS-1) and performed the pulldown assay. Not only GST-ALG-2 but also GST-ALG-2ΔGF122 efficiently pulled down GFP-PLSCR3ΔABS-1 (Fig. 3C). Next, a mutant lacking residues 43–58 (designated GFP-PLSCR3ΔABS-2) was constructed because of the notable presence of two phenylalanine residues surrounded by proline residues. GFP-PLSCR3ΔABS-2 was pulled down by GST-ALG-2 but not by GST-ALG-2ΔGF122. When both ABS-1 and ABS-2 were deleted, the mutant (designated GFP-PLSCR3ΔABS-1/2) was not essentially pulled down anymore. Affinity Purification of ALG-2 Proteins with an ABS-2 Oligopeptide-immobilized Column—The nature of Ca2+-dependent specific interaction of PEF proteins with target peptide sequences has been utilized for affinity purification of recombinant PEF domain proteins of the calpain large subunit and the small subunit (previous name: calmodulin-like domain) using calpastatin subdomain oligopeptides that were immobilized to Sepharose beads (31Yang H.Q.

https://openalex.org/W2010088697,"Background MyoD is a muscle specific transcription factor that is essential for vertebrate myogenesis. In several teleost species, including representatives of the Salmonidae and Acanthopterygii, but not zebrafish, two or more MyoD paralogues are conserved that are thought to have arisen from distinct, possibly lineage-specific duplication events. Additionally, two MyoD paralogues have been characterised in the allotetraploid frog, Xenopus laevis. This has lead to a confusing nomenclature since MyoD paralogues have been named outside of an appropriate phylogenetic framework. Methods and Principal Findings Here we initially show that directly depicting the evolutionary relationships of teleost MyoD orthologues and paralogues is hindered by the asymmetric evolutionary rate of Acanthopterygian MyoD2 relative to other MyoD proteins. Thus our aim was to confidently position the event from which teleost paralogues arose in different lineages by a comparative investigation of genes neighbouring myod across the vertebrates. To this end, we show that genes on the single myod-containing chromosome of mammals and birds are retained in both zebrafish and Acanthopterygian teleosts in a striking pattern of double conserved synteny. Further, phylogenetic reconstruction of these neighbouring genes using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods supported a common origin for teleost paralogues following the split of the Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii. Conclusion Our results strongly suggest that myod was duplicated during the basal teleost whole genome duplication event, but was subsequently lost in the Ostariophysi (zebrafish) and Protacanthopterygii lineages. We propose a sensible consensus nomenclature for vertebrate myod genes that accommodates polyploidization events in teleost and tetrapod lineages and is justified from a phylogenetic perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2012752210,"Recent discoveries in the field of somitogenesis have confirmed, for the most part, the feasibility of the clock and wavefront model. There are good candidates for both the clock (various genes expressed cyclically in the tail bud of vertebrate embryos have been discovered) and the wavefront (there are at least three different substances, whose expression levels vary along the presomitic mesoderm [PSM], that have important effects on the formation of somites). Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which the wavefront interacts with the clock to arrest the oscillations and induce somite formation have not yet been fully elucidated.In this work, we propose a gene regulatory network which is consistent with all known experimental facts in embryonic mice, and whose dynamic behaviour provides a potential explanation for the periodic aggregation of PSM cells into blocks: the first step leading to the formation of somites.To our knowledge, this is the first proposed mechanism that fully explains how a block of PSM cells can stop oscillating simultaneously, and how this process is repeated periodically, via the interaction of the segmentation clock and the determination front."
https://openalex.org/W1991084962,"During the evolution of epithelial cancers, cells often lose their characteristic features and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, in a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study we followed early stages of keratinocyte transformation by HPV16, and observed diverse cellular changes, associated with EMT. We compared primary keratinocytes with early and late passages of HF1 cells, a cell line of HPV16-transformed keratinocytes. We have previously shown that during the progression from the normal cells to early HF1 cells, immortalization is acquired, while in the progression to late HF1, cells become anchorage independent. We show here that during the transition from the normal state to late HF1 cells, there is a progressive reduction in cytokeratin expression, desmosome formation, adherens junctions and focal adhesions, ultimately leading to poorly adhesive phenotype, which is associated with anchorage-independence. Surprisingly, unlike “conventional EMT”, these changes are associated with reduced Rac1-dependent cell migration. We monitored reduced Rac1-dependent migration also in the cervical cancer cell line SiHa. Therefore we can conclude that up to the stage of tumor formation migratory activity is eliminated."
https://openalex.org/W1979536103,"Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is essential to the function of pulmonary surfactant and to lamellar body genesis in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells. The bioactive, mature SP-B is derived from multistep post-translational proteolysis of a larger proprotein. The identity of the proteases involved in carboxyl-terminal cleavage of proSP-B remains uncertain. This cleavage event distinguishes SP-B production in type 2 cells from less complete processing in bronchiolar Clara cells. We previously identified pepsinogen C as an alveolar type 2 cell-specific protease that was developmentally regulated in the human fetal lung. We report that pepsinogen C cleaved recombinant proSP-B at Met302 in addition to an amino-terminal cleavage at Ser197. Using a well described model of type 2 cell differentiation, small interfering RNA knockdown of pepsinogen C inhibited production of mature SP-B, whereas overexpression of pepsinogen C increased SP-B production. Inhibition of SP-B production recapitulated the SP-B-deficient phenotype evident by aberrant lamellar body genesis.

The mixture of phospholipids, neutral lipids, and proteins that constitutes pulmonary surfactant facilitates alveolar patency by reducing surface tension of the alveolar lining fluid. Although phospholipids drive this biophysical process by organizing in a monolayer at the air-liquid interface in the alveolus, surfactant protein B (SP-B) 2The abbreviations used are: SP-B, surfactant protein B; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; LCMS, liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectroscopy (MS); RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. 2The abbreviations used are: SP-B, surfactant protein B; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; LCMS, liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectroscopy (MS); RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. has a vital function in pulmonary surfactant. The absence or deficiency of SP-B, due to developmental, genetic, or acquired disease processes, is associated with high surface tension in the alveolar space resulting in atelectasis, even in the presence of sufficient alveolar phospholipids (1Weaver T.E.

Even when phospholipid levels were low in surfactant obtained from human patients, correction of phospholipid content alone was not sufficient to restore surfactant function, whereas supplementation with exogenous SP-B rapidly improved surface activity (5Gunther A.

Perhaps equally important, SP-B deficiency in vivo or in vitro is associated with abnormal type 2 cell ultrastructure due to the abnormal development of lamellar bodies, the lysosome-like structures that store and release surfactant within type 2 cells (6Guttentag S.

SP-B in its mature form is a small, lumenal, hydrophobic protein that commonly exists as a homodimer in the alveolar space (11Hawgood S. Derrick M. Poulain F. Biochim. Biophys.

Mature SP-B is the result of extensive proteolysis of a 381-amino acid proSP-B precursor that shares structural homology with the saposin/amoebapore family of proteins through the regular arrangement of intramolecular disulfide bridges (13Zhai Y. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ProSP-B contains three saposin-like domains, with the mature SP-B protein residing in the second domain. Proteolysis of proSP-B after signal peptide cleavage involves the release of three saposin-like domains, amino terminus cleavage (domain 1) followed by carboxyl terminus cleavage (domain 3) and trimming of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions flanking mature SP-B (domain 2) (6Guttentag S.

The first protease to be associated with proSP-B processing, cathepsin H, is responsible for the exopeptidase trimming of both the amino and carboxyl termini before release of the mature SP-B protein (6Guttentag S. Robinson L. Zhang P. Brasch F. Buhling F. Beers M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Ueno T. Linder S. Na C.L. Rice W.R. Johansson J.

Inhibition of cathepsin H action either by protease inhibitors or RNA-mediated interference results in decreased production of mature SP-B. There is similar evidence using in vitro proteolysis and RNA-mediated interference that napsin A, an aspartic protease found in lung and kidney, is involved in removing the amino terminus from proSP-B between Leu178 and Pro179 (14Brasch F. Ochs M. Kahne T. Guttentag S. Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Derrick M. Johnen G. Kapp N. Muller K.M. Richter J. Giller T. Hawgood S. Buhling F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16178-16184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the protease involved in cleavage of the carboxyl terminus has been elusive. We recently described another aspartic protease, pepsinogen C, that is unique to alveolar type 2 cells in the lung (17Foster C. Aktar A. Kopf D. Zhang P. Guttentag S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 286: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pepsinogen C was highly induced during the process of in vivo and in vitro type 2 cell differentiation. Furthermore, in vitro transdifferentiation of type 2 cells into type 1-like cells was associated with abrupt cessation of pepsinogen C expression. We now report that pepsinogen C specifically cuts in both the amino- and carboxyl termini of proSP-B, resulting in a peptide Ser197 to Met302 containing mature SP-B. Knockdown of pepsinogen C results in the SP-B-deficient phenotype, whereas overexpression of pepsinogen C enhances SP-B production in a model of in vitro differentiation of alveolar type 2 cells. Together these findings establish pepsinogen C as an SP-B-processing enzyme. Reagents—Dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and 8-bromo-cAMP were obtained from Sigma. Purified human pepsinogen C prepared from human gastric mucosa was obtained from Biodesign International (A38200H). Commercial antisera used herein included pepsinogen C (ab9013, Abcam), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (MAB 374, Chemicon), and GST (554805, BD Biosciences), His (27-4710-01, GE Healthcare), and HA (2367, Cell Signaling Technology). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to human SP-B prepared from human alveolar proteinosis fluid was the kind gift of Dr. Aldo Baritussio, Padova, Italy. All other reagents were purchased from Fisher or Invitrogen. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant ProSP-B—A recombinant protein based the 39-kDa human ProSP-B protein (unglycosylated Mr) was developed for in vitro proteolysis by pepsinogen C. In the recombinant protein proSP-B is flanked on the amino terminal side by (in order) a GST tag, His tag, and thrombin cleavage site and is flanked on the carboxyl-terminal side by an HA tag (depicted in Fig. 1A). A DNA fragment encoding proSP-B was generated by PCR from a plasmid containing the human SP-B cDNA. The following synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used: forward, CTC TCA TAT GCA TGG CTG AGT CAC ACC TG, and reverse, CTC TGA ATT CTT AAG CGT AAT CTG GAA CAT CGT ATG GGT AAA GGT CGG GGC TGT GGA TAC, where restriction enzyme NdeI and EcoRI (underlines) were incorporated to facilitate cloning. The initiation and termination codons are indicated in bold, and the HA tag is indicated as italics. The resultant PCR product was cloned into pGEMT-Easy cloning vector, and the product confirmed both via sequencing and restriction analysis. The PCR product was digested with Ndel and EcoRI, gel-purified, and cloned into pAcGHLT-A vector. The resultant clones were confirmed via both restriction analysis and sequencing. Recombinant baculovirus were generated by co-transfecting ∼70% confluent Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (sf9) with linearized BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (BD Bioscience) and the recombinant transfer vector pAcGHLT-AProSP-B using BD BaculoGold transfection kit reagents. Recombinant viruses were amplified for two rounds. The amplifications were done at a multiplicity of infection <0.5. The titer was checked using a rapid titer kit (BacPak BV; Clontech). Sf9 cells were routinely maintained as shake flask cultures grown in Sf-900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at a 3 × 105 cells/ml, 125 rpm, and 27 °C. For expression of recombinant ProSP-B protein, cultures were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml using a multiplicity of infection between 3 and 6. Production cultures were harvested 48 h post-infection by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min), at which time the culture viability remained high (∼90%). Cells were lysed, and the recombinant protein was recovered using mouse monoclonal anti-HA-agarose conjugate and HA peptide per the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Cleavage of Recombinant ProSP-B by Peptide N-Glycosidase F, Thrombin, and Pepsinogen C—To assist in the characterization of the recombinant protein, peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) and thrombin (Novagen) cleavages were accomplished per the manufacturer's instructions. Proteolysis by pepsinogen C was accomplished in either 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer at pH 3 unless otherwise specified in the presence or absence of pepstatin (Roche Diagnostics). Phosphate-citrate buffers of 0.2 m dibasic sodium phosphate and 0.1 m citric acid were used for pH dependence enzyme studies. Western Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0) mixed with 1– protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Total protein was measured using the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215491) Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting of cell lysates or in vitro proteolysis was performed using NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels with MES running buffer (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (19Foster C. Varghese L. Skalina R. Gonzales L. Guttentag S. Pediatr. Res. 2007; 61: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using the following primary antibodies: Baritussio SP-B, hSP-B (also developed from SP-B isolated from human alveolar proteinosis fluid) (15Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.M. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L559-L566PubMed Google Scholar), CTermB (rabbit polyclonal to Leu330–Leu349 peptide derived from human proSP-B), CFlank (Gly284–Ser304), NFlank (Gln186–Gln200), NFProx (Ser145–Leu160) at 1:4000, pepsinogen C at 1:5000, and GAPDH at 1:20,000. Blots were probed with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:10,000 to detect SP-B antibodies and pepsinogen C and conjugated to IRDye 800 (Rock-land) at a dilution of 1:10,000 to simultaneously detect GAPDH expression. Blotted proteins were detected, and densitometry was analyzed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples were desalted using C4 tips (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were deposited onto the surface of a gold chip and allowed to dry followed by the addition of 1 μlof sinapinic acid (3.5 mg/ml in a mixture of water/acetonitrile (50/50) containing (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Samples were analyzed using a Ciphergen PBSIIC mass spectrometer. Analysis was performed using a laser energy of 230, sensitivity of 9, and a mass range set from 1,000 to 150,000 Da. In-gel Tryptic Digestion—Wet Coomassie-stained gels were excised and cut into 1-mm3 cubes using a modified protocol (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7803) Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were destained with 50% acetonitrile, 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with 20 mm Tris(2-carboxy-ethyl)phosphine, and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide. Gels were then washed with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate followed by 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The gel pieces were then dried in a SpeedVac. Trypsin (20 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate) was added to the gels until the gel was fully swelled and hydrated. Proteolysis was allowed to proceed at 37 °C overnight. After this, peptides were extracted with 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate followed by 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile. Samples were frozen at–80 °C until analysis. LCMS/MS Analysis—Peptide digests were loaded directly onto a C18 capillary column (75 μm × 100 mm; New Objective Proteoprep 2) isocratically in 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 1 μl/min using an Eksigent two-dimensional LC system. A linear gradient was then initiated at a flow rate of 300 nl/min (3–40% B over 42 min, 40–100% B over 3 min, then 5 min at 100% B). Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid, and buffer B was 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Thermo-Finnegan LTQ mass spectrometer in a data-dependent fashion as peptides were eluted off of the capillary column. A top 5 method was performed in which one survey scan was followed by MS/MS analysis of the 5 most intense ions. MS thresholds were set to 1500, and the MS/MS was set to 500. A mass range of 800–2500 was implemented for all runs. A repeat count of 3 was selected such that after 3 MS/MS repeats this ion was placed onto an exclusion list for 0.5 min. An exclusion window was set to 0.5 daltons below the target m/z and 1.5 daltons above. MS/MS experiments were performed with an isolation width of 2 Hz, collision energy of 35, activation Q = 0.25, and an activation time of 30. Peptides that showed a neutral loss of 98, 49.5, or 33.2 daltons were subjected for a further round of sequencing (MS3). Analysis of LCMS/MS Data and Data Base Searching—Raw Sequest files were searched against the species specific component of the Swissprot data base using both Sequest (Thermo) and MASCOT (Matrix Science). Two missed cleavages were allowed. A fixed modification of carbamidomethylation for cysteine and variable modification for methionine oxidation was used. A parent mass window of 1.2 and a fragment tolerance of 0.6 daltons were utilized for all ion-trap-based searches. A charge state of +2 and +3 was specified for all nanospray analyses. Peptide spectra were only accepted after SEQUEST analysis using the following criteria: Xcorr > 1.5 (z = 1), 2(z = 2), 2.5 (z = 3); ΔCn > 0.1 and a continuous ion series of at least 5 y-ions and b ions. Additionally, the five major peaks in the MS/MS spectrum needed to be identified. Semi-tryptic peptides, peptides in which either the carboxyl or amino terminus was non-tryptic, were considered in this analysis since non-tryptic cleavage of proSP-B by pepsinogen C was known to occur. Data were also searched using MASCOT. Only proteins with a MASCOT score above 60 were accepted. After the initial search, data were analyzed in detail using the program Scaffold (Proteome Software). Only proteins whose peptide probabilities were above 95% and protein probabilities above 80% were accepted. Any protein with a one-peptide match was manually inspected and only accepted if a contiguous y and/or b ion series was greater than or equal to five residues. Alveolar Type 2 Cell Culture—Human fetal lung from 14–20-week therapeutic abortions came from the Birth Defects Laboratory in the Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington Medical Center (Seattle, WA) or from Advanced Biosciences Resources, Inc. (Alameda CA). All tissue was obtained and handled in compliance with state and federal law and under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Fetal lung epithelial cells were prepared as described (21Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. Wade K.C. Postle A.D. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: 940-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on tissue culture plastic in 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (DCI medium) to induce and maintain type 2 cell differentiation. siRNA Transfection—Naïve lung epithelial cells after isolation were transfected using the Amaxa Mammalian Epithelial Cell Nucleofector solution and Amaxa program M05 as recommended by the manufacturer (Amaxa). The siRNA (2–100 pmol) were added to 100 μl of nucleofector solution before executing the transfection protocol. Cells were then plated into 2 ml of Waymouth media with 10% fetal calf serum for a final siRNA concentration of 1–50 nm. After culture overnight to allow recovery and attachment, the medium was changed to Waymouth with 2% fetal calf serum to ensure that cells recovered completely and to minimize fibroblast overgrowth. After culture for 2 days, the medium was changed to Waymouth ± DCI without serum to induce differentiation of type 2 cells. The siRNA used included pepsinogen C and a scrambled pepsinogen C siRNA (Invitrogen), GAPDH (Ambion), and a fluorescence-conjugated negative control to assess transfection efficiency (siGLO, Dharmacon). Real Time RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated with RNA STAT-60 Reagent (Tel-Test). Purity was verified by the absorbance 260:280 ratio. Integrity was screened using the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano assay on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent). Real-time RT-PCR reactions using a single-plex strategy were performed using an ABI Prism 7900 system (Applied Biosystems). The two-step PCR protocol was performed as detailed elsewhere (17Foster C. Aktar A. Kopf D. Zhang P. Guttentag S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 286: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The following primer/probe sets were used: SP-B Hs00167036_m1, pepsinogen C Hs00160052_m1, and GAPDH Hs99999905_m1, 18sHs99999901_ s1. All assays were determined to be in the linear amplification range by using cDNA standards developed from alveolar type 2 epithelial cells. Ultrastructural Studies—Transmission electron microscopy samples were prepared and imaged as previously described (7Foster C.D. Zhang P.X. Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All transmission electron microscopy supplies were obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences or Polysciences. Construction and Expression of Human Pepsinogen C—RNA was prepared from human alveolar type 2 cells derived from in vitro differentiation of human fetal naïve epithelial cells and was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript™ First-Strand RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed to obtain the human pepsinogen C cDNA using the following primers: forward, 5′-CAG TTG GGG ACC AGC ATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTG CAG GGT CAA GAG GAA GA-3′. After inserting the cDNA into TA plasmid, the human pepsinogen C cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmid by directional cloning using HindIII and XhoI sites. Statistical Analysis—Results are given as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance with Dunnett's correction for multiple comparisons was performed using GraphPad Prism 4.00 for Macintosh (GraphPad). All RNA results were normalized to 18 S rRNA expression, and protein results were normalized to GAPDH expression. Characterization of Recombinant ProSP-B—Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels of recombinant human proSP-B revealed a major band at ∼70 kDa as expected (Fig. 1B). However, immunoblotting with antisera to epitopes within proSP-B, GST, His, and HA revealed three immunoreactive bands. MALDI-TOF revealed that these bands had masses of 145970.3, 72709.7, and 43543.1 daltons (Fig. 1B). The antiserum to the HA tag identified all three proteins, whereas the GST and His (His data not shown) antisera only identified the 72- and 145-kDa proteins. We suspected that the 43-kDa band might arise from an alternative translation start site that eliminated the GST and His tags. In-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry of each band identified 20 unique peptides covering 43% of the human proSP-B sequence. The recombinant proSP-B was then subjected to proteolytic cleavage by thrombin (Fig. 1C). Thrombin cleavage would remove the GST and His tags from the full-length recombinant protein, leaving a 43-kDa proSP-B with an HA tag. In the presence of thrombin both the 145- and 72-kDa proteins were reduced to a mass of 43 kDa. Together these data indicate that the dominant 72-kDa band is the full-length recombinant monomeric proSP-B, the 145-kDa band is a dimer of the full-length recombinant proSP-B that results from associations via the GST and/or His tags, and the 43-kDa band is the product of an alternate translation start site that excludes the GST and His tags. In Vitro Cleavage of ProSP-B by Pepsinogen C—The specific pH profile for pepsinogen C cleavage of proSP-B was determined using phosphate-citrate buffers between pH 3 and 7. ProSP-B was digested by pepsinogen C over a broad pH range (Fig. 2A). Although the optimal pH was ≤5, pepsinogen C cleaved >25% of proSP-B at pH 6 after 1 h. In vitro digestion of proSP-B by pepsinogen C revealed two fragments with apparent molecular masses of 16 and 12 kDa. These fragments were recognized on immunoblots using antisera to mature SP-B and the CFlank epitope (Fig. 2B). By contrast, the more distal CTermB epitope-specific antibody only recognized the 16-kDa band. None of these fragments was identified by antisera to amino-terminal epitopes, GST, or His (not shown). ProSP-B is typically glycosylated at Asn129 and Asn311 of the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. Neither the 72-kDa nor 145-kDa bands exhibited perceptible changes in migration after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2C). However, the 42-kDa proSP-B migrated faster after peptide N-glycosidase F. ProSP-B fragments resulting from pepsinogen C digestion were subjected to peptide N-glycosidase F digestion to determine whether any cleavage product was N-linked glycosylated. The cleavage product with an apparent molecular mass of 12 kDa (Fig. 2B, arrowhead), strongly immunoreactive to CFlank but not to CTermB, did not shift after peptide N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2C, arrowhead). Together these data indicate that the 12-kDa cleavage product resulting from pepsinogen C cleavage of proSP-B consists of mature SP-B with additional carboxyl-terminal amino acids recognized by CFlank antibody but does not include the glycosylation site at Asn311. Mass Spectrometry of Recombinant proSP-B Cleavage Products—In-gel tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry of the 12-kDa band resulting from pepsinogen C digests of proSP-B revealed 20 unique peptides mapping to human proSP-B, many of which were contained within the amino acid sequence of mature SP-B (Fig. 3, underlined). Each tryptic fragment from the 12-kDa band was also identified in tryptic digests of full-length recombinant proSP-B. There were 3 semi-tryptic peptides identified from the 12-kDa band; in other words these peptides were tryptic at one end but non-tryptic at the other. The identities of these peptides were 197SEQQFPIPLPYCWLCR, SPT-GEWLPRD295, and DSECHLCM302 (Fig. 3, italicized sequence). None of the semi-tryptic peptides was identified in tryptic digests of full-length recombinant proSP-B, indicating that they were the result of pepsinogen C cleavage. The LCMS/MS analysis also identified the full tryptic peptide SPTGEWLPR294, making the SPTGEWLPRD295 peptide somewhat ambiguous and possibly the result of off-target proteolysis. This was not observed for the other two semi-tryptic peptides. The estimated Mr from Ser197–Met302 is 11,826 Da, in good agreement with the immunoblotting results. The schematic diagram in Fig. 3C illustrates the position of the 12-kDa cleavage product in reference to full-length proSP-B and the position of the epitope-specific antisera. In Vivo Silencing of Pepsinogen C in Alveolar Type 2 Cells— To determine whether pepsinogen C accomplishes proSP-B processing in alveolar type 2 cells, naïve human lung epithelial cells were transfected with siRNA followed by in vitro differentiation into type 2 cells using 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and 0.1 mm IBMX (DCI) for 72 h. We have previously shown that DCI treatment of naïve human lung epithelial cells results in increased expression of SP-B over 5 days of culture in addition to promoting the expression of lamellar bodies (21Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. Wade K.C. Postle A.D. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: 940-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Using siGLO, a fluorescence-tagged unrelated siRNA, >90% of plated cells were successfully transfected. The effect of siRNA on pepsinogen C RNA expression was dose-responsive between 2 and 100 pmol of siRNA in 2 separate experiments (Fig. 4), with poor pepsinogen C knockdown at 2 pmol of siRNA. Because cell viability by visual inspection and plating efficiency was decreased with 60 and 100 pmol of siRNA, all subsequent experiments were performed using the 20 pmol of siRNA. Pepsinogen C siRNA at 20 pmol for 72 h resulted in an average 70.8 ± 7.3% knockdown of pepsinogen C RNA with no effect on the expression of SP-B or GAPDH RNA (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W1998142283,"The biosynthesis of 60 S ribosomal subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires Tif6p, the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF6. This protein is necessary for the formation of 60 S ribosomal subunits because it is essential for the processing of 35 S pre-rRNA to the mature 25 S and 5.8 S rRNAs. In the present work, using molecular genetic and biochemical analyses, we show that Hrr25p, an isoform of yeast casein kinase I, phosphorylates Tif6p both in vitro and in vivo. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro phosphorylated Tif6p by Hrr25p and 32P-labeled Tif6p isolated from yeast cells followed by mass spectrometric analysis revealed that phosphorylation occurred on a single tryptic peptide at Ser-174. Sucrose gradient fractionation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that a small but significant fraction of Hrr25p is bound to 66 S preribosomal particles that also contain bound Tif6p. Depletion of Hrr25p from a conditional yeast mutant that fails to phosphorylate Tif6p was unable to process pre-rRNAs efficiently, resulting in significant reduction in the formation of 25 S rRNA. These results along with our previous observations that phosphorylatable Ser-174 is required for yeast cell growth and viability, suggest that Hrr25p-mediated phosphorylation of Tif6p plays a critical role in the biogenesis of 60 S ribosomal subunits in yeast cells.

Chem. 1984; 259: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this ribosomal subunit anti-association property, the protein was originally thought to be an initiation factor that functions to provide a pool of free ribosomal subunits required for initiation of protein synthesis (5Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). The protein was named eIF6, although a role in translation was not demonstrated in these earlier studies. To understand the function of this protein in translation, Si et al. (6Si K. Chaudhuri J. Chevesich J. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14285-14290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) first cloned the human cDNA and then the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene (7Si K. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoding functionally active eIF6, each of 245 amino acids. The two proteins are 72% identical. The yeast gene, designated TIF6, is a single copy gene that is essential for cell growth and viability (7Si K. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These properties of TIF6 allowed the construction of a conditional null allele by placing its expression under the control of the regulatable GAL10 promoter. Depletion of Tif6p in this yeast mutant strain inhibited the rate of in vivo protein synthesis (7Si K. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a more detailed analysis of the protein synthesis parameters in Tif6p-depleted cells showed that the reduced rate of protein synthesis was not due to a direct inhibition in initiation (7Si K. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, the biogenesis of 60 S ribosomal subunits was severely inhibited. Similar observations were also reported by Sanvito et al. (8Sanvito F. Piatti S. Villa A. Bossi M. Lucchini G. Marchisio P.C. Biffo S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), who identified eIF6 from mammalian cells as a β4 integrin-interacting protein. Specifically, lack of Tif6p in yeast cells prevented the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) to the mature 25 S and 5.8 S rRNAs, the constituents of the 60 S ribosomal particle (9Basu U. Si K. Warner J.R. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, Tif6p was found to be a constituent of a multiprotein assembly complex associated with 60 S pre-ribosomal particles (also known as the 66 S pre-ribosomal particles) in the nucleolus that are the intermediates in the biosynthesis of mature 60 S ribosomal subunits (7Si K. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Horsey E. Miles T. Roman J. Rout M. Meagher D. Imai B. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).In previous studies we have observed that in both mammalian and yeast cells, eIF6 (Tif6p) is phosphorylated, and we have identified casein kinase I α (CK Iα) as the protein kinase responsible for this modification in mammalian cell extracts (11Basu U. Si K. Deng H. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sites of in vitro phosphorylation in mammalian eIF6 were identified as the serine residues at positions 174 (major site accounting for >90% of the total in vitro phosphorylation) and 175 (<10% phosphorylation). The serine residue at position 174 is present in a highly conserved consensus CK I sequence from yeast to mammals (11Basu U. Si K. Deng H. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser-174 to alanine abolished phosphorylation of Tif6p in yeast cells by >75% and caused a loss of cell growth and viability (11Basu U. Si K. Deng H. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When both Ser-174 and Ser-175 were mutated to alanine, phosphorylation was virtually abolished (11Basu U. Si K. Deng H. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that phosphorylatable serine residues at Ser-174 and Ser-175 play an important regulatory role in the function of Tif6p in yeast cells. However, the protein kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of Tif6p in yeast has not been identified.In the present work we have carried out molecular genetic and biochemical analyses to show that Hrr25p, an isoform of the budding yeast CK I (12Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that is encoded by an essential gene HRR25, phosphorylates Tif6p at Ser-174 in vitro and in vivo. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping shows that this is the only Tif6p site phosphorylated in yeast cells. We also show that a small but significant fraction of Hrr25p localizes along with Tif6p on 66 S pre-ribosomal particles. Furthermore, Hrr25p-mediated phosphorylation is also required for efficient processing of pre-rRNAs to form the mature rRNAs. These results suggest that constitutively active kinase Hrr25p plays an important regulatory role in coordinating the process of 60 S and 40 S ribosome biogenesis in yeast.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia, Growth Conditions, and Genetic Methods—Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in standard media as described previously (7Si K. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For pre-rRNA processing experiments using [methyl-3H]methionine pulse, synthetic complete medium lacking methionine and containing either 2% galactose (SGal) or 2% dextrose (SD) was used as the carbon source. These methionine-lacking media were designated SGal-Met and SD-Met, respectively. Yeast genetic methods as well as methods for isolation of plasmids and genomic DNAs, cloning, and bacterial transformation were carried out as described (13Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Yeast Strains—The genotype of yeast strains used in this work are described in Table 1. The construction of yeast strains used in this study is as follows. For epitope-tagging of chromosomal genes at the 3′ ends of their open reading frames (ORFs), the PCR-based gene targeting method of Longtine et al. (15Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4108) Google Scholar) was used. The construction of several other strains were as follows. For overexpression of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Hrr25p in yeast cells, the ORF of HRR25 was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA using Pyrococcus DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using two primer sequences as follows; N terminus 5′-dccggatccatggacttaagagtaggaag-3′ having a BamHI overhang and C terminus 5′-dttgcggccgcttacaaccaaattgactggcca-3′ having a NotI overhang. The PCR product was used in a three-fragment ligation reaction with a NotI/SacI fragment derived from the vector pGEXYP1 and URA3-based CEN plasmid pRS316GAL digested at the BamHI and SacI sites. This reaction yielded the recombinant plasmid pGAL-HRR25-HA. The plasmid was transformed into a yeast strain KSY606 (Table 1) to generate a yeast strain, UBY616, which expressed HA-tagged Hrr25p when grown in a medium containing galactose as the carbon source. The strain PRY101 that expresses Myc-tagged Hrr25p from its genomic promoter and HA-tagged Tif6p from a CEN plasmid under the transcriptional control of its natural promoter was constructed by tagging the genomic copy of HRR25 of yeast strain KSY607 MATαtif6::HIS3, p[LEU2 TIF6-HA]) at its ORF 3′ end. In the strain KKY387 (16Kafadar K.A. Zhu H. Snyder M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2698-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. Martha Cyert of Stanford University, a rapidly degradable form of Hrr25p (degron-tagged Hrr25p) is expressed from a galactose-inducible promoter in a plasmid, whereas the strain YPH499 is the isogenic parental wild-type strain in which Hrr25p is expressed from its own endogenous promoter (16Kafadar K.A. Zhu H. Snyder M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2698-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A chromosomal copy of TIF6 in these two strains was the Myc epitope tagged at the 3′ end to generate PRY102 and PRY103 strains, respectively. The strain PRY104 was constructed by tagging the genomic copy of TIF6 at its ORF 3′ end with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) cassette.TABLE 1Yeast strains usedStrainGenotypeReference or sourceW303 αMATα leu2-3,112 his3-1, 15 ade2-1 1 trp-1 ura3-1 can1-10013Rose M.D. Winston F.

Exponentially growing UBY616 cells (100-ml culture) in which Hrr25p is expressed as a HA-tagged protein were harvested. The washed cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), lysed by vortexing with glass beads, and then centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of a 50% suspension of agarose for about 90 min with gentle mixing in a rotator followed by centrifugation to remove the agarose beads. The supernatant was then incubated with 20 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Berkeley, CA) for about 3 h with gentle mixing in a rotator. Immunocomplexes bound to agarose beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed sequentially with 0.5 ml of a immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 500 mm KCl (twice) and, second, with lysis buffer (once). HA-tagged Hrr25p bound to agarose beads was recovered by centrifugation and then suspended in 10 μl of the kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2) and used for phosphorylation of Tif6p.Recombinant GST-tagged Hrr25p was isolated from Escherichia coli BL21/pLys cells expressing GST-Hrr25p from an expression plasmid KK196 (16Kafadar K.A.

Harvested cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium molybdate) and used as a source of protein kinase for Tif6p phosphorylation. It should be noted that the growth of KKY387 cells begins to slow down 12–14 h after transfer to SD medium.Coimmunoprecipitation of Tif6p with Hrr25p—A 100-ml culture of exponentially growing PRY101 yeast cells was harvested, washed twice with ice-cold water, and then suspended in 500 μl of a coimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and an aliquot of a mixture of protease inhibitors). Cells were disrupted by vortexing with glass beads and centrifuged. The glass beads were washed once with 500 μl of the coimmunoprecipitation buffer, and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation was mixed with the initial supernatant. The combined supernatant (about 1 ml) was incubated with 10 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz) for about 4 h with gentle mixing at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes bound to agarose beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed with 0.5 ml of the coimmunoprecipitation buffer (twice). Proteins bound to the immunocomplexes were eluted by suspending the beads in 30 μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol and incubating the suspension in a boiling water bath for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was treated with 100 mm DTT, cooled, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% gel). The resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The washed membrane was then analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies.Assay for in Vitro Phosphorylation of Tif6p—Phosphorylation of Tif6p was carried out in reaction mixtures (30–50 μl each) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/pmol), 15 pmol of recombinant His6-Tif6p, a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium molybdate), and the indicated amounts of either yeast cell-free extracts or the purified kinase protein. In some experiments the nuclear or cytoplasmic fractions of yeast cell-free extracts replaced the total yeast cell-free extracts as the source of kinase. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, each reaction was treated with 450 μl of buffer I (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 6 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10% glycerol) followed by the addition of 15 μl of equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose bead suspension. The solutions were mixed gently at 4 °C for 2 h then centrifuged. The agarose beads were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer I containing 50 mm imidazole. The washed beads containing bound His6-Tif6p were suspended in 50 μl of SDS-loading buffer, boiled, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (either 15% gel or 4–15% gradient gel as indicated). For reactions using the purified kinase, the incubated reaction mixtures were directly treated with SDS-loading buffer, boiled, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. In each case, after SDS-PAGE, the resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was analyzed by autoradiography to determine the extent of phosphorylation of Tif6p. Subsequently, the recovery of Tif6p in each reaction was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-His antibody.Phosphopeptide Mapping—The procedure for the preparation of tryptic phosphopeptides from immunocomplexes of in vivo 32P-labeled Tif6p was similar to that described previously (18Maiti T. Bandyopadhyay A. Maitra U. Yeast. 2003; 20: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional separation of tryptic phosphopeptides by thin-layer chromatography, the samples were spotted 4 cm from the bottom edge of a 20 × 20-cm thin layer cellulose plate (Fisher) and electrophoresed at pH 1.9 in 2.5% formic acid, 17.8% acetic acid for 20 min at 16 °C at 1000 V. The plates were air-dried and then subjected to ascending chromatography in pyridine:acetic acid:1-butanol:H2O (50:15:75:60). The air-dried plates were subsequently subjected to autoradiography using phosphorimaging.Tandem Affinity Purification and Identification of Tif6p-associated RNA and Protein Components—The genomic copy of TIF6 of the yeast strain W303α (Table 1) was C-terminal-tagged with the TAP-tag cassette using PCR-based gene targeting methods (15Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4108) Google Scholar). The resulting yeast strain, designated PRY104 (Table 1), expresses TAP-tagged Tif6p from its genomic promoter. This strain grew at a rate similar to the untagged wild-type strain. Immunoblot analysis of extracts of this strain showed a protein band whose size corresponded to Tif6p-TAP fusion protein. Furthermore, the Tif6p-TAP fusion protein sedimented in sucrose gradients primarily at the 60 S–66 S region (data not shown). Cells expressing Tif6p-TAP were grown in YPD at 30 °C to an A600 of about 1.0, and cell-free extracts were subjected to tandem affinity purification as described by Rigaut et al. (19Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). RNAs that co-purified with the Tif6p-TAP complex(s) were extracted from the final eluate with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by Northern blot by using 32P-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide probes (9Basu U. Si K. Warner J.R. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that specifically detect each pre-rRNA species. Primer extension was carried out as described by Venema et al. (20Venema J. Planta R.J. Raue H.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 257-270PubMed Google Scholar). The probe used for detection of 35 S and 25.5 S pre-rRNAs by primer extension was (5′-ACACGCTGTATAGAGACTAGGC-3′) and (5′-CGCCTAGACGCTCTCTTCTTA-3′), respectively, as described by these investigators (20Venema J. Planta R.J. Raue H.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 257-270PubMed Google Scholar).Other Materials and Methods—Recombinant yeast His6-Tif6p was purified from BL21 (DE3) cells carrying the ORF of yeast Tif6p in the plasmid pRSET-A by following a procedure similar to that described previously for the purification of His6-tagged mammalian eIF6 (11Basu U. Si K. Deng H. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The procedure involved affinity purification from a Ni-NTA column followed by gradient elution from an fast protein liquid chromatography-Mono Q column. The final preparation was >95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining.Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from exponentially growing yeast cells were prepared by an adaptation of the method of Evans and Engelke (21Evans C.F. Engelke D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The procedures used for pulse-chase labeling of pre-rRNAs with [methyl-3H]methionine and subsequent analysis of RNA by gel electrophoresis were as described (9Basu U. Si K. Warner J.R. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from each immunocomplex by a phenol/chloroform extraction procedure as described (9Basu U. Si K. Warner J.R. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Purified yeast eIF5 (Tif5p) was a kind gift of Drs. Michael Acker and Jon Lorsch of the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Anti-Pgk1p antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, whereas anti-Nop1p antibodies were obtained from EnCor Biotechnology Inc. Anti-Tcm1p (L3) antibodies and Northern probes JW71 and JW499 were kind gifts of Dr. Jonathan Warner of this institution.RESULTSHrr25p Phosphorylates Tif6p in Vitro—To identify the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Tif6p in vitro and to characterize the phosphorylation reaction, yeast cell-free extracts were fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions. The validity of the fractionation was verified by using antibodies for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, Pgk1p (a marker for cytoplasmic proteins), and Nop1p (a marker for nucleolar proteins) (Fig. 1, panel C). Using bacterially expressed recombinant His6-Tif6p as the substrate and [γ-32P]ATP as the phosphoryl donor and increasing concentrations of either the nuclear or cytoplasmic extract as the source of the kinase, we observed that Tif6p was readily phosphorylated by the nuclear extract (Fig. 1, panel A, lanes d and e). In contrast, under the same conditions the relative efficiency of phosphorylation of Tif6p by the cytosolic fraction was low (Fig. 1A, lane h). A higher concentration of the cytosolic fraction was inhibitory in the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 1A, lane i). The presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors did not have any effect on the extent of phosphorylation (data not shown). Furthermore, the amount of His6-Tif6p recovered from each reaction was similar (Fig. 1, panel B).It has been reported previously that mammalian eIF6 is phosphorylated at Ser-174 by CK Iα (11Basu U. Si K. Deng H. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In view of our observation (11Basu U. Si K. Deng H. Maitra U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6187-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that this serine residue is present in a highly conserved consensus CK I sequence (12Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) between yeast and mammals, we initially investigated whether a particular isoform(s) of yeast CK I can phosphorylate Tif6p in vitro. In S. cerevisiae there are four different isoforms of CK I, each encoded by a separate gene, YCK I, YCK 2, YCK 3, and HRR25 (12Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Robinson L.C. Hubbard E.J. Graves P.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Kung C. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. Goebl M.

Among these isoforms, Hrr25p localizes throughout the cell (16Kafadar K.A. Zhu H. Snyder M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2698-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereasYck1p, Yck2p, and Yck3p are prenylated and tightly bound to the plasma membrane (24Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wang X. Hoekstra M.F. DeMaggio A.J. Dhillon N. Vancura A. Kuret J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To show if any isoform of yeast CK I is able to phosphorylate Tif6p in vitro, we purified Hrr25p, Yck1p, and Yck2p and used these purified proteins to phosphorylate recombinant Tif6p (Fig. 2). Tif6p was readily phosphorylated by both immunopurified Hrr25p (Fig. 2A) and by bacterially expressed recombinant GST-Hrr25p (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the other purified CK I isoform, Yck1p, was unable to phosphorylate Tif6p (Fig. 2C). Similar observations were made using β-galactosidase fusion protein of Yck2p (22Robinson L.C.

https://openalex.org/W1966079674,"The clinical use of HIV protease inhibitors is associated with insulin resistance and other metabolic changes that increase long-term cardiovascular risk. Since the failing heart has increased reliance on glucose, the influence of drug exposure on glucose homeostasis, myocardial glucose uptake, cardiac function, and survival was determined in TG9 mice, an established transgenic model of dilated cardiomyopathy generated by cardiac-specific overexpression of Cre-recombinase, as these animals progressed to overt heart failure. Beginning on day of life 75, TG9 mice and nontransgenic littermate controls were given a daily 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir 4:1, atazanavir, atazanavir/ritonavir 4:1) or vehicle. Glucose tolerance testing, measurement of in vivo myocardial 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and echocardiography were performed before and 30 min following drug administration. The progression of dilated cardiomyopathy in TG9 animals was accompanied by impaired glucose tolerance, which was acutely exacerbated by exposure to ritonavir. Ritonavir and lopinavir precipitated acute, decompensated heart failure and death from pulmonary edema in TG9 mice. However, atazanavir, which does not inhibit glucose transport, had no effect. These studies demonstrate that, in the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy, HIV protease inhibitors that impair glucose transport induce acute, decompensated heart failure. The potential for HIV protease inhibitors to contribute to or exacerbate cardiomyopathy in human patients warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2057038291,"By precisely manipulating the expression of individual genetic elements thought to be important for ecological performance, reverse genetics has the potential to revolutionize plant ecology. However, untested concerns about possible side-effects of the transformation technique, caused by Agrobacterium infection and tissue culture, on plant performance have stymied research by requiring onerous sample sizes. We compare 5 independently transformed Nicotiana attenuata lines harboring empty vector control (EVC) T-DNA lacking silencing information with isogenic wild types (WT), and measured a battery of ecologically relevant traits, known to be important in plant-herbivore interactions: phytohormones, secondary metabolites, growth and fitness parameters under stringent competitive conditions, and transcriptional regulation with microarrays. As a positive control, we included a line silenced in trypsin proteinase inhibitor gene (TPI) expression, a potent anti-herbivore defense known to exact fitness costs in its expression, in the analysis. The experiment was conducted twice, with 10 and 20 biological replicates per genotype. For all parameters, we detected no difference between any EVC and WT lines, but could readily detect a fitness benefit of silencing TPI production. A statistical power analyses revealed that the minimum sample sizes required for detecting significant fitness differences between EVC and WT was 2–3 orders of magnitude larger than the 10 replicates required to detect a fitness effect of TPI silencing. We conclude that possible side-effects of transformation are far too low to obfuscate the study of ecologically relevant phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2081542482,"The linker histone H1 binds to the DNA in between adjacent nucleosomes and contributes to chromatin organization and transcriptional control. It is known that H1 carries diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, lysine methylation and ADP-ribosylation. Their biological functions, however, remain largely unclear. This is in part due to the fact that most of the studies have been performed in organisms that have several H1 variants, which complicates the analyses. We have chosen Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism, which has a single H1 variant, to approach the study of the role of H1 PTMs during embryonic development. Mass spectrometry mapping of the entire sequence of the protein showed phosphorylation only in the ten N-terminal amino acids, mostly at S10. For the first time, changes in the PTMs of a linker H1 during the development of a multicellular organism are reported. The abundance of H1 monophosphorylated at S10 decreases as the embryos age, which suggests that this PTM is related to cell cycle progression and/or cell differentiation. Additionally, we have found a polymorphism in the protein sequence that can be mistaken with lysine methylation if the analysis is not rigorous."
https://openalex.org/W2077160992,"During reading, we generate saccadic eye movements to move words into the center of the visual field for word processing. However, due to systematic and random errors in the oculomotor system, distributions of within-word landing positions are rather broad and show overlapping tails, which suggests that a fraction of fixations is mislocated and falls on words to the left or right of the selected target word. Here we propose a new procedure for the self-consistent estimation of the likelihood of mislocated fixations in normal reading. Our approach is based on iterative computation of the proportions of several types of oculomotor errors, the underlying probabilities for word-targeting, and corrected distributions of landing positions. We found that the average fraction of mislocated fixations ranges from about 10% to more than 30% depending on word length. These results show that fixation probabilities are strongly affected by oculomotor errors."
https://openalex.org/W2113498649,"We performed a bioinformatical analysis of protein export elements (PEXEL) in the putative proteome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. A protein family-specific conservation of physicochemical residue profiles was found for PEXEL-flanking sequence regions. We demonstrate that the family members can be clustered based on the flanking regions only and display characteristic hydrophobicity patterns. This raises the possibility that the flanking regions may contain additional information for a family-specific role of PEXEL. We further show that signal peptide cleavage results in a positional alignment of PEXEL from both proteins with, and without, a signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2109193316,"Both Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are members of the human gamma herpesvirus family: each is associated with various human cancers. The majority of AIDS-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) are co-infected with both KSHV and EBV. Dually-infected PELs selectively switch from latency to lytic replication of either KSHV or EBV in response to chemical stimuli. KSHV replication and transcription activator (K-RTA) is necessary and sufficient for the switch from KSHV latency to lytic replication, while EBV BZLF1 gene product (EBV-Z) is a critical initiator for induction of EBV lytic replication.We show K-RTA and EBV-Z are co-localized and physically interact with each other in dually-infected PELs. K-RTA inhibits the EBV lytic replication by nullifying EBV-Z-mediated EBV lytic gene activation. EBV-Z inhibits KSHV lytic gene expression by blocking K-RTA-mediated transactivations. The physical interaction between K-RTA and EBV-Z are required for the mutual inhibition of the two molecules. The leucine heptapeptide repeat (LR) region in K-RTA and leucine zipper region in EBV-Z are involved in the physical interactions of the two molecules. Finally, initiation of KSHV lytic gene expression is correlated with the reduction of EBV lytic gene expression in the same PEL cells.In this report, how the two viruses interact with each other in dually infected PELs is addressed. Our data may provide a possible mechanism for maintaining viral latency and for selective lytic replication in dually infected PELs, i.e., through mutual inhibition of two critical lytic replication initiators. Our data about putative interactions between EBV and KSHV would be applicable to the majority of AIDS-associated PELs and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of PELs."
https://openalex.org/W1980922062,"Background As we move into the post genome-sequencing era, an immediate challenge is how to make best use of the large amount of high-throughput experimental data to assign functions to currently uncharacterized proteins. We here describe CSIDOP, a new method for protein function assignment based on shared interacting domain patterns extracted from cross-species protein-protein interaction data. Methodology/Principal Findings The proposed method is assessed both biologically and statistically over the genome of H. sapiens. The CSIDOP method is capable of making protein function prediction with accuracy of 95.42% using 2,972 gene ontology (GO) functional categories. In addition, we are able to assign novel functional annotations for 181 previously uncharacterized proteins in H. sapiens. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for proteins that are characterized by GO, the CSIDOP may predict extra functions. This is attractive as a protein normally executes a variety of functions in different processes and its current GO annotation may be incomplete. Conclusions/Significance It can be shown through experimental results that the CSIDOP method is reliable and practical in use. The method will continue to improve as more high quality interaction data becomes available and is readily scalable to a genome-wide application."
https://openalex.org/W2020934028,"The majority of studies examining activity-induced conformational changes in G protein-coupled receptors have focused on transmembrane helices or intracellular regions. Relatively few studies have examined the involvement of the extracellular region in general and the N-terminal region in particular in this process. To begin to address this, we generated a series of antibodies to the N-terminal region of opioid receptors. Characterization of these antibodies revealed that they differentially recognize activated receptors. Recently, we generated monoclonal antibodies that recognize regions proximal to glycosylation sites in the receptor N terminus. Characterization of these antibodies revealed that agonist treatment leads to a decrease in epitope recognition by the antibody presumably because of a movement of the region of the N terminus proximal to glycosylation sites. The time course of the decrease in antibody recognition suggested that it could be due to a post-activation-mediated event. Examination of the involvement of receptor residues in the C-tail and beta-arrestin binding using site-directed mutagenesis and cells or tissues lacking beta-arrestin 2 suggests a role for these desensitization-related mechanisms in governing antibody binding to the receptor. Thus, these N-terminally directed antibodies can differentially recognize post-activation-mediated changes in the C-terminal (intracellular) region of the receptor. Therefore, these conformation-sensitive antibodies represent powerful reagents to probe receptor activation states and provide a potential tool for identifying and characterizing new compounds of therapeutic interest."
https://openalex.org/W2059770489,"Background A direct link between the names and structures of compounds and the functional groups contained within them is important, not only because biochemists frequently rely on literature that uses a free-text format to describe functional groups, but also because metabolic models depend upon the connections between enzymes and substrates being known and appropriately stored in databases. Methodology We have developed a database named “Biochemical Substructure Search Catalogue” (BiSSCat), which contains 489 functional groups, >200,000 compounds and >1,000,000 different computationally constructed substructures, to allow identification of chemical compounds of biological interest. Conclusions This database and its associated web-based search program (http://bisscat.org/) can be used to find compounds containing selected combinations of substructures and functional groups. It can be used to determine possible additional substrates for known enzymes and for putative enzymes found in genome projects. Its applications to enzyme inhibitor design are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2008041798,"The ligand specificity of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is determined by the alternative splicing of exons 8 (IIIb) or 9 (IIIc). Exon IIIb is included in epithelial cells, whereas exon IIIc is included in mesenchymal cells. Although a number of cis elements and trans factors have been identified that play a role in exon IIIb inclusion in epithelium, little is known about the activation of exon IIIc in mesenchyme. We report here the identification of a splicing enhancer required for IIIc inclusion. This 24-nucleotide (nt) downstream intronic splicing enhancer (DISE) is located within intron 9 immediately downstream of exon IIIc. DISE was able to activate the inclusion of heterologous exons rat FGFR2 IIIb and human beta-globin exon 2 in cell lines from different tissues and species and also in HeLa cell nuclear extracts in vitro. DISE was capable of replacing the intronic activator sequence 1 (IAS1), a known IIIb splicing enhancer and vice versa. This fact, together with the requirement for DISE to be close to the 5'-splice site and the ability of DISE to promote binding of U1 snRNP, suggested that IAS1 and DISE belong to the same class of cis-acting elements."
https://openalex.org/W2112266933,"In asthma, mechanisms contributing to chronicity remain to be determined. Recent models of sensitisation with prolonged airway allergen challenges reproduce typical features of chronic asthma. However, the interplay between inflammation, structural changes and lung function is poorly understood. This study was performed to delineate functional, structural and immunological airway changes after cessation of long term challenges to elucidate factors contributing to the development of prolonged lung function changes.Mice sensitised systemically were consecutively challenged intranasally with ovalbumin for two or eight weeks. After the end of challenges, lung function, airway inflammation, features of airway remodelling, local T-cell cytokines and systemic ovalbumin-specific antibodies were monitored. Long term challenges resulted in airway hyperresponsiveness lasting 2 weeks and reduced baseline lung function for 6 weeks after their cessation. In contrast, these changes resolved within one week after short term challenges. Prolonged transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)1 production and marked peribronchial fibrosis were only induced by long term challenges. Importantly, fibrosis became apparent only after the onset of lung function changes and outlasted them. Further, long term challenges led to prolonged and intense airway inflammation with marked lymphocytosis, but moderate eosinophilia, sustained IL-5 production and ovalbumin-specific IgG2a antibodies, the latter suggesting a Th1 component to the immune response. In contrast, following short term challenges airway inflammation was dominated by eosinophils and associated with a strong, but transient IL-13 response.Prolonged lung function changes after long term allergen challenges seem to develop and resolve independently of the persistent peribronchial fibrosis. They are more closely associated with intense airway inflammation, marked lymphocytosis, prolonged IL-5 and TGF-beta1 production in the airways and a Th1 immune response."
