https://openalex.org/W2061268350,"Background Recent studies suggest that humans exhale fine particles during tidal breathing but little is known of their composition, particularly during infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a study of influenza infected patients to characterize influenza virus and particle concentrations in their exhaled breath. Patients presenting with influenza-like-illness, confirmed influenza A or B virus by rapid test, and onset within 3 days were recruited at three clinics in Hong Kong, China. We collected exhaled breath from each subject onto Teflon filters and measured exhaled particle concentrations using an optical particle counter. Filters were analyzed for influenza A and B viruses by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Twelve out of thirteen rapid test positive patients provided exhaled breath filter samples (7 subjects infected with influenza B virus and 5 subjects infected with influenza A virus). We detected influenza virus RNA in the exhaled breath of 4 (33%) subjects–three (60%) of the five patients infected with influenza A virus and one (14%) of the seven infected with influenza B virus. Exhaled influenza virus RNA generation rates ranged from <3.2 to 20 influenza virus RNA particles per minute. Over 87% of particles exhaled were under 1 µm in diameter. Conclusions These findings regarding influenza virus RNA suggest that influenza virus may be contained in fine particles generated during tidal breathing, and add to the body of literature suggesting that fine particle aerosols may play a role in influenza transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2020089910,"Despite an enormous research effort, most cases of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) still remain unexplained and the current biomedical science is still a long way from the ultimate goal of revealing clear risk factors that can help in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the disease. Current theories about the development of LOAD hinge on the premise that Alzheimer's arises mainly from heritable causes. Yet, the complex, non-Mendelian disease etiology suggests that an epigenetic component could be involved. Using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in post-mortem brain samples and lymphocytes, we have performed an analysis of DNA methylation across 12 potential Alzheimer's susceptibility loci. In the LOAD brain samples we identified a notably age-specific epigenetic drift, supporting a potential role of epigenetic effects in the development of the disease. Additionally, we found that some genes that participate in amyloid-beta processing (PSEN1, APOE) and methylation homeostasis (MTHFR, DNMT1) show a significant interindividual epigenetic variability, which may contribute to LOAD predisposition. The APOE gene was found to be of bimodal structure, with a hypomethylated CpG-poor promoter and a fully methylated 3'-CpG-island, that contains the sequences for the epsilon4-haplotype, which is the only undisputed genetic risk factor for LOAD. Aberrant epigenetic control in this CpG-island may contribute to LOAD pathology. We propose that epigenetic drift is likely to be a substantial mechanism predisposing individuals to LOAD and contributing to the course of disease."
https://openalex.org/W1979843175,"The c-Myc transcription factor is a master regulator and integrates cell proliferation, cell growth and metabolism through activating thousands of target genes. Our identification of direct c-Myc target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with pair-end ditag sequencing analysis (ChIP-PET) revealed that nucleotide metabolic genes are enriched among c-Myc targets, but the role of Myc in regulating nucleotide metabolic genes has not been comprehensively delineated.Here, we report that the majority of genes in human purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway were induced and directly bound by c-Myc in the P493-6 human Burkitt's lymphoma model cell line. The majority of these genes were also responsive to the ligand-activated Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein, Myc-ER, in a Myc null rat fibroblast cell line, HO.15 MYC-ER. Furthermore, these targets are also responsive to Myc activation in transgenic mouse livers in vivo. To determine the functional significance of c-Myc regulation of nucleotide metabolism, we sought to determine the effect of loss of function of direct Myc targets inosine monophosphate dehydrogenases (IMPDH1 and IMPDH2) on c-Myc-induced cell growth and proliferation. In this regard, we used a specific IMPDH inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA) and found that MPA dramatically inhibits c-Myc-induced P493-6 cell proliferation through S-phase arrest and apoptosis.Taken together, these results demonstrate the direct induction of nucleotide metabolic genes by c-Myc in multiple systems. Our finding of an S-phase arrest in cells with diminished IMPDH activity suggests that nucleotide pool balance is essential for c-Myc's orchestration of DNA replication, such that uncoupling of these two processes create DNA replication stress and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035939293,"The Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is an important regulator of cell-type specific functions in melanocytic cells. MITF is essential for the survival of pigmented cells, but whereas high levels of MITF drive melanocyte differentiation, lower levels are required to permit proliferation and survival of melanoma cells. MITF is phosphorylated by ERK, and this stimulates its activation, but also targets it for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, coupling MITF degradation to its activation. We have previously shown that because ERK is hyper-activated in melanoma cells in which BRAF is mutated, the MITF protein is constitutively down-regulated. Here we describe another intriguing aspect of MITF regulation by oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells. We show oncogenic BRAF up-regulates MITF transcription through ERK and the transcription factor BRN2 (N-Oct3). In contrast, we show that in melanocytes this pathway does not exist because BRN2 is not expressed, demonstrating that MITF regulation is a newly acquired function of oncogenic BRAF that is not performed by the wild-type protein. Critically, in melanoma cells MITF is required downstream of oncogenic BRAF because it regulates expression of key cell cycle regulatory proteins such as CDK2 and CDK4. Wild-type BRAF does not regulate this pathway in melanocytes. Thus, we show that oncogenic BRAF exerts exquisite control over MITF on two levels. It downregulates the protein by stimulating its degradation, but then counteracts this by increasing transcription through BRN2. Our data suggest that oncogenic BRAF plays a critical role in regulating MITF expression to ensure that its protein levels are compatible with proliferation and survival of melanoma cells. We propose that its ability to appropriate the regulation of this critical factor explains in part why BRAF is such a potent oncogene in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2057573783,"Background All plants in nature harbor a diverse community of endophytic bacteria which can positively affect host plant growth. Changes in plant growth frequently reflect alterations in phytohormone homoeostasis by plant-growth-promoting (PGP) rhizobacteria which can decrease ethylene (ET) levels enzymatically by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase or produce indole acetic acid (IAA). Whether these common PGP mechanisms work similarly for different plant species has not been rigorously tested. Methodology/ Principal Findings We isolated bacterial endophytes from field-grown Solanum nigrum; characterized PGP traits (ACC deaminase activity, IAA production, phosphate solubilization and seedling colonization); and determined their effects on their host, S. nigrum, as well as on another Solanaceous native plant, Nicotiana attenuata. In S. nigrum, a majority of isolates that promoted root growth were associated with ACC deaminase activity and IAA production. However, in N. attenuata, IAA but not ACC deaminase activity was associated with root growth. Inoculating N. attenuata and S. nigrum with known PGP bacteria from a culture collection (DSMZ) reinforced the conclusion that the PGP effects are not highly conserved. Conclusions/ Significance We conclude that natural endophytic bacteria with PGP traits do not have general and predictable effects on the growth and fitness of all host plants, although the underlying mechanisms are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2045992045,"In proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) cause blindness by neovascularization and subsequent fibrosis, but their relative contribution to both processes is unknown. We hypothesize that the balance between levels of pro-angiogenic VEGF and pro-fibrotic CTGF regulates angiogenesis, the angio-fibrotic switch, and the resulting fibrosis and scarring.VEGF and CTGF were measured by ELISA in 68 vitreous samples of patients with proliferative DR (PDR, N = 32), macular hole (N = 13) or macular pucker (N = 23) and were related to clinical data, including degree of intra-ocular neovascularization and fibrosis. In addition, clinical cases of PDR (n = 4) were studied before and after pan-retinal photocoagulation and intra-vitreal injections with bevacizumab, an antibody against VEGF. Neovascularization and fibrosis in various degrees occurred almost exclusively in PDR patients. In PDR patients, vitreous CTGF levels were significantly associated with degree of fibrosis and with VEGF levels, but not with neovascularization, whereas VEGF levels were associated only with neovascularization. The ratio of CTGF and VEGF was the strongest predictor of degree of fibrosis. As predicted by these findings, patients with PDR demonstrated a temporary increase in intra-ocular fibrosis after anti-VEGF treatment or laser treatment.CTGF is primarily a pro-fibrotic factor in the eye, and a shift in the balance between CTGF and VEGF is associated with the switch from angiogenesis to fibrosis in proliferative retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2109945939,"Assays for the detection of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin in plasma or urine have not yet been widely available, whereas quantitative comparisons between hepcidin levels in these different matrices were thus far even impossible due to technical restrictions. To circumvent these limitations, we here describe several advances in time-of flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS), the most important of which concerned spiking of a synthetic hepcidin analogue as internal standard into serum and urine samples. This serves both as a control for experimental variation, such as recovery and matrix-dependent ionization and ion suppression, and at the same time allows value assignment to the measured hepcidin peak intensities. The assay improvements were clinically evaluated using samples from various patients groups and its relevance was further underscored by the significant correlation of serum hepcidin levels with serum iron indices in healthy individuals. Most importantly, this approach allowed kinetic studies as illustrated by the paired analyses of serum and urine samples, showing that more than 97% of the freely filtered serum hepcidin can be reabsorbed in the kidney. Thus, the here reported advances in TOF MS-based hepcidin measurements represent critical steps in the accurate quantification of hepcidin in various body fluids and pave the way for clinical studies on the kinetic behavior of hepcidin in both healthy and diseased states."
https://openalex.org/W2014333184,"Epigenetic changes are emerging as one of the most important events in carcinogenesis. Two alterations in the pattern of DNA methylation in breast cancer (BC) have been previously reported; active estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) is associated with decreased methylation of ER-alpha target (ERT) genes, and polycomb group target (PCGT) genes are more likely than other genes to have promoter DNA hypermethylation in cancer. However, whether DNA methylation in normal unrelated cells is associated with BC risk and whether these imprints can be related to factors which can be modified by the environment, is unclear.Using quantitative methylation analysis in a case-control study (n = 1,083) we found that DNA methylation of peripheral blood cell DNA provides good prediction of BC risk. We also report that invasive ductal and invasive lobular BC is characterized by two different sets of genes, the latter particular by genes involved in the differentiation of the mesenchyme (PITX2, TITF1, GDNF and MYOD1). Finally we demonstrate that only ERT genes predict ER positive BC; lack of peripheral blood cell DNA methylation of ZNF217 predicted BC independent of age and family history (odds ratio 1.49; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.97; P = 0.006) and was associated with ER-alpha bioactivity in the corresponding serum.This first large-scale epigenotyping study demonstrates that DNA methylation may serve as a link between the environment and the genome. Factors that can be modulated by the environment (like estrogens) leave an imprint in the DNA of cells that are unrelated to the target organ and indicate the predisposition to develop a cancer. Further research will need to demonstrate whether DNA methylation profiles will be able to serve as a new tool to predict the risk of developing chronic diseases with sufficient accuracy to guide preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W1988766602,"Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells control immune activation and maintain tolerance. How T(regs) mediate their suppressive function is unclear. Here we identified a cell surface molecule, called GARP, (or LRRC32), which within T cells is specifically expressed in T(regs) activated through the T cell receptor (TCR). Ectopic expression of GARP in human naïve T (T(N)) cells inhibited their proliferation and cytokine secretion upon TCR activation. Remarkably, GARP over-expression in T(N) cells induced expression of T(reg) master transcription factor Foxp3 and endowed them with a partial suppressive function. The extracellular but not the cytoplasmic region of GARP, was necessary for these functions. Silencing Foxp3 in human T(reg) cells reduced expression of GARP and attenuated their suppressive function. However, GARP function was not affected when Foxp3 was downregulated in GARP-overexpressing cells, while silencing GARP in Foxp3-overexpressing cells reduced their suppressive activity. These findings reveal a novel cell surface molecule-mediated regulatory mechanism, with implications for modulating aberrant immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1963863970,"The adipocyte-derived cytokine adiponectin is known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, circulating levels of adiponectin correlate inversely with those of the proinflammatory, proapoptotic cytokine interleukin (IL)-18. The opposing actions of IL-18 and adiponectin on both cell survival and inflammation led us to investigate whether adiponectin signaling antagonizes IL-18-mediated endothelial cell death and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Treatment with IL-18 suppressed Akt phosphorylation and its associated kinase activity, induced IkappaB kinase (IKK)-NF-kappaB-dependent PTEN activation, and promoted endothelial cell death. Pretreatment with adiponectin stimulated APPL1-dependent AMPK activation, reversed Akt inhibition in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner, blocked IKK-NF-kappaB-PTEN signaling, reduced caspase-3 activity, blocked Bax translocation, and inhibited endothelial cell death. The cytoprotective effect of adiponectin signaling was recapitulated by treatment with the pharmacological AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-riboside. Collectively, these results demonstrated that adiponectin reverses IL-18-mediated endothelial cell death through an AMPK-associated mechanism, which may thus have therapeutic potential for diminishing IL-18-dependent vascular injury and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2002633662,"Two major transitions in animal evolution–the origins of multicellularity and bilaterality–correlate with major changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) organization. Demosponges, the largest class in the phylum Porifera, underwent only the first of these transitions and their mitochondrial genomes display a peculiar combination of ancestral and animal-specific features. To get an insight into the evolution of mitochondrial genomes within the Demospongiae, we determined 17 new mtDNA sequences from this group and analyzing them with five previously published sequences. Our analysis revealed that all demosponge mtDNAs are 16- to 25-kbp circular molecules, containing 13–15 protein genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 2–27 tRNA genes. All but four pairs of sampled genomes had unique gene orders, with the number of shared gene boundaries ranging from 1 to 41. Although most demosponge species displayed low rates of mitochondrial sequence evolution, a significant acceleration in evolutionary rates occurred in the G1 group (orders Dendroceratida, Dictyoceratida, and Verticillitida). Large variation in mtDNA organization was also observed within the G0 group (order Homosclerophorida) including gene rearrangements, loss of tRNA genes, and the presence of two introns in Plakortis angulospiculatus. While introns are rare in modern-day demosponge mtDNA, we inferred that at least one intron was present in cox1 of the common ancestor of all demosponges. Our study uncovered an extensive mitochondrial genomic diversity within the Demospongiae. Although all sampled mitochondrial genomes retained some ancestral features, including a minimally modified genetic code, conserved structures of tRNA genes, and presence of multiple non-coding regions, they vary considerably in their size, gene content, gene order, and the rates of sequence evolution. Some of the changes in demosponge mtDNA, such as the loss of tRNA genes and the appearance of hairpin-containing repetitive elements, occurred in parallel in several lineages and suggest general trends in demosponge mtDNA evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1993775542,"Background The regulation of Notch signaling heavily relies on ubiquitination events. Drosophila Su(dx), a member of the HECT family of ubiquitin-ligases, has been described as a negative regulator of Notch signaling, acting on the post-endocytic sorting of Notch. The mammalian ortholog of Su(dx), Itch/AIP4, has been shown to have multiple substrates, including Notch, but the precise events regulated by Itch/AIP4 in the Notch pathway have not been identified yet. Methodology/Principal Findings Using Itch-/- fibroblasts expressing the Notch1 receptor, we show that Itch is not necessary for Notch activation, but rather for controlling the degradation of Notch in the absence of ligand. Itch is indeed required after the early steps of Notch endocytosis to target it to the lysosomes where it is degraded. Furthermore Itch/AIP4 catalyzes Notch polyubiquitination through unusual K29-linked chains. We also demonstrate that although Notch is associated with Itch/AIP4 in cells, their interaction is not detectable in vitro and thus requires either a post-translational modification, or a bridging factor that remains to be identified. Conclusions/Significance Taken together our results identify a specific step of Notch regulation in the absence of any activation and underline differences between mammalian and Drosophila Notch pathways."

Here, we report the results of such an effort. We present an essentially complete collection of point mutations in the MccJ25 coding portion of the mcjA gene, and we determine the effects of amino acid substitutions resulting from these point mutations on production of MccJ25 (comprising synthesis of MccJ25 precursor, processing of MccJ25 precursor, export of mature MccJ25, and stability of mature MccJ25), on ability to inhibit bacterial RNAP in vitro, and on ability to inhibit the bacterial growth in culture. Our results establish that, despite the unusual lariat-protoknot structure of MccJ25, only three wild-type amino acid side chains of MccJ25 are strictly essential for production of MccJ25. In addition, our results define amino acid side chains of MccJ25 important for inhibition of bacterial RNAP and for inhibition of bacterial growth. The fact that only a small number of wild-type side chains of MccJ25 are strictly essential for production of MccJ25 suggests that it should be possible to construct substituted MccJ25 derivatives with higher potencies and/or broadened specificities in further rounds of mutagenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis—Plasmid pTUC202, which carries the MccJ25 biosynthetic gene cluster (9Solbiati J.O. Ciaccio M. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3661-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in the presence of 6% DMSO. For each targeted codon, a pair of ∼40-nt oligonucleotide primers introducing all possible substitutions in the first and the second position and specific substitution to G or C into the third position of the codon were used. Mutagenized plasmid DNA was introduced by transformation into MAX Efficiency DH5α-competent cells (Invitrogen). Cells were plated on LB agar plates containing 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol and cultured overnight at 37 °C. Plasmids were prepared from individual transformants, sequences were determined, and clones with desired substitutions were selected.MccJ25 Derivatives—Transformants of Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) harboring the pTUC202 derivative of interest were cultured for 18 h at 37 °C in 500 ml of M9 minimal medium (15Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 1 mm thiamine, 2% glucose, and 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture supernatant was obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C at 4000 × g, and 500 ml of the culture supernatant was loaded onto a 35-ml Sep-Pak C8 cartridge (Waters) prewashed with 5 volumes of 100% acetonitrile and 20 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After loading, the cartridge was washed with 20 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and was eluted successively with 5, 10, 20, and 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing MccJ25 derivatives (typically the fraction with 30% acetonitrile) were concentrated by lyophilization, dissolved in 1.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded onto a 3-ml C18 cartridge (Waters), prewashed with 5 volumes of 100% acetonitrile and 20 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The cartridge was washed successively with 20 volumes of 10 and 20% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and was eluted successively with 23, 25, 27, and 29% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing MccJ25 derivatives (typically fractions with 27 or 29% acetonitrile) were concentrated by lyophilization and dissolved in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Typical yields were ∼1 mg/liter of cultured medium.Culture Supernatants—Transformants of E. coli strain DH5α harboring pTUC202 derivatives were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of M9 minimal medium (15Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 1 mm thiamine, 2% glucose, and 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Culture supernatants were prepared by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C at 4000 × g and were stored at -20 °C.Analysis of Production—To 90 μl of culture supernatant (prepared as above) was added 10 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was loaded onto a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) preequilibrated per instructions of the manufacturer, and was eluted in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry on a PE Biosystems DE-PRO mass spectrometer in a positive mode using α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Mass spectra of culture supernatants of cells harboring wild-type pTUC202 exhibited a MALDI-mass spectrometry peak corresponding to mature MccJ25 (m/z = 2108 [M + H+]) that exceeded the background by ∼100 times. Mass spectra of culture supernatants of cells harboring pTUC202 mutants that exhibited unequivocal peaks with expected m/z values (2002-2237 [M + H+], depending on sequence of the mutant) that exceeded the background by at least 3 times were scored as positives.Analysis of Inhibition of RNAP—The fluorescence-detected abortive initiation assay of Ref. 13Mukhopadhyay J.

Assays were performed in Corning black flat-bottom 96-well plates (Corning Glass). To each well, was added, successively, 43 μl of culture supernatant (prepared as above), 1 μl of 5 μm E. coli RNAP holoenzyme, 1 μl of 1 μm promoter DNA fragment (DNA fragment lacUV5-12 of Ref. 16Mukhopadhyay J.

Following 15 min at 37 °C, 0.5 μl of 1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma) and 0.5 μl of 2.5 mm (γ-AmNS)UTP (Molecular Probes, Inc.) were added. Following a further 2-min incubation at 37 °C, RNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of 2.5 μl of 10 mm ApA (Sigma), and fluorescence emission intensity was monitored for 15 min at 37 °C using a GENios Pro multimode scanner (TECAN, Inc.). The reaction rate was determined from the quantity of (γ-AmNS)UTP consumed within time t, as in Ref. 17Schlageck J.G. Baughman M. Yarbrough L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12074-12077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rate=(γ-AmNS)UTPconsumed/t=[(γ-AmNS)UTPo](Ft-Fo)/(12.4×Fo)t(Eq. 1) where (γ-AmNS)UTP0 is the quantity of (γ-AmNS)UTP at time 0, F0 is the fluorescence emission intensity at time 0, and Ft is the fluorescence emission intensity at time t. Reaction rates with culture supernatants containing MccJ25 derivatives were compared with reaction rates of positive controls (culture supernatants from cells harboring pTUC202) and of negative controls (culture supernatants from nontransformed DH5α cells). Since assays are performed using unfractionated culture supernatants, results depend on quantities of MccJ25 derivatives in culture supernatants as well as on intrinsic inhibitory activities of MccJ25 derivatives. Therefore, assays must be considered as qualitative, plus-or-minus assays. In this work, all culture supernatants exhibiting unequivocally above-background inhibitory activities (i.e. inhibitory activities >20% of the inhibitory activity of wild-type MccJ25) are scored as positives. Results reported are based on at least two independent determinations (with full agreement among determinations in >95% of cases).Analysis of Inhibition of Bacterial Growth—E. coli strain DH5α or Shigella flexneri clinical isolate BK 12440 (provided by Dr. B. Kreisworth, Public Health Research Institute Inc., Newark, NJ) were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of M9 medium (15Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Aliquots (50 μl; ∼1 × 109 cells) were mixed with 3 ml of LB top agar (0.8% LB agar) at 45 °C and were applied as overlays to plates containing 25 ml of standard LB agar. After hardening of overlays, 5-μl drops of culture supernatants containing MccJ25 derivatives (prepared as above) or purified MccJ25 were deposited on surfaces of overlays, drops were allowed to dry, plates were incubated for 5-8 h at 37 °C, and plates were examined for the presence of growth inhibition zones. Results with culture supernatants containing MccJ25 derivative were compared with results of positive controls (culture supernatants from cells harboring pTUC202) and of negative controls (culture supernatants from nontransformed DH5α cells). For each derivative, microbiological tests were performed at least three times, with no conflicting results between the tests. Since most assays are performed using unfractionated culture supernatants, results depend on quantities of MccJ25 derivatives in culture supernatants as well as on intrinsic inhibitory activities of MccJ25 derivatives. Therefore, these assays must be considered as qualitative, plus-or-minus assays. In this work, all culture supernatants exhibiting unequivocally inhibitory activities (determined as the presence of anabiosis haloes) are scored as positives.RESULTSSystematic Mutational Scan of MccJ25—We constructed all possible single-amino acid substitutions of residues 1-7 and 9-21 of MccJ25. These residues comprise seven of eight residues of the MccJ25 cycle and all 13 residues of the MccJ25 tail. In addition, we constructed one substitution of residue 8 of MccJ25, the side chain of which forms the lactam bond that defines the MccJ25 cycle (5Wilson K.A. Kalkum M. Ottesen J. Yuzenkova J.

In total, we constructed and analyzed 381 single-amino acid substitutions of MccJ25.Substitutions were constructed by mutagenesis of the mcjA gene, which encodes the MccJ25 precursor (9Solbiati J.O. Ciaccio M. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3661-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on a plasmid-borne mcjABCD biosynthetic gene cluster (9Solbiati J.O. Ciaccio M. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3661-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by expression of the mutant mcjABCD biosynthetic gene cluster (see “Experimental Procedures”).Determinants for Production, Maturation, and Stability of MccJ25—To assess effects of substitutions on production of MccJ25 (comprising synthesis of MccJ25 precursor, processing of MccJ25 precursor, export of mature MccJ25, and stability of mature MccJ25), we prepared culture supernatants of cells harboring substituted mcjABCD biosynthetic gene clusters, and we assayed culture supernatants for the presence of substituted mature MccJ25 by use of MALDI-MS. We tested 381 single-amino acid substitutions of MccJ25, comprising all possible single-amino acid substitutions at residues 1-7 and 9-21 of MccJ25 and one single-amino acid substitution at residue 8 of MccJ25.Unequivocal mass ions corresponding to expected masses of mutant mature MccJ25 derivatives were detected for 242 of the 381 tested mutants (64%; Fig. 1). It is striking that such a high fraction, nearly two-thirds, of mutant MccJ25 derivatives is competent for production, maturation, export, and stability.The results indicate that wild-type side chains are strictly essential for production/maturation/export/stability only for three residues of MccJ25 (i.e. the two residues that form the lactam bond that defines the MccJ25 cycle (Gly1 and Glu8) and one adjacent residue (Gly2)) (Fig. 1 and data not shown). For these residues, no tested substitutions are compatible with production/maturation/export/stability. The results indicate that the wild-type side chain is important, albeit not strictly essential, at one residue (i.e. the distal aromatic residue of the pair of aromatic residues proposed to trap the threaded segment of the MccJ25 tail within the MccJ25 cycle: Tyr20) (Fig. 1). For this residue, only two tested substitutions, Tyr20 > Phe20 and Tyr20 > Ile20, are compatible with production/maturation/export/stability. Interestingly, the proximal aromatic residue of the pair of aromatic residues proposed to trap the threaded segment of the MccJ25 tail within the MccJ25 cycle, Phe19, is considerably much more tolerant of substitution (with eight substitutions being tolerated; Fig. 1).Wild-type side chains at residues 11-14, located within the loop segment of the MccJ25 tail, are totally (positions 11-13) or nearly totally (position 14) dispensable for MccJ25 production/maturation/export/stability, consistent with previous results indicating that these residues can be deleted, substituted, or chemically modified without loss of function (13Mukhopadhyay J. Sineva E. Knight J. Levy R.M. Ebright R.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Semenova E. Yuzenkova Y. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3859-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 4J. Mukhopadhyay and R. H. Ebright, unpublished results. In summary, the results for production/maturation/export/stability indicate that there is a strict requirement for wild-type side chains at and adjacent to the site of proteolytic cleavage of the MccJ25 precursor (residues 1 and 2), at and adjacent to the site of cyclization of the MccJ25 precursor (residues 1, 2, and 8), and at the distal aromatic residue that locks the threaded segment of the MccJ25 threaded tail within the MccJ25 cycle. Side chains of the N-terminal half of the MccJ25 tail, the segment that forms the loop of the MccJ25 tail, are unimportant. Perhaps surprisingly, side chains of three of eight residues within the MccJ25 cycle also are relatively unimportant.Determinants of MccJ25 for Inhibition of RNAP—To assess the effects of substitutions on inhibition of RNAP by MccJ25, we prepared culture supernatants of cells harboring substituted mcjABCD biosynthetic gene clusters, and we assayed culture supernatants for the ability to inhibit RNAP in vitro. We tested 242 single-amino acid substitutions of MccJ25, comprising all single-amino acid substitutions found to be compatible with production/maturation/export/stability of MccJ25 (see above). The results indicate that 155 of the 242 substituted MccJ25 derivatives competent for production/maturation/export/stability also are competent for inhibition of RNAP (64%; Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effects of single-amino acid substitutions in MccJ25 on inhibition of RNAP. Data are presented for 242 single-amino acid substitution derivatives of MccJ25, comprising all substitutions shown to be competent for production/maturation/export/stability (see Fig. 1). The sequence of MccJ25 is shown at the bottom. The heights of bars indicate the percentage of tested amino acid substitutions that do not prevent inhibition of RNAP by MccJ25. Letters within bars list amino acid substitutions that do not prevent inhibition of RNAP by MccJ25.

For this residue, no tested substitutions are compatible with inhibition of RNAP. The results indicate that the wild-type side chains of five additional residues are important, albeit not strictly essential (i.e. the wild-type side chains of two residues within the MccJ25 cycle (Gly4 and Pro7), one residue nearly immediately following the MccJ25 cycle (Phe10), and the proximal aromatic residue of the pair of aromatic residues proposed to trap the threaded segment of the MccJ25 tail within the MccJ25 cycle (Phe19)) (Fig. 2). For each of these residues, <40% of tested substitutions, typically substitutions conservative with respect to size and/or conservative with respect to polarity, are compatible with inhibition of RNAP. We infer that the wild-type side chains of these residues (Gly4, Pro7, Tyr9, Phe10, and Phe19) are likely to make direct interactions with RNAP in the RNAP-MccJ25 complex. We note that the wild-type side chains of these residues all are hydrophobic and in three cases are aromatic, and we suggest that RNAP-MccJ25 interactions involve predominantly hydrophobic interactions.Wild-type side chains at residues 11-15, located within the loop segment of the MccJ25 tail, are totally, or nearly totally, dispensable for inhibition of RNAP, consistent with previous results indicating that these residues can be deleted, substituted, or chemically modified without loss of function (13Mukhopadhyay J.

https://openalex.org/W1989476825,"Neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor are thought to define a set of specific brain circuits involved in fear and anxiety. Here we provide evidence for a novel, NPS-responsive circuit that shapes neural activity in the mouse basolateral amygdala (BLA) via the endopiriform nucleus (EPN). Using slice preparations, we demonstrate that NPS directly activates an inward current in 20% of EPN neurons and evokes an increase of glutamatergic excitation in this nucleus. Excitation of the EPN is responsible for a modulation of BLA activity through NPS, characterized by a general increase of GABAergic inhibition and enhancement of spike activity in a subset of BLA projection neurons. Finally, local injection of NPS to the EPN interferes with the expression of contextual, but not auditory cued fear memory. Together, these data suggest the existence of a specific NPS-responsive circuitry between EPN and BLA, likely involved in contextual aspects of fear memory."
https://openalex.org/W2163426704,"The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is pivotal to the cellular anti-oxidative defence strategies in most organisms. Although its production mediated by different enzyme systems has been relatively well-studied, metabolic networks dedicated to the biogenesis of NADPH have not been fully characterized. In this report, a metabolic pathway that promotes the conversion of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), a pro-oxidant into NADPH has been uncovered in Pseudomonas fluorescens exposed to oxidative stress. Enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase (PC), malic enzyme (ME), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), malate synthase (MS), and isocitrate lyase (ICL) that are involved in disparate metabolic modules, converged to create a metabolic network aimed at the transformation of NADH into NADPH. The downregulation of phosphoenol carboxykinase (PEPCK) and the upregulation of pyruvate kinase (PK) ensured that this metabolic cycle fixed NADH into NADPH to combat the oxidative stress triggered by the menadione insult. This is the first demonstration of a metabolic network invoked to generate NADPH from NADH, a process that may be very effective in combating oxidative stress as the increase of an anti-oxidant is coupled to the decrease of a pro-oxidant."
https://openalex.org/W1987169606,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited pleiotropic disease that results from abnormalities in the gene that codes for the chloride channel, Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). CF patients are frequently colonized by several pathogens, but the mechanisms that allow colonization in spite of apparently functional immune systems are incompletely understood. In this paper we show that blood peripheral monocytes isolated from CF patients are found in an endotoxin tolerance state, yet this is not due to a deficient TLR activation. On the other hand, levels of the amplifier of inflammatory responses, TREM-1 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells), are notably down-regulated in monocytes from patients, in comparison to those extracted from healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the soluble form of TREM-1 (sTREM-1) was not detected in the sera of patients. Additionally, and in strict contrast to patients who suffer from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), CF monocytes challenged ex vivo with LPS neither up-regulated membrane-anchored TREM-1 nor sTREM-1. Finally, similar levels of PGE(2) expression and p65 translocation into the nucleus were found in both patients and healthy volunteers, thus suggesting that TREM-1 regulation is neither controlled by PGE(2) levels nor by p65 activation in this case. However, PU.1 translocation into the nucleus was significantly higher in CF monocytes than in controls, suggesting a role for this transcription factor in the control of TREM-1 expression. We conclude that down-regulation of TREM-1 expression in cystic fibrosis patients is at least partly responsible for the endotoxin tolerance state in which their monocytes are locked."
https://openalex.org/W2060725084,"We have recently shown that two proteins containing RRM-type RNA-binding domains, FCA and FPA, originally identified through their role in flowering time control in Arabidopsis, silence transposons and other repeated sequences in the Arabidopsis genome. In flowering control, FCA and FPA function in the autonomous pathway with conserved chromatin regulators, the histone demethylase FLD and the MSI1-homologue FVE, a conserved WD-repeat protein found in many chromatin complexes. Here, we investigate how the RRM proteins interact genetically with these chromatin regulators at a range of loci in the Arabidopsis genome. We also investigate their interaction with the DNA methylation pathway. In several cases the RRM protein activity at least partially required a chromatin regulator to effect silencing. However, the interactions of the autonomous pathway components differed at each target analysed, most likely determined by certain properties of the target loci and/or other silencing pathways. We speculate that the RNA-binding proteins FCA and FPA function as part of a transcriptome surveillance mechanism linking RNA recognition with chromatin silencing mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2037878697,"Histone-modifying enzymes are essential for a wide variety of cellular processes dependent upon changes in gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) lead to the compaction of chromatin and subsequent silencing of gene transcription, and they have recently been implicated in a diversity of functions and dysfunctions in the postnatal and adult brain including ocular dominance plasticity, memory consolidation, drug addiction, and depression. Here we investigate the role of HDACs in the generation of neurons and astrocytes in the embryonic brain.As a variety of HDACs are expressed in differentiating neural progenitor cells, we have taken a pharmacological approach to inhibit multiple family members. Inhibition of class I and II HDACs in developing mouse embryos with trichostatin A resulted in a dramatic reduction in neurogenesis in the ganglionic eminences and a modest increase in neurogenesis in the cortex. An identical effect was observed upon pharmacological inhibition of HDACs in in vitro-differentiating neural precursors derived from the same brain regions. A reduction in neurogenesis in ganglionic eminence-derived neural precursors was accompanied by an increase in the production of immature astrocytes. We show that HDACs control neurogenesis by inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein BMP2/4 signaling pathway in radial glial cells. HDACs function at the transcriptional level by inhibiting and promoting, respectively, the expression of Bmp2 and Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of BMP signaling. Inhibition of the BMP2/4 signaling pathway restored normal levels of neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis to both ganglionic eminence- and cortex-derived cultures in which HDACs were inhibited.Our results demonstrate a transcriptionally-based regulation of BMP2/4 signaling by HDACs both in vivo and in vitro that is critical for neurogenesis in the ganglionic eminences and that modulates cortical neurogenesis. The results also suggest that HDACs may regulate the developmental switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis that occurs in late gestation."

However, the HCV life cycle is only partially understood because it has not been possible to infect normal human hepatocytes in culture. The current Huh-7 systems use cloned, synthetic HCV RNA expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells to produce virions, but these cells cannot be infected with naturally occurring HCV obtained from infected patients. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we describe a human hepatocyte culture permissible to the direct infection with naturally occurring HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the blood of HCV-infected patients. The culture system mimics the biology and kinetics of HCV infection in humans, and produces infectious virions that can infect naïve human hepatocytes. Conclusions/Significance This culture system should complement the existing systems, and may facilitate the understanding of the HCV life cycle, its effects in the natural host cell, the hepatocyte, as well as the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2079466113,"While basic mechanisms of several major molecular chaperones are well understood, this machinery has been known to be involved in folding of only limited number of proteins inside the cells. Here, we report a chaperone type of protein folding facilitated by interaction with RNA. When an RNA-binding module is placed at the N-terminus of aggregation-prone target proteins, this module, upon binding with RNA, further promotes the solubility of passenger proteins, potentially leading to enhancement of proper protein folding. Studies on in vitro refolding in the presence of RNA, coexpression of RNA molecules in vivo and the mutants with impaired RNA binding ability suggests that RNA can exert chaperoning effect on their bound proteins. The results suggest that RNA binding could affect the overall kinetic network of protein folding pathway in favor of productive folding over off-pathway aggregation. In addition, the RNA binding-mediated solubility enhancement is extremely robust for increasing soluble yield of passenger proteins and could be usefully implemented for high-throughput protein expression for functional and structural genomic research initiatives. The RNA-mediated chaperone type presented here would give new insights into de novo folding in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1967542513,"Ginseng, a traditional herbal medicine, may interact with several co-administered drugs in clinical settings, and ginsenosides, the major active components of ginseng, may be responsible for these ginseng-drug interactions (GDIs). Results from previous studies on ginsenosides' effects on human drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes are inconsistent and confusing. Herein, we first evaluated the inhibitory effects of fifteen ginsenosides and sapogenins on human CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes by using commercially available fluorescent probes. The structure-activity relationship of their effects on the P450s was also explored and a pharmacophore model was established for CYP3A4. Moreover, substrate-dependent phenomena were found in ginsenosides' effects on CYP3A4 when another fluorescent probe was used, and were further confirmed in tests with conventional drug probes and human liver microsomes. These substrate-dependent effects of the ginsenosides may provide an explanation for the inconsistent results obtained in previous GDI reports."
https://openalex.org/W2000507520,"The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) functions as a transcriptional repressor through a mechanism that involves methylation of Histone H3 at lysine 27. The PRC2 complex activity is essential for cellular proliferation, development, and cell fate decisions. PRC2 target genes include important regulators of development and proliferation as well as tumor suppressor genes. Consistent with this, the activity of several Polycomb group (PcG) proteins is deregulated in human cancer suggesting an important role for PcGs in tumor development. Whereas the downstream functions of PcGs are well characterized, the mechanisms of their recruitment to target genes and the regulation of their activity are not fully understood.Here we show that the two PRC2 components SUZ12 and EZH2 are sumoylated in vitro and in vivo. Among several putative sumoylation sites we have mapped the major site of SUZ12 sumoylation. Furthermore, we show that SUZ12 interacts with the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9 both in vitro and in vivo and that mutation of the SUZ12 sumoylation site does not abolish this binding. Finally, we provide evidence that the E3-ligase PIASXbeta interacts and enhances the sumoylation of SUZ12 in vivo suggesting that PIASXbeta could function as an E3-ligase for SUZ12.Taken together, our data identify sumoylation as a novel post-translational modification of components of the PRC2 complex, which could suggest a potential new mechanism to modulate PRC2 repressive activity. Further work aimed to identify the physiological conditions for these modifications will be required to understand the role of SUZ12 and EZH2 sumoylation in PcG-mediated epigenetic regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2010759495,"Background Little is known about the impact of prey sexual dimorphism on predator-prey dynamics and the impact of sex-selective harvesting and trophy hunting on long-term stability of exploited populations. Methodology and Principal Findings We review the quantitative evidence for sex-selective predation and study its long-term consequences using several simple predator-prey models. These models can be also interpreted in terms of feedback between harvesting effort and population size of the harvested species under open-access exploitation. Among the 81 predator-prey pairs found in the literature, male bias in predation is 2.3 times as common as female bias. We show that long-term effects of sex-selective predation depend on the interplay of predation bias and prey mating system. Predation on the ‘less limiting’ prey sex can yield a stable predator-prey equilibrium, while predation on the other sex usually destabilizes the dynamics and promotes population collapses. For prey mating systems that we consider, males are less limiting except for polyandry and polyandrogyny, and male-biased predation alone on such prey can stabilize otherwise unstable dynamics. On the contrary, our results suggest that female-biased predation on polygynous, polygynandrous or monogamous prey requires other stabilizing mechanisms to persist. Conclusions and Significance Our modelling results suggest that the observed skew towards male-biased predation might reflect, in addition to sexual selection, the evolutionary history of predator-prey interactions. More focus on these phenomena can yield additional and interesting insights as to which mechanisms maintain the persistence of predator-prey pairs over ecological and evolutionary timescales. Our results can also have implications for long-term sustainability of harvesting and trophy hunting of sexually dimorphic species."
https://openalex.org/W2023879035,"Transplant patients would benefit from reduction of immunosuppression providing that graft rejection is prevented. We have evaluated a number of immunological markers in blood of patients in whom tacrolimus was withdrawn after renal transplantation. The alloreactive precursor frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the frequency of T cell subsets and the functional capacity of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) were analyzed before transplantation and before tacrolimus reduction. In a case-control design, the results were compared between patients with (n = 15) and without (n = 28) acute rejection after tacrolimus withdrawal.Prior to tacrolimus reduction, the ratio between memory CD8+ T cells and Treg was higher in rejectors compared to non-rejectors. Rejectors also had a higher ratio between memory CD4+ T cells and Treg, and ratios <20 were only observed in non-rejectors. Between the time of transplantation and the start of tacrolimus withdrawal, an increase in naive T cell frequencies and a reciprocal decrease of effector T cell percentages was observed in rejectors. The proportion of Treg within the CD4+ T cells decreased after transplantation, but anti-donor regulatory capacity of Treg remained unaltered in rejectors and non-rejectors.Immunological monitoring revealed an association between acute rejection following the withdrawal of tacrolimus and 1) the ratio of memory T cells and Treg prior to the start of tacrolimus reduction, and 2) changes in the distribution of naive, effector and memory T cells over time. Combination of these two biomarkers allowed highly specific identification of patients in whom immunosuppression could be safely reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2034785760,"Many microorganisms, including bacteria of the class Streptomycetes, produce various secondary metabolites including antibiotics to gain a competitive advantage in their natural habitat. The production of these compounds is highly coordinated in a population to expedite accumulation to an effective concentration. Furthermore, as antibiotics are often toxic even to their producers, a coordinated production allows microbes to first arm themselves with a defense mechanism to resist their own antibiotics before production commences. One possible mechanism of coordination among individuals is through the production of signaling molecules. The γ-butyrolactone system in Streptomyces coelicolor is a model of such a signaling system for secondary metabolite production. The accumulation of these signaling molecules triggers antibiotic production in the population. A pair of repressor-amplifier proteins encoded by scbA and scbR mediates the production and action of one particular γ-butyrolactone, SCB1. Based on the proposed interactions of scbA and scbR, a mathematical model was constructed and used to explore the ability of this system to act as a robust genetic switch. Stability analysis shows that the butyrolactone system exhibits bistability and, in response to a threshold SCB1 concentration, can switch from an OFF state to an ON state corresponding to the activation of genes in the cryptic type I polyketide synthase gene cluster, which are responsible for production of the hypothetical polyketide. The switching time is inversely related to the inducer concentration above the threshold, such that short pulses of low inducer concentration cannot switch on the system, suggesting its possible role in noise filtering. In contrast, secondary metabolite production can be triggered rapidly in a population of cells producing the butyrolactone signal due to the presence of an amplification loop in the system. S. coelicolor was perturbed experimentally by varying concentrations of SCB1, and the model simulations match the experimental data well. Deciphering the complexity of this butyrolactone switch will provide valuable insights into how robust and efficient systems can be designed using “simple” two-protein networks."
https://openalex.org/W1972774385,"Background The medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in a variety of cognitive and executive processes such as decision making and working memory. The medial prefrontal cortex of rodents consists of several areas including the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex that are thought to be involved in different aspects of cognitive performance. Despite the distinct roles in cognitive behavior that have been attributed to prelimbic and infralimbic cortex, little is known about neuronal network functioning of these areas, and whether these networks show any interaction during fast network oscillations. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that fast network oscillations in rat infralimbic cortex slices occur at higher frequencies and with higher power than oscillations in prelimbic cortex. The difference in oscillation frequency disappeared when prelimbic and infralimbic cortex were disconnected. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that neuronal networks of prelimbic and infralimbic cortex can sustain fast network oscillations independent of each other, but suggest that neuronal networks of prelimbic and infralimbic cortex are interacting during these oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2063454131,"Optimization of high affinity reagents is a significant bottleneck in medicine and the life sciences. The ability to synthetically create thousands of permutations of a lead high-affinity reagent and survey the properties of individual permutations in parallel could potentially relieve this bottleneck. Aptamers are single stranded oligonucleotides affinity reagents isolated by in vitro selection processes and as a class have been shown to bind a wide variety of target molecules.High density DNA microarray technology was used to synthesize, in situ, arrays of approximately 3,900 aptamer sequence permutations in triplicate. These sequences were interrogated on-chip for their ability to bind the fluorescently-labeled cognate target, immunoglobulin E, resulting in the parallel execution of thousands of experiments. Fluorescence intensity at each array feature was well resolved and shown to be a function of the sequence present. The data demonstrated high intra- and inter-chip correlation between the same features as well as among the sequence triplicates within a single array. Consistent with aptamer mediated IgE binding, fluorescence intensity correlated strongly with specific aptamer sequences and the concentration of IgE applied to the array.The massively parallel sequence-function analyses provided by this approach confirmed the importance of a consensus sequence found in all 21 of the original IgE aptamer sequences and support a common stem:loop structure as being the secondary structure underlying IgE binding. The microarray application, data and results presented illustrate an efficient, high information content approach to optimizing aptamer function. It also provides a foundation from which to better understand and manipulate this important class of high affinity biomolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1964589948,"Background DNA sequences from ancient speciments may in fact result from undetected contamination of the ancient specimens by modern DNA, and the problem is particularly challenging in studies of human fossils. Doubts on the authenticity of the available sequences have so far hampered genetic comparisons between anatomically archaic (Neandertal) and early modern (Cro-Magnoid) Europeans. Methodology/Principal Findings We typed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region I in a 28,000 years old Cro-Magnoid individual from the Paglicci cave, in Italy (Paglicci 23) and in all the people who had contact with the sample since its discovery in 2003. The Paglicci 23 sequence, determined through the analysis of 152 clones, is the Cambridge reference sequence, and cannot possibly reflect contamination because it differs from all potentially contaminating modern sequences. Conclusions/Significance: The Paglicci 23 individual carried a mtDNA sequence that is still common in Europe, and which radically differs from those of the almost contemporary Neandertals, demonstrating a genealogical continuity across 28,000 years, from Cro-Magnoid to modern Europeans. Because all potential sources of modern DNA contamination are known, the Paglicci 23 sample will offer a unique opportunity to get insight for the first time into the nuclear genes of early modern Europeans."
https://openalex.org/W1999412359,"Functional and structural alterations of clustered postsynaptic ligand gated ion channels in neuronal cells are thought to contribute to synaptic plasticity and memory formation in the human brain. Here, we describe a novel molecular mechanism for structural alterations of NR1 subunits of the NMDA receptor. In cultured rat spinal cord neurons, chronic NMDA receptor stimulation induces disappearance of extracellular epitopes of NMDA receptor NR1 subunits, which was prevented by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Immunoblotting revealed the digestion of solubilized NR1 subunits by MMP-3 and identified a fragment of about 60 kDa as MMPs-activity-dependent cleavage product of the NR1 subunit in cultured neurons. The expression of MMP-3 in the spinal cord culture was shown by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Recombinant NR1 glycine binding protein was used to identify MMP-3 cleavage sites within the extracellular S1 and S2-domains. N-terminal sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis revealed S542 and L790 as two putative major MMP-3 cleavage sites of the NR1 subunit. In conclusion, our data indicate that MMPs, and in particular MMP-3, are involved in the activity dependent alteration of NMDA receptor structure at postsynaptic membrane specializations in the CNS."

However, the link between electrical activity and biochemical cascade activation involved in the generation of the nuclear Ca2+ signaling is poorly understood.

In neurons, Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels and N-methyl-d-asparatic acid receptors has been shown to be important in nuclear Ca2+ signaling generation and, for example, in Ca2+-dependent regulation of gene expression (7Hawkins R.D.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The surface antigen CD38 has been mostly found at the plasma membrane with the catalytic site exposed to the extracellular space (29Malavasi F. Deaglio S. Ferrero E. Funaro A. Sancho J. Ausiello C.M.

To solve this topological paradox, several authors have proposed that CD38 could generate the synthesis of extracellular cADPR, which then may enter into the cell interior possibly through nucleoside transporters (30De Flora A.

The synthesis of NAADP through the base-exchange reaction by this enzyme requires exclusive acidic conditions. In the case of the Aplysia cyclase, although the base-exchange reaction depends critically on the pH, it appears that NAADP synthesis is possible at more neutral pH (26Aarhus R. Graeff R.M.

Clearly, our understanding of the physiological role of the expanding ADP-ribosyl cyclase family remains poor and the cyclase from Aplysia remains the only prototypical form for the soluble enzyme characterized in neurons so far. Pioneering work on the neurobiology of learning has been performed on Aplysia californica. For example, it has been found that synaptic potentiation at sensory-motor neuron synapses require Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels and/or Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores sensitive to IP3 and ryanodine depending of the potentiation type (7Hawkins R.D.

Our previous studies have shown that the soluble ADP-ribosyl cyclase is not only present in the neurons of the Aplysia buccal ganglion, but that its product cADPR, an endogenous modulator of the ryanodine receptors, can enhance the evoked synaptic transmission (39Mothet J.P. Fossier P. Meunier F.M. Stinnakre J. Tauc L. Baux G. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that NAADP, the other product of the cyclase, can increase neurotransmitter release at well identified cholinergic synapses (40Chameau P. Van de Vrede Y. Fossier P. Baux G. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 443: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further delineate the Ca2+ signaling pathway mediated by the Aplysia cyclase, we looked at its distribution in the Aplysia nervous system that has not been characterized. In this study, we have revealed for the first time that in resting conditions, the soluble Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase is localized in the cytosol of the soma of neurons. Importantly, we have found that depolarization of Aplysia neurons induces the translocation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase from the cytosol into the nucleus. The translocation is dependent on Ca2+ influx through the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels. We also show that the neuronal nucleus is a Ca2+ stores, which could generate specific nucleoplasmic Ca2+ signals in response to three different calcium messengers, cADPR, NAADP, both produced by the ADP-ribosyl cyclase, and IP3. Finally, we propose that the translocation of the Ca2+ signaling enzyme to nucleus following neuronal depolarization may provide a new link between the electrical activity and the biochemical cascades leading to nuclear Ca2+ signals generation. Preparation of Isolated Nuclei—Most of the experiments were done on nuclei isolated from abdominal, pedal, and pleural ganglia of adult A. californica and Aplysia punctata. The animals were first perfused with an isotonic MgCl2 solution and the ganglia, after extraction, were pinned in a chamber bathed with artificial seawater (ASW) (NaCl 460 mm; KCl 10 mm; CaCl2 11 mm; MgCl2 25 mm; MgSO4 28 mm; Tris-HCl buffer 10 mm; pH 7.8). The connective tissue packing the neurons was sharply removed with fine forceps. Then the neurons were gently broken in a homogenizer to extract the nuclei in an intracellular buffer with the following composition: KCl 450 mm; K2HPO4 2 mm; HEPES 50 mm; MgCl2 4 mm; CaCl2/EGTA (depending of the experiments); pH 7.2, adjusted with 5 n KOH. Some experiments were done on nuclei from the ganglia of A. punctata. No species differences were observed. Confocal Imaging—Preparations of nuclei were incubated with the different fluorescent Ca2+ probes. For the experiments performed on the nuclear envelope, Mag Fluo4 AM was used (λex = 494 nm and λem = 516 nm) (Kd = 22 μm). The free Ca2+ concentration of the intracellular medium was strongly buffered to 400 nm using 1.4 mm Ca2+ and 2 mm EGTA. During loading, nuclei were incubated with 30 μm Mag Fluo4 AM and 5 mm ATP for 1 h in the intracellular medium. To measure Ca2+ changes in the nucleoplasmic space, we loaded the nuclei with 10-kDa Fluo-4 dextran (λex = 494 nm and λem = 516 nm) (Kd = 3 μm) at a concentration of 20 μm together with 3 mm ATP for 1 h. The intracellular medium was buffered to 100 nm free Ca2+. All experiments were performed at room temperature in the same Ca2+/EGTA buffers used for loading the probe with a final ATP concentration of 3 mm. The loaded nuclei were placed on a polylysine-coated coverslip in a chamber. Ca2+ changes in the lumen of the nuclear envelope were measured using an inverted Leica SP2 RS confocal microscope (objective ×40 and ×20) and the data analyzed with the 2.5 Leica confocal software. Most of the nucleoplasmic Ca2+ measurements were done using the same confocal imaging system. But some were also performed using a right Olympus microscope (objective ×40) coupled with a CCD camera and a xenon lamp. Images were analyzed with the Axon Imaging Workbench software. For all experiments, Ca2+ concentration changes are expressed in fluorescence ratio as f/f0 (fluorescence/fluorescence at the beginning of the experiment). For immunocytochemistry, buccal or pleural ganglia were dissected and incubated with KCl to induce depolarization. They were then fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) in ASW for 40 min. Neurons were then permeabilized for 10 min with a solution containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton in PBS. Ganglia were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (1/10 dilution) raised against the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (41Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J.

Before mounting in Vectashield Hardset (Vector), ganglia were bathed with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (100 ng/ml) for 15 min (λex = 405 nm and λem = 461 nm). Neuron depolarization was achieved by the addition of KCl (110 mm) for 20 min (with equimolar substitution of NaCl in control experiments). Ganglia were incubated for at least 30 min in the presence of Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM, 50 μm, Molecular Probes) or Ca2+ channel inhibitors (nifedipine, 10 μm from Sigma, and ω-conotoxins CN VIIA and S VI B, 5 μm, kind gift of Dr. J. Molgo) before KCl depolarization. In the case of conotoxins, the ganglia were incubated in Ca2+-free ASW for 30 min and then reperfused with standard ASW before KCl stimulation. To measure Ca2+ changes in the intact Aplysia neurons, we used as previously described intracellular injections of Rhod-2 (Kd 570 nm), selected as the best Ca2+-sensitive probe in Aplysia neurons that exhibit autofluorescence at some excitation wavelengths (40Chameau P. Van de Vrede Y. Fossier P. Baux G. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 443: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Intracellular injections were performed using air pressure pulses delivered by controlled air valves (Pico Pump, WPI). The Rhod-2 concentration in the injecting pipette was at 1 mm and neurons were injected until they appeared dark red with an estimated dye concentration of 100 μm. Neurons were depolarized by addition of 60 mm KCl (with equimolar substitution of NaCl). To visualize DNA in the Aplysia ganglia, we used the cell-permeant SYTO 13 Green from Molecular Probes at a concentration of 5 μm (λex = 488 nm and λem = 509 nm). Sequence Analysis—The sequence of the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase was scanned for consensus motifs homologies, using the Prosite Data base on the ExPASy Proteomic server. Localization of the Aplysia Cyclase in Intact Nervous Ganglia—The Aplysia cyclase was first discovered in the ovotestis (28Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 42Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but its distribution in the nervous system of Aplysia has not been characterized. Typical Aplysia neurons contain a large nucleus surrounded by a thin cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). The localization of the enzyme was revealed by confocal microscopy using a specific antibody raised against the cyclase (41Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In resting conditions, the cyclase was almost exclusively localized in the thin cytosol surrounding the nucleus of the soma (Fig. 1B, n = 75/81). To investigate whether the cyclase distribution could change during neuronal activities, the neurons were depolarized for 20 min by the addition of KCl, which evoked a Ca2+ response (Fig. 1D, n = 7). Under depolarizing conditions, nuclear localization of the enzyme was dramatically enhanced (Fig. 1C, n = 35/42). This depolarization-induced Ca2+ elevation and translocation of the cyclase was prevented by prior incubation of the ganglia with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (50 μm, 30 min, n = 28/29) (Fig. 2, A, B, and E, n = 4). The next step was to investigate what types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels could be involved in our observation. Previous studies from our laboratory on Aplysia neurons have shown that during neuronal depolarization the Ca2+ currents are reduced nearly 40-50% in the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine and N-type, P-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels block nearly 40% of calcium influx during depolarization by conotoxins (43Fossier P. Tauc L. Baux G. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 161-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). So, in Aplysia neurons, 80-90% Ca2+ entry occurred through L-type, N-type, and P-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.FIGURE 2Pharmacology of the Aplysia cyclase translocation Aplysia neurons. Addition of BAPTA-AM prevented the translocation of the enzyme (A). Nifedipine similarly inhibited the nuclear translocation of the cyclase in response to KCl depolarization (B), whereas activation of L-type Ca2+ channel by Bay K-8644 evoked nuclear translocation of the cyclase (C). Application of ω-conotoxins had no effect on the depolarization-induced translocation (D). E, Ca2+ responses evoked by a sustained KCl depolarization of neurons is markedly reduced in the presence of nifedipine (10 μm) or after pre-treatment of the neurons with BAPTA-AM at 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In our experiments, extracellular addition of the L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor (nifedipine 10 μm, Sigma, n = 33/33) likewise prevented the translocation and reduced dramatically the Ca2+ responses evoked by KCl (Fig. 2, B and E, n = 4). In addition, activation of the L-type Ca2+ channel by Bay K-8644 at 10 μm evoked nuclear translocation of the cyclase (Fig. 2C, n = 24/53). In contrast, extracellular application of ω-conotoxins (CN VIIA and S VI B, 5 μm), which block the N- and P-type Ca2+ channels, did not affect the depolarization-induced translocation of the cyclase (Fig. 2D, n = 15/20). These data indicate that translocation of the cyclase to the nucleus is a Ca2+-dependent process triggered by Ca2+ entry through the L-type voltage-dependent channels, which, in turn, are activated by membrane depolarization. The Nuclear Envelope Is a Ca2+ Store Sensitive to Intracellular Ca2+ Releasing Messengers—Cytosolic Ca2+ buffering by the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria (16Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 369-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 17Gomes D.A. Leite M.F. Bennett A.M. Nathanson M.H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 325-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could insulate the nucleus (18Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although it is poorly known in neurons, the nucleus could be autonomous by mobilization of Ca2+ sequestered into the nuclear envelope (11Bezin S. Fossier P. Cancela J.M. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the nuclear Ca2+ stores are responsive to both cADPR (11Bezin S. Fossier P. Cancela J.M. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and NAADP, the two Ca2+ messengers produced by the Aplysia cyclase, the large nuclei of the Aplysia neurons were isolated. The luminal Ca2+ of the nuclear envelope was measured by loading Mag Fluo-4 (30 μm) into the lumen, using a membrane permeant AM-form of the Ca2+-sensitive dye of low affinity (Fig. 3A). Fluorimetric measurements using confocal microscopy showed that the luminal space could be loaded with Ca2+ following the addition of ATP (5 mm) suggesting that Ca2+-ATPase is involved in nuclear store refilling (Fig. 3B) (n = 3). More importantly, addition of the second messengers IP3 (5-10 μm; n = 8) or cADPR (5-10 μm; n = 8) (Fig. 3, C and D) likewise decreased the Ca2+ concentration in the nuclear envelope, indicating that it is a fully functional Ca2+ store. NAADP is known to produce a biphasic response, releasing Ca2+ from the sensitive stores at low concentrations while desensitizing its own receptor at high concentrations (44Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Various NAADP concentrations, ranging from 10 nm to 100 μm, were thus tested on the isolated nuclei (Fig. 3, E-G). With NAADP in the nanomolar range (10-500 nm), all nuclei examined responded with decreases in Ca2+ contents (n = 3 for each concentration) (Fig. 3, E and F). In stark contrast, at 1 and 10 μm, NAADP failed to evoke a Ca2+ response in 2 of 3 nuclei tested for each concentration and at 100 μm NAADP, 5 of 6 nuclei, showed no response (Fig. 3G). Finally, if the nuclear Ca2+ stores were first depleted by thapsigargin (5 μm), a widely used inhibitor of the sarco(endoplasmic) Ca2+-ATPase, neither IP3 nor NAADP could release any additional Ca2+, indicating that both messengers release Ca2+ from the same thapsigargin-sensitive stores (Fig. 3H, n = 8 and 10, respectively). To determine whether the Ca2+ release from the nuclear envelope would result in an increase of Ca2+ in the nucleoplasm, a fluorescent Ca2+ probe, Fluo-4 dextran (10 kDa, 20 μm), was loaded into the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4A). Addition of IP3 (10 μm; n = 21), cADPR (5 μm; n = 14), or NAADP (500 nm; n = 37) at the optimal concentrations determined above indeed evoked a modest (supplemental Fig. S1A) but significant increase of the nucleoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 4, B-D). In many nuclei, intranuclear Ca2+ fluctuation events called oscillations were observed on the top of a Ca2+ transient response following application of the second messengers (Fig. 4. B-D). The oscillations were characterized by amplitude of about 0.1 ΔF/F and duration of about 10 s and occurred in bursts. The duration of the Ca2+ oscillation period varied among the nuclei and the frequency was estimated by dividing the number of oscillations by the duration of the burst. In 64% of the investigated nuclei, NAADP evoked 0.7 ± 0.06 oscillations/min for 1340 ± 140 s (n = 18/28), whereas IP3 evoked 1.1 ± 0.14 oscillations/min for 1300 ± 150 s in 55% of the nuclei (n = 5/9). The difference in the mean frequency evoked by IP3 and NAADP was statistically significant (p = 0.012). The mean frequency of cADPR-evoked Ca2+ oscillations was 0.9 ± 0.13/min, for 1075 ± 290 s, in 75% of the nuclei (n = 6/8), which was not significantly different from either of the two means listed above. The nuclear Ca2+ oscillations suggest that the release mechanisms involved are capable of self-limiting by feedback. Indeed, none of the three Ca2+ messengers were able to totally discharge the nuclear stores. Addition of a Ca2+ ionophore (ionomycin, 5 μm) elicited a much larger increase. Also consistent with feedback is the transient nature of the Ca2+ increase (supplemental data Fig. S1B). The decline is most likely due to diffusion of Ca2+ out of the nuclei through the nuclear pores, following cessation of Ca2+ release. As shown in supplemental data Fig. S1A, after the release induced by IP3 had reached the peak and started to decline, addition of Ca2+ (10 mm) elicited a rapid and large increase in the nucleoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, which could be buffered back by EGTA, indicating that the nuclear pores are permeant to Ca2+, in agreement with previous work (13Gerasimenko J.V.

Similar results were obtained after the NAADP- or cADPR-induced release (n = 6). In contrast to nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 5A), 100 μm NAADP failed to induce an increase of the nucleoplasmic Ca2+ (n = 9), consistent with the biphasic behavior described above (Fig. 3). However, subsequent addition of cADPR (5 μm) still resulted in a nucleoplasmic Ca2+ increase (n = 5) (Fig. 5A). Thus, self-desensitization of the NAADP release mechanism did not impair the effect of cADPR on these nuclei, indicating that cADPR and NAADP target different release mechanisms in the nuclear envelope. The specificity of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release was verified by testing two inactive analogs of NAADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP,"

To investigate the role of the major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) in conferring pathogen resistance, we challenged Xenopus laevis tadpoles bearing different combinations of four MHC haplotypes (f, g, j, and r) with the bacterial pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila in two experiments. In the first, we exposed ff, fg, gg, gj, and jj tadpoles, obtained from breeding MHC homozygous parents, to one of three doses of A. hydrophila or heat-killed bacteria as a control. In the second, we exposed ff, fg, fr, gg, rg, and rr tadpoles, obtained from breeding MHC heterozygous parents and subsequently genotyped by PCR, to A. hydrophila, heat-killed bacteria or media alone as controls. We thereby determined whether the same patterns of MHC resistance emerged within as among families, independent of non-MHC heritable differences. Tadpoles with r or g MHC haplotypes were more likely to die than were those with f or j haplotypes. Growth rates varied among MHC types, independent of exposure dose. Heterozygous individuals with both susceptible and resistant haplotypes were intermediate to either homozygous genotype in both size and survival. The effect of the MHC on growth and survival was consistent between experiments and across families. MHC alleles differentially confer resistance to, or tolerance of, the bacterial pathogen, which affects tadpoles' growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2048917856,"Background Pluri-potent bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) provide an attractive opportunity to generate unlimited glucose-responsive insulin-producing cells for the treatment of diabetes. We explored the potential for human MSCs (hMSCs) to be differentiated into glucose-responsive cells through a non-viral genetic reprogramming approach. Methods and Findings Two hMSC lines were transfected with three genes: PDX-1, NeuroD1 and Ngn3 without subsequent selection, followed by differentiation induction in vitro and transplantation into diabetic mice. Human MSCs expressed mRNAs of the archetypal stem cell markers: Sox2, Oct4, Nanog and CD34, and the endocrine cell markers: PDX-1, NeuroD1, Ngn3, and Nkx6.1. Following gene transfection and differentiation induction, hMSCs expressed insulin in vitro, but were not glucose regulated. After transplantation, hMSCs differentiated further and ∼12.5% of the grafted cells expressed insulin. The graft bearing kidneys contained mRNA of insulin and other key genes required for the functions of beta cells. Mice transplanted with manipulated hMSCs showed reduced blood glucose levels (from 18.9+/−0.75 to 7.63+/−1.63 mM). 13 of the 16 mice became normoglycaemic (6.9+/−0.64 mM), despite the failure to detect the expression of SUR1, a K+-ATP channel component required for regulation of insulin secretion. Conclusions Our data confirm that hMSCs can be induced to express insulin sufficient to reduce blood glucose in a diabetic mouse model. Our triple gene approach has created cells that seem less glucose responsive in vitro but which become more efficient after transplantation. The maturation process requires further study, particularly the in vivo factors influencing the differentiation, in order to scale up for clinical purposes."

Gene annotation of this MHC was completed and identified 183 possible coding regions, 147 human homologues, possible functional genes and 36 pseudo/unidentified genes) by GENSCAN and BLASTN, BLASTP RepeatMasker programs. The first region spans 2.976 Mbp sequence, which encodes six classical class II antigens (three DRA and three DRB antigens) lacking the functional DP, DQ regions, nine antigen processing molecules (DOA/DOB, DMA/DMB, TAPASIN, and LMP2/LMP7,TAP1/TAP2), 52 class III genes, nineteen class I genes/gene fragments (FLAI-A to FLAI-S). Three class I genes (FLAI-H, I-K, I-E) may encode functional classical class I antigens based on deduced amino acid sequence and promoter structure. The second region spans 0.362 Mbp sequence encoding no class I genes and 18 cross-species conserved genes, excluding class I, II and their functionally related/associated genes, namely framework genes, including three olfactory receptor genes. One previously identified feline endogenous retrovirus, a baboon retrovirus derived sequence (ECE1) and two new endogenous retrovirus sequences, similar to brown bat endogenous retrovirus (FERVmlu1, FERVmlu2) were found within a 140 Kbp interval in the middle of class I region. MHC SNPs were examined based on comparisons of this BAC sequence and MHC homozygous 1.9× WGS sequences and found that 11,654 SNPs in 2.84 Mbp (0.00411 SNP per bp), which is 2.4 times higher rate than average heterozygous region in the WGS (0.0017 SNP per bp genome), and slightly higher than the SNP rate observed in human MHC (0.00337 SNP per bp)."

Using blue native/SDS-PAGE and single particle analysis, we show for the first time that PSII in the bundle sheath (BS) chloroplasts exists in a dimeric form and forms light-harvesting complex II (LHCII).PSII supercomplexes. We also demonstrate that a similar set of photosynthetic membrane complexes exists in mesophyll and agranal BS chloroplasts, including intact LHCI.PSI supercomplexes, PSI monomers, PSII core dimers, PSII monomers devoid of CP43, LHCII trimers, LHCII monomers, ATP synthase, and cytochrome b(6)f complex. Fluorescence functional measurements clearly indicate that BS chloroplasts contain PSII complexes that are capable of performing charge separation and are efficiently sensitized by the associated LHCII. We identified a fraction of LHCII present within BS thylakoids that is weakly energetically coupled to the PSII reaction center; however, the majority of BS LHCII is shown to be tightly connected to PSII. Overall, we demonstrate that organization of the photosynthetic apparatus in BS agranal chloroplasts of a model C(4) plant is clearly distinct from that of the stroma lamellae of the C(3) plants. In particular, supramolecular organization of the dimeric LHCII.PSII in the BS thylakoids strongly suggests that PSII in the BS agranal membranes may donate electrons to PSI. We propose that the residual PSII activity may supply electrons to poise cyclic electron flow around PSI and prevent PSI overoxidation, which is essential for the CO(2) fixation in BS cells, and hence, may optimize ATP production within this compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1975875087,"The psi2 mutant of Arabidopsis displays amplification of the responses controlled by the red/far red light photoreceptors phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) but no apparent defect in blue light perception. We found that loss-of-function alleles of the protein phosphatase 7 (AtPP7) are responsible for the light hypersensitivity in psi2 demonstrating that AtPP7 controls the levels of phytochrome signaling. Plants expressing reduced levels of AtPP7 mRNA display reduced blue-light induced cryptochrome signaling but no noticeable deficiency in phytochrome signaling. Our genetic analysis suggests that phytochrome signaling is enhanced in the AtPP7 loss of function alleles, including in blue light, which masks the reduced cryptochrome signaling. AtPP7 has been found to interact both in yeast and in planta assays with nucleotide-diphosphate kinase 2 (NDPK2), a positive regulator of phytochrome signals. Analysis of ndpk2-psi2 double mutants suggests that NDPK2 plays a critical role in the AtPP7 regulation of the phytochrome pathway and identifies NDPK2 as an upstream element involved in the modulation of the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defense pathway by light. Thus, cryptochrome- and phytochrome-specific light signals synchronously control their relative contribution to the regulation of plant development. Interestingly, PP7 and NDPK are also components of animal light signaling systems."
https://openalex.org/W2063062863,"The World Health Organization (WHO) released new Child Growth Standards in 2006 to replace the current National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth reference. We assessed how switching from the NCHS to the newly released WHO Growth Standards affects the estimated prevalence of wasting, underweight and stunting, and the pattern of risk factors identified.Data were drawn from a village-informant driven Demographic Surveillance System in Northern Malawi. Children (n = 1328) were visited twice at 0-4 months and 11-15 months. Data were collected on the demographic and socio-economic environment of the child, health history, maternal and child anthropometry and child feeding practices. Weight-for-length, weight-for-age and length-for-age were derived in z-scores using the two growth references. In early infancy, prevalence estimates were 2.9, 6.1, and 8.5 fold higher for stunting, underweight, and wasting respectively using the WHO standards compared to NCHS reference (p<0.001 for all). At one year, prevalence estimates for wasting and stunting did not differ significantly according to reference used, but the prevalence of underweight was half that with the NCHS reference (p<0.001). Patterns of risk factors were similar with the two growth references for all outcomes at one year although the strength of association was higher with WHO standards.Differences in prevalence estimates differed in magnitude but not direction from previous studies. The scale of these differences depends on the population's nutritional status thus it should not be assumed a priori. The increase in estimated prevalence of wasting in early infancy has implications for feeding programs targeting lactating mothers and ante-natal multiple micronutrients supplementation to tackle small birth size. Risk factors identified using WHO standards remain comparable with findings based on the NCHS reference in similar settings. Further research should aim to identify whether the young infants additionally diagnosed as malnourished by this new standard are more appropriate targets for interventions than those identified with the NCHS reference."
https://openalex.org/W2126076347,"In many in vitro experiments Brownian motion hampers quantitative data analysis. Therefore, additives are widely used to increase the solvent viscosity. For this purpose, methylcellulose (MC) has been proven highly effective as already small concentrations can significantly slow down diffusive processes. Beside this advantage, it has already been reported that high MC concentrations can alter the microstructure of polymer solutions such as filamentous actin. However, it remains to be shown to what extent the mechanical properties of a composite actin/MC gel depend on the MC concentration. In particular, significant alterations might occur even if the microstructure seems unaffected. Indeed, we find that the viscoelastic response of entangled F-actin solutions depends sensitively on the amount of MC added. At concentrations higher than 0.2% (w/v) MC, actin filaments are reorganized into bundles which drastically changes the viscoelastic response. At small MC concentrations the impact of MC is more subtle: the two constituents, actin and MC, contribute in an additive way to the mechanical response of the composite material. As a consequence, the effect of methylcellulose on actin solutions has to be considered very carefully when MC is used in biochemical experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2045319198,"It has been demonstrated that the development of NKT cells requires CD1d. The contribution of costimulatory molecules in this process has not been studied. Here we show that in mice with targeted mutations of B7-1/2 and CD28, the TCRbeta(+)alpha-Galcer/CD1d(+) (iValpha14 NKT) subset is significantly reduced in the thymus, spleen and liver. This is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation; although increased cell death in the thymi of CD28-deficient mice was also observed. Moreover, in the B7-1/2- and CD28-deficient mice, we found a decreased percentage of the CD4(-)NK1.1(+) subset and a correspondingly increased portion of the CD4(+)NK1.1(-) subset. In addition, the mice with a targeted mutation of either B7 or CD28 had a reduced susceptibility to Con A induced hepatitis, which is known to be mediated by NKT cells. Our results demonstrate that the development, maturation and function of NKT cell are modulated by the costimulatory pathway and thus expand the horizon of costimulation into NKT, which is widely viewed as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. As such, costimulation may modulate all major branches of cell-mediated immunity, including T cells, NK cells and NKT cells."

https://openalex.org/W2000881330,"Mutations in ATCAY that encodes the brain-specific protein BNIP-H (or Caytaxin) lead to Cayman cerebellar ataxia. BNIP-H binds to glutaminase, a neurotransmitter-producing enzyme, and affects its activity and intracellular localization. Here we describe the identification and characterization of the binding between BNIP-H and Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase. BNIP-H interacted with Pin1 after nerve growth factor-stimulation and they co-localized in the neurites and cytosol of differentiating pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and the embryonic carcinoma P19 cells. Deletional mutagenesis revealed two cryptic binding sites within the C-terminus of BNIP-H such that single point mutants affecting the WW domain of Pin1 completely abolished their binding. Although these two sites do not contain any of the canonical Pin1-binding motifs they showed differential binding profiles to Pin1 WW domain mutants S16E, S16A and W34A, and the catalytically inert C113A of its isomerase domain. Furthermore, their direct interaction would occur only upon disrupting the ability of BNIP-H to form an intramolecular interaction by two similar regions. Furthermore, expression of Pin1 disrupted the BNIP-H/glutaminase complex formation in PC12 cells under nerve growth factor-stimulation. These results indicate that nerve growth factor may stimulate the interaction of BNIP-H with Pin1 by releasing its intramolecular inhibition. Such a mechanism could provide a post-translational regulation on the cellular activity of BNIP-H during neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2128670627,"DNA chips allow simultaneous measurements of genome-wide response of thousands of genes, i.e. system level monitoring of the gene-network activity. Advanced analysis methods have been developed to extract meaningful information from the vast amount of raw gene-expression data obtained from the microarray measurements. These methods usually aimed to distinguish between groups of subjects (e.g., cancer patients vs. healthy subjects) or identifying marker genes that help to distinguish between those groups. We assumed that motifs related to the internal structure of operons and gene-networks regulation are also embedded in microarray and can be deciphered by using proper analysis.The analysis presented here is based on investigating the gene-gene correlations. We analyze a database of gene expression of Bacillus subtilis exposed to sub-lethal levels of 37 different antibiotics. Using unsupervised analysis (dendrogram) of the matrix of normalized gene-gene correlations, we identified the operons as they form distinct clusters of genes in the sorted correlation matrix. Applying dimension-reduction algorithm (Principal Component Analysis, PCA) to the matrices of normalized correlations reveals functional motifs. The genes are placed in a reduced 3-dimensional space of the three leading PCA eigen-vectors according to their corresponding eigen-values. We found that the organization of the genes in the reduced PCA space recovers motifs of the operon internal structure, such as the order of the genes along the genome, gene separation by non-coding segments, and translational start and end regions. In addition to the intra-operon structure, it is also possible to predict inter-operon relationships, operons sharing functional regulation factors, and more. In particular, we demonstrate the above in the context of the competence and sporulation pathways.We demonstrated that by analyzing gene-gene correlation from gene-expression data it is possible to identify operons and to predict unknown internal structure of operons and gene-networks regulation."

The study of Brachyury, Lim1, Otx2 and Otx5 expression patterns points to a highly conserved dynamic of expression with amniote model organisms and makes it possible to identify the site of mesoderm internalization, which is a long-standing issue in reptiles. Analysis of Brachyury expression also highlights the presence of two distinct phases, less easily recognizable in model organisms and respectively characterized by an early ring-shaped and a later bilateral symmetrical territory. Systematic comparisons with tetrapod model organisms lead to new insights into the relationships of the blastopore/blastoporal plate system shared by all reptiles, with the blastopore of amphibians and the primitive streak of birds and mammals. The biphasic Brachyury expression pattern is also consistent with recent models of emergence of bilateral symmetry, which raises the question of its evolutionary significance."
https://openalex.org/W1972766112,"Many aspects of development, tumor growth and metastasis depend upon the provision of an adequate vasculature. This can be a result of regulated angiogenesis, recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitors and/or vascular trans-differentiation. The present study demonstrates that treatment of SKBR-3 breast cancer cells with retinoic acid (RA), an important regulator of embryogenesis, cancer and other diseases, stimulates the formation of networks in Matrigel. RA-treatment of SKBR-3 cells co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in the formation of mixed structures. RA induces expression of many endothelial genes including vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin. VE-cadherin was also induced by RA in a number of other breast cancer cells. We show that RA-induced VE-cadherin is responsible for the RA-induced morphological changes. RA rapidly induced the expression of Sox-9 and ER81, which in turn form a complex on the VE-cadherin promoter and are required to mediate the transcriptional regulation of VE-cadherin by RA. These data indicate that RA may promote the expression of endothelial genes resulting in endothelial-like differentiation, or provide a mechanism whereby circulating endothelial progenitor cells could be incorporated into a growing organ or tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2032094559,"Amyloid fibril formation involves three steps; structural perturbation, nucleation and elongation. We have investigated amyloidogenesis using prion protein as a model system and UV-light as a structural perturbant. We find that UV-exposed prion protein fails to form amyloid fibrils. Interestingly, if provided with pre-formed fibrils as seeds, UV-exposed prion protein formed amyloid fibrils albeit with slightly different morphology. Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopic studies clearly show the formation of fibrils under these conditions. Circular dichroism study shows loss in helicity in UV-exposed protein. UV-exposed prion protein fails to form amyloid fibrils. However, it remains competent for fibril extension, suggesting that UV-exposure results in loss of nucleating capability. This work opens up possibility of segregating nucleation and elongation step of amyloidogenesis, facilitating screening of new drug candidates for specifically inhibiting either of these processes. In addition, the work also highlights the importance of light-induced structural and functional alterations which are important in protein based therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2091138418,"Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a small molecular weight secreted protein predominantly expressed in lung airways. We previously demonstrated that the expression of SCGB3A2 is regulated by homeodomain transcription factor NKX2-1. Here we show that CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPdelta, regulate mouse Scgb3a2 gene transcription in vivo and in vitro by binding to specific sites located in the Scgb3a2 promoter and the activity is synergistically enhanced through cooperative interaction with NKX2-1. Six C/EBP binding sites lie within 500 bp of the Scgb3a2 gene promoter, of which two sites, located at -44 to -54 bp and -192 to -201 bp, appear to be critical for the synergistic activation of Scgb3a2 gene transcription with NKX2-1. All three transcription factors, C/EBPalpha, C/EBPdelta, and NKX2-1, are expressed in the epithelial cells of airways, particularly the bronchus, where high expression of SCGB3A2 is found. The expression of these transcription factors markedly increases toward the end of gestation, which coincides with the marked increase of SCGB3A2, suggesting the importance of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPdelta, and their synergistic interaction with NKX2-1 in mouse Scgb3a2 gene transcription and lung development."
https://openalex.org/W1985239469,"Susceptibility to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is thought to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and their interaction with each other. Statistical models including multiple variants in axon guidance pathway genes have recently been purported to be capable of predicting PD risk, survival free of the disease and age at disease onset; however the specific models have not undergone independent validation. Here we tested the best proposed risk panel of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two PD sample sets, with a total of 525 cases and 518 controls. By single marker analysis, only one marker was significantly associated with PD risk in one of our sample sets (rs6692804: P = 0.03). Multi-marker analysis using the reported model found a mild association in one sample set (two sided P = 0.049, odds ratio for each score change = 1.07) but no significance in the other (two sided P = 0.98, odds ratio = 1), a stark contrast to the reported strong association with PD risk (P = 4.64×10−38, odds ratio as high as 90.8). Following a procedure similar to that used to build the reported model, simulated multi-marker models containing SNPs from randomly chosen genes in a genome wide PD dataset produced P-values that were highly significant and indistinguishable from similar models where disease status was permuted (3.13×10−23 to 4.90×10−64), demonstrating the potential for overfitting in the model building process. Together, these results challenge the robustness of the reported panel of genetic markers to predict PD risk in particular and a role of the axon guidance pathway in PD genetics in general."
https://openalex.org/W1986000110,"Background Life and death decisions of metazoan cells hinge on the balance between the expression of pro- versus anti-apoptotic gene products. The general RNA polymerase II transcription factor, TFIID, plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression through its core promoter recognition and co-activator functions. The core TFIID subunit TAF6 acts in vitro as an essential co-activator of transcription for the p53 tumor suppressor protein. We previously identified a splice variant of TAF6, termed TAF6δ that can be induced during apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate the impact of TAF6δ on cell death and gene expression, we have employed modified antisense oligonucleotides to enforce expression of endogenous TAF6δ. The induction of endogenous TAF6δ triggered apoptosis in tumor cell lines, including cells devoid of p53. Microarray experiments revealed that TAF6δ activates gene expression independently of cellular p53 status. Conclusions Our data define TAF6δ as a pivotal node in a signaling pathway that controls gene expression programs and apoptosis in the absence of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2058056397,"Background Outbreaks of phocine distemper virus (PDV) in Europe during 1988 and 2002 were responsible for the death of around 23,000 and 30,000 harbour seals, respectively. These epidemics, particularly the one in 2002, provided an unusual opportunity to estimate epidemic parameters for a wildlife disease. There were marked regional differences in the values of some parameters both within and between epidemics. Methodology and Principal Findings We used an individual-based model of seal movement that allowed us to incorporate realistic representations of space, time and animal behaviour into a traditional epidemiological modelling framework. We explored the potential influence of a range of ecological (foraging trip duration, time of epidemic onset, population size) and epidemiological (length of infectious period, contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals, case mortality) parameters on four readily-measurable epidemic characteristics (number of dead individuals, duration of epidemic, peak mortality date and prevalence) and on the probability that an epidemic would occur in a particular region. We analysed the outputs as if they were the results of a series of virtual experiments, using Generalised Linear Modelling. All six variables had a significant effect on the probability that an epidemic would be recognised as an unusual mortality event by human observers. Conclusions Regional and temporal variation in contact rate was the most likely cause of the observed differences between the two epidemics. This variation could be a consequence of differences in the way individuals divide their time between land and sea at different times of the year."
https://openalex.org/W2114173268,"Background Destrin (DSTN) is a member of the ADF/cofilin family of proteins and is an important regulator of actin dynamics. The primary function of destrin is to depolymerize filamentous actin into its monomeric form and promote filament severing. While progress has been made in understanding the biochemical functions of the ADF/cofilin proteins, the study of an animal model for cells deficient for DSTN provides an opportunity to investigate the physiological processes regulated by proper actin dynamics in vivo. A spontaneous mouse mutant, corneal disease 1(corn1), is deficient for DSTN, which causes epithelial hyperproliferation and neovascularization in the cornea. Dstncorn1 mice exhibit an actin dynamics defect in the cornea as evidenced by the formation of actin stress fibers in the epithelial cells. Previously, we observed a significant infiltration of leukocytes into the cornea of Dstncorn1 mice as well as the upregulation of proinflammatory molecules. In this study, we sought to characterize this inflammatory condition and explore the physiological mechanism through which a loss of Dstn function leads to inflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings Through immunofluorescent analyses, we observed a significant recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the Dstncorn1 cornea, demonstrating that the innate immune system is spontaneously activated in this mutant. The inflammatory chemokine, CXCL5, was ectopically expressed in the corneal epithelial cells of Dstncorn1 mice, and targeting of the receptor for this chemokine inhibited neutrophil recruitment. An inflammatory reaction was not observed in the cornea of allelic mutant strain, Dstncorn1-2J, which has a milder defect in actin dynamics in the corneal epithelial cells. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that severe defects in actin dynamics lead to an autoinflammatory condition that is mediated by the expression of CXC chemokines."
https://openalex.org/W2085768315,"Background Retroviruses have been observed to bud intracellularly into multivesicular bodies (MVB), in addition to the plasma membrane. Release from MVB is thought to occur by Ca2+-regulated fusion with the plasma membrane. Principal Findings To address the role of the MVB pathway in replication of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) we took advantage of mouse models for the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) and Griscelli syndrome. In humans, these disorders are characterized by hypopigmentation and immunological alterations that are caused by defects in the biogenesis and trafficking of MVBs and other lysosome related organelles. Neonatal mice for these disease models lacking functional AP-3, Rab27A and BLOC factors were infected with Moloney MLV and the spread of virus into bone marrow, spleen and thymus was monitored. We found a moderate reduction in MLV infection levels in most mutant mice, which differed by less than two-fold compared to wild-type mice. In vitro, MLV release form bone-marrow derived macrophages was slightly enhanced. Finally, we found no evidence for a Ca2+-regulated release pathway in vitro. Furthermore, MLV replication was only moderately affected in mice lacking Synaptotagmin VII, a Ca2+-sensor regulating lysosome fusion with the plasma membrane. Conclusions Given that MLV spreading in mice depends on multiple rounds of replication even moderate reduction of virus release at the cellular level would accumulate and lead to a significant effect over time. Thus our in vivo and in vitro data collectively argue against an essential role for a MVB- and secretory lysosome-mediated pathway in the egress of MLV."
