https://openalex.org/W3009159814,"Autism is characterized by repetitive behaviors, impaired social interactions, and communication deficits. It is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, and available treatments offer little benefit. Here, we show that genetically reducing the protein tau prevents behavioral signs of autism in two mouse models simulating distinct causes of this condition. Similar to a proportion of people with autism, both models have epilepsy, abnormally enlarged brains, and overactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. All of these abnormalities were prevented or markedly diminished by partial or complete genetic removal of tau. We identify disinhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a negative PI3K regulator that tau controls, as a plausible mechanism and demonstrate that tau interacts with PTEN via tau's proline-rich domain. Our findings suggest an enabling role of tau in the pathogenesis of autism and identify tau reduction as a potential therapeutic strategy for some of the disorders that cause this condition."
https://openalex.org/W3009616544,"Actually, there is scarce literature looking for the relationship between inter-limb asymmetries and performance in youth elite team sports. The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationships between inter-limb asymmetries and physical performance in youth elite team-sports players. A secondary objective was to evaluate the presence of between-sexes differences in inter-limb asymmetries in elite youth team sports players. Eighty-one young elite team-sports athletes (age: u-14 to u-18) performed the star excursion balance test in the anterior direction (SEBT ANT), a single leg vertical countermovement jump test (SLCMJ), the one leg hop test for distance (OLHT), a 30 m sprint test, and the V-cut test. Inter-limb asymmetries were calculated for SEBT ANT, SLCMJ and OLHT. Pearson r was used to analyse the relationships between inter-limb asymmetries and physical performance. Results showed significant (p < 0.05) but small (r = 0.26) relationships between SLCMJ asymmetries and 30 m sprint time for the total group. Significant negative correlations with small to moderate magnitude of correlation were also found between SLCMJ asymmetries and SLCMJ performance on the lowest performing limb for the total group (p < 0.05; r = -0.26), males (p < 0.01; r = -0.48) and females (p < 0.05; r = -0.30). Moreover, significant negative correlations with moderate and large magnitude were also present between OLHT asymmetries and OLHT performance on the lowest performing limb for the total group (p < 0.01; r = -0.44), males (p < 0.01; r = -0.56) and females (p < 0.01; r = -0.64). No correlations were observed between asymmetries and either the V-cut test or SEBT ANT performance. No correlation were observed between SEBT ANT asymmetries and physical performance. In addition, when comparing asymmetry values between sexes there were no significant differences in vertical (p = 0.06) and horizontal (p = 0.61) jumping tests. However, there were significant differences in asymmetry between sexes in the ANT SEBT (p = 0.04). In conclusion, the current study indicated that jumping asymmetries were associated with decrements in sprint speed and jumping performance. Therefore, assessing inter-limb asymmetries would be recommended to improve training interventions for youth elite team-sports athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3009824236,"African Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa landraces are considered valuable resources for breeding traits due to their adaptation to local environmental and soil conditions. They often possess superior resistance to endemic pests and tolerance to drought and nutrient deficiencies when compared to the “imported” high production Asian rice varieties. In contrast, “domestication traits” such as seed shattering, lodging, and seed yield are not well established in these African landraces. Therefore, the use of these African varieties for high production agriculture is limited by unpredictable yield and grain quality. We are addressing this shortcoming by developing protocols for genetically transforming African landraces to allow the use of CRISPR-Cas mediated breeding approaches. Here we use as proof of concept the cultivated African landrace Kabre to target selected known “domestication loci” and improve the agronomic potential of Kabre rice. Stable genetic transformation with CRISPR-Cas9-based vectors generated single and simultaneous multiple gene knockouts. Plants with reduced stature to diminish lodging were generated by disrupting the HTD1 gene. Furthermore, three loci shown to control seed size and/or yield (GS3, GW2 and GN1A) were targeted using a multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 construct. This resulted in mutants with significantly improved seed yield. Our study provides an example of how new breeding technologies can accelerate the development of highly productive African landrace rice varieties, an important advancement considering that Africa is a hotspot for worldwide population growth and therefore prone to food shortage."
https://openalex.org/W3009972972,"We have designed a pyrocosm to enable fine-scale dissection of post-fire soil microbial communities. Using it we show that the peak soil temperature achieved at a given depth occurs hours after the fire is out, lingers near this peak for a significant time, and is accurately predicted by soil depth and the mass of charcoal burned. Flash fuels that produce no large coals were found to have a negligible soil heating effect. Coupling this system with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the control and post-fire soil we show that we can stimulate a rapid, massive response by Pyronema, a well-known genus of pyrophilous fungus, within two weeks of a test fire. This specific stimulation occurs in a background of many other fungal taxa that do not change noticeably with the fire, although there is an overall reduction in richness and evenness. We introduce a thermo-chemical gradient model to summarize the way that heat, soil depth and altered soil chemistry interact to create a predictable, depth-structured habitat for microbes in post-fire soils. Coupling this model with the temperature relationships found in the pyrocosms, we predict that the width of a survivable “goldilocks zone”, which achieves temperatures that select for postfire-adapted microbes, will stay relatively constant across a range of fuel loads. In addition we predict that a larger necromass zone, containing labile carbon and nutrients from recently heat-killed organisms, will increase in size rapidly with addition of fuel and then remain nearly constant in size over a broad range of fuel loads. The simplicity of this experimental system, coupled with the availability of a set of sequenced, assembled and annotated genomes of pyrophilous fungi, offers a powerful tool for dissecting the ecology of post-fire microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W3010250210,"Kratom is a botanical substance that is marketed and promoted in the US for pharmaceutical opioid indications despite having no US Food and Drug Administration approved uses. Kratom contains over forty alkaloids including two partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, that have been subjected to the FDA's scientific and medical evaluation. However, pharmacological and toxicological data for the remaining alkaloids are limited. Therefore, we applied the Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation (PHASE) protocol to generate in silico binding profiles for 25 kratom alkaloids to facilitate the risk evaluation of kratom. PHASE demonstrates that kratom alkaloids share structural features with controlled opioids, indicates that several alkaloids bind to the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors, and suggests that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are the strongest binders at the mu opioid receptor. Subsequently, the in silico binding profiles of a subset of the alkaloids were experimentally verified at the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors using radioligand binding assays. The verified binding profiles demonstrate the ability of PHASE to identify potential safety signals and provide a tool for prioritizing experimental evaluation of high-risk compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3010411511,"Trophic interactions can result in changes to the abundance and distribution of habitat-forming species that dramatically reduce ecosystem functioning. In the coastal zone of the Aleutian Archipelago, overgrazing by herbivorous sea urchins that began in the 1990s resulted in widespread deforestation of the region’s kelp forests, which led to lower macroalgal abundances and higher benthic irradiances. We examined how this deforestation impacted ecosystem function by comparing patterns of net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and the range between GPP and Re in remnant kelp forests, urchin barrens, and habitats that were in transition between the two habitat types at nine islands that spanned more than 1000 kilometers of the archipelago. Our results show that deforestation, on average, resulted in a 24% reduction in GPP, a 26% reduction in Re, and a 24% reduction in the range between GPP and Re. Further, the transition habitats were intermediate to the kelp forests and urchin barrens for these metrics. These opposing metabolic processes remained in balance; however, which resulted in little-to-no changes to NEP. These effects of deforestation on ecosystem productivity, however, were highly variable between years and among the study islands. In light of the worldwide declines in kelp forests observed in recent decades, our findings suggest that marine deforestation profoundly affects how coastal ecosystems function."
https://openalex.org/W3009675882,"Fifty four Trichoderma strains were isolated from soil samples collected from garlic and onion crops in eight different sites in Brazil and were identified using phylogenetic analysis based on combined ITS region, tef1-α, cal, act and rpb2 sequences. The genetic variability of the recovered Trichoderma species was analysed by AFLP and their phenotypic variability determined using MALDI-TOF. The strain clusters from both typing techniques coincided with the taxonomic determinations made from phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic analysis showed the occurrence of Trichoderma asperellum, Trichoderma asperelloides, Trichoderma afroharzianum, Trichoderma hamatum, Trichoderma lentiforme, Trichoderma koningiopsis, Trichoderma longibrachiatum and Trichoderma erinaceum, in the soil samples. We also identified and describe two new Trichoderma species, both in the harzianum clade of section Pachybasium, which we have named Trichoderma azevedoi sp. nov. and Trichoderma peberdyi sp. nov. The examined strains of both T. azevedoi (three strains) and T. peberdyi (12 strains) display significant genotypic and phenotypic variability, but form monophyletic clades with strong bootstrap and posterior probability support and are morphologically distinct from their respective most closely related species."
https://openalex.org/W3010223323,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major cause of cancer death, but the molecular mechanism for its development has not yet been well characterized. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a wide range of biological processes via their roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of LINC00324 in HCC through its interaction with Fas ligand (FasL). Initially, microarray-based gene expression profiling of HCC was employed to identify differentially expressed genes. Next, the expression of LINC00324 in HCC tissues and liver cancer stem cell (LCSC) lines was examined using RT-qPCR. Then, the interaction among LINC00324, PU box binding protein (PU.1) and FasL was identified with RIP, ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. The effect of LINC00324 on viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis as well as the tumorigenesis of transfected cells was examined with gain- and loss-of-function experiments. LINC00324 and FasL were highly expressed in HCC. LINC00324 regulated FasL expression via interaction with PU.1. Silencing of LINC00324 or FasL suppressed expression of stemness-related genes, cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, self-renewal, and tumorigenesis, but enhanced cell apoptosis. Taken together, LINC00324 promotes the expression of FasL through the recruitment of PU.1, which ultimately maintains the biological properties of LCSCs, thus, highlighting LINC00324 as a promising therapeutic candidate for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3009927163,"Domesticated lentil has a relatively narrow genetic base globally and most released varieties are susceptible to severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The crop wild relatives could provide new traits of interest for tailoring novel germplasm and cultivated lentil improvement. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate wild lentil accessions for identification of economically viable agro-morphological traits and resistance against major biotic stresses. The study has revealed substantial variations in seed yield and its important component characters. Further, the diversity analysis of wild accessions showed two major clusters which were bifurcated into sub-clusters, thereby suggesting their wider genetic divergence. However, principal component analysis exhibited that seed yield plant-1, number of seeds plant-1, number of pods plant-1, harvest index and biological yield plant-1 contributed significantly to the total genetic variation assessed in wild lentil taxa. Moreover, some of the wild accessions collected from Syria and Turkey regions showed resistance against more than one disease indicating rich diversity of lentil genetic resources. The identification of most promising genotypes carrying resistance against major biotic stresses could be utilized in the cultivated or susceptible varieties of lentil for enhancing genetic gains. The study has also identified some trait specific accessions, which could also be taken into the consideration while planning distant hybridization in lentil."

https://openalex.org/W3010280255,"Though traditional thresholding methods are simple and efficient, they may result in poor segmentation results because only image’s brightness information is taken into account in the procedure of threshold selection. Considering the contextual information between pixels can improve segmentation accuracy. To to this, a new thresholding method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method constructs a new two dimensional histogram using brightness of a pixel and local relative entropy of it’s neighbor pixels. The local relative entropy (LRE) measures the brightness difference between a pixel and it’s neighbor pixels. The two dimensional histogram, consisting of gray level and LRE, can reflect the contextual information between pixels to a certain extent. The optimal thresholding vector is obtained via minimizing cross entropy criteria. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve more accurate segmentation results than other thresholding methods."
https://openalex.org/W3010447055,"Despite more than 250 years of taxonomic research, we still have only a vague idea about the true size and composition of the faunas and floras of the planet. Many biodiversity inventories provide limited insight because they focus on a small taxonomic subsample or a tiny geographic area. Here, we report on the size and composition of the Swedish insect fauna, thought to represent roughly half of the diversity of multicellular life in one of the largest European countries. Our results are based on more than a decade of data from the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative and its massive inventory of the country’s insect fauna, the Swedish Malaise Trap Project The fauna is considered one of the best known in the world, but the initiative has nevertheless revealed a surprising amount of hidden diversity: more than 3,000 new species (301 new to science) have been documented so far. Here, we use three independent methods to analyze the true size and composition of the fauna at the family or subfamily level: (1) assessments by experts who have been working on the most poorly known groups in the fauna; (2) estimates based on the proportion of new species discovered in the Malaise trap inventory; and (3) extrapolations based on species abundance and incidence data from the inventory. For the last method, we develop a new estimator, the combined non-parametric estimator, which we show is less sensitive to poor coverage of the species pool than other popular estimators. The three methods converge on similar estimates of the size and composition of the fauna, suggesting that it comprises around 33,000 species. Of those, 8,600 (26%) were unknown at the start of the inventory and 5,000 (15%) still await discovery. We analyze the taxonomic and ecological composition of the estimated fauna, and show that most of the new species belong to Hymenoptera and Diptera groups that are decomposers or parasitoids. Thus, current knowledge of the Swedish insect fauna is strongly biased taxonomically and ecologically, and we show that similar but even stronger biases have distorted our understanding of the fauna in the past. We analyze latitudinal gradients in the size and composition of known European insect faunas and show that several of the patterns contradict the Swedish data, presumably due to similar knowledge biases. Addressing these biases is critical in understanding insect biomes and the ecosystem services they provide. Our results emphasize the need to broaden the taxonomic scope of current insect monitoring efforts, a task that is all the more urgent as recent studies indicate a possible worldwide decline in insect faunas."
https://openalex.org/W3010263638,"Bloodstream infections (BSI) are serious and life-threatening, associated with high mortality and morbidity. In resource-limited settings, there is a paucity of data on predictors of outcome in patients with BSI. This study aimed at examining the predictors of mortality in patients with BSI as well as bacteria causing BSI.This was a cross-sectional study conducted at Muhimbili National Hospital between April and May 2018. Blood culture results from all inpatients at the clinical microbiology laboratory were recorded and clinical information was retrieved retrospectively from the files. Bacteria from positive blood culture were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility was performed.The overall prevalence of BSI was, 46/402 (11.4% 95% CI 8.6-15), with a case fatality rate of 37%. There was a significantly high rate of BSI in patients who had died (19.5%) compared to those who survived (9.2%) p = 0.008. Gram-negative bacteria (74%) were the common cause of BSI, with a predominance of Enterobacteriaceae (22), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11). The majority of bacteria (70.5%) isolated from patients with BSI were Multi-drug resistant (MDR). Forty-six percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to meropenem while 68% (15/22) of Enterobacteriaceae were extended-spectrum β lactamase producers. Carbapenemase production was detected in 27% (3/11) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one Proteus mirabilis. Forty percent of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Positive blood culture (aOR 2.24, 95%CI 1.12-4.47, p 0.02) and admission to the intensive care unit (aOR 3.88, 95%CI 1.60-9.41, p = 0.003) were independent factors for mortality in suspected BSI. Isolation of MDR bacteria was an independent predictor for mortality in confirmed BSI (aOR 15.62, 95%CI 1.24-161.38, p = 0.02).The prevalence of BSI was 11.4%, with the majority of bacteria in BSI were MDR. Positive blood culture, admission to the ICU and MDR were predictors for mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3010599477,"Objective To clarify the relationship among serum adiponectin, body composition, current disease activity and therapeutics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in RA patients under treatment with agents including biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. A total of 351 subjects from the Kyoto University RA Management Alliance cohort (KURAMA) were enrolled in the analysis. We classified the participants into five body composition groups according to the cut-off points for obesity and visceral fat used in Japan: body mass index (BMI), 18.5 kg/m2 for underweight and 25.0 kg/m2 for obesity, and visceral fat area (VFA), 100 cm2 for visceral adiposity. Results Classification of body composition revealed that serum adiponectin levels and disease activity score (DAS28-ESR) in the low BMI group were significantly higher than those in the normal and overweight groups. Because both increased serum adiponectin and low BMI were previously reported as poor prognostic factors of RA, we performed multiple regression analysis to determine which factor was correlated with RA disease activity. Serum adiponectin level, but not BMI, was positively associated with DAS28-ESR (estimate = 0.0127, p = 0.0258). Subanalysis also showed that the use of bDMARD or JAK inhibitor did not have an obvious influence on circulating adiponectin. Conclusions Classification of body composition and multiple regression analysis revealed a positive and independent correlation between serum adiponectin and DAS28-ESR in Japanese RA patients. Thus, serum adiponectin may be an important marker reflecting high disease activity of RA regardless of current medications."
https://openalex.org/W3009638976,"Oligomers of β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42), rather than fibrils, drive the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, toxic oligomeric species called protofibrils (PFs) have attracted significant attention. Herein, we report RNA aptamers with higher affinity toward PFs derived from a toxic Aβ42 dimer than toward fibrils produced from WT Aβ42 or from a toxic, conformationally constrained Aβ42 variant, E22P-Aβ42. We obtained these RNA aptamers by using the preincubated dimer model of E22P-Aβ42, which dimerized via a linker located at Val-40, as the target of in vitro selection. This dimer formed PFs during incubation. Several physicochemical characteristics of an identified aptamer, E22P-AbD43, suggested that preferential affinity of this aptamer toward PFs is due to its higher affinity for the toxic dimer unit (KD = 20 ± 6.0 nm) of Aβ42 than for less-toxic Aβ40 aggregates. Comparison of CD data from the full-length and random regions of E22P-AbD43 suggested that the preferential binding of E22P-AbD43 toward the dimer might be related to the formation of a G-quadruplex structure. E22P-AbD43 significantly inhibited the nucleation phase of the dimer and its associated neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Of note, E22P-AbD43 also significantly protected against the neurotoxicity of WT Aβ42 and E22P-Aβ42. Furthermore, in an AD mouse model, E22P-AbD43 preferentially recognized diffuse aggregates, which likely originated from PFs or higher-order oligomers with curvilinear structures, compared with senile plaques formed from fibrils. We conclude that the E22P-AbD43 aptamer is a promising research and diagnostic tool for further studies of AD etiology."

The enhancement of extracellular cGAMP levels therefore holds great promise for managing cancer. However, there is still much more to understand about the basic biology of cGAMP before its full therapeutic potential can be realized. To answer these questions, we must be able to detect and quantitate cGAMP with an assay that is high-throughput, sensitive, and precise. Existing assays fall short of these needs.

Extracellular cGAMP plays a major role in tumor detection and elimination; we demonstrated through in vivo experiments that depleting extracellular cGAMP in tumors represses innate immune activation (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that enhancing extracellular cGAMP through the inhibition of its degradation or the catalysis of its synthesis with ionizing radiation diminishes tumors (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancement of extracellular cGAMP therefore contains great potential for the treatment of cancer. Nonhydrolyzable analogs of cGAMP are currently in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic solid tumors with promising results (SCR_002309: NCT03172936 and NCT03010176). To realize the full therapeutic potential of extracellular cGAMP, there is still much more to be understood about the basic biology of cGAMP. Among the immediately apparent questions are how ENPP1 inhibitors can be screened in a high-throughput manner, how cGAMP exporters can be identified in cancer cells, how cancer cells can be stimulated to export more cGAMP, and which cell types import and respond to cGAMP to mediate the immune response. Outside of cancer immunology, the roles that extracellular cGAMP plays in homeostasis and other diseases are largely unexplored. To begin to address these questions, we must first be able to measure cGAMP using an assay accessible to academic laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, and hospitals. Such an assay must have a wide dynamic range, as physiological cGAMP concentrations range from low nanomolar to high micromolar (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this assay must be sufficiently precise to study significant biological processes that may rely only on subtle changes in cGAMP concentrations. Ideally, such an assay is also suitable for high-throughput genetic and drug screens. Current methods to quantitate cGAMP fall short of these standards. We previously developed a quantitative LC tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) technique with a wide dynamic range and detection limit of 4 nm (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is low-throughput and requires equipment and expertise beyond the range of most laboratories. cGAMP ELISAs are commercially available, but like all ELISAs, they are expensive and have a narrow detection range. A riboswitch for cGAMP has also been developed, but its Kd of 13 μm limits its utility in detecting and quantitating physiologically relevant concentrations of cGAMP (20Bose D. Su Y. Marcus A. Raulet D.H. Hammond M.C. An RNA-based fluorescent biosensor for high-throughput analysis of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway.Cell Chem.

Here, we describe the development of cGAMP-Luc, a sensitive, precise, and high-throughput coupled enzyme assay based on luciferase that can quantitate cGAMP in a range of complex biological samples. The general scheme of the cGAMP-Luc assay is described in Fig. 1A. Our overall strategy takes advantage of our discovery of ENPP1, the dominant hydrolase of cGAMP (21Li L. Yin Q. Kuss P. Maliga Z. Millán J.L. Wu H. Mitchison T.J. Hydrolysis of 2′3′-cGAMP by ENPP1 and design of nonhydrolyzable analogs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 (25344812): 1043-104810.1038/nchembio.1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this assay, cGAMP is first cleaved into AMP and GMP by ENPP1. We considered alternative cGAMP hydrolases, but they are ultimately incompatible with this assay; poxvirus immune nucleases (poxins) do not cleave cGAMP to AMP (22Eaglesham J.B. Pan Y. Kupper T.S. Kranzusch P.J. Viral and metazoan poxins are cGAMP-specific nucleases that restrict cGAS–STING signalling.Nature. 2019; 566 (30728498): 259-26310.1038/s41586-019-0928-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and snake venom phosphodiesterase (6Diner E.J.

The innate immune DNA sensor cGAS produces a noncanonical cyclic dinucleotide that activates human STING.Cell Rep. 2013; 3 (23707065): 1355-136110.1016/j.celrep.2013.05.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) cannot be purified in large quantities as it is harvested from snake venom. Following ENPP1 digestion of cGAMP, the resulting AMP is subsequently converted to ADP by the enzyme polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase (PAP) at the expense of polyphosphate (23Resnick S.M. Zehnder A.J.B. In vitro ATP regeneration from polyphosphate and AMP by polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase and adenylate kinase from Acinetobacter johnsonii 210A.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66 (10788379): 2045-205110.1128/AEM.66.5.2045-2051.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Kameda A. Shiba T. Kawazoe Y. Satoh Y. Ihara Y. Munekata M. Ishige K. Noguchi T. A novel ATP regeneration system using polyphosphate-AMP phosohotransferase and polyphosphate kinase.J. Biosci.

ATP is used by luciferase to oxidize luciferin in a concentration-dependent manner to generate a luminescent species. The final ATP concentration is thus quantitated on a luminescence plate reader and related back to the original cGAMP concentration. To accurately quantitate low nanomolar concentrations of cGAMP, all enzymatic steps of cGAMP-Luc should operate at nanomolar concentrations and couple with each other in a linear fashion. We purified ENPP1 (Fig. 1B) and first tested whether it could convert nanomolar amounts of cGAMP to AMP despite a Km of 15 μm for cGAMP. We incubated a trace amount of [32P]cGAMP with 350 nm cGAMP and 10 nm ENPP1 for 16 h and analyzed the reaction mixture using TLC (Fig. 1C). We observed complete cleavage of cGAMP to Pi with a trace amount of the desired AMP intermediate. This is in agreement with our previous observation (21Li L. Yin Q. Kuss P. Maliga Z. Millán J.L. Wu H. Mitchison T.J. Hydrolysis of 2′3′-cGAMP by ENPP1 and design of nonhydrolyzable analogs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 (25344812): 1043-104810.1038/nchembio.1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) that trace amounts of phosphatases from the purified cGAS protein are sufficient to cleave most of the AMP intermediate to Pi. To avoid phosphatase contaminants and the subsequent loss of AMP as the key analyte, all of the cold cGAMP used in the rest of this study was subjected to HPLC purification. Regardless, the demonstrated complete cleavage of crude hot [32P]cGAMP indicates that the quantitation of cGAMP via its cleavage product AMP is a viable strategy. We then attempted to generate a standard curve by coupling our ENPP1 cleavage of cGAMP to AMP with a commercially available AMP quantitation assay, AMP-GloTM. Biological samples likely contain a significant amount of AMP that does not originate from cGAMP. To ensure specificity for cGAMP, we plotted standard curves after taking the difference in luminescence signals of samples that were and were not subjected to ENPP1 cleavage. The generated cGAMP standard curve has a quantitation limit of nearly 200 nm (Fig. 1D), which is 50 times worse than our LC-MS/MS method (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the standard curve of AMP generated by AMP-GloTM has a quantitation limit of 125 nm (Fig. 1E). In contrast, the standard curve of ATP alone is linear and quantitative until 16 nm (Fig. 1F). The limit of quantitation of ATP is the theoretical limit of quantitation of cGAMP. To improve the quantitation of cGAMP to approach this theoretical limit, we began by optimizing the quantitation of AMP. In the commercially available AMP-GloTM assay kit, the detection of ATP by luciferase is coupled to its synthesis from ADP. We hypothesized that the quantitation limit of AMP would improve if we allowed ATP to accumulate to greater concentrations before its detection by luciferase. To test this hypothesis, we assembled the components of this assay ourselves and uncoupled these two steps. As shown in the scheme in Fig. 2A, we instead coupled the generation of ADP and ATP from AMP by the enzymes PAP and myokinase. As the first step to assembling our own AMP quantitation assay, we expressed and purified PAP from Escherichia coli (Fig. 2B) and verified its activity by TLC. In 2 h, the conversion of 1 mm AMP to ADP by 0.5 mm PAP was nearly complete (Fig. 2C), suggesting that our purified PAP enzyme is active. To test our hypothesis that rearranging the coupled steps in the AMP assay would lead to an improved quantitation limit, we generated AMP standard curves with both the old and new coupling schemes. We combined PAP with a commercially available myokinase enzyme to convert AMP to ATP and used CellTiter-Glo® to quantitate the resulting ATP. The quantitation limit with the old coupling scheme was 125 nm, similar to that generated by the AMP-GloTM assay (Figs. 1E and 2D). Under the new coupling scheme, the standard curve of AMP was much more linear and had a quantitation limit of 15 nm (Fig. 2E), confirming our hypothesis that we could improve the quantitation limit of AMP by rearranging the coupled steps in the assay. We named this new AMP quantitation assay AMP-Luc. We combined our new AMP-Luc assay with ENPP1 to generate a cGAMP standard curve but found that it was still nonlinear (Fig. 3A). After confirming that any GMP from the cGAMP digestion would not affect any components of AMP-Luc (Fig. S1), we hypothesized that this nonlinearity was due to added components from the digestion of cGAMP by ENPP1. Zn2+ is a known inhibitor of myokinase, and there is 200 μm ZnCl2 present in our previously reported ENPP1 buffer (21Li L. Yin Q. Kuss P. Maliga Z. Millán J.L. Wu H. Mitchison T.J. Hydrolysis of 2′3′-cGAMP by ENPP1 and design of nonhydrolyzable analogs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 (25344812): 1043-104810.1038/nchembio.1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25Noda L. Adenosine Triphosphate-Adenosine Monophosphate Transphosphorylase.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226 (13428784): 541-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, standard curves of AMP generated with buffers containing 50 or 200 μm ZnCl2 show a concentration-dependent decrease in luminescence signal (Fig. 3B). Reducing the amount of ZnCl2 present in the buffer from 200 to 1 μm did not affect ENPP1 activity (Fig. 3C) and had minimal effect on the detection limit of AMP (Fig. 3D). With this minimal ENPP1 buffer, we obtained a linear cGAMP standard curve with a detection limit of 1 nm and a quantitation limit of 62.5 nm (Fig. 3E). With this optimized protocol, we achieved a smaller S.E. in the cGAMP standard curve than in the unoptimized protocol used to generate Fig. 1D. We named this fully optimized series of enzymatic reactions the cGAMP-Luc assay. With the linearity of the cGAMP standard curve established, we hypothesized that we could utilize the cGAMP-Luc assay to assess the potency of ENPP1 inhibitors. We incubated 5 μm cGAMP and 10 nm ENPP1 with a serial dilution of known ENPP1 inhibitors, STF-1084 (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and QS1 (26Shayhidin E.E. Forcellini E. Boulanger M.C. Mahmut A. Dautrey S. Barbeau X. Lagüe P. Sévigny J. Paquin J.F. Mathieu P. Quinazoline-4-piperidine sulfamides are specific inhibitors of human NPP1 and prevent pathological mineralization of valve interstitial cells.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 172 (26031197): 4189-419910.1111/bph.13204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After a 2-h incubation, we heat-inactivated ENPP1 to terminate the reaction and quantitated the resulting AMP. The cGAMP-Luc assay determined IC50 values of 149 ± 20 nm for STF-1084 and 1.59 ± .07 μm for QS1 (Fig. 3F). These values agree well with our previously reported values of 110 ± 10 nm for STF-1084 and 6.4 ± 3.2 μm for QS1, determined by measuring the degradation of 32P-labeled cGAMP by ENPP1 in the presence of ENPP1 inhibitors (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment further validates the ability of the cGAMP-Luc assay to be quantitative across a wide range of cGAMP concentrations. Our ultimate objective is to develop an assay to quantitate cGAMP in a wide array of biological samples. Ideally, such an assay would be able to measure intracellular and extracellular cGAMP levels during homeostasis and in cancer. To preserve cGAMP in these biological samples before measurement, ENPP1 inhibitors are required; ENPP1 potently degrades extracellular cGAMP as a result of its ubiquitous expression on the plasma membrane and in serum (21Li L. Yin Q. Kuss P. Maliga Z. Millán J.L. Wu H. Mitchison T.J. Hydrolysis of 2′3′-cGAMP by ENPP1 and design of nonhydrolyzable analogs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 (25344812): 1043-104810.1038/nchembio.1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To avoid the interference of ENPP1 inhibitors in the ENPP1-dependent portion of our cGAMP-Luc assay, we sought to develop a method that would allow us to purify cGAMP away from these inhibitors. Such a method would also preferentially be able to concentrate cGAMP and remove any other analytes, such as AMP, from complex culture medium that could lead to false positives in the assay. To this end, we developed STING-CAP (STING-mediated concentration and purification of cGAMP). In this method, biological samples containing cGAMP are treated with His-tagged STING. The resulting cGAMP:STING complexes are collected by magnetic nickel beads, which are subsequently washed and boiled in a minimal volume of buffer to elute cGAMP (Fig. 4A). To boost the robustness of the assay, we added Tween 20 and imidazole to prevent the nonspecific binding of unwanted proteins and molecules to the nickel beads, as well as protease inhibitors to prevent STING degradation. We optimized each step of this procedure to ensure maximal recovery of cGAMP (Fig. S2, A–D). To increase the ease of use of cGAMP-Luc, we also developed an alternate method of STING-CAP that replaces the magnetic nickel beads with standard nonmagnetic nickel beads and filter columns with no loss of detection limit (Fig. S2E). We paired STING-CAP and cGAMP-Luc to generate cGAMP standard curves in conditioned medium and human plasma. We collected conditioned medium from WT 293T cells, which do not produce any appreciable levels of cGAMP (17Carozza J.A. Böhnert V. Nguyen K.C. Skariah G. Shaw K.E. Brown J.A. Rafat M. von Eyben R. Graves E.E. Glenn J.S. Smith M. Li L. Extracellular cGAMP is a cancer-cell-produced immunotransmitter involved in radiation-induced anticancer immunity.Nat. Cancer. 2020; 1: 184-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two standard curves were generated by spiking cGAMP into 250 μl or 1400 μl of medium. From a volume of 250 μl, we obtained a quantitation limit of 9 nm (Fig. 4B), and from a volume of 1400 μl, we obtained a quantitation limit of 1.9 nm (Fig. 4C). In human plasma, we obtained a standard curve with a quantitation limit of 25 nm from 250 μl of plasma (Fig. 4D). We next tested whether cGAMP-Luc could be used to quantitate intracellular cGAMP from cell lysate. We lysed WT 293T cells in hypotonic buffer and added known concentrations of cGAMP into the lysate. Following complete lysis, we corrected the osmolarity of the buffer and performed the same STING-CAP and cGAMP-Luc assay steps as in the quantitation of extracellular cGAMP. The standard curve of intracellular cGAMP was generated with a detection limit of 26 nm from 20 million cells (Fig. 4E). With the cGAMP-Luc assay fully optimized, we sought to compare it with other methods of cGAMP quantitation. We first compared cGAMP-Luc with the commercially available cGAMP ELISA. Although expensive, the cGAMP ELISA is high-throughput in principle. However, the ELISA yielded a cGAMP standard curve with a dynamic range that spans barely an order of magnitude (Fig. 5A). This limited dynamic range makes the ELISA impractical for most applications, as several dilutions of a sample are required in order to find one that falls within the quantitation range of the standard curve. We next compared cGAMP-Luc with our previously developed MS method, the current gold standard of cGAMP quantitation. LC-MS/MS generates a linear standard curve with a quantitation limit of 4 nm, and cGAMP-Luc is capable of generating a standard curve spanning the same range (Fig. 5B and Fig. S3). To compare the quantitative abilities of the cGAMP-Luc assay and the LC-MS/MS assay, we prepared samples with known amounts of cGAMP and quantitated them utilizing the previously generated standard curves. At a wide range of concentrations of cGAMP, both assays were able to quantitate cGAMP with an average of ∼80% accuracy (Fig. 5C). In addition, we took time points of conditioned medium from a cGAS-overexpressing 293T line and used both assays to quantitate the cGAMP concentrations in these samples. The concentrations of cGAMP determined by the two assays agreed well with an average difference of less than 5% (Fig. 5D). We also measured the export of cGAMP from HeLa cells stimulated by dsDNA (Fig. 5E). The cGAMP-Luc assay is therefore as precise and sensitive an assay as LC-MS/MS, with additional high-throughput capacity. A summary of the advantages of each assay for cGAMP quantitation is listed in Fig. 5F. Here, we developed the cGAMP-Luc assay as the first high-throughput and quantitative detection assay for cGAMP at physiologically relevant concentrations. With the assistance of STING-CAP, the STING-mediated concentration, and purification of cGAMP, virtually any amount of cGAMP can be assayed from any sample type. cGAMP-Luc surpasses the detection limit and matches the accuracy of MS, the current gold standard for cGAMP quantitation, with the added benefit of a"
https://openalex.org/W3009787933,"Background Placental protein expression plays a crucial role during pregnancy. We hypothesized that: (1) circulating levels of pregnancy-associated, placenta-related proteins throughout gestation reflect the temporal progression of the uncomplicated, full-term pregnancy, and can effectively estimate gestational ages (GAs); and (2) preeclampsia (PE) is associated with disruptions in these protein levels early in gestation; and can identify impending PE. We also compared gestational profiles of proteins in the human and mouse, using pregnant heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) heterozygote (Het) mice, a mouse model reflecting PE-like symptoms. Methods Serum levels of placenta-related proteins–leptin (LEP), chorionic somatomammotropin hormone like 1 (CSHL1), elabela (ELA), activin A, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), and placental growth factor (PlGF)–were quantified by ELISA in blood serially collected throughout human pregnancies (20 normal subjects with 66 samples, and 20 subjects who developed PE with 61 samples). Multivariate analysis was performed to estimate the GA in normal pregnancy. Mean-squared errors of GA estimations were used to identify impending PE. The human protein profiles were then compared with those in the pregnant HO-1 Het mice. Results An elastic net-based gestational dating model was developed (R2 = 0.76) and validated (R2 = 0.61) using serum levels of the 6 proteins measured at various GAs from women with normal uncomplicated pregnancies. In women who developed PE, the model was not (R2 = -0.17) associated with GA. Deviations from the model estimations were observed in women who developed PE (P = 0.01). The model developed with 5 proteins (ELA excluded) performed similarly from sera from normal human (R2 = 0.68) and WT mouse (R2 = 0.85) pregnancies. Disruptions of this model were observed in both human PE-associated (R2 = 0.27) and mouse HO-1 Het (R2 = 0.30) pregnancies. LEP outperformed sFlt-1 and PlGF in differentiating impending PE at early human and late mouse GAs. Conclusions Serum placenta-related protein profiles are temporally regulated throughout normal pregnancies and significantly disrupted in women who develop PE. LEP changes earlier than the well-established biomarkers (sFlt-1 and PlGF). There may be evidence of a causative action of HO-1 deficiency in LEP upregulation in a PE-like murine model."

Discoidin domain receptor 1 (Ddr1) is expressed in chondrocytes, but the molecular mechanisms by which DDR1 regulates chondrocyte behaviors during the endochondral ossification process remain undefined. To elucidate Ddr1-mediate chondrocyte functions, we generated chondrocyte-specific Ddr1 knockout (CKOΔDdr1) mice in this study. The CKOΔDdr1 mice showed delayed development of the secondary ossification center and increased growth plate length in the hind limbs. In the tibial growth plate in CKOΔDdr1 mice, chondrocyte proliferation was reduced in the proliferation zone, and remarkable downregulation of Ihh, MMP13, and Col-X expression in chondrocytes resulted in decreased terminal differentiation in the hypertrophic zone. Furthermore, apoptotic chondrocytes were reduced in the growth plates of CKOΔDdr1 mice. We concluded that chondrocytes with Ddr1 knockout exhibit decreased proliferation, terminal differentiation, and apoptosis in growth plates, which delays endochondral ossification and results in short stature. We also demonstrated that Ddr1 regulates the Ihh/Gli1/Gli2/Col-X pathway to regulate chondrocyte terminal differentiation. These results indicate that Ddr1 is required for chondrocytes to regulate endochondral ossification in skeletal development."
https://openalex.org/W3010452664,"European honeybee, Apis mellifera, produces α-glucosidase (HBGase) that catalyzes the cleavage of an α-glycosidic bond of the non-reducing end of polysaccharides and has potential applications for malt hydrolysis in brewing industry. Characterized by their substrate specificities, HBGases have three isoforms including HBGase II, which prefers maltose to sucrose as a substrate. Previous study found that the catalytic efficiency of maltose hydrolysis of N226P mutant of HBGase II was higher than that of the wild type (WT), and the catalytic efficiency of maltose hydrolysis of WT was higher than those of H227Y and N226P-H227Y mutants. We hypothesized that N226P mutation probably caused maltose to bind with better affinity and position/orientation for hydrolysis than WT, while H227Y and N226P-H227Y mutations caused maltose to bind with worse affinity and position/orientation for hydrolysis than WT. Using this hypothesis, we performed molecular dynamics on the catalytically competent binding conformations of maltose/WT, maltose/N226P, maltose/H227Y, and maltose/N226P-H227Y complexes to elucidate effects of N226P and H227Y mutations on maltose binding in HBGase II active site. Our results reasonably support this hypothesis because the N226P mutant had better binding affinity, higher number of important binding residues, strong and medium hydrogen bonds as well as shorter distance between atoms necessary for hydrolysis than WT, while the H227Y and N226P-H227Y mutants had worse binding affinities, lower number of important binding residues and strong hydrogen bonds as well as longer distances between atoms necessary for hydrolysis than WT. Moreover, results of binding free energy and hydrogen bond interaction of residue 227 support the role of H227 as a maltose preference residue, as proposed by previous studies. Our study provides important and novel insight into how N226P and H227Y mutations affect maltose binding in HBGase II active site. This knowledge could potentially be used to engineer HBGase II to improve its efficiency."

Concentrations of CSF-derived EVs were almost similar in both groups. CT/HIV (mean: 2.9 x 109 EVs/mL) and OI/HIV (mean: 4.8 x 109 EVs/mL). Analyses by NTA confirmed that CSF-derived EVs and serum-derived EVs had size and shape similar to microvesicles and exosomes. The mean size of EVs was similar in serum and CSF. Thus, the concentration, and not size was able distinguish patients with toxoplasmosis than healthy individuals. Presence of exosomes was also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and evidence of tetraspanins CD63 and CD9 in immunoblotting. Relative expressions of miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-29c-3p and miR-125b-5p were estimated in exosomal miRNA extracted of EVs. Serum-derived EVs from group II (cerebral and gestational toxoplasmosis) up-expressed miR-125b-5p and miR-146a-5p. CSF-derived EVs from CT/HIV patients) up-expressed miR-155-5p and miR-21-5p and were unable to express miR-29c-3p.These data suggest the participation of EVs and exosomal miRNAs in unbalance of immune response as elevation of TNF-α, IL-6; and downregulation of IFN-γ in cerebral and gestational forms of toxoplasmosis."
https://openalex.org/W3009630152,"Fatigue is a common adverse event during lenvatinib treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. One mechanism contributing to development of fatigue might involve abnormal adenosine triphosphate synthesis that is caused by carnitine deficiency. To address this possibility, we examined the relationship between carnitine levels and fatigue during lenvatinib treatment.This prospective study evaluated 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent lenvatinib treatment. Both blood and urine samples were collected from the patients before starting lenvatinib therapy (day 0), and on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 thereafter. Plasma and urine concentrations of free and acyl carnitine (AC) were assessed at each time point. The changes in daily fatigue were evaluated using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI).Plasma levels of free carnitine (FC) at days 3 and 7 were significantly higher compared with baseline (p = 0.005, p = 0.005, respectively). The urine FC level at day 3 was significantly higher compared with baseline (p = 0.030) and that of day 7 tended to be higher compared with baseline (p = 0.057). The plasma AC concentration at days 14 and 28 was significantly higher compared with that of baseline (p = 0.002, p = 0.005, respectively). The plasma AC-to-FC (AC/FC) ratio on days 14 and 28 was significantly higher compared with baseline (p = 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). There were significant correlations between the plasma AC/FC ratio and the change in the BFI score at days 14 and 28 (r = 0.461, p = 0.041; r = 0.770, p = 0.002, respectively).Longitudinal assessments of carnitine and fatigue in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma suggest that lenvatinib affects the carnitine system in patients undergoing lenvatinib therapy and that carnitine insufficiency increases fatigue. The occurrence of carnitine insufficiency may be a common cause of fatigue during the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3009847852,"In many countries, emission of insufficiently treated wastewater into water bodies appears to be an important factor in spreading clinically relevant antimicrobial resistant bacteria. In this study, we looked for the presence of Enterobacteriaceae strains with resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporin antibiotics in four urban wetlands in southwestern Nigeria by isolation, whole genome sequencing and qPCR enumeration of marker genes. Genome analysis of multi-drug resistant and potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates (members of the widely distributed ST10 complex) revealed the presence of the extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene blaCTX-M-15 on self-transmissible IncF plasmids. The gene was also present together with a blaTEM-1B gene on self-transmissible IncH plasmids in multi-drug resistant Enterobacter cloacae isolates. A Citrobacter freundii isolate carried blaTEM-1B on an IncR-type plasmid without discernable conjugation apparatus. All strains were isolated from a wetland for which previous qPCR enumeration of marker genes, in particular the ratio of intI1 to 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, had indicated a strong anthropogenic impact. Consistent with the isolation origin, qPCR analysis in this study showed that the blaCTX-M gene was present at an abundance of 1x10-4 relative to bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers. The results indicate that contamination of these urban aquatic ecosystems with clinically relevant antibiotic resistant bacteria is substantial in some areas. Measures should therefore be put in place to mitigate the propagation of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance within the Nigerian aquatic ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3009918449,"Background Uncorrected refractive error (URE) is a major cause of vision impairment among children that impacts negatively on their lives including distresses. We aim to understand the disability-related distress among vision-impaired children due to URE in rural and semi-rural South Africa using qualitative techniques. Methods Structured focus groups of children (aged 5–12 years old) with normal vision and vision impairment due to URE from four schools in Pinetown, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, were performed (four mixed-gender group discussions and eight single gender group discussions). We recruited the study participants after the children underwent standardised vision screening. Criterion sampling was used when selecting study participants. The interviews were transcribed to identify meaning units and broken down to condensed meaning units, which were then grouped into megathemes. Themes were then generated. Results Thirteen children with normal vision and 63 children with vision impairment due to URE participated in the twelve focus group discussions with 36 boys (47%) and 40 girls (53%). Twelve themes were generated. The megathemes were Loss of Self Confidence (number of themes (n) = 3), Loss of self-worth (n = 3), Loss of interconnection/ interaction with community (n = 2), Humiliation (n = 2) and Discrimination (n = 2). Conclusions We found that vision impairment due to URE can cause distress in different domains in children’s life and further grouped them into different themes. The themes will be used for the development of a tool to assess disability-related distress among children with vision impairment due to URE. We also recommend that distresses caused by URE should be taken into consideration when designing eye care programmes for children."
https://openalex.org/W3010068520,"Getting a grip on how we may age healthily is a central interest of biogerontological research. To this end, a number of academic teams developed platforms for life- and healthspan assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans. These are very appealing for medium- to high throughput screens, but a broader implementation is lacking due to many systems relying on custom scripts for data analysis that others struggle to adopt. Hence, user-friendly recommendations would help to translate raw data into interpretable results. The aim of this communication is to streamline the analysis of data obtained by the WorMotel, an economically and practically appealing screening platform, in order to facilitate the use of this system by interested researchers. We here detail recommendations for the stepwise conversion of raw image data into activity values and explain criteria for assessment of health in C. elegans based on locomotion. Our analysis protocol can easily be adopted by researchers, and all needed scripts and a tutorial are available in S1 and S2 Files."
https://openalex.org/W3010030124,"Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly consumed analgesics world wide. Generally perceived as a safe medication, it is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States with inadvertent hepatotoxicity in half of all cases. We therefore conducted a survey on the public perceptions of acetaminophen in patients attending the outpatient clinic in Vancouver, Canada. Among 928 patients who were asked, 765 completed the survey questionnaire. The majority of respondents were female (59%), Caucasian (61%), and educated beyond the secondary school level (81%). 23% reported using acetaminophen at least once a week. A significant minority were unaware of the potential liver toxicity of acetaminophen (24%), and knowledge of hepatotoxicity did not vary with education status. In terms of the medicinal composition of acetaminophen products, over half of the respondents (58%) did not know that extra strength preparations of acetaminophen contained the same drug but in a different dose. This knowledge was more prevalent among those with higher level of education (49% in graduate school educated respondents), but was still low overall. The knowledge that alcohol use with acetaminophen was more harmful was low (43%), but improved with level of education (P for trend 0.03). Among respondents who consumed alcohol regularly, 21% were consuming over 1.5 grams of acetaminophen at a time. These patients had similar harm perception to liver as patients who consumed lower doses of acetaminophen. Overall, in a large, well-educated cohort of patients, knowledge about the adverse effects of acetaminophen, the additional risks with alcohol and composition of various retailed products was suboptimal. We speculate that consumer ignorance is a significant reason why acetaminophen is a leading cause of acute liver failure."

Twenty participants suspected of having OSAS were recruited. During PSG study, IOP was monitored using a CLS placed in the eye of the patient. The patients were classified according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in two categories, severe (>30) or mild/moderate (<30) OSAS. We evaluated several parameters determined by the IOP curves, including nocturnal elevations (acrophase) and plateau times in acrophase (PTs) defined by mathematical and visual methods.The IOP curves exhibited a nocturnal acrophase followed by PTs of varying extents at which the IOP remained higher than daytime measurement with small variations. We found significant differences in the length of the PTs in patients with severe OSAS compared to those with mild/moderate disease (P = 0.032/P = 0.028). We found a positive correlation between PTs and OSAS severity measured by the total number of apneic events (r = 0.681/0.751 P = 0.004/0.001) and AHI (r = 0.674/0.710, P = 0.004/0.002). Respiratory-related arousal and oxygen saturation also were associated significantly with the IOP PT length.Periods of nocturnal IOP elevation lasted longer in severe OSAS patients than those with mild/moderate OSAS and correlate with the severity of the disease. The length of the nocturnal PT is also associated to respiratory parameters altered in patients with OSAS."
https://openalex.org/W3009994885,"Background Hepatitis C virus core antigen (HCV Ag) assay has been proposed as a more economical alternative to HCV RNA detection. This study aimed to investigate the clinical utility of HCV Ag assay in the monitoring of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C patients. Methods We analyzed serum samples from 110 patients treated with paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir (PrOD) with or without ribavirin. The levels for both HCV Ag and HCV RNA assessed by COBAS TaqMan HCV (CTM) Test or Abbott RealTime HCV (ART) assay were evaluated at baseline, week 2, 4, and 12 during treatment and 12 weeks after completion. Results Baseline HCV Ag levels showed good correlations with HCV viral load (r = 0.879; p<0.001); whereas the correlation was slightly stronger with CTM test than with ART assay (p = 0.074). The concordance of HCV Ag and HCV RNA undetectability was significantly better in CTM test than in ART assay at week 2 (p = 0.003) and week 4 (p = 0.003). A sustained viral response 12 weeks off therapy (SVR12) was achieved in 108 patients (98%); the HCV Ag assay identified 99% of these patients. Both undetectability of serum HCV Ag and HCV RNA had high positive predictive value at week 2 (98% vs. 100%) and at week 4 (97% vs. 99%) in predicting SVR12. Conclusions HCV Ag assay may be a feasible alternative to HCV RNA for the determination of SVR12 in patients treated with DAAs."
https://openalex.org/W3010099336,"Background The link between parental divorce and adolescents’ academic achievement may depend on parental educational levels. However, findings have been inconsistent regarding whether the negative associations between parental divorce and adolescents’ academic outcomes are greater or smaller in highly educated families. The present study aimed to investigate the possible heterogeneity in the associations between divorce and adolescents’ academic achievement by parental educational levels, within the context of the elaborate Norwegian welfare state. Methods The population-based cross-sectional youth@hordaland study of adolescents aged 16–19 years conducted in Norway in 2012, provided information about parental divorce and was linked to national administrative registries (N = 9,166) to obtain high-quality, objective data on the adolescents’ grade point average (GPA), and their parents’ educational qualifications and income. Results The negative association between parental divorce and GPA was stronger among adolescents with educated or highly educated parents compared to adolescents with less educated parents. This heterogeneity was driven by maternal educational qualifications, whereby divorce was more strongly and negatively associated with GPA among adolescents with educated mothers compared to those with less educated mothers, independent of paternal educational levels and income measures. Conclusions Among adolescents whose parents have low educational qualifications, parental divorce is not associated with their academic achievement. Educated divorced mothers appear less likely to transfer their educational advantages onto their children than nondivorced equally educated mothers, perhaps due to a “double-burden” regarding work pressure and child-rearing responsibilities. There is a need for future studies to detail the mechanisms underlying this finding."
https://openalex.org/W2955225656,"Despite the spectacular success of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases, fears about their safety and other anti-vaccination claims are widespread. To better understand how such fears and claims persist and spread, we must understand how they are perceived and recalled. One influence on the perception and recall of vaccination-related information might be universal cognitive biases acting against vaccination. An omission bias describes the tendency to perceive as worse, and recall better, bad outcomes resulting from commissions (e.g. vaccine side effects) compared to the same bad outcomes resulting from omissions (e.g. symptoms of vaccine preventable diseases). Another factor influencing the perception and recall of vaccination-related information might be people’s attitudes towards vaccines. A confirmation bias would mean that pre-existing pro-vaccination attitudes positively predict perceptions of severity and recall of symptoms of vaccine preventable diseases and negatively predict perceptions of severity and recall of vaccine side effects. To test for these hypothesized biases, 202 female participants aged 18–60 (M = 38.15, SD = 10.37) completed an online experiment with a between-subjects experimental design. Participants imagined that they had a 1-year old child who suffered from either vaccine side effects (Commission Condition) or symptoms of a vaccine-preventable disease (Omission Condition). They then rated a list of symptoms/side effects for their perceived severity on a 7-point Likert scale. Finally, they completed a surprise recall test in which they recalled the symptoms/side effects previously rated. An additional scale was used to measure their attitudes towards vaccines. Contrary to the hypotheses, perceptions of severity and the recall of symptoms/side effects were not associated with experimental condition, failing to support the omission bias, nor did they interact with attitudes towards vaccines, failing to support the confirmation bias. This cast doubt on the possibility that the spread of anti-vaccination claims can be explained by these particular universal cognitive biases."
https://openalex.org/W3010243874,"Objective To identify the geographic, organisational, and payment correlates of buprenorphine and methadone treatment among substance abuse treatment (SAT) providers. Methods Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007–16 were conducted. We provide bivariate descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007–16. Using multiple logistic regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results Buprenorphine is increasingly offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions Greater attention towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted, especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related use disorders bears further scrutiny."
https://openalex.org/W3009112301,"Aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) is a widespread commercial forest tree of high economic importance in western Canada and has been subject to tree improvement efforts over the past two decades. Such improvement programs rely on accurate estimates of the genetic gain in growth traits and correlated response in adaptive traits that are important for forest health. Here, we estimated genetic parameters in 10 progeny trials containing >30,000 trees with pedigree structures based on a partial factorial mating design that includes 60 half-sibs, 100 full-sib families and 1,400 clonally replicated genotypes. Estimated narrow-sense and broad-sense heritabilities were low for height and diameter (~0.2), but moderate for the dates of budbreak and leaf senescence (~0.4). Furthermore, estimated genetic correlations between growth and phenology were moderate to strong with tall trees being associated with early budbreak (r = -0.3) and late leaf senescence (r = -0.7). Survival was not compromised, but was positively associated with early budbreak or late leaf senescence, indicating that utilizing the growing season was more important for survival and growth than avoiding early fall or late spring frosts. These result suggests that populations are adapted to colder climate conditions and lag behind environmental conditions to which they are optimally adapted due to substantial climate warming observed over the last several decades for the study area."

Modeling is a powerful tool for informing decision-making about current and future practices. We present a model to evaluate the effects of crop diversification on the robustness of simulated farms under labor shocks. We use an example inspired by the Florida production system of high-value, labor-intensive fruits. We find that crop diversification to high-value crops is a robust strategy when labor shocks are mild, and that crop diversification becomes less valuable as more simulated farms practice it. Based on our results, we suggest that crop diversification is a useful management strategy under specific conditions, but that policies designed to encourage crop diversification must consider broad effects as well as farm-level benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3009387897,"The cephalochordates amphioxus or lancelets are benthic marine animals representing the earliest divergent evolutionary lineage within chordates. Although amphioxus are present in most of the world’s tropical and temperate oceans, only about thirty different species grouped into three different genera, Branchiostoma, Epigonichthys and Asymmetron have been described. In the genus Asymmetron, only two species have been characterized, although for one of them, A. lucayanum, several cryptic lineages exist. In this work we have sequenced and analyzed the mitogenome of an A. lucayanum population previously described in the Red Sea. The phylogenetic study using this complete mitogenome as well as the analysis of COI gene sequences of several individuals of this Red Sea population show that the Red Sea population is a new cryptic species. We propose to call this new species Asymmetron rubrum."
https://openalex.org/W3010170831,"Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a clear beneficial motor response to levodopa (LD) treatment. However, with disease progression and longer LD exposure, drug-related motor fluctuations usually occur. Recognition of the individual relationship between LD concentration and its effect may be difficult, due to the complexity and variability of the mechanisms involved. This work proposes an innovative procedure for the automatic estimation of LD pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters, by a biologically-inspired mathematical model. An original issue, compared with previous similar studies, is that the model comprises not only a compartmental description of LD pharmacokinetics in plasma and its effect on the striatal neurons, but also a neurocomputational model of basal ganglia action selection. Parameter estimation was achieved on 26 patients (13 with stable and 13 with fluctuating LD response) to mimic plasma LD concentration and alternate finger tapping frequency along four hours after LD administration, automatically minimizing a cost function of the difference between simulated and clinical data points. Results show that individual data can be satisfactorily simulated in all patients and that significant differences exist in the estimated parameters between the two groups. Specifically, the drug removal rate from the effect compartment, and the Hill coefficient of the concentration-effect relationship were significantly higher in the fluctuating than in the stable group. The model, with individualized parameters, may be used to reach a deeper comprehension of the PD mechanisms, mimic the effect of medication, and, based on the predicted neural responses, plan the correct management and design innovative therapeutic procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3010250600,"Blood glucose is vital for many physiological pathways and can be quantified by clinical chemistry analyzers and in-house point-of-care (POC) devices. Pre-analytical and analytical factors can influence blood glucose measurements. This project aimed to investigate pre-analytical factors on whole blood and plasma glucose measurements in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) by evaluating the effects of storage (refrigeration) up to 48h after sampling and of packed cell volume (PCV) on whole blood glucose analysis by POC glucometer (time series n = 13); and by evaluating the effects of storage (room temperature and refrigeration) on plasma glucose concentrations using a dry slide chemistry analyzer (DCA) at various conditions: immediate processing and delayed plasma separation from erythrocytes at 24h and 48h (time series n = 14). The POC glucometer had overall strong agreement with the DCA (CCC = 0.76, r = 0.84, Cb = 0.90), but consistently overestimated glucose concentrations (mean difference: +0.4 mmol/L). The POC glucometer results decreased significantly over time, resulting in a substantial decline within the first 2h (0.41±0.47 mmol/L; 8±9%) that could potentially alter clinical decisions, thereby highlighting the need for immediate analysis using this method. The effects of PCV on glucose could not be assessed, as the statistical significance was associated with one outlier. Storage method significantly affected plasma glucose measurements using DCA, with room temperature samples resulting in rapid decreases of 3.57±0.89 mmol/L (77±9%) over the first 48h, while refrigerated samples provided consistent plasma glucose results over the same time period (decrease of 0.26±0.23 mmol/L; 6±5%). The results from this study provide new insights into optimal blood sample handling and processing for glucose analysis in sea turtles, show the suitability of the POC glucometer as a rapid diagnostic test, and confirm the reliability of plasma glucose measurements using refrigeration. These findings emphasize the need to consider pre-/analytical factors when interpreting blood glucose results from loggerhead sea turtles."
https://openalex.org/W3010477678,"The idea that households produce and consume their own energy, that is, energy self-sufficiency at a very local level, captures the popular imagination and commands political support across parts of Europe. This paper investigates the technical and economic feasibility of household energy self-sufficiency in Switzerland, which can be seen as representative for other regions with a temperate climate, by 2050. We compare sixteen cases that vary across four dimensions: household type, building type, electricity demand reduction, and passenger vehicle use patterns. We assume that photovoltaic (PV) electricity supplies all energy, which implies a complete shift away from fossil fuel based heating and internal combustion engine vehicles. Two energy storage technologies are considered: short-term storage in lithium-ion batteries and long-term storage with hydrogen, requiring an electrolyzer, storage tank, and a fuel cell for electricity conversion. We examine technological feasibility and total system costs for self-sufficient households compared to base cases that rely on fossil fuels and the existing power grid. PV efficiency and available rooftop/facade area are most critical with respect to the overall energy balance. Single-family dwellings with profound electricity demand reduction and urban mobility patterns achieve self-sufficiency most easily. Multi-family buildings with conventional electricity demand and rural mobility patterns can only be self-sufficient if PV efficiency increases, and all of the roof plus most of the facade can be covered with PV. All self-sufficient cases are technically feasible but more expensive than fully electrified grid-connected cases. Self-sufficiency may even become cost-competitive in some cases depending on storage and fossil fuel prices. Thus, if political measures improve their financial attractiveness or individuals decide to shoulder the necessary investments, self-sufficient buildings may start to become increasingly prevalent."
https://openalex.org/W3009178876,"Ambiguity aversion–the tendency to avoid options whose outcome probabilities are unknown—is a ubiquitous phenomenon. While in some cases ambiguity aversion is an adaptive strategy, in many situations it leads to suboptimal decisions, as illustrated by the famous Ellsberg Paradox. Behavioral interventions for reducing ambiguity aversion should therefore be of substantial practical value. Here we test a simple intervention, aimed at reducing ambiguity aversion in an experimental design, where aversion to ambiguity leads to reduced earnings. Participants made a series of choices between a reference lottery with a 50% chance of winning $5, and another lottery, which offered more money, but whose outcome probability was either lower than 50% (risky lottery) or not fully known (ambiguous lottery). Similar to previous studies, participants exhibited both risk and ambiguity aversion in their choices. They then went through one of three interventions. Two groups of participants learned about the Ellsberg Paradox and their own suboptimal choices, either by actively calculating the objective winning probability of the ambiguous lotteries, or by observing these calculations. A control group learned about base-rate neglect, which was irrelevant to the task. Following the intervention, participants again made a series of choices under risk and ambiguity. Participants who learned about the Ellsberg Paradox were more tolerant of ambiguity, yet ambiguity aversion was not completely abolished. At the same time, these participants also exhibited reduced aversion to risk, suggesting inappropriate generalization of learning to an irrelevant decision domain. Our results highlight the challenge for behavioral interventions: generating a strong, yet specific, behavioral change."
https://openalex.org/W3009939534,"An understanding of menstruation and its relationship to fertility can help women know the gestational age of any pregnancies, and thus identify preterm births. It can also help women avoid unintended pregnancies. However, little is known about women, and especially men’s, menstruation and fertility knowledge, outside of research on adolescent girls and stigma, and in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Additionally, little is known about practices surrounding the tracking of menstruation and fertility, and how, if at all, women would like to be supported in this. This research is the first phase in adapting a support tool for women in a LMIC, using an implementation science approach to understand relevant cultural needs. We explored women and men’s understanding of the relationship between menstruation and fertility, and their interest in support tools, through in-depth qualitative interviews in rural western Kenya. We interviewed 45 adult men, adult women and adolescent women all who had children in 2018. We found high levels of misinformation about menstruation and fertility, with most respondents not knowing the correct times when a woman could become pregnant. Common sources of knowledge included friends/family and school. Few women got information from health providers, even when they were at a facility already for care. There were mixed feelings from women about wanting support from male partners regarding tracking menstruation. While women were interested in a tool that could help them track their menstruation and pregnancies, they had privacy concerns about a mobile health app approach and preferred simpler calendar based tools. This study provides evidence for the high need for correct menstruation information among both men and women, and not only for adolescents. It also suggests that despite the international health community’s enthusiasm for mobile health solutions, that approach might not be most appropriate for this topic and setting."
https://openalex.org/W3009139392,"Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been highly successful in controlling HIV replication, reducing viral burden, and preventing both progression to AIDS and viral transmission. Yet, ART alone cannot cure the infection. Even after years of successful therapy, ART withdrawal leads inevitably to viral rebound within a few weeks or months. Our hypothesis: effective therapy must control both the replicating virus pool and the reactivatable latent viral reservoir. To do this, we have combined ART and immunotherapy to attack both viral pools simultaneously. The vaccine regimen consisted of DNA vaccine expressing SIV Gag, followed by a boost with live attenuated rubella/gag vectors. The vectors grow well in rhesus macaques, and they are potent immunogens when used in a prime and boost strategy. We infected rhesus macaques by high dose mucosal challenge with virulent SIVmac251 and waited three days to allow viral dissemination and establishment of a reactivatable viral reservoir before starting ART. While on ART, the control group received control DNA and empty rubella vaccine, while the immunotherapy group received DNA/gag prime, followed by boosts with rubella vectors expressing SIV gag over 27 weeks. Both groups had a vaccine ""take"" to rubella, and the vaccine group developed antibodies and T cells specific for Gag. Five weeks after the last immunization, we stopped ART and monitored virus rebound. All four control animals eventually had a viral rebound, and two were euthanized for AIDS. One control macaque did not rebound until 2 years after ART release. In contrast, there was only one viral rebound in the vaccine group. Three out of four vaccinees had no viral rebound, even after CD8 depletion, and they remain in drug-free viral remission more than 2.5 years later. The strategy of early ART combined with immunotherapy can produce a sustained SIV remission in macaques and may be relevant for immunotherapy of HIV in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3009379980,"Dynamic soaring is a flight technique used by albatrosses and other birds to cover large distances without the expenditure of energy, which is extracted from the available wind conditions, as brightly perceived five centuries ago by Leonardo da Vinci. Closed dynamic soaring trajectories use spatial variations of wind speed to travel, in principle, indefinitely over a prescribed area. The application of the concept of closed dynamic soaring trajectories to aerial vehicles, such as UAVs, may provide a solution to improve the endurance in certain missions. The main limitation of dynamic soaring is its dependence on the wind characteristics. More than one century ago, Lord Rayleigh proposed a very simple model, based on the repeated crossing of a step wind profile, presently known as Rayleigh cycle, that provides a clear explanation of the physical phenomenon. The present paper studies the feasibility of closed, single-loop, energy-neutral trajectories for a broad set of wind and vehicle conditions. Through the use of trajectory optimization methods, it was possible to see how the shape of the wind profile, the initial flight conditions and the vehicle constraints influence the required wind strength to perform dynamic soaring trajectories and consequently their feasibility. It was possible to conclude that there are optimal values for the initial airspeed and initial height of the vehicle, that minimize the required wind strength. In addition, it was seen how the structural and aerodynamic constraints of the vehicle affect dynamic soaring at high and low airspeeds respectively. Finally, some new trajectories that can be performed in conditions of excess wind are proposed. The purpose is to maximize the time spent aloft and the path length while maintaining the concept of single-loop, energy-neutral trajectories, making them especially useful for aerial vehicles surveillance applications."
https://openalex.org/W3009954596,"Chinese women are known to have both a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) <50 nmol/l). Associations between sleep duration and circulating 25OHD have recently been reported but, to our knowledge, these associations have not been studied in older Chinese populations. We thus investigated whether sleep duration was associated with vitamin D status in a population from Macao, China, and whether sleep duration modified the association between MetS and vitamin D deficiency. In 207 older (>55 years) Macanese, anthropometry, blood samples and validated questionnaires, including sleep duration and cardiovascular risk factors, were simultaneously collected. On multivariable categorical analyses, those women, not men, who had short sleep duration (≤6 hours (h)) were at a 2-fold risk for vitamin D deficiency (both <50 nmol/L and <37 nmol/L; OR = 1.94, 95%CI 1.29–2.92; OR = 2.05, 95%CI 1.06–3.98, respectively) and those who had longer sleep duration (>8 h) were 3-fold more likely to have vitamin D deficiency (OR = 3.07, 95%CI 1.47–6.39; OR = 2.75, 95%CI 1.08–7.00, respectively) compared to those with normal sleep duration (6–8 h). Both women and men with MetS were 2-fold more likely to have vitamin D deficiency (women: OR = 2.04, 95%CI 1.31–3.17; OR = 2.15, 95%CI 1.11–4.17, respectively; men: OR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.23–3.28; OR = 2.04, 95%CI 1.00–4.29, respectively). Moreover, women with both short sleep duration and MetS had an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR = 3.26, 95%CI 1.10–9.64). These associations were not found in those with longer sleep. Men with longer sleep and MetS had a 5-fold risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR = 5.22; 95%CI 2.70–10.12). This association was non-significant for men with shorter sleep. We conclude that both short and long sleep duration were associated with vitamin D deficiency in older Chinese women. Further research is needed in larger cohorts or with intervention studies to further examine the associations between reduced sleep, metabolic syndrome and vitamin D deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3010005773,"Historically, time preferences are modelled by assuming constant discounting, which implies a constant level of impatience. The prevailing empirical finding, however, is decreasing impatience (DI), meaning that levels of impatience decrease over time. Theoretically, such changes in impatience are crucial to understand behavior and self-control problems. Very few methods exist to measure DI without being restricted to or confounded by certain assumptions about the discounting function or utility curve. One such measure is the recently introduced DI-index, which has been applied to both monetary and health outcomes. The DI-index quantifies the deviation from constant impatience and is flexible enough to capture both increasing and decreasing impatience. In this study, we apply the DI-index to measure impatience for health outcomes in a reference-dependent framework. That is, we measure impatience for both health gains and health losses compared to a reference-point, in individual and societal settings, using a within-subjects design (n = 98). We allowed for both positive and negative discounting, since negative discounting has been observed for losses (i.e. preferring to incur losses earlier rather than later) in earlier work. To capture changes in time inconsistency when subjects show negative discounting (i.e. patience), we modify the DI-index to a decreasing (im)patience (DIP)-index, which can be applied without loss of generality. As in earlier work, we observe large heterogeneity in time consistency; i.e., a mix of decreasing, increasing and constant (im)patience. Across all DIP-indices elicited, increasing impatience was the modal preference for those satisfying impatience, and decreasing patience for those satisfying patience. No systematic differences were observed between health gains and losses or between societal and individual outcomes. This suggests that for health outcomes both patient and impatient individuals assign more importance to time differences delayed further in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3010569595,"The aim of this work was to study the effect of a high sodium (HS) diet on blood pressure and renal function in male adult rats that have been treated with a dual Endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) during their early postnatal period (day 1 to 20 of life). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in four groups: CNS: control rats with normosodic diet; ERANS: ERA-treated rats with normosodic diet; CHS: control rats with high sodium diet; ERAHS: ERA-treated rats with HS diet. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was recorded before and after the diet and 24-hour metabolic cage studies were performed. AQP2 and α-ENac expressions were measured by western blot and real time PCR in the renal medulla. Vasopressin (AVP) pathway was evaluated by measuring V2 receptor and adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6) expression and cAMP production in the renal medulla. Pre-pro ET-1mRNA was also evaluated in the renal medulla. Only rats that had been treated with an ERA during their postnatal period increased their SBP after consumption of a HS diet, showing an impaired capacity to excrete sodium and water, i.e. developing salt sensitivity. This salt sensitivity would be mediated by an increase in renomedullary expression and activity of AQP2 and α-ENaC as a consequence of increased AC6 expression and cAMP production and/or a decreased ET-1 production in the renal medulla. The knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the perinatal programming of salt sensitive hypertension will allow the development of reprogramming strategies in order to avoid this pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3009593604,"Multidrug-resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection has emerged as a prominent cause of invasive infections in Africa. We investigated the prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant invasive NTS infections, conducted exploratory analysis of risk factors for resistance, and described antimicrobial use in western Kenya. We conducted a secondary analysis of existing laboratory, epidemiology, and clinical data from three independent projects, a malaria vaccine trial, a central nervous system (CNS) study, and the International Emerging Infections Program morbidity surveillance (surveillance program) during 2009-2014. We calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ceftriaxone-resistant NTS infections compared with ceftriaxone-susceptible infections. We surveyed hospitals, pharmacies, and animal drug retailers about the availability and use of antimicrobials. In total, 286 invasive NTS infections were identified in the three projects; 43 NTS isolates were ceftriaxone-resistant. The absolute prevalence of ceftriaxone resistance varied among these methodologically diverse projects, with 18% (16/90) of isolates resistant to ceftriaxone in the vaccine trial, 89% (16/18) in the CNS study, and 6% (11/178) in the surveillance program. Invasive ceftriaxone-resistant infections increased over time. Most ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were co-resistant to multiple other antimicrobials. Having an HIV-positive mother (OR = 3.7; CI = 1.2-11.4) and taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the current illness (OR = 9.6, CI = 1.2-78.9) were significantly associated with acquiring ceftriaxone-resistant invasive NTS infection. Ceftriaxone and other antibiotics were widely prescribed; multiple issues related to prescription practices and misuse were identified. In summary, ceftriaxone-resistant invasive NTS infection is increasing and limiting treatment options for serious infections. Efforts are ongoing to address the urgent need for improved microbiologic diagnostic capacity and an antimicrobial surveillance system in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W3010463740,"Risk-takers are rhetorically extolled in America, but does this veneration ignore the downsides of failure? We test competing perspectives on how workplace risk-takers are perceived by examining cultural attitudes about individuals who successfully take, unsuccessful take, and avoid risks at work. The results of two experiments show that, in comparison to risk-avoidance, expected workplace outcomes are enhanced by successful risk-taking and that failure does not appear to significantly harm expected workplace outcomes for risk-takers. While one experiment finds that failed risk-takers are seen as more likely to be downsized (because they are viewed as more foolish), we also find failed risk-takers are perceived as more likely to be hired and promoted. Mediation analyses reveal this is primarily because risk-taking-regardless of outcome-considerably increases perceptions of agency and decreases perceptions of indecisiveness, and these attributions predict positive workplace outcomes. We also find the results to be remarkably similar across varying participant characteristics (namely, gender, race, education level, work experience, income, and age), which suggests that there is a broad cultural consensus in the U.S. about the value of risk-taking. In sum, we find evidence that observers generally make more positive attributions about risk-takers than about risk-avoiders, even when risk-takers fail."
https://openalex.org/W3009049983,"Medication dispensing performed without the necessary information on proper use can result in harmful effects to the individual, and therefore providing this service with quality for the users is necessary to promote the rational use of medication; however, in a developing country this activity is performed largely by unqualified people and in an inappropriate way. This study aims to develop and validate a study instrument that measures the knowledge of medication dispensing for the professionals involved in this practice (pharmacist, pharmacy technician in the pharmacy, and clerk/assistant). The study has methodological design and is characterized by the development and validation of an instrument to measure the knowledge of dispensation. A questionnaire denominated CDM-51 was elaborated and divided in two parts: the first collects the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, and the second has 51 questions to assess the knowledge construct regarding dispensation. The validity of content was realized through the evaluation by seven experts regarding the relevance and clarity of the items. A pretest and main validation study with 30 and 79 pharmacy professionals respectively, from the city of Ribeirão Preto in the Brazilian state of São Paulo were carried out, and questions presented to the respondents were corrected. The analysis of the internal consistency of the KR-20 (Kuder-Richardson) was 0.837, and validity construct evidence was found (p value: 0.001) that participants with formal education have greater knowledge of medication dispensing. This work contributes to increasing the quality of services provided by dispensing pharmacies and points out the importance of training for formal education to perform this service, thus promoting the rational use of medication."
https://openalex.org/W3010423217,"The purpose of the study was to determine the impact of the performance of bimanual coordination tasks with specific characteristics on the changes in quality of coordination, musculoskeletal load of the upper limbs and cognitive functions.A group of 26 people aged 60-67 years performed 6 sessions of bimanual coordination training. Each session included set of tasks that varied depending on the shape in which the cursor moved, the coordination mode (in-phase, anti-phase, complex) and the tracking mode (imposed or freely chosen speed). Performance was assessed by: Error, Variability and Execution. The load of upper limb muscles was expressed with the value of the normalized EMG amplitude. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Vienna Test System. The Variability and Error values obtained during the sixth training session decreased by more than 50% of the initial values. Tasks with freely chosen speed showed changes from 15% to 34% for Error and from 45% to 50% for Variability. For tasks with imposed speed and coordination mode anti-phase or complex it was between 51% and 58% for Error and between 58% and 68% for Variability. Statistically significant differences between load during the sixth training session compared to the first session occurred in three out of four muscles and were between 9% to 39%. There were statistically significant differences in motor time and no differences in variables describing attention and working memory.Coordination mode is meaningful for improving coordination skills; tasks in the anti-phase and complex are recommended. Tracking mode also plays a role, tasks with an imposed cursor movement speed have greater potential to improve coordination skills than tasks with freely chosen. Improved control skills resulted in the reduction of upper limb musculoskeletal load. It can be assumed that an increase in coordination skills with the use of appropriate training can help to reduce musculoskeletal load."

https://openalex.org/W3009981132,"We utilize a contest-theoretic model to demonstrate a version of the alliance formation puzzle that aligns with reception-coverage contests in American football. Namely, secondary defenders can opt for single-coverage—1 v 1 contest. Alternatively, they can choose to ally—form double-coverage or 2 v 1 contest with exogenous intra-alliance prize division—when defending a given receiver. In our theoretical treatment, we find that defenses have a lower equilibrium success rate in preventing the receiver from “getting open” under double-coverage than under single-coverage in the absence of capacity constraints. We also find that this success rate paradox is a necessary condition for the alliance formation puzzle. We then test the theoretical treatment by analyzing 8,508 plays of NCAA and NFL game data within a set of fixed effects, logistic regression models that control for receiver, level-of-play, and season-of-play. We find that equilibrium level of defensive success rises significantly and substantially (p-value < 0.01 and marginal effect of between 13 and 17 percentage points) when moving from single-coverage to double-coverage, ceteris paribus. There is strong evidence that the necessary condition for the alliance formation puzzle does not hold in this setting. We conclude that sufficiently-binding physiological and training-based capacity constraints eliminate the alliance formation puzzle in this setting, as was shown theoretically by Konrad and Kovenock (2009). This empirical result suggests that other contest settings that regularly feature alliance, such as liquidity-constrained conflict, may not be puzzling."
https://openalex.org/W3010355413,"Category-based induction involves the generalization of a novel property (conclusion property) to a new category (conclusion category), based on the knowledge that a category exemplar (premise category) has the respective novel property. Previous studies have shown that conclusion specificity (i.e., specific [S] or generic categories [G]) influences category-based induction. However, the timing of brain activity underlying this effect is not well known, especially with controlling the similarities of premise and conclusion categories between S and G arguments. In this study, the event-related potential (ERP) responses to category-based induction between S and G arguments were compared under both congruent (+, premise and conclusion categories are related) and incongruent (-, premise and conclusion categories are unrelated) arguments; additionally, the similarities of premise and conclusion categories between S and G arguments were controlled. The results showed that replicating this effect, S+ arguments have increased ""strong"" response rates compared to G+ arguments, suggesting that category-based induction is contingent on factors beyond matched similarities. Moreover, S arguments have more liberal inductive decision thresholds than G arguments, which suggest that conclusion specificity affects the inductive decision reflected by inductive decision thresholds. Furthermore, G+ arguments elicit greater P3a amplitudes than S+ arguments, which suggest greater attention resources allocation to the review of decisions for G+ arguments than that for S+ arguments. Taken together, the conclusion specificity effect during semantic category-based induction can be revealed by ""strong"" response rates, inductive decision thresholds, and P3a component after controlling the premise-conclusion similarity, providing evidence that category-based induction rely on more than simple similarity judgment and conclusion specificity would affect category-based induction."
