https://openalex.org/W2165603404,"National and international economic policy has usually ignored the environment. In areas where the environment is beginning to impinge on policy, as in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it remains a tangential concern, and the presumption is often made that economic growth and economic liberalization (including the liberalization of international trade) are, in some sense, good for the environment. This notion has meant that economy-wide policy reforms designed to promote growth and liberalization have been encouraged with little regard to their environmental consequences, presumably on the assumption that these consequences would either take care of themselves or could be dealt with separately. In this article, we discuss the relation between economic growth and environmental quality, and the link between economic activity and the carrying capacity and resilience of the environment."

A simply described but highly chaotic dynamical system called the analog shift map is presented here, which has computational power beyond the Turing limit (super-Turing); it computes exactly like neural networks and analog machines. This dynamical system is conjectured to describe natural physical phenomena."

The discovery of an unmelted chondritic inclusion in the Techado iron meteorite sheds light on the genetic relation between these two groups, providing clues on the origin of chondritic materials as inclusions in iron meteorites. It is proposed that the complex IIE iron meteorite breccias formed by collisions with several different bodies, followed by deep burial of metal and silicate fragments in the asteroidal megaregolith."
https://openalex.org/W2010195518,"At the end of the Cold War, the manufacturing operations involved in making military equipment and commercial goods are commonly believed to intersect hardly at all. Our analyses of 1991 survey data from a large sample of establishments in the machining-intensive durable goods sector show that there are few technical and competitive conditions separating the defense and commercial industrial spheres. Commercial-military integration of production is now the normal practice among the majority of defense contractors in this sector. Moreover, we find little difference between defense and commercial producers in the competitive conditions they face or in the diversity of their customers. However, defense contractors have an advantage over their strictly commercial counterparts because of their greater use of productivity-enhancing technologies."

https://openalex.org/W2033452791,"Nuclear weapons scientists from the United States and the former Soviet Union have been quietly collaborating on a range of research projects. The goal: to keep the lid on the bomb. This article examines the new interactions between the US and the former Soviet Union by discussing the following areas: how the `iron` curtain was bridged; the first interactions between US scientists and individual Russian laboratories in scientific areas; Moving from lab-to-lab collaborations to nuclear related issues, spurred by the interception of smuggled nuclear materials; and the future including the financing."

One piece of unwelcome news was that the ACS governance boards approved hikes in journal subscription prices for 1996. But researchers considered matters more physical than fiscal, listening to presentations on substances that self-construct, molecules that clean up after themselves, and DNA recovered from a stone, among other topics."
