The present communication deals with the application of paper partition chromatography to the identification of natural resins and the separation of the constituents present, with particular reference to dammar and mastic. It has been found that such a separation can be readily achieved in a reversed-phase system using odourless kerosene (boiling range 180°−200–C.) as the stationary phase on the filter paper and aqueous iso-propanol saturated with odourless kerosene as the mobile phase. The filter paper strips (Whatman No. 1) are impregnated by dipping them in a 25 per cent solution of odourless kerosene in ether, excess solution being removed by pressing between sheets of filter paper. About 0.2 mgm. of the resin dissolved in acetone or chloroform is spotted at the origin, and a descending chromatogram is run at 21° C. using the lower phase of the system iso-propanol (7.5 parts), water (2.5 parts) and odourless kerosene (1 part) as solvent. (For the faster-moving spots a better separation is achieved using 6.5 parts of iso-propanol.) The solvent front moves slowly, usually about 25 cm. in twenty-four hours ; but the actual distance may vary With slight changes in the experimental conditions. The strips are dried, and the chromatogram is developed by spraying with a fifty per cent (w/v) solution of phenol in carbon tetrachloride and exposing to bromine vapour for a short period. Those resin components which give a positive Halphen–;Hicks test2 are shown up as coloured zones normally varying in hue from pink to violet, but with certain resins blue or yellow zones appear. These colours fade rapidly if left exposed to the air, but will remain fairly bright for about a week it the strips are kept in a closed box."

https://openalex.org/W2984689039,"IN a communication which has recently appeared under the above title, Johnsson and Högberg1 have claimed that intermedin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are closely related or identical. Moreover, they have suggested that the assay for melanophore-expansion activity in the frog is “a rapid and simple method of testing for adrenocorticotropic hormone”. Similar conclusions have been arrived at independently by Sulman2. Experimental evidence which we have obtained relating to this question does not support these claims."

The distribution of the blood types observed is evident from the following tabulation."

https://openalex.org/W2077430425,"IT has been established by earlier investigators that acetic acid has a destructive effect on the ascorbic acid in raw cabbage. This effect is somewhat surprising, since the lower the pH in the medium, the more stable is the ascorbic acid and, therefore, one would expect the acetic acid to have a preservative effect on the ascorbic acid in cabbage. However, in experiments carried out in the early months of 1951, we found that, in many fruits and vegetables, the ascorbic acid is to a remarkable degree oxidized into dehydroascorbic acid if slices are sprinkled with 5 per cent acetic acid and allowed to stand for two hours. This oxidation does not take place if water is used instead of acetic acid. Other lower fatty acids have a similar effect. The action of lactic acid is very slow and that of citric and tartaric acid practically negligible."
