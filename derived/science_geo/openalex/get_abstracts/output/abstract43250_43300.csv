https://openalex.org/W2065051915,"Affinity chromatography was used to identify a putative cell surface receptor for fibronectin. A large cell-attachment-promoting fibronectin fragment was used as the affinity matrix, and specific elution was effected by using synthetic peptides containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, which is derived from the cell recognition sequence in the fibronectin cell attachment site. A 140 kd protein was bound by the affinity matrix from octylglucoside extracts of MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells and specifically eluted with the synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro. The 140 kd protein was labeled by cell surface specific radioiodination and became incorporated into liposomes at a high efficiency. Liposomes containing this protein showed specific affinity toward fibronectin-coated surfaces, and this binding could be selectively inhibited by the synthetic cell-attachment peptide but not by inactive peptides. Affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose showed that the 140 kd protein is a glycoprotein and, in combination with the fibronectin fragment chromatography, gave highly enriched preparations of the 140 kd protein. These properties suggest that the 140 kd glycoprotein is a membrane-embedded cell surface protein directly involved in the initial step of cell adhesion to fibronectin substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2062102056,"Golgi impregnations of neostriatum from deceased Huntington's disease patients and controls were examined. In all cases of Huntington's disease the morphology of dendrites of medium-sized spiny neurons was markedly altered by the appearance of recurved endings and appendages, a decrease or increase in the density of spines, and abnormalities in the size and shape of spines. Pathological changes were rarely observed in medium-sized and large aspiny neostriatal neurons. The findings provide evidence for simultaneous degeneration and growth of spiny neurons in Huntington's disease and support the view that a specific population of neostriatal neurons is selectively involved in its pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2144148386,"The switch gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl), controls sexual development and dosage compensation. It must be active in females and inactive in males throughout development. Analysis of Sxl cDNAs shows that this on/off regulation may be explained by differential RNA splicing; only female transcripts appear to encode functional products, whereas all male transcripts contain an exon that truncates the open reading frame. The functional female product shows sequence similarities with ribonucleoproteins, suggesting that it is an RNA binding protein. Thus, we propose that Sxl encodes a factor that interacts with both its own pre-mRNA (accounting for positive autoregulation) and that of downstream genes to confer female-specific splicing. In this way, a single, simple mechanism could account for both the maintenance and expression of the sexually determined state."
https://openalex.org/W1971675092,"The molecular size of the plasma LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor synthesized by cultured fibroblasts from a patient with the internalization-defective form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH 274) was smaller by 10,000 daltons than the size of the normal LDL receptor. The segment of the gene encoding the truncated portion of the FH 274 receptor was cloned into bacteriophage lambda. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the normal and FH 274 genes revealed a 5-kilobase deletion, which eliminated the exons encoding the membrane-spanning region and the carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. The deletion appeared to be caused by a novel intrastrand recombination between two repetitive sequences of the Alu family that were oriented in opposite directions. The truncated receptors lack membrane-spanning regions and cytoplasmic domains; they are largely secreted into the culture medium, but a small fraction remains adherent to the cell surface. The surface-adherent receptors bind LDL, but they are unable to cluster in coated pits, thus explaining the internalization-defective phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1970785480,"Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against the period gene product, which influences biological rhythms in D. melanogaster, by using small synthetic peptides from the per sequence as immunogens. The peptide that elicited the best antibody reagent was a small domain near the site of the pers (short period) mutation. Specific immunohistochemical staining was detected in a variety of tissue types: the embryonic CNS; a few cell bodies in the central brain of pupae; these and other cells in the central brain of adults, as well as imaginal cells in the eyes, optic lobes, and the gut. The intensity of per-specific staining in the visual system was found to oscillate, defining a free-running circadian rhythm with a peak in the middle of the night."
https://openalex.org/W2095029406,"Administration of a monoclonal antibody (GK1.5) that recognizes the L3T4 marker present on helper T cells prevented the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Furthermore, treatment with GK1.5 reversed EAE when the antibody was given to paralyzed animals. In vivo injection of GK1.5 selectively reduced the number of L3T4+ cells in the spleen and the lymph nodes. These results suggest that manipulation of the human equivalent of the murine L3T4+ T-cell subset with monoclonal antibodies may provide effective therapy for certain autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2024032585,"The axoplasm at the presynaptic active zone of excitatory synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cell spines contains a meshwork of distinct filaments intermingled with synaptic vesicles, seen most clearly after the rapid freezing, freeze-etch technique of tissue preparation. One set of filaments extends radially from synaptic vesicles and intersects similar filaments associated with vesicles as well as larger filaments arising from the presynaptic membrane. The small, vesicle-associated filaments appear to link synaptic vesicles to one another and to enmesh them in the vicinity of the synaptic junction. The vesicle-associated filaments could be synapsin I because they have the same molecular dimensions and are distributed in the same pattern as synapsin I immunoreactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2012630877,"A sequence of developmental events transforms neurons from their immature state to their mature, terminally differentiated state. The elav locus is one of the first examples of a gene that is expressed in neurons early during this developmental sequence. This gene has been shown to be required for the proper development of young neurons and for the maintenance of mature neurons. DNA sequence data presented in this report suggest that the elav gene product is an RNA binding protein, based on the presence of RNP (ribonucleoprotein) consensus sequences. This leads to the proposal that this protein is involved in the RNA metabolism of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1521493025,"The ability of exogenous sn-1,2-diacylglycerols and analogs to function as bioregulators of protein kinase C in human platelets was investigated. The activation of protein kinase C in platelets is indicated by specific phosphorylation of a 40,000-dalton protein. Dihexanoylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), didecanoylglycerol, and sn-1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol were active in stimulating 40,000-dalton protein phosphorylation. Only a trace of phosphorylation was elicited by dibutyrylglycerol. Phosphorylation was not induced by analogs of diC8 in which an -H, -SH, or -Cl group replaced the free -OH, nor by monoacylglycerols or long chain diacylglycerols. Maximum phosphorylation was induced by dihexanoylglycerol, diC8, and didecanoylglycerol at concentrations from 5 to 20 microM and between 5 and 30 S after exposure of platelets to these diacylglycerols. Under conditions of maximal phosphorylation of the 40,000-dalton protein, these diacylglycerols did not induce phosphatidylinositol turnover, or platelet aggregation, or stimulate release of ATP or serotonin. A small degree of aggregation was evident with platelets isolated in the absence of prostacyclin, and release of serotonin was observed when 1 mM Ca2+ or submaximal concentrations of ionophore A23187 were included. These results are consistent with a model in which platelet activation requires the simultaneous formation of two intracellular signals, diacylglycerols and Ca2+. These diacylglycerols and diacylglycerol analogs provide useful tools to investigate the function of diacylglycerols as bioregulators in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2118690285,"Using monoclonal antibodies and electron microscopy, we have localized N-acetylglucosamine transferase I within the Golgi apparatus. This enzyme initiates the conversion of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type. We have found that the enzyme is concentrated in the central (or medial) cisternae of the Golgi stack. Cisternae at the cis and trans ends of the Golgi complex appear to lack this protein. These experiments establish a function for the medial portion of the Golgi and imply that the Golgi is partitioned into at least three biochemically and morphologically distinct cisternal compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2020046465,"A family of loci homologous to the EGF-like portion of Notch, a gene involved in neurogenesis, have been identified in D. melanogaster. The sequence, spatial, and temporal distribution of both RNA and protein of one of these loci suggest a possible role in the development of the central nervous system (CNS). In situ hybridization and antibody staining of embryos show initial localization in cells along the midline of the neuroepithelium. High level expression is restricted in the developing embryo to a subset of six midline glial cells abutting growing axons. Extracellular localization is suggested by the presence of EGF-like repeats in the deduced protein sequence and antibody staining. Cytological, immunocytochemical, genetic, and molecular data show that this gene corresponds to the slit locus. Mutations in this locus result in the collapse of the regular scaffold of commissural and longitudinal axon tracts in the embryonic central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2013287897,"The gene transformer-2 (tra-2) of Drosophila is necessary not only for female sexual differentiation but also for normal spermatogenesis in males. We have cloned and characterized the tra-2 gene. Its putative protein has a domain that is homologous to RNA binding proteins. This suggests that the tra-2 protein might achieve the female-specific splicing of the transcript of dsx, a sex-determining gene whose mode of expression depends on tra-2. The protein coding region of the tra-2 transcript is identical in males and females. In both sexes, a low level of transcript is present in the soma and a high level in the germ line. This indicates that tra-2 is regulated in a way different from other sex-determining genes."
https://openalex.org/W1557498748,"For mitogenic response of macrophage-depleted human peripheral lymphocytes, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) and Ca2+ ionophore are both needed in addition to a small quantity of plant lectin, phytohemagglutinin (PHA). PHA alone is not sufficient to produce the cellular response. The addition of TPA or OAG to these cells induces the activation of protein kinase C as assayed by the phosphorylation of its endogenous substrates. Apparently, TPA or OAG and A23187 together substitute for macrophages and act synergistically to potentiate the DNA synthesis of this lymphocyte preparation. The results suggest that protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization are essential and that additional receptor occupation by PHA is necessary for producing cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1508856051,"The glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex was isolated from human platelet membranes and examined for glycoprotein stoichiometry and morphology. To determine the ratio of glycoproteins in the complex, the isolated glycoproteins were solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Quantitative amino acid analysis of individual glycoproteins showed that the ratio of GP IIb to GP IIIa in the Ca2+-dependent complex was 0.93:1. Morphology was determined by electron microscopy of rotary-shadowed and negatively stained specimens. Individual complexes consisted of two domains: an oblong head of approximately 8 X 10 nm with two rodlike tails extending approximately 14-17 nm from one side of the head. Treatment of the isolated complex with EDTA resulted in the appearance of a mixture of oblong and filamentous structures, which could be separated by a sucrose gradient sedimentation in Triton X-100. As seen by rotary and unidirectional shadowing, GP IIb was a compact structure, approximately 8 X 10 nm in size. Isolated GP IIIa was more heterogeneous but was most often observed in an elongated form, varying in length from 20 to 30 nm and in width from 2 to 3 nm. By comparing these structures to that of the heterodimer complex, it was determined that the oblong domain was GP IIb and the rodlike tails were GP IIIa. Each milligram of isolated GP IIb-IIIa complex bound 0.30 mg of [3H]Triton X-100, indicating that the glycoprotein complex contained limited hydrophobic domains. Upon removal of detergent, GP IIb-IIIa complexes formed aggregates that sedimented in sucrose gradients as a diffuse peak ranging from 14 to 32 s. Examination of these aggregates by electron microscopy showed that they were composed of clusters or of 2 to 20 or more of the GP IIb-IIIa complexes. The orientation of these rosettes was such that the tails were joined in the center, with the head portions directed away from the interacting tails. It thus appears that the primary hydrophobic domains of the GP IIb-IIIa complex exist at the tips of the GP IIIa tails. Because the GP IIb-IIIa complex is an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein, these findings indicate a potential membrane attachment site for the GP IIb-IIIa complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1966427800,"We describe novel products of V(D)J recombination in which signal sequences become joined to coding elements, in contrast to the standard reaction whose products are junctions of two signal sequences or two coding elements. In this variant reaction, the recombination machinery evidently recognizes signal sequences and introduces strand breaks at the normal positions, but then connects the elements in unusual combinations. The lack of fixed directionality indicates that recombination sites are not uniquely aligned when strand exchange occurs. The discovery of these variant junctions suggests a model for the evolution of the antigen receptor loci."
https://openalex.org/W1522180040,"The content of Ca2+-, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activity (protein kinase C) in murine peritoneal macrophages treated with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been investigated. Protein kinase C activity was solubilized by nonionic detergent extraction of sonicated cells and separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a TSK 4000 SW gel filtration column. The enzyme eluted from the column in a molecular weight range of 60-80 X 10(3) and was identified by virtue of Ca2+ and phospholipid requirements. Macrophages treated with recombinant IFN-gamma exhibited a substantial increase in total protein kinase activity which could be accounted for entirely by increased protein kinase C activity. This activity was enhanced as much as 5-fold over that seen in untreated macrophages and was specific for IFN-gamma in that other agents known to signal changes in macrophage function had no effect. The time required for the elevation of kinase activity was identical to that required for induction of other functions by IFN-gamma in macrophages. These observations suggest that protein kinase C may be a focus of regulatory action in IFN-gamma-mediated macrophage activation."

https://openalex.org/W2112890409,"Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against different portions of the amyloid precursor protein were used to localize this protein in normal rat brain. Light and electron microscopic immunohistochemical localizations demonstrate that the protein is widely distributed throughout the neuraxis, with the highest concentrations of immunoreactive neurons occurring in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, septum-diagonal band, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and hippocampus. Immunoreactive astrocytes are also present in the cerebral cortex in relation to both neurons and capillaries. However, immunoreactivity was not observed within the endothelium of the cerebral vasculature. These data demonstrate that the beta-amyloid precursor is widely distributed in the CNS and provide further insight into the cellular elements that may be involved in the neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054533778,"Dopamine induces a decrease in voltage-dependent Ca2+ current in identified neurons of the snail H. aspersa. This effect is blocked by intracellular injection of activated B. pertussis toxin and of an affinity-purified antibody against the alpha subunit of bovine Go protein. The dopamine effect is mimicked by intracellular injection of mammalian alpha o. In snail nervous tissue, pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates a single protein band on SDS gels, and this band is recognized in immunoblots by the anti-alpha o antibody. We propose that this is a 40 kd alpha subunit of a molluscan G protein immunologically related to alpha o and that it mediates the effect of dopamine on Ca2+ currents in identified snail neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2090112051,"Binary developmental decisions and homeostatic regulation by steroids require negative transcriptional regulation to balance steroid-mediated stimulatory effects. Human glucocorticoid receptor mutants were used to identify regions important for trans-repression of the gene encoding the alpha subunit of chorionic gonadotropin. While the amino terminus is not critical, the DNA binding and ligand binding domains are required for efficient repression. However, the function of the carboxyl terminus can be substituted by a polypeptide from the human mineralocorticoid receptor or beta-galactosidase gene. The function of these fusion repressors supports the model that the human glucocorticoid receptor negatively regulates transcription via a steric hindrance mechanism. These results suggest a potentially general strategy for creation of sequence-specific transcriptional repressors."
https://openalex.org/W2017190337,β-Endorphin in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland is posttranslationally modified to produce opioid inactive peptides. Whether these are metabolites or biologically relevant products has not been known. It was found that repeated stress induces increased biosynthesis and release of β-endorphin-like substances from the intermediate lobe of rats and that opioid-inactive N-acetylated β-endorphin-(1-31) is selectively made and liberated. The possible role of this nonopioid product and the selective release of peptide forms are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1515461142,"Changes in Ca2+ binding after phosphorylation of membranous or detergent-solubilized preparations of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase with ATP were followed spectrophotometrically by the use of murexide. Distinct Ca2+ release from the two high-affinity translocation sites was observed, particularly at alkaline pH and at low Ca2+/Mg2+ concentration ratios. Phosphorylation also induced additional binding of Ca2+ at a third site in competition with Mg2+. Ca2+ release was increased after solubilization of Ca2+-ATPase in predominantly monomeric form with the nonionic detergent octaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether. At 0 degree C, chemical-quench studies with [32P]ATP indicated that release of Ca2+ is correlated with the level of ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (2 mol of Ca2+ released per mol of E2P formed), both for membranous and detergent solubilized Ca2+-ATPase. Ca2+ release was also found to be accompanied by changes in intrinsic fluorescence. Analysis of the data at 20 degrees C, pH 8.0, showed that binding of Ca2+ to transport sites on E2P occurs with a half-saturation constant of 0.7 mM and a Hill coefficient of 1.8. This is consistent with a drastic decrease in Ca2+ affinity following conversion of ADP-sensitive E1P to ADP-insensitive E2P. The similarity between membranous and detergent-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase supports the view that not more than a single Ca2+-ATPase polypeptide chain is required to complete the conformational transitions which are the basis for active transport of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1482058108,"Gel-filtered platelets accelerate activated protein C inactivation of factor Va in a reaction that requires the presence of protein S. With protein S present, specific activated protein C binding to the platelet surface is observed (Kd = 11 +/- 3 nM, 203 +/- 20 sites/platelet). The concentration dependence of the activated protein C-mediated factor Va inactivation is in close agreement with the binding. The observed binding is specific since protein C does not compete with activated protein C. Platelet-bound activated protein C is approximately 8000 times more active than the solution-phase enzyme. Platelet activation with thrombin results in formation of a site capable of accelerating factor Va inactivation by activated protein C in the absence of added protein S. This cell surface site is blocked by the addition of affinity purified antibodies to protein S. We conclude that protein S is required for activated protein C binding to the platelet surface and subsequent rapid factor Va inactivation. Platelet activation leads to the expression of either protein S or an antigenically related protein which can substitute for exogenously added protein S."
https://openalex.org/W1542531015,"Recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) produced in Escherichia coli was labeled with 125I to study its binding to receptors of HeLa and lymphoblastoid cells. All the cell lines examined had receptors for rIFN-gamma, although the binding varied considerably among different cell lines. The binding of 125I-rIFN-gamma was competed up to 90% by the addition of unlabeled rIFN-gamma, although not by the addition of IFN-alpha or -beta. By adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled rIFN-gamma to binding assays containing a constant amount of 125I-rIFN-gamma, we determined a KD of 3.7 and 6.3 X 10(-10) M for its binding to Daudi and HeLa cells, respectively. About 13,000 receptors per cell were present in Daudi and 5,000 in HeLa cells. The Mr of the IFN-gamma/receptor complex was determined by cross-linking experiments to be about 125,000. This complex is smaller than the IFN-alpha/receptor complex that has a Mr of about 140,000. The rIFN-gamma receptor was down-regulated when HeLa cells were treated with this interferon, but not when these cells were treated with IFN-beta. These findings suggest that the receptors for IFN-alpha and -gamma differ in several characteristics. The turnover of the rIFN-gamma receptor was measured by inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide and the half-life of this receptor was found to be 2 h. The unglycosylated rIFN-gamma was bound to cellular receptors with an affinity similar to that previously reported for natural IFN-gamma. The lymphoblastoid cell lines examined had high affinity receptors for rIFN-gamma, but did not respond to treatment with this IFN with an induction of the synthesis of the enzyme (2'-5')oligo(A) synthetase, whereas HeLa cells responded to rIFN-gamma. The reason for the lack of response of lymphoblastoid cells is presently unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2002279787,"To examine the distribution of synaptic vesicle antigens during development of the cerebral cortex, antibodies against synapsin I and p65 were used on sections of cat cerebral cortex between E40 and adulthood. In the adult, the layers of the cerebral cortex are immunoreactive for each of these antigens, while the white matter is free of staining. In contrast, the fetal and neonatal pattern of immunostaining is reversed: the cortical plate (future cortical layers) is devoid of immunoreactivity, while the marginal (future layer 1) and the intermediate zones (future white matter) are stained. Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry shows that immunolabeling is associated with presynaptic nerve terminals in the adult and during development. These observations suggest that during development the white matter is a transient synaptic neuropil and that a global redistribution of synapses takes place as the mature pattern of connections within the cerebral cortex emerges."
https://openalex.org/W1492465703,"The relative abilities of insulin and the phorbol ester tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to lead to the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in vivo were compared in a Reuber H35 hepatoma cell line shown previously to be highly responsive to these agents. In quiescent (serum-starved) cultures of H35 cells incubated with 32Pi, both insulin (10(-7) M) and TPA (1.6 X 10(-6) M) resulted in the marked phosphorylation of S6 compared to the unstimulated cultures as evidenced by an increase in radioactivity associated with S6 and by a corresponding shift in the mobility of phosphorylated S6 during two-dimensional electrophoresis. Following incubation with insulin or TPA, greater than 95% of the phosphate was in derivatives containing four to five phosphate groups. The site-specific phosphorylation of S6 in response to both optimal and suboptimal concentrations of insulin and/or TPA was examined by two-dimensional peptide mapping of the trypsin-digested ribosomal protein S6. The tryptic phosphopeptides of S6 obtained following treatment of the H35 cells with insulin and/or TPA were identical and were the same phosphopeptides as those observed previously following the phosphorylation in vitro of 40 S ribosomal subunits from reticulocytes with purified protease-activated kinase II (Perisic, O., and Traugh, J. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13998-14002)."
https://openalex.org/W1528601280,"Membrane assembly of complement proteins C5b-9 on human platelets results in a dose-dependent increase in the binding of coagulation factors Va and Xa to the plasma membrane, concomitant with a marked increase in platelet prothrombinase activity. Factor Va binding increased by 6-15-fold in platelets treated with the C5b-9 proteins as compared to controls. In the presence of near-saturating concentrations of factor Xa, factor Va binding to C5b-9-treated platelets approximately doubled. In the absence of added factor Va, C5b-9-treated platelets bound 1700 molecules of factor Xa versus 50 molecules/cell bound to controls, suggesting that C5b-9 assembly on the platelet surface initiates the release of platelet factor V from the alpha-granules. The capacity of the C5b-9 proteins to initiate the nonlytic release of the platelet alpha-granule storage pool was confirmed by assay for platelet factor 4. When measured in the presence of exogenous factor Va (2 micrograms/ml), factor Xa uptake by C5b-9 platelets increased to approximately 5500 molecules/cell (versus 330 molecules/cell for controls). Removal of external Ca2+ inhibited the C5b-9-initiated release of the alpha-granule storage pool and reduced by approximately 50% the expression of new factor Va binding sites, suggesting that these two events contributing to increased platelet prothrombinase activity are mediated in part by the influx of Ca2+ across the C5b-9 pore."
https://openalex.org/W1507674329,"A calcium-activated and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) catalyzes the phosphorylation of both insoluble microsomal (Mr approximately 100,000) and purified soluble (Mr = 53,000) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of enzymic activity of HMG-CoA reductase was absolutely dependent on Ca2+, phosphatidylserine, and diolein. Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated HMG-CoA reductase was associated with the loss of protein bound radioactivity and reactivation of enzymic activity. Maximal phosphorylation of purified HMG-CoA reductase was associated with the incorporation of 1.05 +/- 0.016 mol of phosphate/mol of native form of HMG-CoA reductase (Mr approximately 100,000). The apparent Km for purified HMG-CoA reductase and histone H1 was 0.08 mg/ml, and 0.12 mg/ml, respectively. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated the protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase. Increased phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate suggests a possible in vivo protein kinase C-mediated mechanism for the short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The identification of the protein kinase C system in addition to the reductase kinase-reductase kinase kinase bicyclic cascade systems for the modulation of the enzymic activity of HMG-CoA reductase may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1597377374,"A highly purified plasma membrane fraction isolated from rat hepatocytes was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP in response to micromolar concentrations of glutathione disulfide (GSSG). This process exhibited distinct kinetic parameters suggesting the existence of both a high and low affinity component. The apparent Km values (GSSG) for ATP hydrolysis were 140 microM and 1 mM for the high affinity and low affinity components, respectively. Disulfides other than GSSG were also found to stimulate ATP hydrolysis. The similarity between the kinetic properties of the GSSG-stimulated ATPase and those reported for GSSG transport in erythrocytes (Kondo, T., Dale, G. L., and Beutler, E. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 6359-6362) suggests that the ATPase may function in the active extrusion of intracellular GSSG."
https://openalex.org/W1632662791,"Human platelets maintain a low cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in part by controlling plasma membrane Ca2+ transport. The present studies examine the role in this process of two well-characterized membrane proteins: glycoproteins IIb and IIIa. These glycoproteins form a Ca2+-dependent complex which serves as both the platelet fibrinogen receptor and the principle site for high affinity Ca2+ binding on the platelet surface. The kinetics of plasma membrane Ca2+ exchange were compared in normal platelets and in thrombasthenic platelets, which lack the IIb X IIIa complex. Under steady-state conditions, the maximum rate of plasma membrane Ca2+ exchange in the thrombasthenic platelets was half the rate observed in normal platelets. The size of the cytosolic exchangeable Ca2+ pool and the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, however, were normal. A quantitatively similar decrease in plasma membrane Ca2+ exchange was seen in normal platelets after incubation with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) at 37 degrees C, conditions that dissociate the IIb X IIIa complex. This decrease in the Ca2+ exchange rate in normal platelets could be prevented by preincubating platelets with a complex-specific anti-IIb X IIIa monoclonal antibody, but not by preincubating platelets with an anti-IIIa monoclonal antibody. In order to determine whether loss of the IIb X IIIa complex primarily affects Ca2+ influx or Ca2+ efflux, both processes were also examined under nonsteady-state conditions. An immediate decrease in the 45Ca2+ influx rate was seen when Ca2+ was added back to platelets preincubated with EGTA at 37 degrees C. The 45Ca2+ efflux rate, on the other hand, was not immediately affected. These data suggest, therefore, that an intact IIb X IIIa complex is necessary for normal Ca2+ homeostasis in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1489442306,"Protein kinase C was detected in a group of Ca2+-dependent chromaffin granule membrane-binding proteins (chromobindins) on the basis of Ca2+-, phosphatidylserine-, 1,2-diolein-, and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated histone kinase activity. When the chromobindins were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, Ca2+, and phosphatidylserine, 32P was incorporated predominantly into a protein of mass 37 +/- 1 kilodaltons (chromobindin 9, or CB9). Phosphorylation of this protein was also stimulated by diolein and phorbol myristate acetate, indicating that it is a substrate for the protein kinase C activity present in the chromobindins. Maximum phosphate incorporation into CB9 in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+, 75 micrograms/ml of phosphatidylserine, 2.5 micrograms/ml of diolein, and 12.5 micrograms/ml of dithiothreitol was 0.53 mol/mol of CB9 in 5 min. Eight 32P-labeled phosphopeptides were resolved in two-dimensional electrophoretic maps of trypsin digests of CB9. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation was exclusively on serine (94%) and threonine (6%) residues. Incubation of the chromobindins with chromaffin granule membranes in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the incorporation of 32P into eight additional proteins besides CB9 that could be separated from the membranes by centrifugation in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. We suggest that phosphorylation of CB9 or these additional eight proteins may regulate events underlying exocytosis in the chromaffin cell."
https://openalex.org/W1516601134,"Platelet membrane glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa have been identified as platelet aggregation sites. These glycoproteins form a heterodimer complex (GP IIb-IIIa) in the presence of Ca2+. To study the morphology of this glycoprotein complex in membranes, we incorporated GP IIb-IIIa into artificial phospholipid vesicles using a detergent (octyl glucoside) dialysis procedure. Phosphatidylserine-enriched vesicles (70% phosphatidylserine, 30% phosphatidylcholine) incorporated approximately 90% of the GP IIb-IIIa as determined by sucrose flotation. Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa incorporation into the vesicles was unaffected by ionic strength, suggesting a hydrophobic interaction between the glycoprotein and the phospholipid. In both intact platelets or phospholipid vesicles, GP IIb was susceptible to neuraminidase hydrolysis, indicating that most of the glycoprotein complexes were oriented toward the outside of the platelets or vesicles. The morphology of GP IIb-IIIa in the phospholipid vesicles was observed by negative staining electron microscopy. Individual GP IIb-IIIa complexes appeared as spikes protruding as much as 20 nm from the vesicle surface. Each spike consisted of a GP IIb head, which was distal to the vesicle and was supported by the GP IIIa The GP IIb-IIIa complex appeared to be attached to the vesicle membrane by the tips of the GP IIIa tails. Treatment of vesicles with EGTA dissociated the GP IIb-IIIa complex. The dissociated glycoproteins remained attached to the phospholipid vesicles, indicating that both GP IIb and GP IIIa contain membrane-attachment sites. These data suggest a possible structural arrangement of the GP IIb-IIIa complex in whole platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2109334967,"A cell-binding peptide (Mr = 85,000) which lacks the gelatin- and heparin-binding domains, was purified from trypsin-digested fibronectin. Preincubation of rat hepatocytes in suspension with the peptide, inhibited initial attachment of the cells to immobilized fibronectin while attachment to immobilized laminin and collagen was unaffected. 125I-labeled 85-kDa peptide bound to the cells in suspension at 4 degrees C in a time-dependent, saturable, and partially reversible reaction. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated a single class of receptors with a Kd of 1.7 X 10(-8) M. The number of binding-sites was approximately 2.8 X 10(5)/cell. Unlabeled 85-kDa peptide inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled 85-kDa peptide 30-fold more effectively than intact fibronectin. These results provide direct evidence for the presence of a domain in the fibronectin molecule which has or may acquire a high affinity for receptors involved in adhesion of hepatocytes to immobilized fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1583414424,"A human DNA library, cloned in bacteriophage lambda, was screened with an opal suppressor tRNA probe. Two genes were isolated, subcloned into pBR322, and sequenced. One is a normal opal suppressor tRNA gene 87 nucleotides in length without intervening sequences. It has a TCA anticodon demonstrating that the mature tRNA reads the termination codon UGA. The 5' internal control region for transcription has two extra nucleotides compared to the consensus sequence for eucaryotic tRNA genes, while the 3' internal control region is normal. This gene differs from a previously sequenced chicken opal suppressor serine tRNA gene (Hatfield, D., Dudock, B., and Eden, F. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 4940-4944) only at position 11. The second human gene appears to be a pseudogene truncated near the 3' end, since in the cloverleaf form of the mature tRNA there are three noncomplementary bases in the acceptor stem. The two human genes have a high degree of homology and, excluding the truncated 3' terminus of the pseudogene, differ in only two positions. The flanking sequences of the pseudogene are about 90% homologous to the consensus sequence of the human Alu family of repeated sequences. This gene appears to have been inserted between two adjacent Alu family members."
https://openalex.org/W1581811940,"Phosphofructokinase from rabbit brain consists of hybrids of the A, B, and C isozymes. Phosphofructokinase C was isolated from a purified mixture of such hybrids in a 2-step procedure. In the first step, phosphofructokinase B was removed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. In the second step, subunits of phosphofructokinases A and C were separated by dissociation at pH 5.0 followed by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. The separated isozymes were then reassociated by neutralization. Phosphofructokinase C was structurally distinct from phosphofructokinases A (obtained from muscle or brain) and B (obtained from liver) as shown by one-dimensional chymotryptic and staphylococcal V8 protease fingerprints of all three isozymes. In addition, phosphofructokinase C cross-reacted weakly or not at all with antisera raised against phosphofructokinase B or phosphofructokinase A. Phosphofructokinase C was also kinetically distinct from the A and B isozymes. The C isozyme was more sensitive than the A isozyme but less sensitive than the B isozyme to inhibition by ATP, was less sensitive than the A isozyme but more sensitive than the B isozyme to inhibition by citrate, and was less sensitive than either of the other two isozymes to activation by inorganic phosphate, AMP, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The self-association properties of phosphofructokinase C differed from those of the A and B isozymes in that at pH 8.0, the C isozyme did not form oligomers larger than a tetramer under conditions where the other two isozymes did. Thus the properties of phosphofructokinase C are in general quite distinct from those of the other two phosphofructokinase isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1529006742,"Abstract Actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin II from Acanthamoeba castellanii is regulated by phosphorylation of three serine residues located at the carboxyl-terminal end of each of the two 185,000-Da heavy chains; the phosphorylated molecule has full Ca2+-ATPase activity but no actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. Under controlled conditions, chymotrypsin removes a small peptide containing all three phosphorylation sites from the ends of the myosin II heavy chains producing a molecule with heavy chains of 175,000 Da and undigested light chains. The length of the myosin II tail decreased from 89 to 76 nm. Chymotrypsin-cleaved myosin II has complete Ca2+-ATPase activity but no actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity under standard assay conditions and binds to F-actin as well as undigested myosin II in the absence, but not in the presence, of MgATP. In the presence of MgCl2, undigested myosin II forms biopolar filaments but chymotrypsin-cleaved myosin II forms only parallel (monopolar) dimers, as assessed by analytical ultra-centrifugation and rotary shadow electron microscopy. We conclude that the short segment very near the end of the myosin II tail that contains the three phosphorylatable serines is necessary for the formation of biopolar filaments and, probably as a consequence of filament formation, for the high-affinity binding of myosin II to F-actin in the presence of ATP and the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of native myosin II. This supports our previous conclusion that actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase of native myosin II is expressed only when the enzyme is in bipolar filaments with the proper conformation as determined by the state of phosphorylation of the heavy chains."
https://openalex.org/W1533375024,"We have purified myosin from human erythrocytes using methods similar to that for other cytoplasmic myosins with a yield of about 500 micrograms/100 ml of packed cells. It consists of a 200-kDa heavy chain and light chains of 26- and 19.5 kDa and therefore differs from the isozyme in platelets which has light chains of 20- and 15 kDa. At low ionic strength, the myosin forms short bipolar filaments like those of platelet myosin. Eight of eight monoclonal antibodies to platelet myosin also bind to erythrocyte myosin. Like most myosins, it has a high ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+ or EDTA, but is inhibited by Mg2+. Myosin light-chain kinase transfers 1 phosphate from ATP to the 20-kDa light chain, and this stimulates the actin-activated ATPase. Thus, myosin may play a role in shape changes in the erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1544663300,"The Escherichia coli RecB protein, normally synthesized in low amounts, has been amplified by linkage of the recB gene to the phage lambda leftward promoter in an expression plasmid. From strains harboring this plasmid, RecB protein has been purified to homogeneity by a simple procedure which includes affinity chromatography on a column of RecC protein bound to agarose. The purified RecB protein has DNA-dependent ATPase activity but no exonuclease activity. RecC protein alone has neither ATPase nor exonuclease activity. However, when combined together, the RecB and RecC proteins show the ATP-dependent double-stranded exonuclease properties characteristic of the RecBC DNase."
https://openalex.org/W1604973744,"A MgATPase has been isolated and characterized from unfertilized sea urchin eggs which is very similar, but not identical, to latent activity axonemal dynein. The cytoplasmic MgATPase activity sediments at 20 S, slightly slower than 21 S latent activity flagellar dynein. Activity is stimulated by nonionic detergent and is inhibited by sodium orthovanadate but is not as sensitive to vanadate as is 21 S flagellar dynein. The egg 20 S MgATPase is composed, at least in part, of three high molecular weight polypeptides. In addition, two intermediate-sized polypeptides appear to co-sediment with the 20 S MgATPase activity. A novel microtubule-affinity assay reveals that high molecular weight polypeptides 1 and 2 of the egg 20 S MgATPase can bind to reassembled microtubules and can be released from the microtubules with MgATP2-. Further, the apparent specific activity of the egg MgATPase is enriched 15-fold by a single microtubule binding step. The results suggest that the cytoplasmic 20 S MgATPase is a dynein-like microtubule translocator which resides in the unfertilized egg awaiting future incorporation onto microtubules in order to perform work. The egg 20 S enzyme might function in cytoplasmic microtubule-mediated movement or it might be a precursor of embryonic ciliary dynein."
https://openalex.org/W1525124343,"A calcium-transport ATPase is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum of rat liver. Catalysis of calcium translocation involves transient covalent binding of the terminal phosphate residue of ATP by the enzyme, resulting in the formation of an alkali- and hydroxylamine-labile phosphorylprotein intermediate. Both MgATP as well as CaATP can be utilized in the phosphorylation reaction which requires calcium as a cofactor. Magnesium accelerates the turnover of the phosphorylprotein intermediate. An ADP-reactive and ADP-unreactive state of the phosphoenzyme could be distinguished. In the ADP-reactive state with tightly bound calcium, the phosphoenzyme can transphosphorylate its phosphate residue to ADP, giving rise to synthesis of ATP. The ADP-reactive phosphoenzyme can be converted into an ADP-unreactive state by prolonged incubation with excess EGTA (ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid). It is suggested that this conversion is brought about by the removal of tightly bound calcium from the phosphoenzyme. A strong homology of the sequential reaction steps during calcium translocation by the calcium-transport ATPases in endoplasmic reticulum from rat liver and sarcoplasmic reticulum from skeletal muscle is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1594437264,"Precursor RNA substrates for splicing reaction were synthesized in vitro from a plasmid DNA in which the early region 2 gene of adenovirus 2 was fused to an efficient bacteriophage promoter (Salmonella phage 6). Pre-mRNA splicing activity from nuclear extracts of MOPC-315 mouse myeloma cells was partially purified 108-fold by three chromatographic steps. The in vitro splicing reaction catalyzed by the partially purified fractions was efficient (60-80% substrate conversion) and accurate at the nucleotide level. The reaction occurred with crude or purified fractions without any detectable lag and nucleotides (ATP or GTP) were absolutely required. Monoclonal anti-Sm antibodies that quantitatively immunoprecipitate U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles totally inhibited the splicing activity of the purified fractions, indicating that U1 small nuclear RNPs had co-purified with the activity and were absolutely required for the splicing reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1484354814,"The vanadate-sensitive membrane ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis forms, as part of the reaction cycle, an acylphosphate intermediate. The phosphorylated amino acid residue was identified by reducing the purified reconstituted phosphoenzyme with [3H]borohydride, followed by acid hydrolysis of the protein and quantitative amino acid analysis. Tritiated homoserine was found to be the resulting reaction product, generated through the reduction of a beta-aspartyl phosphate residue. The S. faecalis ATPase thus forms the same phosphorylated intermediate as a number of eukaryotic transport ATPases and appears to be related to these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1551049760,"The pattern of incorporation of [14C]N-ethylmaleimide (MalNEt) into gizzard myosin indicates the presence of two classes of thiols: rapidly and slowly modified. The first class contains two thiol residues, SH-A and SH-B, located in the myosin rod and the 17-kDa light chain, respectively, while the second contains at least two thiols located in the myosin heavy chain. Changes in ATPase activities upon modification occur rapidly or slowly, paralleling reaction of either the first or second class of thiols. Rapid changes include increases in the Ca2+- and Mg2+-activated activities of myosin alone, measured at ionic strengths below 0.3 M, and an increase and a decrease in the actin-activated activity of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin, respectively. Modification of SH-A and SH-B with MalNEt is accompanied by stabilization of myosin filaments, seen as an increase in light-scattering intensity, and by destabilization of the folded, 10 S conformation of the myosin monomer. In the presence of 0.175 M NaCl and 1 mM MgATP, unmodified and MalNEt-modified myosin sediment in the ultracentrifuge as single components at 10.0 S and 6.0 S, respectively. The MalNEt-induced increase in the Ca2+- or Mg2+-activated ATPase activity, measured in the absence of actin, can be attributed either to stabilization of filaments or to destabilization of the 10 S conformation, depending on the ionic strength of the assay. Modification of the second class of thiols is accompanied by a decrease in K+-EDTA-activated activity and an increase in Ca2+-activated activity measured above 0.3 M NaCl, where myosin neither forms filaments nor assumes the 10 S conformation. These slow changes are characteristic of blocking the SH-1 thiols of skeletal-muscle myosin, but in gizzard myosin are attributable to modification of a less reactive thiol, SH-C."
https://openalex.org/W1987981022,"We find rapid changes in the specificity of the cytolytic effector cells in a mixed lymphocyte culture. The lysis patterns produced by cytolytic effector cells generated near limiting dilution in murine mixed lymphocyte reactions of three types, F1 anti-parent (F1(A X B) anti-A), allogeneic (C anti-F1(A X B)), and F1 antimodified parent (F1(A X B) anti-A-TNP), were investigated. Cultures were characterized by their ability or inability to lyse a panel of target cells (e.g., A, B, F1). When individual cultures were tested at two different times, changes in lytic pattern were routinely seen, with some patterns reproducibly increasing in frequency and others reproducibly decreasing (e.g., patterns involving lysis of F1 decreased in an F1 anti-A response but increased in a C anti-F1 response). X-linked isoenzyme analysis showed that changes can occur within a single clone of effector cells. These results imply that the T cell specificity repertoire continues to evolve during an ongoing immune response, a conclusion incompatible with clonal selection theory."
https://openalex.org/W1606926572,"Rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase was irreversibly inactivated upon preincubation with vitamin C (Vit C). Fe(III), NADH.NADH oxidase.Fe(III), or ferritin.Vit C. Substrate, glucose 1-phosphate and Mg2+ afforded partial protection. No altered amino acid could be detected in the inactive enzyme. Enzyme so inactivated was more susceptible to trypsin. More importantly, during inactivation, the enzyme lost up to 70% of its enzyme-bound phosphate; the completely inactivated enzyme retained the remainder of the bound phosphate which was isolatable as phosphoserine residing in the 22-amino acid long tryptic peptide. Free phosphoserine as well as those in phosphorylase alpha and phosphocasein were resistant to the oxidizing system, suggesting that the phosphoserine of phosphoglucomutase is uniquely vulnerable to these treatments. Alternatively, a fraction of the total 1 mol of phosphate in the phosphoform of phosphoglucomutase may not be associated with phosphoserine. Phosphoglyceromutase, which has phosphohistidine at its active site, was also inactivated by the oxidizing system. However, it did not release any of the bound phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1553017104,"The addition of nanomolar concentrations of free Fe2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ to rat liver plasma membranes resulted in an activation of ATP hydrolysis by these membranes which was not additive with the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity coupled to the Ca2+ pump. Detailed analysis showed that, if fact, (i) as for the stimulation of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase by Ca2+, activation of ATP hydrolysis by Fe2+, Mn3+, or Co2+ followed a cooperative mechanism involving two ions; (ii) two interacting sites for ATP were involved in the activation of both Fe2+- and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities; (iii) micromolar concentrations of magnesium caused the same dramatic inhibition of both activities; and (iv) the subcellular distribution of Fe2+-activated ATP hydrolysis activity corresponded to that of plasma membrane markers. This suggests that the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase might be stimulated not only by Ca2+, but also by Fe2+, Mn2+, or Co2+. However, interaction of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase with Fe2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ inhibited the Ca2+ pump activity. Furthermore, neither the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase, nor ATP-dependent (59Fe) uptake could be detected in the presence of Fe2+ concentrations which stimulated ATP hydrolysis. We conclude that: (i) under the influence of certain metal ions, the Ca2+ pump in the liver plasma membrane may be switched to an uncoupled state which displays ATP hydrolysis activity, but does not insure ion transport; (ii) therefore the Ca2+ pump in liver plasma membranes specifically insures Ca2+ transport."

https://openalex.org/W1543707444,"The relationship between the synthesis of phospholipids and the intrinsic proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum was investigated in differentiating L6 cells in culture. The rates of lipid synthesis and turnover in L6 showed no large variations over the course of differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes while the rate of synthesis of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase steadily increased. Removal of choline from the culture medium after the onset of fusion resulted in a 2-fold inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis and a 40-50% reduction in total cellular PC content within 36 h. The synthesis and content of phosphatidylethanolamine also declined subsequent to the effect on PC. The amount of newly synthesized phospholipid in the microsomal fraction also decreased 50% in choline-deprived cells. Choline deprivation of myotubes for up to 4 days had no effect on the rates of synthesis of the Ca2+-ATPase or two intrinsic glycoproteins of 53,000 and 160,000 daltons. The newly synthesized proteins were incorporated into PC-deficient microsomal membranes. The synthesis of total cellular protein and total membrane protein was not altered, thus phospholipid:protein ratios declined 2-fold. These observations suggest that the assembly of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is not tightly coordinated with the rate of phospholipid synthesis."
