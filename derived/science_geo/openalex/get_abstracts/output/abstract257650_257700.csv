https://openalex.org/W2017081079,"Certain tyrosine kinases are overactive in many cancers, and drugs that inhibit them, such as the leukaemia treatment imatinib, can be successful. But they don't work for all tyrosine kinase-driven cancers, and new work points to a possible reason why. The kinase HER2 is frequently overactive in breast cancers and signals through another family member, HER3. Sergina et al. find that when HER2 is partially blocked by kinase inhibitors, a feedback mechanism causes an increase of active HER3 at the plasma membrane where it continues to signal cancer cell proliferation. So more effective inhibitors that block HER2 completely, and reduce HER3 activity too, may be more effective cancer therapies. Oncogenic tyrosine kinases have proved to be promising targets for the development of highly effective anticancer drugs. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family show only limited activity against HER2-driven breast cancers, despite effective inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 in vivo1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The reasons for this are unclear. Signalling in trans is a key feature of this multimember family and the critically important phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)/Akt pathway is driven predominantly through transphosphorylation of the kinase-inactive HER3 (refs 9, 10). Here we show that HER3 and consequently PI(3)K/Akt signalling evade inhibition by current HER-family TKIs in vitro and in tumours in vivo. This is due to a compensatory shift in the HER3 phosphorylation–dephosphorylation equilibrium, driven by increased membrane HER3 expression driving the phosphorylation reaction and by reduced HER3 phosphatase activity impeding the dephosphorylation reaction. These compensatory changes are driven by Akt-mediated negative-feedback signalling. Although HER3 is not a direct target of TKIs, HER3 substrate resistance undermines their efficacy and has thus far gone undetected. The experimental abrogation of HER3 resistance by small interfering RNA knockdown restores potent pro-apoptotic activity to otherwise cytostatic HER TKIs, re-affirming the oncogene-addicted nature of HER2-driven tumours and the therapeutic promise of this oncoprotein target. However, because HER3 signalling is buffered against an incomplete inhibition of HER2 kinase, much more potent TKIs or combination strategies are required to silence oncogenic HER2 signalling effectively. The biologic marker with which to assess the efficacy of HER TKIs should be the transphosphorylation of HER3 rather than autophosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2156925439,"Variation in DNA sequence contributes to individual differences in quantitative traits, but in humans the specific sequence variants are known for very few traits. We characterized variation in gene expression in cells from individuals belonging to three major population groups. This quantitative phenotype differs significantly between European-derived and Asian-derived populations for 1,097 of 4,197 genes tested. For the phenotypes with the strongest evidence of cis determinants, most of the variation is due to allele frequency differences at cis-linked regulators. The results show that specific genetic variation among populations contributes appreciably to differences in gene expression phenotypes. Populations differ in prevalence of many complex genetic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. As some of these are probably influenced by the level of gene expression, our results suggest that allele frequency differences at regulatory polymorphisms also account for some population differences in prevalence of complex diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2048502125,"The cover shows part of the first map of the large-scale distribution of 'dark matter' in the Universe, constructed using images obtained in the largest ever survey with the Hubble Space Telescope. Dark matter is a mysterious substance that dominates the mass of the Universe, but neither emits nor reflects light, so is consequently invisible. It can be detected indirectly via gravitational lensing, the deflection of light from distant galaxies by any foreground concentrations of mass. The new map depicts a network of dark matter filaments that have grown over time and are separated by huge voids. Ordinary 'baryonic' particles (which account for only a sixth of the total mass in the Universe) subsequently build all stars, galaxies and planets inside this underlying scaffold of dark matter, during a process of gravitationally induced structure formation. (Cover image: NASA/ESA/R. Massey.) Ordinary baryonic particles account for only one-sixth of the total matter in the Universe, the rest being the mysterious 'dark matter'. This paper presents high-fidelity maps of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. The results are consistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation. Ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for only one-sixth of the total matter in the Universe1,2,3. The remainder is a mysterious ‘dark matter’ component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thus neither emits nor reflects light. As dark matter cannot be seen directly using traditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties. It does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed through gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by the gravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations4,5. This is a purely geometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive to all matter—whether baryonic or dark6,7. Here we show high-fidelity maps of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. We find a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect in massive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. Our results are consistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation8,9, in which the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filaments then into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas can accumulate, and stars can be built10."
https://openalex.org/W2153134824,"Systematic genetic interaction studies have illuminated many cellular processes. Here we quantitatively examine genetic interactions among 26 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes conferring resistance to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), as determined by chemogenomic fitness profiling of pooled deletion strains. We constructed 650 double-deletion strains, corresponding to all pairings of these 26 deletions. The fitness of single- and double-deletion strains were measured in the presence and absence of MMS. Genetic interactions were defined by combining principles from both statistical and classical genetics. The resulting network predicts that the Mph1 helicase has a role in resolving homologous recombination-derived DNA intermediates that is similar to (but distinct from) that of the Sgs1 helicase. Our results emphasize the utility of small molecules and multifactorial deletion mutants in uncovering functional relationships and pathway order."
https://openalex.org/W2026044415,"The Red List Index uses information from the IUCN Red List to track trends in the projected overall extinction risk of sets of species. It has been widely recognised as an important component of the suite of indicators needed to measure progress towards the international target of significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. However, further application of the RLI (to non-avian taxa in particular) has revealed some shortcomings in the original formula and approach: It performs inappropriately when a value of zero is reached; RLI values are affected by the frequency of assessments; and newly evaluated species may introduce bias. Here we propose a revision to the formula, and recommend how it should be applied in order to overcome these shortcomings. Two additional advantages of the revisions are that assessment errors are not propagated through time, and the overall level extinction risk can be determined as well as trends in this over time."
https://openalex.org/W2103180882,"Copper is essential for human physiology, but in excess it causes the severe metabolic disorder Wilson disease. Elevated copper is thought to induce pathological changes in tissues by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species that damage multiple cell targets. To better understand the molecular basis of this disease, we performed genome-wide mRNA profiling as well as protein and metabolite analysis for Atp7b-/- mice, an animal model of Wilson disease. We found that at the presymptomatic stages of the disease, copper-induced changes are inconsistent with widespread radical-mediated damage, which is likely due to the sequestration of cytosolic copper by metallothioneins that are markedly up-regulated in Atp7b-/- livers. Instead, copper selectively up-regulates molecular machinery associated with the cell cycle and chromatin structure and down-regulates lipid metabolism, particularly cholesterol biosynthesis. Specific changes in the transcriptome are accompanied by distinct metabolic changes. Biochemical and mass spectroscopy measurements revealed a 3.6-fold decrease of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum and a 33% decrease of liver cholesterol, indicative of a marked decrease in cholesterol biosynthesis. Consistent with low cholesterol levels, the amount of activated sterol regulatory-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) is increased in Atp7b-/- nuclei. However, the SREBP-2 target genes are dysregulated suggesting that elevated copper alters SREBP-2 function rather than its processing or re-localization. Thus, in Atp7b-/- mice elevated copper affects specific cellular targets at the transcription and/or translation levels and has distinct effects on liver metabolic function, prior to appearance of histopathological changes. The identification of the network of specific copper-responsive targets facilitates further mechanistic analysis of human disorders of copper misbalance.

Copper plays an essential role in human physiology. It serves as a cofactor of key metabolic enzymes and is required for embryonic development, neuronal myelination, radical detoxification, and numerous other physiological processes. Mutations in copper-binding proteins have been linked to such devastating disorders as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, prion disease, and Menkes disease.

The disease is caused by mutations of the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B (Wilson disease protein) (1Cox D. Roberts E. Feldman M. Friedman L. Brandt L.S. Wilson Disease, W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia. 2006: 1601-1612Google Scholar, 2Ferenci P. Metab. Brain Dis. 2004; 19: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3Gitlin J.D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1868-1877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). ATP7B is expressed predominantly in the liver, where it transports copper from the cytosol into the lumen of the Golgi network for incorporation into ceruloplasmin, a copper-dependent ferroxidase. ATP7B is also required to export excess copper from the liver into the bile; this represents the major excretory route for copper in the body (4Loudianos G. Gitlin J.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In WD patients, both functions are disrupted, and copper accumulates to levels that are 10-20-fold higher than the norm (5Brewer G.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: S1087-S1090Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gradual copper accumulation, most noticeable in the liver, induces marked changes in tissue structure and function. Liver injury is the most common manifestation of WD, although neurological and psychiatric symptoms are also frequently observed (2Ferenci P. Metab. Brain Dis. 2004; 19: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Loudianos G. Gitlin J.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Stremmel W.

WD patients may show progressive hepatic cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, or rapidly developing liver failure (7Riordan S.M. Williams R. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 165-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). None of these clinical features is specific to WD, complicating its diagnosis. Remarkably, despite a long history (WD was described in 1912 (8Wilson S.A.K. Brain. 1912; 34: 295-507Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar)) and significant progress in characterization of its genetic basis (9Tanzi R.E. Petrukhin K. Chernov I. Pellequer J.L. Wasco W. Ross B.

Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), the molecular and metabolic changes that accompany initial stages of copper accumulation (and may serve as markers of disease progression) remain poorly characterized. The effects of accumulated copper on lipid peroxidation, enzyme activity, and DNA stability have been reported in both patients and in animal models of WD (12Britton R.S. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Gaetke L.M. Chow C.K. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 14Linder M.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 475: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), yet it is still unclear which of these manifestations are the primary effects of accumulated copper and which are the longer term consequences of the disease. Understanding the initial copper-specific changes is particularly important, not only because detecting such changes may serve as a useful diagnostic tool, but also because corrective or supportive treatment can be implemented to overcome observed metabolic alterations and further improve and supplement copper-chelation therapy. To understand molecular events associated with the early stages of copper overload, we have utilized Atp7b-/- mice, an animal model of WD. We have shown previously that these animals accumulate copper to high levels and have several phenotypic features resembling WD (15Huster D. Finegold M.J. Morgan C.T. Burkhead J.L. Nixon R. Vanderwerf S.M. Gilliam C.T. Lutsenko S. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have also observed that in the 6-week-old Atp7b-/- mice, the hepatic copper is at its highest level, yet the pathology is still minimal (15Huster D. Finegold M.J. Morgan C.T. Burkhead J.L. Nixon R. Vanderwerf S.M. Gilliam C.T. Lutsenko S. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). At this presymptomatic stage the changes in gene/protein expression as well as associated metabolic alterations in the liver are likely to represent specific responses to copper. In this study, we characterize changes in the hepatic mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites in response to copper accumulation in 6-week-old Atp7b-/- mice. We demonstrate that the effect of copper is selective and involves distinct metabolic pathways, organized in the interconnected network, although oxidative stress is not apparent. The most significant and unexpected are the up-regulation of cell cycle machinery and the down-regulation of cholesterol metabolism; the latter is accompanied by marked decrease of cholesterol in the liver. These novel findings pave the way for detailed mechanistic analysis of WD and other copper-induced pathologies. Animals—The generation of the Atp7b-/- mouse has been described previously (16Buiakova O.I. Xu J. Lutsenko S. Zeitlin S. Das K. Das S. Ross B.M. Mekios C. Scheinberg I.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained on strain C57BL × 129S6/SvEv, and female animals at 6 weeks of age were used for microarray and RT-PCR studies. The Atp7b-/- and control mice were housed at the Oregon Health & Science University animal facility according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the use of laboratory and experimental animals. Food and water were provided ad libitum, and no further treatment was carried out. Animals were euthanized at given time points and livers quickly removed for different tissue preparations. RNA Isolation for Microarray—Immediately after removal, the liver pieces (∼75 mg) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until further use. The total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol followed by an RNeasy cleanup procedure (Qiagen). The integrity of isolated RNA was electrophoretically verified by ethidium bromide staining and by absorbance ratio (A260 nm/280 nm > 1.8). A total of six liver RNA samples (three biological replicates for WT and three for KO animals) were tested for RNA quality. Each of the six sample targets was hybridized to two different MOE430A Affymetrix GeneChip arrays (technical replicates). The Affymetrix chip contained 22,691 spots corresponding to 13,016 unique Unigene IDs (i.e. unique genes). Chip Performance Analysis—Image processing and analysis were performed using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software. The resulting intensities and coordinate information were saved in a CEL file format and then subjected to global scaling with an average target intensity of 350 to allow for direct comparison of hybridization values from different targets. Scaled results for each sample were saved as CHP files, and these data were used to evaluate overall chip performance (supplemental Table 1). The analysis indicated that the parameters describing the quality of RNA, hybridization, and detection were all within acceptable range. The data in CEL format were imported into GeneSifter.net, a microarray data analysis application and subjected to RMA normalization using published algorithms (17Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8415) Google Scholar). The RMA-normalized data set was then used to identify changed genes and determine the statistical significance and magnitude of changes (fold change). The significance was established using Wilcoxon t test with Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons. The data were annotated with NCBI Unigene IDs and with related Gene Ontology terms by using the Affymetrics NetAffx tool and NIAID-NIH DAVID (apps1.niaid.nih.gov/david/). Of the 310 significantly differentially expressed probe sets, 304 had Unigene IDs and were annotated in mouse Gene Ontology (GO). In a number of cases, when changes in the transcript were detected by more than one probe set, the sequences of these probe sets were manually compared with the sequence of the identified transcript to ensure that the probe sets indeed mapped to the same gene. The GO analysis was carried out using GenMapp on-line tool (18Dahlquist K.D. Salomonis N. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 19Doniger S.W. Salomonis N. Dahlquist K.D. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each identified GO term, Gene Map z-statistic was calculated. A positive z-statistic for any particular GO term indicated that there were more genes associated with this GO term than would be expected by random chance. The GO terms with positive z-statistic were then ranked based on the percent of changed genes that belong to the corresponding GO compared with the total number of genes on a chip with the same GO. This analysis identified those GO terms that were most strongly represented among the differentially expressed genes (probe sets). The results were independently confirmed by applying the GO Browser tool in NetAffx to the same set of differentially expressed genes. The gene expression data have been submitted to GEO data base (GEO number GSE5348). The associations between altered genes or pathways were further evaluated using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (Ingenuity® Systems). Affymetrix identifiers of the differentially expressed genes (the fold change of 1.5 or higher) and their corresponding expression values were loaded into the software and mapped to its corresponding gene object (so-called focus genes) in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. The significance of the associations between the data set and the canonical pathway and functional annotations was calculated in two ways. First, the number of genes from the data set that map to the pathway was divided by the number of all known genes ascribed to the pathway. Second, the left-tailed Fisher exact test was used to calculate related p values and distinguish those functional/pathway annotations that had more focus genes than expected by chance. The networks of the focus genes were algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. Real Time PCR (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted from livers of 4-, 6-, and 32-week-old WT and KO mice (n = 6 per group) and checked for integrity as described above. One-step RT-PCR was performed with a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 ng of total RNA, 0.5 μm each primer, LightCycler RT-PCR reaction mix SYBR Green I (1×), and LightCycler RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (Roche Applied Science). Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 20 min. The denaturation and amplification conditions were 95 °C for 15 s followed by up to 35 cycles of PCR. Each cycle of PCR included denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and then 10 s of primer annealing at 55 °C and 20 s of extension/synthesis at 72 °C (20 s). The temperature ramp was 20 °C/s, except when heating to 72 °C, when it was 2 °C/s. At the end of the extension, step fluorescence of each sample was measured to allow quantification of the RNA. After amplification a melting curve was obtained by heating at 20 °C/s to 95 °C, cooling at 20 °C/s to 60 °C, and slowly heating at 0.1 °C/s to 90 °C with fluorescence data collection at 0.1 °C intervals. RT-PCR primers for the internal standard glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the target genes were designed using Omiga™ software (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK). Gene sequences were taken from the Affymetrix web site based on Affymetrix ID and Unigene number. Primer design followed standard criteria; the complete list of primers is given in the supplemental Table 2. For selected genes QuantiTect® (Qiagen) primer assays were used (supplemental Table 2). Product identity was confirmed by separation on agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. The abundance of target mRNA was calculated in relation to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in the same sample. The amount of target mRNA in Atp7b-/- mice relative to the wild-type mice was quantified using the 2ΔΔCt method (20Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121290) Google Scholar). Human liver samples were obtained from eight Wilson disease patients who underwent liver transplantation and eight control livers from other patients who underwent liver resection. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the University of Leipzig (registration number 236-2006) and followed ethical guidelines. RNA from small liver samples was isolated as described above. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA by reverse transcription with Super-Script II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers. Gene expression was determined by quantitative fluorogenic RT-PCR (ABI PRISM SDS 7900, Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were selected to span two exons in order to prevent amplification of genomic DNA (supplemental Table 2). The PCR was prepared in a final volume of 12.5 μl of a reaction mixture containing 2.5 μl of cDNA (diluted 1:15), 5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 μl of 10× AmpliTaq buffer A, 200 μm dNTP (each), 0.3 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems), 200 nm 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and 900 nm of each oligonucleotide primer. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min and 40 two-step cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Standardization was performed using serial dilutions of linearized plasmid cDNA ranging from 10 to 107 copies. Data were analyzed with the ABI PRISM software. The mRNA expression results are given as the fold change of LDL receptor compared with control and for HMG-CoA reductase as the copy number normalized to 106 copies of β-actin. Analysis of Soluble Proteins by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The liver tissue (50-100 mg wet weight) from control and Atp7b-/- mice was homogenized in 800 μl of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 using a glass Dounce homogenizer with tight pestle. Soluble proteins were obtained by centrifuging samples at 100,000 × g for 30 min and collecting the supernatant. The lipids at the top of the supernatant were removed using a 0.22-μm centrifugal filter device (ultrafree-MC, Millipore). The soluble proteins were precipitated by adding 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone, 1 mm HCl. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at -20 °C for 1 h, and proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was air dried for 5 min. Pellets were then dissolved by vortexing in 8 m urea, and protein content was determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). 0.17 ml of this solution containing 2 mg of protein was mixed with 0.17 ml of 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 100 mm DTT, 4% glycerol, and 4% pH 3-10NL IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences). This solution was used for overnight reswelling of 18-cm pH 3-10NL IPG strips (Amersham Biosciences). The strips were focused using a Protean IEF Cell (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 20 °C, 0-500 V for 6 h (rapid), 500-3500 V for 3 h (linear), 3500 V for 8 h, with a 50-mA limit per gel. Following isoelectric focusing, the strips were reduced and alkylated, and the second dimension separation was performed using 12% gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie G-250 as described previously (21Lampi K.J. Shih M. Ueda Y. Shearer T.R. David L.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 216-224PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—The spots of interest were excised from Coomassie-stained gels, washed twice with doubly deionized water, and then twice with 50% (v/v) 50 mm NH4CO3, 50% acetonitrile. The gel pieces were then incubated in 100% acetonitrile for 2 min after which the liquid was removed, and the pieces were air dried until white in appearance. Rehydration of the gel pieces was performed with digestion buffer containing 0.01 μg/μl trypsin (Princeton Applied Research), 50 mm NH4CO3, and 50 mm CaCl2 followed by the addition of 60 μl of the same buffer without trypsin and incubation at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 μl of 98% formic acid (Aldrich) to ∼60 μl of digest. A 45-μl aliquot was analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy using an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Deca XP Plus, Thermo Electron Corp.). The analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopy was performed using a capillary 180 μm × 12-cm column packed in-house with stable-bond C18 packing material (5 μm, ZORBAX, Agilent Technologies). The samples were applied to the column through a trap column (180 μm × 2.5 cm, packed in-house with the same packing material as above), and the peptides were separated using a linear gradient changing the solvent composition from 2% acetonitrile to 30% acetonitrile over a 30-min period with a constant flow rate of 1.5 μl/min. MS data were acquired in data-dependent mode in which a single survey scan (MS) was followed by up to four sequential data-dependent MS/MS scans on the four most intense peptide ions. A dynamic exclusion feature was used to extend the analysis to less abundant ions. The peptides were identified using SEQUEST (22Eng J.K. McKormack A.L. Yates J.R.I. J. Am. Soc.

Systems Biol. 2005; 1: E1-E8Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Scaffold (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) was used to analyze protein identifications derived from MS/MS sequencing results. Scaffold validates peptide identifications using PeptideProphet (24Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal.

Proteins were considered as “identified” when probability scores were ≥0.99 (protein) and ≥0.90 (peptide) with a minimum of two peptides identified. Serum Analysis—Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and serum was separated by centrifugation after blood coagulation and used immediately for analysis. Serum lipids were quantified after isolation by sequential centrifugation as described previously (26Teupser D. Pavlides S. Tan M. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Kolbeck R. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17795-17800Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Metabolic Profiling of Liver Tissue—2 mg of frozen tissue was homogenized for 30 s in an MM301 ball mill (Retsch, Germany). Extraction was carried using 1 ml of a one phasic mixture of isopropyl alcohol:acetonitrile:water (3:3:2, v/v) at -20 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was completely dried in a SpeedVac concentrator and then derivatized in two steps. First, carbonyl functions were protected by methoximation using 20 μl of a 40 mg/ml solution of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine at 28 °C for 30 min. The samples were then derivatized using 180 μl of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) at 37 °C for 30 min to increase the volatility. 0.5 μl of this solution was injected into an automatic liner exchange system unit (ALEX, Gerstel, Germany) at a 1:5 split ratio. For every sample, a fresh liner was used to avoid sample carryover. Each liner was deactivated and cleaned using a blank N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide injection followed by a flash heat ramp. The sample was introduced at 50 °C using an MPS injector (Gerstel, Germany) and heated to 250 °C using a 5 °C/min ramp. An Agilent 6890 gas chromatography oven (Hewlett-Packard, Atlanta, GA) was coupled to a Pegasus IV time of flight-mass spectrometer from Leco (St. Joseph, MI). An rtx5-SilMS fused silica capillary column (Restek) of 30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, and 0.25-μm film thickness was used for separation with the 0.25-mm inner diameter 10-m IntegraGuard column without film. For the analysis the gas chromatography oven was set to 85 °C with duration of 210 s and a following ramp of 20 °C/min. The target time was 330 °C with duration of 5 min. The transfer line temperature was set to 250 °C. Mass spectra were acquired with a scan range of 83-500 m/z and an acquisition rate of 20 spectra/s. The ionization mode was electron impact at 70 eV. The temperature for the ion source was set to 250 °C. Chromatogram acquisition, data handling, automated peak deconvolution, library search, and retention index calculation was done by the Leco ChromaTOF software (version 2.32) using an in-house custom mass spectral library for compound identification. Analysis of Mature SREBP-2 in Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Sheng et al. (27Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mouse livers (∼0.7-1.0 g) were homogenized in 3 volumes of buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2.0 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1.0 mm DTT and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by six passes of a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Homogenate was layered over 1.0 ml of buffer 1 and centrifuged for 45 min at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50 rotor. The supernatant was removed, and pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 1.0 mm DTT, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture. The suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0 mm DTT, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture. The one-tenth volume of 4.0 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.9, was added, and the mixture was placed on a rocking shaker at 4 °C for 45 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant contained nuclear extract. 10.0 μg of nuclear extract was then separated on a 7.5% Laemmli gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 10% methanol. The membrane was blocked overnight in 50% Aquablock (EastCoastBio, North Berwick, ME). Anti-SREBP2 (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) was used at 1:5,000 dilution, and IRDye800-conjugated goat antirabbit (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) was used at 1:20,000 dilution. Washes after both primary and secondary antibodies were in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate as described in Sheng et al. (27Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was visualized with an Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Evaluation of the Quality of the Array Data—To characterize molecular consequences of hepatic copper accumulation in the Atp7b-/- (KO) mice, we initially performed a comparative genome-wide analysis of transcripts isolated from livers of 6-week-old animals. At this age, the copper concentration in livers was elevated approximately 18-fold compared with control, but little if any pathology could be detected histologically (data not shown, see also Ref. 15Huster D.

In these disorders, the relationships between these responses are not well defined. In addition, the apoptosis pathways that contribute to these responses and the mechanism(s) of their contribution have not been described. We hypothesized that BH3 domain-only protein-induced apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1-induced pulmonary responses. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the effects of transgenic TGF-β1 in mice with wild type (WT) and null Bax loci. To investigate the mechanisms of Bax activation and its effector functions, we also compared the effects of TGF-β1 in mice with WT and null Bid and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 loci, respectively. These studies demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a potent stimulator of Bax, Bid, and MMP-12. The studies also demonstrate that Bax and Bid play key roles in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis; that TGF-β1 stimulates MMP-12, TIMP-1, and cathepsins and inhibits MMP-9 and p21 via Bax- and Bid-dependent mechanisms; and that TGF-β1-stimulated pulmonary fibrosis is ameliorated in MMP-12-deficient animals. Finally, they demonstrate that Bax, Bid, and MMP-12 play similar roles in bleomycin-induced fibrosis, thereby highlighting the importance of this Bid-activated, Bax-mediated pathway and downstream MMP-12 in a variety of fibrogenic settings.

Fibrosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the lung and other organs. This can be seen in the interstitial lung diseases (ILD) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), scleroderma, radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and bleomycin lung where matrix molecule deposition, enhanced collagen accumulation, and alveolar septal rupture with honeycombing are seen and can lead to fatal consequences (1Antoniou K.M.

Mutlu G.M. Eisenbart J. Fuller A.C. Bellmeyer A.A. Baker C.M. Wilson M. Ridge K. Barrett T.A. Lee V.Y. Chandel N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). As a result of these studies, TGF-β1 is believed to be a critical mediator of pathologic, fibrotic, and remodeling responses in the lung and other organs, and these responses are believed to be mediated by the ability of TGF-β1 to activate fibrogenic and apoptotic “injury” pathways. The components of these pathways, however, are poorly understood. In particular, the apoptosis responses that contribute to TGF-β1-induced tissue fibrosis and alveolar remodeling have not been defined, and the mechanisms via which apoptosis contributes to these fibrogenic and remodeling responses have not been adequately investigated. Although cell death can be triggered by a vast array of stimuli and mediated via an increasingly complex series of pathways, the vast majority of signals engage the cell death machinery at the level of the cell membrane and/or at the level of the mitochondria. The membrane (“extrinsic”) pathway triggers surface “death receptors” such as Fas, which binds Fas ligand and TNF receptor 1, which binds TNF and lymphotoxin (9Li X. Shu R. Filippatos G. Uhal B.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Lu Q. Harrington E.O. Rounds S. Keio J. Med. 2005; 54: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Joza N. Kroemer G. Penninger J.M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 142-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Other stimuli use mitochondrial dysfunction to signal death responses. In this “intrinsic” response, the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family members is altered with BH3 domain-only family members like Bid being activated, neutralizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and binding to pro-apoptotic molecules like Bax. These interactions allow Bax to form or interact with mitochondrial pores, release a variety of mediators including cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, activate caspase-9, and induce cell death (9Li X.

The relative contributions that the different cell death pathways make to these responses, however, have not been investigated. In addition, the mechanisms by which these pathways contribute to tissue fibrosis have not been adequately defined. We hypothesized that BH3 domain-only protein-induced mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the effects of transgenic TGF-β1 in mice with wild-type and null mutant Bax loci. To investigate the mechanisms of Bax activation and its effector functions, we also compared the effects of transgenic TGF-β1 in mice with wild-type and null Bid and mice with wild-type and null matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 loci, respectively. These studies demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a potent stimulator of Bax, Bid, and MMP-12 in the murine lung. They also demonstrate that Bax and Bid play key roles in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1-induced inflammation and fibrosis and bleomycin-induced fibrosis and that TGF-β1 regulates the expression of MMPs, antiproteases and cathepsins, but not collagens via a Baxand Bid-dependent mechanism(s). Finally, they demonstrate that MMP-12 also plays an important role in TGF-β1 effector pathway activation, because TGF-β1-stimulated and bleomycin-stimulated pulmonary fibrosis were ameliorated in MMP-12-deficient animals. Overexpression Transgenic and Null Mutant Mice—CC10-tTS-rtTA-TGF-β1 transgenic (Tg) mice were generated in our laboratory, bred onto a C57BL/6 background for >10 generations, and used in these studies. These mice utilize the Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10) promoter to specifically target TGF-β1 to the lung. The methods that were used to generate and characterize these mice have been described previously (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A.

Mice with null mutations of Bax or Bid that had been bred onto a C57BL/6 background for >10 generations were generated in the laboratory of the late Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer as previously described (34Yin X.M.

Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). These mice were bred with the TGF-β1 Tg mice to obtain Tg mice with WT and null loci. Doxycycline Water Administration—Six-week-old transgene (+) mice and transgene (-) littermate controls were randomized to normal water or water containing 0.5 mg/ml of doxycycline as described previously (22Lee C.G.

Phenotypic alterations were evaluated at intervals thereafter. Quantification of Lung Collagen—Animals were anesthetized, a median sternotomy was performed, and right heart perfusion was accomplished with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline. The heart and lungs were then removed en bloc. The right lung was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until used. The collagen content was determined by quantifying total soluble collagen using the Sircol Collagen Assay kit (Biocolor) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data are expressed as the collagen content of the entire right lung. Histologic Analysis—The lungs were removed en bloc as described above, inflated at 25-cm pressure with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% low melting point agarose gel, fixed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained. Hematoxylin and eosin, and Mallory's trichrome stains were performed in the Research Histology Laboratory of the Department of Pathology at the Yale University School of Medicine. Morphometric Analysis—Alveolar remodeling was estimated from the mean chord length of the airspace as described previously by our laboratory (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 8106-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). BAL and Lung Inflammation—Lung inflammation was assessed by BAL as described previously (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The BAL samples from each animal were pooled and centrifuged. The number and type of cells in the cell pellet were determined with light microscopy. TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End-labeling (TUNEL) Evaluations—End-labeling of exposed 3′-OH ends of DNA fragments was undertaken with the TUNEL in situ cell death detection kit AP (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. After staining, 20 fields of alveoli were randomly chosen for examination. The labeled cells were expressed as a percentage of total nuclei. mRNA Analysis—mRNA levels were assessed using real timereverse transcription PCR assays described by our laboratories (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp.

In these assays, total cellular RNA from lungs were obtained using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer sequences that were employed and have not been previously reported by our laboratory can be found in supplemental Table S1. Quantification of TGF-β1—The levels of BAL TGF-β1 were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) per the manufacturer's instructions. These evaluations were done before and after acid activation to assess the levels of activated and total TGF-β1, respectively. Immunoblot Analysis—Lung lysates were prepared, and Western analysis was undertaken with antibodies that reacted selectively with ICAD (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) or MMP-12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp.

Bleomycin Administration—Bleomycin (0.075 units/mouse) or vehicle control were administered to C57BL/6 female mice as previously described by Jiang et al. (65Jiang D. Liang J. Hodge J. Lu B. Zhu Z. Yu S. Fan J. Gao Y. Yin Z. Homer R. Gerard C. Noble P.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Statistics—Normally distributed data are expressed as means ± S.E. and assessed for significance by Student's t test or analysis of variance as appropriate. Data that were not normally distributed were assessed for significance using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. TGF-β1 Regulation of Bax—To address the possibility that intrinsic cell death pathways play important roles in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1-induced tissue responses, studies were first undertaken to determine if the expression of Bax was regulated by transgenic TGF-β1. This was done by comparing the levels of Bax mRNA and protein in lungs from transgene (Tg) negative (-) and Tg(+) mice at various times after Tg activation. These studies demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a potent stimulator of Bax mRNA and protein accumulation in lungs from doxycycline-treated Tg mice (Fig. 1). This induction was seen after as little as 3 days of doxycycline administration and persisted throughout the 28-day study interval (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Roles of Bax in TGF-β1-induced Inflammation and Fibrosis—To determine if the inflammatory and fibrotic effects of TGF-β1 were altered in the absence of Bax, we used BAL, histologic, and biochemical (Sircol) approaches to quantitate the inflammation and collagen in lungs from Tg mice with WT and null Bax loci. In accord with previous studies from our laboratory (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), transgenic TGF-β1 caused a mononuclear cellpredominant inflammatory response and a significant increase in lung collagen content in mice that expressed Bax normally (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2, A-C). Interestingly, both responses were diminished in the absence of Bax. After 14 days of doxycycline water administration, TGF-β1-induced BAL cellularity was decreased by 60.1 ± 5.5% (p = 0.044) in Bax-null versus WT animals (Fig. 2A). BAL and tissue differential cell counts, however, were not significantly altered (data not shown). Similarly, at this time point, TGF-β1-induced collagen accumulation was decreased by 80.3 + 6.1% in Tg(+) Bax-null versus WT mice (p = 0.015) (Fig. 2C). These studies demonstrate that Bax plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1-induced inflammation and fibrosis in the murine lung. Role of Bax in Alveolar Remodeling—In addition to inducing tissue fibrosis, TGF-β1 induces alveolar remodeling with septal destruction and an increase in alveolar chord length (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To define the role(s) of Bax in these responses, we compared the alveoli from Tg mice with WT and null Bax loci. In accord with our prior report (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), an increase in lung destruction was readily apparent in Tg mice that produced Bax normally (Fig. 3). Interestingly, null mutations of Bax did not significantly alter this alveolar remodeling (Fig. 3). Thus, although Bax plays an important role in TGF-β1-induced inflammation and fibrosis, it does not contribute, in a major way, to TGF-β1-induced alveolar remodeling. Role of Bax in TGF-β1-induced DNA Injury and Cell Death—Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that TGF-β1 activates a number of apoptosis pathways in the murine lung (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, studies were undertaken to define the contribution of Bax-induced mitochondrial alterations in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. This was done using TUNEL stains to compare the TGF-β1-induced DNA injury and cell death in transgenic mice with WT and null Bax loci. Transgenic TGF-β1 caused an impressive increase in TUNEL staining in mice with WT Bax loci (Fig. 4A). These TUNEL(+) cells were largely epithelial cells as evidenced by their histologic location and morphology (data not shown). This response was readily appreciated after 2 days of doxycycline administration and decreased with longer periods of Tg activation (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Bax appeared to play an important role in this response because the TUNEL staining was decreased in lungs from Tg(+) mice with null mutations of Bax (Fig. 4A). This was readily appreciated after 48 h of doxycycline administration where TGF-β1-induced TUNEL staining was decreased by 52.2 ± 4.1% compared with Tg mice with WT Bax loci (Fig. 4A) (p = 0.028). This inhibition was associated with a significant decrease in the accumulation of activated caspase-3 and a decrease caspase-mediated ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase) cleavage (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Thus, these studies demonstrate that Bax-mediated mitochondrial alterations are important contributors to TGF-β1-induced DNA injury and cell death in the murine lung. They also highlight a Bax-independent cell death pathway that is induced by TGF-β1 in the murine lung. Bax and the Regulation of Transgenic TGF-β1—The decreased ability of TGF-β1 to induce tissue responses in the absence of Bax could be caused by a decrease in the production of transgenic TGF-β1 or a decrease in its ability to activate its effector pathways. To differentiate among these options, we compared the levels of total and active TGF-β1 in lungs from Tg(-) and Tg(+) mice with WT and null Bax loci. These effects appeared to be due, in great extent, to alteration(s) in TGF-β1 effector pathway activation because the levels of total and bioactive TGF-β1 in BAL from Tg(+) mice with null Bax loci were comparable or greater than those in fluids from Tg(+) mice that make Bax normally (data not shown). Bax and TGF-β1-induced Apoptosis—We demonstrated previously that TGF-β1 induces lung epithelial cell apoptosis via an Egr-1-dependent mechanism and that cathepsins are important regulators of lung epithelial cell death pathways (22Lee C.G. Cho S.J. Kang M.J. Chapoval S.P. Lee P.J. Noble P.W. Yehualaeshet T. Lu B. Flavell R.A. Milbrandt J. Homer R.J. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 35Zheng T. Kang M.J. Crothers K. Zhu Z. Liu W. Lee C.G. Rabach L.A. Chapman H.A. Homer R.J. Aldous D. De Sanctis G.T. Underwood S. Graupe M. Flavell R.A. Schmidt J.A. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 8106-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Bax might contribute to TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, the ability of TGF-β1 to regulate Egr-1 and cathepsins in the presence or absence of Bax was evaluated. We also characterized the ability of TGF-β1 to regulate the apoptosis regulator p21 in these settings. TGF-β1 was a potent stimulator of the levels of Egr-1, cathepsins -S, -D, -K, -H, and -B and p21 mRNA and/or protein in Tg(+) mice (Fig. 5, A-C). These responses were seen as little as 48 h after doxycycline activation and persisted throughout 2-week study interval (Fig. 5 and data not shown). These responses were mediated, at least in part, by Bax because null mutations of Bax decreased the ability of TGF-β1 to stimulate Egr-1 and the cathepsins (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, TGF-β1 stimulation of p21 was enhanced in Bax-null mice (Fig. 5C). When viewed in combination, these studies demonstrate that Bax plays an important role in TGF-β1 stimulation of Egr-1 and the activation of cathepsinmediated cell death pathways. They also highlight a Bax-de"

The presence of CI subcomplexes in CI-deficient cells suggests that assembly occurs in distinct steps. However, discriminating between products of assembly or instability is problematic. Using an inducible NDUFS3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression system in HEK293 cells, we here provide direct evidence for the stepwise assembly of CI. Upon induction, six distinct NDUFS3-GFP-containing subcomplexes gradually appeared on a blue native Western blot also observed in wild type HEK293 mitochondria. Their stability was demonstrated by differential solubilization and heat incubation, which additionally allowed their distinction from specific products of CI instability and breakdown. Inhibition of mitochondrial translation under conditions of steady state labeling resulted in an accumulation of two of the NDUFS3-GFP-containing subcomplexes (100 and 150 kDa) and concomitant disappearance of the fully assembled complex. Lifting inhibition reversed this effect, demonstrating that these two subcomplexes are true assembly intermediates. Composition analysis showed that this event was accompanied by the incorporation of at least one mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunit, thereby revealing the first entry point of these subunits.

Mitochondrial ATP is produced by the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) 3The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; CI-CV, complexes I-V; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; DDM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; EGFP, enhanced GFP; BN, blue native. system. This system consists of five complexes, composed of at least 75 nuclear DNA-encoded and 13 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins, and is a prominent example of coordinated assembly. The first four OXPHOS complexes (CI-CIV) constitute the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from substrates NADH (at CI) and FADH2 (at CII) to the final electron acceptor molecular oxygen (CIV). Energy released by this electron transport is used to drive proton translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane at CI, CIII, and CIV. The resulting proton gradient is used to drive the conversion of ADP and inorganic phosphate into ATP by complex V (1Smeitink J. van Den H.L. DiMauro S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). CI (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex; EC 1.6.5.3) constitutes the largest and least understood of the OXPHOS complexes (2Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75 (69-92): 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 3Janssen R.J. Nijtmans L.G. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J.A. J. Inherit. Metab Dis. 2006; 29: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy revealed that CI has an L-shaped structure that consists of a hydrophobic arm embedded in the lipid bilayer of the mitochondrial inner membrane and a hydrophylic peripheral arm exposed to the mitochondrial matrix (4Grigorieff N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using chaotropic salts and the detergent N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide, CI can be fractionated into several fragments (5Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that together encompass 45 distinct subunits in bovine CI (7Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E.

The recent appearance of the first crystal structure of the hydrophilic domain of CI in Thermus thermophilus is an example of the increasing insight that is gained in this area of research (9Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In contrast, the many steps involved in the assembly of these 45 subunits still remain puzzling. Studies in the fungus Neurospora crassa demonstrated that the membrane and peripheral arms of CI are assembled independently and that the membrane arm, in its turn, is the product of the combination of a small and large assembly intermediate (10Schulte U.

Two models are described for the CI assembly pathway in human mitochondria; one is based on the subcomplex distribution in CI-deficient patient cells, and the other is based on the appearance of subcomplexes in a conditional CI assembly system (13Antonicka H. Ogilvie I. Taivassalo T. Anitori R.P. Haller R.G. Vissing J. Kennaway N.G. Shoubridge E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43081-43088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Ugalde C. Vogel R. Huijbens R. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although both models differ at several points, they agree in that assembly occurs via the combination of large preassembled fragments rather than via sequential addition of individual subunits. Structural and phylogenetic data strongly suggest that certain CI subunits have co-evolved and are arranged in distinct structures, termed modules (15Finel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 17Friedrich T. Weiss H. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 187: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18Hedderich R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Combination of these modules resulted in the “minimal” CI structure consisting of the 14 most conserved subunits, of which a typical example is Escherichia coli CI: NDH-1. The proposed modules are the dehydrogenase module, consisting of the NDUFV2, NDUFV1, and NDUFS1 subunits (homologues of the nuoE, F, and G subunits of bacterial NDH-1); the hydrogenase module, consisting of the NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS7, NDUFS8, ND1 and ND5 subunits (homologues of the nuoD, C, B, I, H and L subunits of NDH-1); and the proton translocation module, consisting of the ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, and ND6 subunits (homologues of the nuoN, A, M, K, and J subunits of NDH-1) (for further details concerning this subject, see Ref. 17Friedrich T. Weiss H. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 187: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Our assembly model proposes that assembly in part reflects this evolutionary conservation of CI subunits (14Ugalde C. Vogel R. Huijbens R. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Assembly intermediates were identified by their appearance after the release of doxycycline inhibition of mitochondrial translation (allowing synthesis of the mtDNA-encoded ND subunits to resume). Membrane arm subunits seemed to be assembled in a different intermediate than peripheral arm subunits, and the presence of distinct early subassemblies suggested a link between the assembly process and co-evolution of different CI subunits (14Ugalde C. Vogel R. Huijbens R. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both assembly studies for human CI have used disturbed assembly systems, such as patient cell lines or cells treated with inhibitors of mitochondrial translation (13Antonicka H. Ogilvie I. Taivassalo T. Anitori R.P. Haller R.G. Vissing J. Kennaway N.G. Shoubridge E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43081-43088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Ugalde C. Vogel R. Huijbens R. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus far, however, no subcomplexes have been identified in undisturbed systems. A useful strategy to trace assembly without disturbing its dynamics is by tagging a CI subunit, provided that the tag does not interfere with its biological function. This was previously done by Scheffler and co-workers (19Potluri P. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3265-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Yadava N. Houchens T. Potluri P. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12406-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), who used inducible tagged versions of the human homologues of the MWFE and ESSS subunits of CI to study their incorporation and function in assembly by complementation of CI-deficient Chinese hamster cell lines. However, assembly intermediates were not studied. In this study, we have used leakage expression of an inducible HEK293 cell line expressing monomeric green fluorescent protein (AcGFP1)-tagged NDUFS3 subunit. This strategy allowed detection of the NDUFS3-containing subcomplexes under steady state labeling conditions and at relatively low expression levels on native one-dimensional gels. Moreover, it allowed the analysis of accumulation or disappearance of individual subcomplexes upon interference with the assembly process. The NDUFS3 subunit was selected for labeling given the apparent ease with which its eYFP-His-tagged Yarrowia lipolytica homologue can be used to isolate CI, demonstrating that the C-terminal tag does not disturb assembly (21Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been argued that this core subunit is incorporated at an early stage of assembly (13Antonicka H. Ogilvie I. Taivassalo T. Anitori R.P. Haller R.G. Vissing J. Kennaway N.G. Shoubridge E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43081-43088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Ugalde C. Vogel R. Huijbens R. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), so that tagging will provide more insight into onset and subsequent CI assembly steps. We demonstrate the existence of at least six distinct NDUFS3-containing intermediates and distinguish these stable intermediates from products of CI instability and breakdown by differential solubilization and heat incubation. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial translation reveals an essential step in which two NDUFS3-containing subcomplexes of 100 and 150 kDa require mtDNA-encoded proteins for progression in assembly. Determination of the constitution of all subcomplexes by two-dimensional SDS immunodetection demonstrates that mtDNA-encoded subunit ND1 makes its first appearance in this key step, indicating that this is the first step in the assembly process that requires the availability of mtDNA-encoded proteins. The NDUFS3 open reading frame sequence (NM_004551; without stop codon) flanked by Gateway® AttB sites (Invitrogen) was created by PCR following the manufacturer's instructions and cloned into pDONR201 by using Gateway® BP Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen). A Gateway® destination vector was produced by subcloning the BamHI/NotI restriction fragment of pAcGFP1-N1 (Clontech) in frame behind Gateway® reading frame cassette B (Invitrogen) in pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). To obtain an inducible vector containing C-terminally GFP-tagged NDUFS3 (NDUFS3-GFP), the pDONR201-NDUFS3 vector was recombined with the AcGFP1 destination vector using the Gateway® LR Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen). Flp-In T-Rex293 cells (Invitrogen) were stably transfected using Superfect® Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. Clones with low leakage levels (noninduced expression of the transgene) were selected to obtain steady state NDUFS3-GFP labeling. To induce NDUFS3-AcGFP1 overexpression in these cell lines, doxycycline (Sigma) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. To reversibly block mitochondrial translation chloramphenicol (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 40 μg/ml. For blue native analysis, the cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhitaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v) (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were harvested and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) prior to resuspension in 2% digitonin (w/v) (Calbiochem)/phosphate-buffered saline and incubation for 10 min on ice. For the amount of cells used (5 × 106), this amount is comparable with 1 g of digitonin/g protein and results in disruption of the plasma membrane without disruption of mitochondrial inner membranes (22Klement P. Nijtmans L.G. Van den Bogert C. Houstek J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), the mitochondria enriched pellet was washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein concentration was determined using the MicroBCA protein assay kit (Pierce). DDM Solubilizations—Mitochondrial protein was mildly solubilized (common solubilizations are performed using 1.6 g/g DDM) by 10 min of incubation on ice using 0.3, 0.6 and 1 g of DDM (Sigma-Aldrich)/g of protein in solubilization buffer (1.75 m 6-aminocaproic acid; Fluka), 75 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.0; Fluka). After centrifugation (30 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant containing solubilized mitochondrial proteins was used for blue native analysis. Digitonin Solubilizations—Mitochondrial protein was solubilized by 30 min of incubation on ice with 4, 8, and 16 g of digitonin/g of protein in solubilization buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate (Merck), 10% (w/v) glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich)). After gentle centrifugation (2 min, 600 × g, 4 °C) the supernatant containing solubilized mitochondrial proteins was used for blue native analysis. 37 °C Incubations—For temperature incubation experiments, mitochondrial protein was mildly solubilized using 1 g of DDM (Sigma-Aldrich)/g of protein in solubilization buffer (1.75 m 6-aminocaproic acid; Fluka), 75 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.0; Fluka). After centrifugation (30 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C) the supernatant containing solubilized mitochondrial proteins was divided into three samples. One sample was kept on ice for 60 min, one was kept at 37 °C for 10 min and on ice for 50 min, and another was kept at 37 °C for 60 min. After this period, mitochondrial lysates were used for blue native analysis. Blue native gradient gels (5-15%) were cast as described previously (23Nijtmans L.G. Henderson N.S. Holt I.J. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and run with 40 or 80 μg of solubilized mitochondrial protein. After electrophoresis, the gels were further processed for in-gel activity assays, Western blotting, or second dimension 10% SDS-PAGE as described in Ref. 23Nijtmans L.G. Henderson N.S. Holt I.J. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar. In addition to CI, in-gel activity assay typically resulted in a previously described smaller band at the bottom half of the gel, which was not shown (19Potluri P. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3265-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to a PROTAN® nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Mitochondrial lysates were prepared as described under “Cell Culture and Mitochondria Preparation” and “DDM Solubilizations.” Subsequently the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of Tricine sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Protein (20 μg/lane) was separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were blotted to PROTAN® nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Protein immunodetection was performed using the following primary antibodies directed against EGFP (a gift from Dr. Frank van Kuppeveld, Nijmegen, The Netherlands), NDUFS2 (a gift from Professor Brian Robinson, Toronto, Canada), NDUFA9 (Invitrogen), NDUFS3 (Invitrogen), ND1 (a gift from Dr. Anne Lombes, Paris, France), NDUFB6 (Mitosciences), NDUFA13 (Mitosciences), NDUFA6 (Mitosciences), NDUFA1 (a gift from Professor Immo Scheffler, San Diego, CA), the CII 70-kDa subunit (SDHA; Invitrogen), the CIII Core2 subunit (UQCRC2; Invitrogen), CIV coxII subunit (COXII; Invitrogen), and CV ATPase α (ATPA1; Invitrogen). For generation of the NDUFA2-specific antibody, the rabbits were immunized with peptide CDQVTRALENVLSGKA that was keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled using the Imject® maleimide-activated mcKLH kit (Pierce). The obtained antiserum was found suitable for specific NDUFA2 detection on Western blots (data not shown). Secondary antibodies used peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (Invitrogen). The signal was generated using ECL® Plus (Amersham Biosciences). The sizes of the observed subcomplexes were determined by their relative migration compared with the OXPHOS complexes (CII, 150 kDa; CIII, 600 kDa (dimer); CIV, 240 kDa; CV, 750 kDa), previously described CI subcomplexes (14Ugalde C. Vogel R. Huijbens R. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and to each other on the same two-dimensional blot. After Western blotting, luminescent signals were quantified using Image Pro Plus 5.1 (Media Cybernetics, San Diego, CA). The integrated optical density of each band was determined and corrected for background. The resulting numerical values were expressed relative to the CII-SDHA signal to correct for loading differences. Induction of NDUFS3-GFP Expression Results in GFP Labeling of CI and Six Distinct Subcomplexes—To trace the appearance of CI subcomplexes, we have made stable HEK293 clones containing a tetracycline inducible vector for the NDUFS3 subunit with C-terminal monomeric GFP (AcGFP1). To exclude that the GFP tag disturbs CI assembly, we first investigated the effects of induction on CI assembly and activity (Fig. 1). After 4 h of induction, the NDUFS3-GFP protein was clearly immunodetectable on an SDS Western blot of mitochondrial lysates stained with a anti-NDUFS3 antibody and increased thereafter (Fig. 1A, top panel). Coinciding with the increase of induced protein, endogenous NDUFS3 decreased in time, possibly because of competition, often observed for inducible expression systems (20Yadava N. Houchens T. Potluri P. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12406-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Vogel R.O. Janssen R.J. Ugalde C. Grovenstein M. Huijbens R.J. Visch H.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Willems P.H. Zeviani M. Smeitink J.A. Nijtmans L.G. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5317-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Blue native (BN) PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-NDUFA9 antibody and measurement of in-gel NADH-NBT oxidoreductase activity revealed that expression of NDUFS3-GFP did not alter the amount of fully assembled CI nor its in-gel activity (Fig. 1A, panels CINDUFA9 and CI-IGA). Fig. 1B, depicting a BN PAGE Western blot of mitochondrial lysates at various times after induction probed with anti-EGFP antibody revealed the appearance of monomeric induced NDUFS3-GFP (m), six distinct GFP-labeled subcomplexes (indicated with 1-6), and GFP-labeled fully assembled CI (Fig. 1B, indicated with 7). In combination with the finding that neither the amount nor the activity of CI is altered, this indicates that the labeled subunit is gradually incorporated in the six subcomplexes and the fully assembled complex without disturbing this process or the activity of the holocomplex. mtDNA-encoded Proteins Are Required for the Formation of Subcomplexes Larger than Subcomplex 3—To highlight the role of mtDNAencoded CI subunits (ND subunits) in the appearance of the subcomplexes, production of these subunits was blocked by specifically inhibiting mitochondrial translation with chloramphenicol. Using translation inhibitors such as chloramphenicol or doxycycline has previously been shown to result in strong reduction of mitochondrial translation and thus ND subunit synthesis (14Ugalde C. Vogel R. Huijbens R. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the absence of ND subunits, CI assembly will seize at the point at which incorporation of these subunits is essential for formation of the next assembly intermediate. To obtain steady state labeling of NDUFS3-GFP, we specifically selected a clone with low leakage level (noninduced expression) resulting in steady state labeling. Cell lines were incubated with chloramphenicol for 24, 36, or 60 h (Fig. 2A). Prolonged chloramphenicol incubations induced the specific accumulation of NDUFS3-GFP-labeled subcomplexes 2 and 3 and the disappearance of subcomplex 6 and the holocomplex. This accumulation was paralleled by a decrease in the total amount of CI (as revealed using the CI-NDUFA9 antibody) and a reduced in-gel NADH-NBT oxidoreductase activity (CI-IGA) on a one-dimensional BN PAGE gel. Expression of the nuclear DNA-encoded SDHA subunit of CII was not affected by chloramphenicol treatment (CII-SDHA). These results support the conclusion that CI assembly cannot proceed beyond the formation of subcomplexes 2 and 3 in the absence of ND subunits. Subsequent quantification of the ECL signals of Fig. 2A in Fig. 2C demonstrates that whereas subcomplexes 2 and 3 accumulate 10-20-fold, fully assembled CI decreases only 5-fold. This strongly suggests that subcomplexes 2 and 3 predominantly accumulate because of new synthesis. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that subcomplexes 2 and 3 to some extent also originate from partial CI breakdown or recycling of its constituents. Next, we analyzed the effects of releasing chloramphenicol inhibition on the distribution of NDUFS3-GFP-containing subcomplexes. Contrary to the induction pattern shown in Fig. 1, these conditions do not disturb endogenous NDUFS3 expression (Fig. 2B, bottom panel) and prevent possible saturation of the assembly process because no monomeric NDUFS3-GFP accumulates (Fig. 2B, BN PAGE NDUFS3-GFP signal). Following 60 h of chloramphenicol treatment, the cells were washed and chased for 0, 4, 8, and 18 h (Fig. 2B, time points 0, 4, 8, and 18 h). Reinitiation of mitochondrial translation resulted in a gradual return of CI amount and activity (Fig. 2B, panels CI-NDUFA9 and CI-IGA). Remarkably, subcomplex 1 appeared 4 h after chloramphenicol removal, whereas it was absent from Fig. 2A. In addition, a shift in the NDUFS3-GFP signal occurred from subcomplexes 2 and 3 toward subcomplexes 4-6 and CI. Because subcomplexes 2 and 3 decrease, whereas larger intermediates appear, subcomplexes 2 and 3 must represent products of assembly and not instability. Furthermore, these findings imply that ND subunits are required for the formation of subcomplexes 4-6 and fully assembled CI. Quantification of the ECL signals of Fig. 2B in Fig. 2D demonstrates that, directly after translation progresses, the levels of subcomplexes 2 and 3 rapidly decrease and then reach a rather constant level. This suggests that the accumulated subcomplexes 2 and 3 are rapidly incorporated into higher molecular weight complexes upon active translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits. The comparable kinetics and amounts of the two subcomplexes in Fig. 2 (C and D) suggest that subcomplex 2 reaches a rapid equilibrium with subcomplex 3, which underlines the dynamic nature of the assembly process and allows the possibility that subcomplex 2 originates from subcomplex 3 and vice versa. Composition of CI Subcomplexes—To confirm that the subcomplexes identified using NDUFS3-GFP are also present in wild type HEK293 cells and to determine the composition of these subcomplexes, we used two-dimensional blue native SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and specific immunodetection of CI subunits. Use of two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was essential because this method, in contrast to onedimensional BN PAGE, allowed detection of wild type NDUFS3 protein using a commercially available antibody, likely because the NDUFS3 antibody binds more efficiently to the unfolded protein. Fig. 3A shows that the subcomplexes identified by GFP tagging of the NDUFS3 subunit (Fig. 2B) are also present in two independent isolations of wild type HEK293 mitochondria (see also Table 1). To analyze the composition of these complexes, we performed immunodetection of nine CI subunits (Fig. 3B). Subcomplex 1 is poorly visible, but subcomplexes 2-6 and CI (indicated with 7) can be clearly discriminated. Alignment between the different subunits shows that subcomplexes 2-6 and CI contain the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits with the addition of ND1 in subcomplexes 4-7 and the addition of NDUFA13 in subcomplex 5-7. Close inspection furthermore reveals the “appearance” of an additional subcomplex termed a1 (appearing subcomplex 1) that only contains membrane subunits ND1, NDUFB6, NDUFA13, NDUFA6, and NDUFA1. Composition analysis of subcomplex 6 is difficult because of the close vicinity of CI and a1. OXPHOS complexes II (∼150 kDa), III (600 kDa in dimeric form), IV (∼240 kDa), and V (∼750 kDa) are shown to allow estimation of the sizes of the CI subcomplexes.TABLE 1Immunodetected proteins in this studyOXPHOS complexSubunitCI fraction (bovine)HumanBovineCINDUFS249 kDaIα (Iλ)CINDUFA939 kDaIαCINDUFS330 kDaIα (λ)CIND1ND1IγCINDUFB6B171βCINDUFA13/GRIM19B16.6Iα (Iλ)CINDUFA6B14IαCINDUFA2B8Iα (Iλ)CINDUFA1MWFEIαCIISDHACIIIUQCRC2CIVCOXIICVATPA1 Open table in a new tab Stability of CI Subcomplexes—In principle, BN analysis reveals native CI subcomplexes after detergent-mediated isolation. To determine whether the observed subcomplexes originate from partial CI solubilization, we investigated their presence in wild type HEK293 mitochondria under different, increasingly stringent, concentrations of DDM and digitonin, which are frequently used detergents in the isolation of membrane protein complexes. We performed immunodetection with the same antibodies as depicted in Fig. 3B. For simplicity, Fig. 4A only shows the NDUFS3 and ND1 subunits. The results obtained for the full set of antibodies are shown in supplemental Figs. S1 and S2 and are summarized in Table 2. Core2 was used as a positive control for the effect of solubilization, because it allows investigation of the presence of complex III in various supercomplexes (described in Ref. 25Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar and marked by S1 and S2). In these experiments the yield of subcomplexes 1-6 did not alter, whereas in contrast, CI was increasingly solubilized from supercomplexes with ever more stringent conditions. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the subcomplexes in our NDUFS3-GFP-expressing and wild type HEK293 cells are artifacts of solubilization. On the contrary, subcomplex a1 became more predominant under more stringent solubilization conditions (Fig. 4A, ND1 signal), strongly suggesting that this subcomplex originates from the holocomplex because of solubilization.TABLE 2Overview of the distribution of the NDUFS3 subcomplexes per solubilization conditionSubcomplex 1Subcomplex 2Subcomplex 3Subcomplex 4Subcomplex 5a2a1Subcomplex 6Subcomplex 7 (CI)S1/S2DDM solubilizationNDUFS2A/DXXXXXXDNDUFA9XDNDUFS3A/DXXXXXXDND1XXAXDNDUFB6AXDNDUFA13XAXDNDUFA6AXDNDUFA2XDNDUFA1AXDDigitonin"
https://openalex.org/W1968782838,"Cyclostreptin (1), a natural product from Streptomyces sp. 9885, irreversibly stabilizes cellular microtubules, causes cell cycle arrest, evades drug resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein in a tumor cell line and potently inhibits paclitaxel binding to microtubules, yet it only weakly induces tubulin assembly. In trying to understand this paradox, we observed irreversible binding of synthetic cyclostreptin to tubulin. This results from formation of covalent crosslinks to β-tubulin in cellular microtubules and microtubules formed from purified tubulin in a 1:1 total stoichiometry distributed between Thr220 (at the outer surface of a pore in the microtubule wall) and Asn228 (at the lumenal paclitaxel site). Unpolymerized tubulin was only labeled at Thr220. Thus, the pore region of β-tubulin is an undescribed binding site that (i) elucidates the mechanism by which taxoid-site compounds reach the kinetically unfavorable lumenal site and (ii) explains how taxoid-site drugs induce microtubule formation from dimeric and oligomeric tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2062931536,"Chemical reaction systems operating in nonequilibrium open-system states arise in a great number of contexts, including the study of living organisms, in which chemical reactions, in general, are far from equilibrium. Here we introduce a theorem that relates forward and reverse fluxes and free energy for any chemical process operating in a steady state. This relationship, which is a generalization of equilibrium conditions to the case of a chemical process occurring in a nonequilibrium steady state in dilute solution, provides a novel equivalent definition for chemical reaction free energy. In addition, it is shown that previously unrelated theories introduced by Ussing and Hodgkin and Huxley for transport of ions across membranes, Hill for catalytic cycle fluxes, and Crooks for entropy production in microscopically reversible systems, are united in a common framework based on this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2072811676,"Background Human RNA polymerase III (pol III) transcription is regulated by several factors, including the tumor suppressors P53 and Rb, and the proto-oncogene c-Myc. In yeast, which lacks these proteins, a central regulator of pol III transcription, called Maf1, has been described. Maf1 is required for repression of pol III transcription in response to several signal transduction pathways and is broadly conserved in eukaryotes. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that human endogenous Maf1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with pol III and associates in vitro with two pol III subunits, the largest subunit RPC1 and the α-like subunit RPAC2. Maf1 represses pol III transcription in vitro and in vivo and is required for maximal pol III repression after exposure to MMS or rapamycin, treatments that both lead to Maf1 dephosphorylation. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that Maf1 is a major regulator of pol III transcription in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000303059,"Re-uptake of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into presynaptic specializations is mediated by the GABA transporter 1 (GAT1), a member of the SLC6 gene family. Here, we show that a motif in the COOH terminus of GAT1 (566RL567), which is conserved in SLC6 family members, is a binding site for the COPII coat component Sec24D. We also identified residues in Sec24D (733DD734) that are required to support the interaction with GAT1 and two additional family members, i.e. the transporters for serotonin and dopamine. We used three strategies to prevent recruitment of Sec24D to GAT1: knock-down of Sec24D by RNA interference, overexpression of Sec24D-VN (replacement of 733DD734 by 733VN734), and mutation of 566RL567 to 566AS567 (GAT1-RL/AS). In each instance, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export of GAT1 was impaired: in the absence of Sec24D or upon coexpression of dominant negative Sec24D-VN, GAT1 failed to undergo concentrative ER export; GAT1-RL/AS also accumulated in the ER and exerted a dominant negative effect on cell surface targeting of wild type GAT1. Our observations show that concentrative ER-export is contingent on a direct interaction of GAT1 with Sec24D; this also provides a mechanistic explanation for the finding that oligomeric assembly of transporters is required for their ER export: transporter oligomerization supports efficient recruitment of COPII components.

Its action is terminated by re-uptake into synaptic terminals. This is achieved by the GABA transporter 1 (GAT1), the predominant isoform in the central nervous system. GAT1 belongs to the Na+/Cl--dependent SLC6 gene family, which also includes transporters for serotonin (SERT), dopamine (DAT), and norepinephrine transporter. The turnover number of these transporters is low (i.e. in the range of 10 s-1). Accordingly, the number of active transporters at the cell surface is critical for the duration of synaptic transmission. This is evident from the gene dosage effect in mice engineered to be GAT1-deficient. The absence of one Gat1-allele homozygous suffices to produce phenotypic consequences: heterozygous mice Gat1+/- consume more ethanol, are more responsive to locomotor activation by ethanol, and are more prone to ethanol dependence than their wild type counterparts (1Cai Y.Q. Cai G.Q. Liu G.X. Cai Q. Shi J.H. Shi J. Ma S.K. Sun X. Sheng Z.J. Mei Z.T. Cui D. Guo L. Wang Z. Fei J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Gat1-/- mice, however, suffer from a complex motor disorder that includes abnormal gait, reduced locomotion, and tremor (2Chiu C.S. Brickley S. Jensen K. Southwell A. Mckinney S. Cull-Candy S. Mody I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3234-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It has been widely appreciated that the number of regulatory membrane proteins (that is receptor, transporters, and ion channels) on the surface is controlled by the rate of endocytosis, recycling, and proteosomal/lysosomal degradation (see e.g. Refs. 3Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar and 4Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of ER export has been explored to a lesser extent but there is evidence that the steadystate level of membrane proteins can also be determined by a rate-limiting step at the level of the ER (5Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Originally, it was assumed that folding and quality control was the major determinant for ER (6Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). However, specific ER export motifs were shown to control exit of several membrane proteins from the ER. Two classes of ER export motifs have been identified: diacidic ((D/E)-X-(D/E)) and di-hydrophobic motifs (7Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). More recently, a dibasic export motif ((R/K)X(R/K)) has been recognized in the cytoplasmic tail of glycosyltransferases (8Giraudo C.G. Macconi H.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3757-3766Crossref Google Scholar). ER export motifs mediate interaction with components of the COPII coat, which is composed of the small G-protein, Sar1, the Sec23/24 complex, and the Sec13/31 complex (9Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Sec24 is the subunit that functions as a cargo receptor (9Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Mammals have 4 different isoforms termed Sec24A-D (9Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The differences between these subunits in terms of cargo selectivity are still unknown. This interaction leads to concentration of cargo into ER exit sites. These can be identified by their morphology, i.e. ribosome-free regions of the rough ER that are decorated with clusters of vesicles and tubules. In addition, they stain for components of the COPII coat. Efficient export from the ER is contingent on cargo concentration in ER exit sites: the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) uses a di-acidic motif to exit the ER (10Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Mutation of the motif does not lead to complete retention but results in a 10-fold reduction of the ER export rate (11Nishimura N. Bannykh S. Slabough S. Matteson J. Altschuler Y. Hahn K. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15937-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).

We also located a sequence element composed of 10 amino acids (Leu553-Gln572) in the GAT1 carboxyl terminus, which mediated an interaction with Sec24D (17Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V.

We surmised that the hydrophobic cluster 569VMI571 conformed to a di-hydrophobic ER export (7Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). However, in the current work, we identified 566RL567 as the key residues that mediate binding of GAT1 to SEC24D. This interaction of GAT1 with Sec24D was necessary for cargo concentration and thus determined the level of the transporter at the cell surface. We also show that a mutant transporter, which is unable to interact with Sec24D, exerts a dominant negative effect on the surface expression of the wild type transporter. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ER export requires oligomeric assembly of transporters (12Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), provide for a mechanistic explanation by linking oligomer formation to efficient recruitment of the COPII components, and may be relevant for other membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (18Salahpour A.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Assay for [3H]GABA Uptake—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. For microscopy, 3-6 × 105 cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. Transient transfections were done with the CaPO4 precipitation method. Only in the case of budding assays, cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine® Plus (Invitrogen). Stealth siRNA (200 nm) was mixed with Lipofectamine® 2000 and the cells were incubated with the RNA/lipid mixture overnight. The medium was exchanged on the next day; cytosol was prepared 48 h after transfection. The plasmid encoding shRNA was also transfected using Lipofectamine Plus. Uptake of [3H]GABA was determined as described in detail elsewhere (17Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V. Dorostkar M.M. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28553-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, transiently transfected cells (3 × 105/well) were seeded into 24-well dishes 24 h after transfection; after 12 h, the cells were incubated in the presence of 20 μm [3H]GABA (specific activity ∼70 cpm/pmol) for 3 min; nonspecific uptake was defined as the amount of cell associated radioactivity determined in the presence of 10 μm tiagabine. RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was prepared using the TriReagent® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was used for the reverse transcription with the Superscript™ III One Step RT-PCR kit with Platinum® Taq (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence images were captured at room temperature with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP fx cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Roper Scientific). The fluorescence filters used on this setup were purchased from Chroma (Chroma Technology Corp.). For confocal microscopy cells were examined with a ×40 oil immersion objective with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, HEK293 cells were transfected with mutated versions of CFP-tagged GAT1 and with YFP-tagged Sec24D as indicated in the figure legends. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was measured by evaluating the extent to which fluorescence emitted by CFP increased after bleaching of YFP (DRAP, donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching FRET); the recorded values were converted into FRET efficiency (17Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V. Dorostkar M.M. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28553-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was also recorded on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope. YFP was detected with a long pass 530-nm filter. Transfected cells were examined with an oil immersion objective (40-fold magnification). Circular regions of interest were specified for bleaching and scanning (bleach regions). Before bleaching, a scan was obtained; the area of interest was then bleached with 70 iterations at maximum laser power (30 milliwatt, at 514 nm). Subsequently, pictures were captured (60 scans in 14 s) with about 4% of laser power. The recorded fluorescence intensities were digitized and averaged over the bleach region using ScionImage™ 4.0.2; these values were plotted and subjected to non-linear curve fitting to the equation describing the monoexponential rise to a maximum: y = bottom + (top-bottom) × (1-e-kx), where “bottom” refers to the relative fluorescence intensity immediately after bleaching (before recovery) and “top” to the value that is reached at equilibrium (after recovery). Purification of GST-tagged Proteins and GST Pulldown—The sequences corresponding to the different versions of the GAT1 COOH terminus as well as the COOH terminus of SERT were cloned into the pGEX5 vector. This was used to transform BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli. Bacteria (0.8 liter of liquid culture) were grown to an optical density of ∼1 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 2.5 h. Thereafter cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min. The cell pellet was lysed in GST buffer (25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Lysozyme was added to destroy bacterial membranes for 30 min on ice. After addition of DNase and Triton X-100 (1%) and a further 20-min incubation, the sample was sonicated and left on ice for a further 15 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 1 h and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a GSH-Sepharose column. The column was washed with GST buffer with 1% Triton X-100 followed by GST buffer containing 1 mm ATP. Proteins were eluted with GST buffer containing glutathione (15 mm). Glutathione was removed by repeated cycles of concentration and dilution in a Centricon microconcentrator. Proteins were stored at -80 °C. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding YFP-tagged Sec24D or YFP-tagged Pals-1. After 24 h, cells (8 × 106) were harvested and lysed by sonication in 0.1 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 130 mm KCl); the particulate fraction was removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min). Cytosol (100 μg) was incubated with purified GST-tagged constructs (30 μg)for 2 h on ice. Pre-equilibrated GSH-Sepharose (corresponding to 25 μl of packed beads) was added and samples were incubated for 3 h. Beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed twice with buffer (130 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2). Proteins were eluted by addition of sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and shaking for 5 min at 90 °C. After centrifugation, 50% of the supernatant was loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In Vitro Budding Assay—HEK293 cells in 10-cm culture dishes were transfected with the plasmids specified in the pertinent figure legends using Lipofectamine Plus. After 24 h, cells were permeabilized by a 5-min incubation in hypotonic buffer containing 18 mm KOAc and 18 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2; these cells are referred to as semi-intact cells. The budding reaction was done according to Xu and Hay (33Xu D.L. Hay J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with the following adaptations: the reaction mixture consisted of 25 μl of semi-intact cells (8 × 105 cells/reaction), 60 μl of cytosol (3-4 μg/μl), 20 μl of buffer (18 mm CaOAc, 50 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2), 5 μl of 0.1 m MgOAc, 22 μl of H2O, 58 μl of 25/125 buffer (125 mm KOAc, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2), and 10 μl of GMP-P(NH)P (final concentration, 20 μm). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C with mild shaking for 100 min. Cells were harvested at 1,500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 30 μl of 25/70 buffer (70 mm KOAc, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2) to induce cell swelling and re-permeabilization, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant represented the vesicular fraction although the pellet contained heavier membranes (e.g. ER, Golgi, etc.). Proteins were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (diluted 1:300 in TBST) was added for 1 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-tagged anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:10,000 in TBST with 5% milk) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (reagents from Amersham Biosciences). If the formation of punctate structures by GAT1-SSS was to be visualized microscopically, the same conditions were maintained with the exception that 25 μl of 25/90 buffer was used instead of cells and the reaction was performed in the presence of an ATP-regeneration system (5 mm creatine phosphate, 4 ng/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP). The cytosol employed in these complementation experiments was prepared from control cells and from appropriately transfected cells (4 × 107) by sonication in 0.4 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 130 mm KCl). The particulate material was removed by centrifugation (70 min at 40,000 × g). Identification of the Sec24 Binding Motif in the COOH Terminus of GAT1—Previously, we showed that mutation of the 569VMI571 motif to serines (GAT1-SSS) led to intracellular retention of the transporter (17Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V. Dorostkar M.M. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28553-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus we first suspected that 569VMI5711 represented the Sec24D-interaction motif. However, the results of our FRET microscopy experiments clearly showed that GAT1-SSS still interacted with Sec24D (Fig. 1B). In search for a conserved sequence element proximal to the 569VMI5711 we found the 566RL567 motif that was conserved among all members of the Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (Fig. 1A). Mutation of 566RL567 to alanine and serine (GAT1-RL/AS) disrupted the interaction with Sec24D (Fig. 1B), although the mutant transporter accumulated in the ER, i.e. the site of Sec24D recruitment (see below). Because 566RL567 is conserved among SLC6 family members, all family members ought to bind Sec24D. The interaction between cargo and Sec24D takes place in the ER. Accordingly, the transporter of interest must be trapped in the ER: if the leucine repeat in transmembrane segment 2 of GAT1 is disrupted by substitution with alanines, the resulting GAT1-L2A is defective in oligomerization and retained in the ER (12Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This mutant still interacts with Sec24D (17Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V. Dorostkar M.M. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28553-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We introduced an analogous mutation in the leucine heptad repeat of the DAT; disruption of the leucine heptad repeat of DAT also leads to retention of the resulting mutants in the ER (13Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and abolishes oligomer formation (not shown). We therefore selected DAT-L2A as an ER export-deficient mutant of DAT to verify that binding of Sec24D was not restricted to GAT1 but a presumably more general phenomenon. We observed a robust FRET signal between Sec24D and DAT-L2A. Energy transfer was comparable in magnitude to that recorded with GAT1-SSS (Fig. 1B). We verified the interaction by GST pulldown assays. GST-tagged GAT1 COOH termini (wild type and mutated versions) were incubated with cytosolic lysates from HEK293 cells overexpressing YFP-Sec24D. In agreement with our FRET experiments, the wild type and the GAT1-SSS COOH terminus pulled down Sec24D from cytosol (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the COOH terminus bearing the RL/AS mutation did not bind Sec24D. The COOH terminus of the SERT bears little similarity with that of GAT1 with the notable exception of a RI motif that is reminiscent of the RL motif in GAT1 (Fig. 1A). The COOH terminus of SERT also interacted with Sec24D (Fig. 1C). We ruled out that the lack of Sec24D binding by GST-RL/AS was due to a mutation-induced misfolding of the COOH terminus by carrying out pulldown experiments with YFP-Pals1, a protein that interacts with the last three amino acids of GAT1 (19McHugh E.M. Zhu W. Milgram S. Mager S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both GST-RL/AS as well as GST-SSS interacted with Pals1 (Fig. 1C). Identification of the Motif on Sec24D Responsible for the Interaction with the GAT1 COOH Terminus—Three cargo binding sites have been discovered in Sec24p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 21Mossessova E. Bickford L.C. Goldberg J. Cell. 2003; 114: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To determine the interaction motif on Sec24D, we compared the sequence of Sec24p and Sec24D and used the published crystal structure for guidance. We reasoned that a potential interaction motif ought to be: (i) exposed on the surface of Sec24, (ii) located near the equator of the bowtieshaped Sec23-Sec24 dimer, and (iii) acidic as it potentially has to interact with an arginine in the RL motif. The most likely motif was 601DE602 in Sec24p, which corresponds to 733DD734 in human Sec24D (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutating these residues to valine and asparagine (Sec24D-VN) resulted in a pronounced reduction in the capability to interact with GST-SSS (Fig. 2C). Neither wild type nor mutated Sec24D interacted with GST-RL/AS. This is unlikely due to a toxic effect of the mutant as it showed the same subcellular staining pattern as wild type Sec24D (i.e. still labeled ER exit sites). In addition to its cellular staining pattern, Sec24D-VN (like wild type Sec24D) interacts with Sec23 (Fig. 2E), the obligatory dimeric partner of Sec24. Sec24D Is Required for ER Export of GAT1 in Vitro—Interaction of cargo with Sec24 is expected to drive its export from the ER. To test directly whether ER export of GAT1 was dependent on Sec24D we performed in vitro budding assays. In mammalian cells, these assays are challenging, because it is difficult to trap sufficient amounts of cargo in the ER. The only exception is VSVG-tsO45: this mutant is temperature-sensitive and, hence, affords efficient trapping in the ER at the restrictive temperature (40 °C). This approach is not available for GAT1. We therefore resorted to a strategy that relies on co-expression of Sar1a-T39N. This GDP-restricted form of Sar1 disrupts COPII formation in a dominant negative manner. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding YFP-tagged wild type GAT1 and Sar1a-T39N, which caused retention of the transporter in the ER. The cells were permeabilized to remove the cytosol and hence Sar1a-T39N. This was replaced by adding cytosol prepared from untransfected HEK293 cells (i.e. containing wild type Sar1a) and GMP-P(NH)P to initiate a budding reaction on ice or at 37 °C. Budding results in the release of small vesicles, which are not retrieved by medium speed centrifugation. Accordingly, immunoreactivity for cargo, i.e. GAT1, is found in the supernatant. If the reaction was incubated on ice, low amounts of GAT1 were detected in the supernatant (Fig. 3A). Upon incubation at 37 °C, GAT1 was released into the supernatant (Fig. 3A). As a control, we trapped the reference protein VSVG-tsO45 with Sar1a-T39N in the ER; budding of VSVG-tsO45 was also readily detectable at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). If the complementation was done with cytosol prepared from cells that overexpressed Sec24D-VN, release of GAT1 into the supernatant was substantially reduced regardless of whether the assay was done on ice or at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). We ruled out that the action of Sec24D-VN was due to a nonspecific action by examining its effect on budding of VSVG-tsO45. ER export of VSVG-tsO45 is controlled by a di-acidic motif, which mediates the interaction with the pre-budding complex (11Nishimura N. Bannykh S. Slabough S. Matteson J. Altschuler Y. Hahn K. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15937-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For obvious reasons, it is unlikely that a di-acidic motif binds to the 733DD734 motif in Sec24D. Accordingly, VSVG-tsO45 was released from the ER at 37 °C at a level comparable with the reaction with control cytosol (Fig. 3A). A sequence comparison (Fig. 2A) shows that the di-acidic motif of Sec24D (733DD734) is present in all other mammalian Sec24 isoforms. This implies that binding to the COOH terminus of GAT1 is not restricted to Sec24D. HEK293 cells endogenously express Sec24A, -C, and -D (Fig. 3B). To determine whether other isoforms can substitute for Sec24D, we performed in vitro budding assays using cytosol depleted of Sec24D. Sec24D was knocked down using an siRNA that did not affect expression of Sec24A and Sec24C (Fig. 3B). We verified that the drop in Sec24D mRNA translated into a drop of protein levels. Antibodies to Sec24D are not available. Accordingly, we transiently expressed YFP-Sec24D and tested if the pertinent siRNA down-regulated immunoreactivity detected by an anti-GFP antiserum. The Sec24D-specific siRNA strongly reduced expression of the fusion protein, whereas the control siRNA did not (Fig. 3C). If the vesicle budding reaction was performed with a cytosol depleted of Sec24D, budding of GAT1 was strongly reduced compared with cytosol prepared from cells transfected with a control siRNA (Fig. 3A). Transfection of siRNA into cells requires the use of liposome-based transfection methods. Under these conditions, cells ingest large amounts of lipids and this may perturb the secretory pathway. We ruled out that the observed effect in the budding assay was due to lipofection by using a shRNA against Sec24D as an alternative approach. The shRNA can be introduced into cells by using the transfection method relying on calcium-phosphate precipitation. By employing the approach outlined above for the siRNA, we verified that the shRNA against Sec24D was effective (Fig. 3D). Cytosol prepared from cells, in wh"
https://openalex.org/W2108393999,"Recent observations demonstrated that translation of mRNAs may occur in axonal processes at sites that are long distances away from the neuronal perikaria. While axonal protein synthesis has been documented in several studies, the mechanism of its regulation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether RNA interference (RNAi) may be one of the pathways that control local protein synthesis in axons. Here we show that sciatic nerve contains Argonaute2 nuclease, fragile X mental retardation protein, p100 nuclease, and Gemin3 helicase-components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Application of short-interfering RNAs against neuronal beta-tubulin to the sciatic nerve initiated RISC formation, causing a decrease in levels of neuronal beta-tubulin III mRNA and corresponding protein, as well as a significant reduction in retrograde labeling of lumbar motor neurons. Our observations indicate that RNAi is functional in peripheral mammalian axons and is independent from the neuronal cell body or Schwann cells. We introduce a concept of local regulation of axonal translation via RNAi."
https://openalex.org/W2160980199,"Recent characterization of the ability of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) to reduce ATP production and inhibit insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells has placed this mitochondrial protein as a candidate target for therapeutics in diabetes mellitus. In the present study we evaluate the effects of short-term treatment of two animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus with an antisense oligonucleotide to UCP2. In both models, Swiss mice (made obese and diabetic by a hyperlipidic diet) and ob/ob mice, the treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the hyperglycemic syndrome. This effect was due not only to an improvement of insulin secretion, but also to improved peripheral insulin action. In isolated pancreatic islets, the partial inhibition of UCP2 increased ATP content, followed by increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This was not accompanied by increased expression of enzymes involved in protection against oxidative stress. The evaluation of insulin action in peripheral tissues revealed that the inhibition of UCP2 expression significantly improved insulin signal transduction in adipose tissue. In conclusion, short-term inhibition of UCP2 expression ameliorates the hyperglycemic syndrome in two distinct animal models of obesity and diabetes. Metabolic improvement is due to a combined effect on insulin-producing pancreatic islets and in at least one peripheral tissue that acts as a target for insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2016081191,"We investigated regulation of the type 1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger by phosphorylation. Four specific groups of serine and threonine residues in the regulatory carboxyl-terminal tail were mutated to alanine residues: group 1, S693A; group 2, T718A and S723A/S726A/S729A; group 3, S766A/S770A/S771A; and group 4, T779A and S785A. The proteins were expressed in Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient cells, and the activity was characterized. All of the mutants had proper expression, localization, and normal basal activity relative to wild type NHE1. Sustained intracellular acidosis was used to activate NHE1 via an ERK-dependent pathway that could be blocked with the MEK inhibitor U0126. Immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled Na+/H+ exchanger from intact cells showed that sustained intracellular acidosis increased Na+/H+ exchanger phosphorylation in vivo. This was blocked by U0126. The Na+/H+ exchanger activity of mutants 1 and 2 was stimulated similar to wild type Na+/H+ exchanger. Mutant 4 showed a partially reduced level of activation. However, mutant 3 was not stimulated by sustained intracellular acidosis, and loss of stimulation of activity correlated to a loss of sustained acidosis-mediated phosphorylation in vivo. Mutation of the individual amino acids within mutant 3, Ser766, Ser770, and Ser771, showed that Ser770 and Ser771 are responsible for mediating increases in NHE1 activity through sustained acidosis.

The ERK-dependent pathway was activated in several models of ischemic heart disease, and this resulted in further activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in the myocardium (12Moor A. Gan X.T. Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 16113-16122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that ERK phosphorylates the NHE1 cytosolic domain at one or more of the following amino acids, Ser693, Ser766, Ser770, Thr779, and Ser785 (13Liu H. Stupak J. Zheng J. Keller B.O. Brix B.J. Fliegel L. Li L. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in vitro. In another report we also showed that amino acids Thr717, Ser722, Ser725, and Ser728 are phosphorylated in vitro by a p38 MAP kinase-dependent pathway (14Khaled A.R. Moor A.N. Li A. Kim K. Ferris D.K. Muegge K. Fisher R.J. Fliegel L. Durum S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7545-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this report, we characterized the role of these amino acids in the ERK-dependent pathway of phosphorylation and regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Our results are the first to define and elucidate this mechanism of regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The MEK inhibitor U0126 was from Sigma. Anti-HA antibody (Y-11), anti-MAP kinase ERK1, ERK2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, and anti-p90RSK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-p90RSK was from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Pierce. [32P]Orthophosphate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 2′,7-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5(6) carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All of the other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Fisher, Sigma, or BDH (Toronto, Canada).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in the cytosolic tail of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger were made to an expression plasmid containing a HA-tagged human NHE1. The plasmid pYN4+ contains the cDNA of the entire coding region of NHE1 (15Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using amplification with PWO DNA polymerase followed by use of the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer. Mutations were designed to create a new restriction enzyme site for use in screening transformants. Mutations were made to four regions of the cytosolic regulatory domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger (see Fig. 1). The mutants were as follows (only one of each primer pair is shown): Mutant 1, S693A, 5′-GCCCACAAGCTTGACGCACCCACCATG-3′; Mutant 2, T718A/S723/726/729A, 5′-ATCGACCCGGCTGCCCCGCAGGCACCCGAGGCTGTAGATCTGGTGAAT-3′ and 5′-AAGGAGGACCTACCGGTCATCGCCATCGACCCGGCT-3′; Mutant 3, S766/770/771A, 5′-GCATCATGATGCGGGCCAAGGAGACTGCAGCCCCAGGAACCGAC-3′; Mutant 4, T779A/S785A, 5′-CCGACGATGTCTTCGCCCCCGCCCCGAGTGACGCCCCCAGCTCCCAG-3′, (underlined residues indicate newly introduced restriction sites). Site-specific mutagenesis was also done on individual amino acids Ser766, Ser770, and Ser771 using the following primers: CATCATGATGCGGGCCAAGGAGACTAGTTCCCCAGGAACCG, GGAGCAAGGAGACTGCTAGCCCAGGAACCGACG, and GCAAGGAGACTTCGGCCCCGGGAACCGACGATG, respectively. DNA sequencing was by the DNA core services laboratory of the Department of Biochemistry to confirm the accuracy of the mutations and the fidelity of the product.Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—AP-1 cells that lack an endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger were used to examine NHE1 activity. Stable cell lines were made of all mutants by transfection with Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent as described earlier (15Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cells were selected using 800 μg/ml geneticin (G418), and stable cell lines were regularly re-established from frozen stocks at passage numbers between 5 and 15 whenever necessary. For some experiments the MEK inhibitor U0126 was included (10 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide). The inhibitor was included in normal Na+-containing medium for 10 min prior to NHE1 assay and in all subsequent steps.To examine in vivo phosphorylation of NHE1 proteins AP-1 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes. One day prior to experimentation, the cells were incubated in complete α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine growth serum overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The day of experimentation the media was replaced with phosphate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% bovine growth serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 30 min. The medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml of the same medium, to which H 323PO4 was added to a final concentration of 100 μCi/ml medium. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Immunoblot analysis using anti-HA antibody was used to confirm NHE1 expression in samples from total cell lysates of AP-1 cells. The cell lysates were made as described earlier (12Moor A. Gan X.T. Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 16113-16122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Slepkov E.R. Chow S. Lemieux M.J. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis equal amounts of each sample (50 μg of total protein) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and immunostained with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio/Can, Mississauga, Canada). The Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting and detection system was used to detect immunoreactive proteins on x-ray film. Densitometric analysis of x-ray films was carried out using ImageJ 1.35s software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).Cell Surface Expression—Cell surface expression was measured as described earlier (15Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly described, the cells were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce), and immobilized streptavidin resin was used to remove surface-labeled Na+/H+ exchanger. Equal amounts of the total and unbound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting against the HA tag. Relative amounts of NHE1 on the cell surface were calculated by comparing both the 110- and 95-kDa forms of NHE1.Na+/H+ Exchange Activity—Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured using a PTI Deltascan spectrofluorometer. The initial rate of Na+-induced recovery of cytosolic pH (pHi) was measured after acute acid load using 2′,7-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5(6) carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc.) as described earlier (15Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ammonium chloride (50 mm × 3 min.) was used to transiently induce an acid load. The coverslip was then removed from the NH4Cl containing buffer and placed in a Na+-free buffer (135 mm N-methyl glucamine, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) for ∼30 s or until the pHi had reached a minimum, at which point the coverslip was removed and placed in a normal Na+ buffer (135 mm NaCl) and allowed to recover for 3 min. There were no differences in buffering capacities of stable cell lines as indicated by the degree of acidification induced by ammonium chloride applications (not shown). Following the pHi recovery, a three-point pH calibration using Na+-free calibration buffers (135 mm N-methyl glucamine, 135 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, at pH 6, 7, and 8) was completed. For some experiments we used a two-pulse assay to induce prolonged intracellular acidosis (17Haworth R.S. McCann C. Snabaitis A.K. Roberts N.A. Avkiran M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31676-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and to stimulate ERK-dependent pathways and the activity of NHE1. For these experiments the cells were initially acidified with ammonium chloride as described above and then immediately allowed to recover in normal Na+-containing medium. The cells were then acidified with a second ammonium chloride pulse either with or without a 3-min period in Na+-free medium. Following pHi recovery in Na+ normal buffer, a three-point calibration was completed.The NHE1 protein activity was determined by measuring the slope of the first linear 20 s of the recovery period and was expressed as ΔpH/s. To calculate the effect of the stimulatory treatment, the rate of recovery for the first pulse was set at 100%, and the rate of recovery of the second pulse was expressed as a percentage relative to the first pulse. Using the percentage values of the second pulse, we compared the effect of sustained acidosis-treated cells to control treated cells (cells that had no sustained acidosis and immediate recovery after the second ammonium chloride induced acidification). The results are shown as the means ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using a Mann-Whitney U test.Immunoprecipitation of NHE1 Protein—Cell lysates were used for the immunoprecipitation of exogenously expressed NHE1 from AP-1 cells. The lysates were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of 100 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min in detergent-containing radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (12Moor A. Gan X.T. Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 16113-16122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After removal of beads by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 1.4 μg/ml of an anti-HA antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were blocked in detergent-containing radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. The blocking solution was removed by centrifugation, and a sample with HA antibody was added and rotated end-over-end overnight at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged to remove the supernatant, and after washing the bound protein was eluted from the washed beads by incubating with 45 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. After SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and radioactivity was detected by exposure of x-ray film. Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody was used to check the level of NHE1 in the samples and correct for any variation in immunoprecipitation efficiency. The results are the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments, and statistical significance was determined using a Mann-Whitney U test.RESULTSWe initially produced a number of mutations to the NHE1 cytosolic regulatory domain that could be used to provide in vivo analysis of effects on the regulation and activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Our mutants were in four locations in the cytosolic domain (Fig. 1). Mutants 1, 3, and 4 were chosen because our recent results have shown that ERK can phosphorylate one or more of the specific amino acids chosen in these regions in vitro (13Liu H. Stupak J. Zheng J. Keller B.O. Brix B.J. Fliegel L. Li L. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutant 2 was made because of our recent results showing that phosphorylation within these amino acids is involved in p38 mitogen-activated phosphorylation of NHE1 (14Khaled A.R. Moor A.N. Li A. Kim K. Ferris D.K. Muegge K. Fisher R.J. Fliegel L. Durum S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7545-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).To study the effect of these mutations, we made stable cell lines of control and mutant NHE1 proteins in AP-1 cells that lack their own endogenous NHE1 protein. At least two stable cell lines were made of each protein type. Fig. 2 illustrates some of the characteristics of each type of protein. The mutants displayed varying levels of expression and cell surface targeting, but all were functionally active at levels that were similar to that of controls (Fig. 2C). The expression levels varied from 40 to 118% of that of the wild type Na+/H+ exchanger (Fig. 2A). AP-1 cells that were either mock or untransfected showed no HA tag immunoreactivity and no NHE1 activity. Our laboratory has earlier observed that with protein mistargeting, the NHE1 protein may be found predominantly as an 85-kDa protein that is bereft of glycosylation (15Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Li X. Liu Y. Cheng F.J. Lindhout D.A. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17863-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This was not the case with these mutant proteins because the majority of the immunoreactive species were present as the larger size of about 105 kDa. We also examined the surface targeting of the various mutants. We found (Fig. 2B) that all targeted to the plasma membrane in amounts similar to that of the wild type. 69% of the wild type NHE1 protein was at the cell surface, whereas 45–81% of the expressed mutant protein targeted to the plasma membrane.FIGURE 2Characterization of wild type and mutant NHE1 proteins in AP-1 cells. A, Western blot analysis of cell extracts from control and stably transfected AP-1 cells. Cell extracts were prepared from control (AP-1) cells and from cells stably transfected with cDNA coding for HA-tagged cells: wild type NHE1 (Wt), mutants 1–4 contained mutations as described for Fig. 1. The numbers indicate values relative to the wild type and are the means ± S.E. of at least three determinations. B, subcellular trafficking of NHE1 proteins. The cells were treated with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, solubilized, and biotin-labeled proteins were bound to streptavidin-agarose beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A sample of the total cell lysate (T) and an equivalent amount of unbound lysate (I, intracellular) were run on SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was with an anti-HA antibody to identify NHE1 protein. The numbers indicate the percentage of surface protein and are the means ± S.E. of at least three determinations. C, NHE activity was measured after transient induction of acute acid load as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means ± S.E. of at least four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We initially characterized the effect of sustained acidosis on NHE1 activity and on ERK1/2 and p90RSK (Fig. 3). AP-1 cells expressing wild type NHE1 were subjected to dual ammonium chloride prepulse, with or without sustained intracellular acidosis. The rate of recovery of the two pulses is indicated. In cells that were not subjected to sustained intracellular acidosis, the second recovery was equivalent to the first. In cells that were subjected to sustained acidosis, the second rate of recovery was significantly elevated relative to the first (Fig. 3A). Because ERK-dependent pathways were reported to be activated by sustained intracellular acidosis (17Haworth R.S. McCann C. Snabaitis A.K. Roberts N.A. Avkiran M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31676-31684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we confirmed that this pathway was activated (Fig. 3, B–D). Sustained acidosis resulted in significant activation of both ERK2 and p90RSK. ERK1 was not significantly activated. The reason for the lack of activation was not clear but could be due to difficulty in quantification of the smaller amount of immunoreactive protein of this type.FIGURE 3Characterization of sustained acidosis activation of NHE1 activity and ERK-dependent pathways. A, AP-1 cells expressing wild type NHE1 were subjected to dual ammonium chloride prepulse with or without sustained intracellular acidosis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rate of recovery for each acid pulse was determined, and the values of the second pulse were compared with those of the first. Control indicates the second pulse was in the absence of sustained intracellular acidosis. Stim indicates the second pulse administered sustained acidosis. The results are the means ± S.E. of at least 10 separate assays. * indicates that the value of the second pulse is significantly higher than that of the control at p > 0.05. B, representative Western blots of p90RSK from control or sustained acidosis-treated cells. Upper panel, cells blotted with anti-phospho-P90RSK antibody. Lower panel, corresponding Western blot with anti-p90RSK antibody. C, representative Western blots of ERK1/2 from control or sustained acidosis-treated cells. Upper panel, cells blotted with anti-phospho-ERK antibody. Lower panel, corresponding Western blot with anti-p90RSK antibody. D, summary of kinase activation by sustained intracellular acidosis. The levels of activated kinase are expressed relative to the levels of controls. The results are the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments. * indicates significantly higher than control at p > 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We examined the effects on NHE1 activity and phosphorylation level following an acute acid load in the presence of U0126 (Fig. 4). To assess the effect on NHE1 activity, four two-pulse activity assay treatments were completed: a control two-pulse assay plus Me2SO, a stimulatory two-pulse assay plus Me2SO, a control two-pulse assay plus 10 μm U0126 in Me2SO, and a stimulatory two-pulse assay plus 10 μm U0126 in Me2SO. The rate of pHi recovery for the first and second pulse of each set of treatments was compared, with the first pulse of each set of treatments set at 100% and the second pulse rate of pHi recovery expressed as a percentage relative to it. The results are shown in Fig. 4A, which illustrates the NHE1 activity of the second pulse relative to the first. In the absence of U0126 there is a statistically significant increase of 67% in NHE1 activity following sustained intracellular acidosis. Control cells did not show a difference in NHE1 activity between the first and second pulses in the presence of Me2SO. In contrast, in the presence of 10 μm U0126, there was no longer an increase in exchanger activity following sustained intracellular acidosis. Both the control and stimulatory treatment in the presence of U0126 resulted in no significant increase in NHE1 activity during the second recovery from acidosis.FIGURE 4Effect of U0126 on sustained intracellular acidosis activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. A, AP-1 cells expressing wild type NHE1 were subjected to dual ammonium chloride prepulse with or without sustained intracellular acidosis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rate of recovery for each acid pulse was determined, and the values of the second pulse are shown relative to those of the first. Control indicates that the second pulse was in the absence of sustained intracellular acidosis. Stim indicates the second pulse administered sustained acidosis. - or + indicates the presence or absence of 10 μm U0126. The results are the means ± S.E. of at least six separate assays. * indicates the value of the second pulse is significantly higher than that of the control at p > 0.01. B and C, effect of sustained acidosis on NHE1 phosphorylation. Cells containing HA-tagged NHE1 were subjected to either control or sustained acidosis (Stim) in the presence or absence of U0126 after incubation in [32P]orthophosphate-containing medium. NHE1 was immunoprecipitated and samples were examined by autoradiography. B, example of autoradiogram of 110-kDa NHE1 protein. C, analysis of stimulated/control ratio of Phospho-NHE1 levels in immunoprecipitates. The samples were corrected for immunoprecipitate protein levels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means of at least five independent experiments. * indicates significantly different at p > 0.05, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney rank sum test or Mann-Whitney U test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess the effect of MEK inhibition on NHE1 phosphorylation, four sets of experiments were completed: a control treatment, a stimulatory treatment, a control treatment plus 10 μm U0126 in Me2SO, a stimulatory treatment plus 10 μm U0126 in Me2SO. The phosphorylation levels of each treatment were corrected for loading, and the level of phospho-NHE1 after positive stimulation was plotted (Fig. 4, b and c). In the absence of the MEK inhibitor, U0126, the stimulated/control ratio of phospho-NHE1 was 1.7 ± 0.3, whereas in the presence of 10 μm U0126, the ratio was 0.97 ± 0.08. The phospho-NHE1 ratio in the presence of the inhibitor was significantly lower than that observed for phospho-NHE1 in the absence of the inhibitor.To assess the effect of mutations of phosphorylation sites of the NHE1 cytoplasmic domain, we examined NHE1 stimulatory activity and NHE1 phosphorylation levels following sustained intracellular acidosis. Four sets of mutant NHE1 proteins were examined with mutations at phosphorylation sites in the cytosolic domain of the NHE1 protein (Fig. 1). Each mutant was subjected to either control or sustained acidosis treatment, and the rate of recovery following an acid load was compared. The results (Fig. 5A) demonstrate that mutants 1 and 2 have a level of stimulation that is the same as the wild type NHE1 protein. Mutant 4 has lower level of stimulation; however, it still is not significantly different from wil"
https://openalex.org/W1965331176,"The conformational transition of the human prion protein from an α-helical to a β-sheet-rich structure is believed to be the critical event in prion pathogenesis. The molecular mechanism of misfolding and the role of intermediate states during this transition remain poorly understood. To overcome the obstacle of insolubility of amyloid fibrils, we have studied a β-sheet-rich misfolded isoform of the prion protein, the β-oligomer, which shares some structural properties with amyloid, including partial proteinase resistance. We demonstrate here that the β-oligomer can be studied by solution-state NMR spectroscopy and obtain insights into the misfolding mechanism via its transient monomeric precursor. It is often assumed that misfolding into β-sheet-rich isoforms proceeds via a compatible precursor with a β-sheet subunit structure. We show here, on the contrary, evidence for an almost natively α-helix-rich monomeric precursor state with molten globule characteristics, converting in vitro into the β-oligomer. We propose a possible mechanism for the formation of the β-oligomer, triggered by intermolecular contacts between constantly rearranging structures. It is concluded that the β-oligomer is not preceded by precursors with β-sheet structure but by a partially unfolded clearly distinguishable α-helical state.

The misfolding of the prion protein is the cause of several fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals (1Prusiner S.B. Trends Biochem.

Among these are scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle and, in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru. These diseases are associated with the misfolding of the α-helix-rich cellular prion PrPC 3The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; PrPC, cellular isoform of PrP; PrPSc, scrapie (proteinase-resistant) PrP isoform; HuPrP90–231, recombinant prion protein fragment 90–231; αN, native state of PrP; βO, β-oligomer state of PrP; αi, intermediate state formed during oligomerization of βO; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; sec-HPLC, size exclusion HPLC; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate; PFG, pulsed field gradient; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. protein to the β-sheet-rich, PrPSc form (1Prusiner S.B.

The native state of PrPC is represented by that of the 19.8-kDa protein (residues 89–231), which consists of three α-helices and a short anti-parallel β-sheet (4Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) and will be denoted here as αN. The mechanism of conversion of αN to the pathogenic PrPSc form remains unclear, although it is now known that it occurs post-translationally without detectable covalent modifications (5Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The transformation requires a substantial change of conformation from an α-helix-rich monomer to a β-sheet-rich amyloid structure. In vitro, αN can be converted into a variety of stable non-native structures with high β-sheet content (6Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol.

Different solution conditions can induce different structures, one of which is the β-oligomer, βO, first described by Baskakov et al. (6Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The βO state is formed under mildly denaturing and acidic conditions similar to those found in endocytic vesicles in humans. Some of the biophysical properties of βO are similar to PrPSc: high β-sheet content, protease K resistance with slightly different cleavage sites (8Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P.

In contrast to PrPSc, βO is soluble, monodisperse, and does not bind thioflavin T (6Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol.

Importantly, βO is not a template for the formation of PrPSc;on the contrary, it is a very stable long-lived macromolecular assembly, the formation of which proceeds through a pathway that competes with amyloid formation (6Baskakov I.V.

Chem. 2006; 281: 34171-34178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the polymorphism at codon 129 was shown to exhibit a measurable effect on the kinetics of formation of βO. It was further shown that βO formed from an equimolar mixture of valine 129 and methionine 129 PrP is very refractory to amyloid formation when compared with homogeneous protein of either allelic form. As heterozygosity at this position is associated epidemiologically with lower rates of prion disease, it was inferred that βO might have an adaptive role by sequestering PrP away from the pathway of amyloid formation. The key to understanding the mechanism of the conformational transition from α-helical to β-sheet structure is the identification of precursors. Among the hypotheses concerning the nature of the possible precursors of PrPSc, an early model due to Cohen et al. (11Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) discusses the possibility of a partially unfolded intermediate whose formation and conversion into PrPSc could be promoted by an irreversible reaction with insoluble PrPSc. Similarly, the formation of the off pathway βO involves a dramatic change of secondary structure (6Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Others have hypothesized about the existence of weakly populated intermediates during the oligomerization process of βO but could not enrich or stabilize such a species (12Sokolowski F. Modler A.J. Masuch R. Zirwer D. Baier M. Lutsch G. Moss D.A. Gast K. Naumann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40481-40492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One of the key questions is the structural nature of such an intermediate and whether at an early stage it adopts a β-sheet structure or remains α-helicalrich. To this end, we have studied the oligomerization process during the formation of βO where we have identified and partially characterized a precursor state, αi. Protein Expression and Purification—Escherichia coli expression of recombinant human PrP was performed as described previously (9Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 90–231 fragment of the PRNP gene was cloned into the pTrcHis2B vector incorporating a C-terminal His tag (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Cells were grown in a minimal medium with 15NH4Cl as the sole source of nitrogen for fully 15N-labeled protein. The purification was performed as described previously (9Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and stocks of highly purified proteins were kept in a storage buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). The protein was fully oxidized as judged by reverse phase chromatography, and the integrity of the samples was further analyzed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). The oxidation state is of particular importance with respect to previously reported and potentially controversial observations of reversible monomeric β-sheet-rich structures (13Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 14Maiti N.R. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2427-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The data presented here are solely for the allelomorph HuPrP90–231 Val129. Studies of direct refolding show that the Val129 allelomorph oligomerizes more slowly to βO than Met129 (9Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other than that, the mutation at position 129 has no measurable effect on the folding, dynamics, or stability of PrPC (15Hosszu L.L. Jackson G.S. Trevitt C.R. Jones S. Batchelor M. Bhelt D.

Size-exclusion HPLC Preparation of αN and αi—We used sec-HPLC to refold the protein to either the native state αN or the precursor αi. To form αN and αi, 0.8 mg of protein denatured in 100 μl of storage buffer was injected onto a TSK®-Gel SWXL G3000 HPLC column (7.8 × 300 mm, Phenomenex, Maccles-field, UK), equilibrated with either αN buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 m urea, and 0.02% azide) or buffer A (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 200 mm sodium chloride, 1 m urea, and 0.02% azide), as appropriate. The peak corresponding to monomeric proteins at 9.04 min of retention time was manually collected (see also Fig. 1, a and b). For NMR studies, up to five runs were collected, pooled, and concentrated (Amicon Ultra-4, 10,000 molecular weight cut-off, Millipore, Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland) to final protein concentrations of 0.8 and 0.2 mm for αN and αi, respectively. All sec-HPLC separations were performed at room temperature with a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 by means of a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HPLC system composed of a Series 200 pump and a diode array detector 235C controlled by Total Chrome software version 6.2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Seer Green, UK), through a PE Nelson 600 series link. The eluent was monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm. β-Oligomer (βO) Formation by Dialysis—As described previously (9Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), βO was formed by dialyzing 0.5 ml of GuHCl-denatured protein (14.8 mg ml-1) at room temperature for 24 h, twice against 2 liters of 2 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.6, and once against βO buffer (1 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.6, 0.02% sodium azide). We used a Slide-A-Lyser dialysis cassette (Perbio Science UK Ltd., Tattenhall, UK) with a 10-kDa cut-off. 1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Fluorolog®-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon Ltd., Stanmore, Middlesex, UK) in 5-mm path length quartz cells (Hellma Cells Inc., Jamaica, NY). The fluorescence of ANS was monitored between 400 and 600 nm with excitation at 385 nm as described previously (6Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). All samples were measured with protein and ANS concentrations of 1 and 100 μm, respectively. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco-720 spectrometer at room temperature with the following parameters for far UV and near UV spectra, respectively: cell path 0.1 cm, speed 50 or 100 nm min-1, bandwidth 2.0 or 1.0 nm, resolution 1.0 or 0.5 nm, and a response time of 4 or 1 s, averaged over 4 or 16 scans. Far and near UV spectra were measured in βO buffer (protein concentration 40 and 550 μm), αN buffer (protein concentration 50 and 780 μm), and buffer A (protein concentration 22 and 440 μm) for βO, αN, and αi, respectively (the buffer compositions are specified above). The amount of helical structure was calculated using the Chen algorithm (16Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Pulsed Field Gradient NMR Diffusion Spectroscopy—PFG NMR diffusion measurements were performed at 20 °C on a home-built spectrometer with a 1H operating frequency of 600.20 MHz. The pulsed gradient stimulated echo longitudinal encode-decode pulse sequence was used (17Jones J.A. Wilkins D.K. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 199Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar), incorporating composite sine gradient pulses (18Merrill M.R. J. Magn. Reson. Series A. 1993; 103: 223Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as described elsewhere (19Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The lengths of all pulses and delays in this sequence were held constant, and 20 spectra were acquired with the strength of the diffusion gradient varying between 5 and 100% of its maximum value. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to estimate the experimental error (quoted as ±1 standard deviation), measurements were repeated five, six, and four times for αN, αi, and βO, respectively. The duration of the pulsed gradients (δ) and the stimulated echo delay time (τ) were optimized for each sample to give a total decay in the protein signal of between 80 and 90% for the strongest field gradients. The following values were used for αN, αi, and βO, respectively: δ = 5.5, 5.5, and 6.5 ms and τ = 75, 100, and 150 ms. The protein concentrations were 300, 100, and 150 μm for αN, αi, and βO, respectively. 0.15% dioxan was added as a viscosity probe of known hydrodynamic radius (17Jones J.A. Wilkins D.K. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 199Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The buffer conditions were αN, A, and βO buffer, as appropriate, except that water was exchanged for D2O. The intensities of the signals (S) from the protein and dioxan as a function of the gradient strength (g) were fitted to the Gaussian function S(g)=A exp(−dg2) (Eq. 1) enabling determination of the decay rate d, which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient, D. The hydrodynamic radius of the protein was obtained from that of dioxan, rref, as rref (dref/dprot). NMR Spectroscopy—One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional heteronuclear HSQC NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer with a 1H operating frequency of 600 MHz. The buffers used were as described above except that 10% D2O was added without correcting for the volume effect. All 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 293 K over a period of about 12 h with a data size of 512 × 256 complex points; the one-dimensional 1H data comprised 1024 complex points. The spectra were internally referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt. The spectra were processed with NMRPipe (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) and analyzed with CARA (21Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. CANTINA Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar) (freely available via Computer Aided Resonance Assignment). Preparation and Characterization of αN, βO, and αi—Recombinant HuPrP90–231 Val129 was metabolically labeled with 15N, purified, and refolded in vitro, as described previously for unlabeled protein (Ref. 9Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). The αN and βO states so formed were identical to those of the unlabeled protein as judged by sec-HPLC, far-UV CD, and ANS binding (Fig. 1, a, c, and e, respectively). The native αN and oligomeric βO states can be clearly differentiated by sec-HPLC with elution times of 9.04 min for αN and 6.4 min for βO, respectively (Fig. 1a). The stability of βO is remarkably high, as judged by reverse phase-HPLC of samples matured for more than a year (9Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In an attempt to observe intermediates between αN and βO, the oligomerization process was monitored with sec-HPLC by injecting samples previously refolded into buffer A (see “Experimental Procedures”) and incubated at room temperature for different times (Fig. 1b). The transient species appearing in these chromatograms at an elution time of ∼9 min is referred to as αi; it elutes with the same retention time as αN. Although αi and αN cannot be resolved by HPLC, they will be shown by optical and NMR spectroscopy (see below) to be distinct species. Detectable amounts of βO are formed from αi after about 2 h. The reaction takes more than 100 days to come to equilibrium under the conditions chosen (buffer A). Reducing pH and/or raising the urea or protein concentrations accelerates the oligomerization. The first and second HPLC chromatograms in Fig. 1b correspond to the initial state for all the experiments on αi; a fresh preparation was used for each experiment. In the far UV CD measurements (Fig. 1c), the αN state exhibits its α-helical spectrum, whereas βO shows the expected β-sheet character (22Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the αi state exhibits a clear α-helix secondary structure, although it was directly refolded in buffer A, which should favor the formation of a β-sheet structure. Judging from the signals at 222 nm, αi has about 45% α-helix structure when compared with 48% in αN and 28% in βO. A clear difference between αN and αi can be seen in the near-UV CD spectra (Fig. 1d). These spectra, which provide a qualitative measure of tertiary structure, display signal loss for αi and βO, whereas αN is clearly highly organized. The dye, ANS, preferentially binds to hydrophobic surfaces of proteins with a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity (23Stryer L. Science. 1968; 162: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Although its affinity to αN is low, it binds strongly to misfolded isoforms of PrP, in particular to PrPSc and βO (6Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to a significant increase in ANS fluorescence in the presence of βO, we also found an increase for αi (Fig. 1e), which probably reflects the accessibility of the hydrophobic core of this partially unfolded state (25Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic Radius Measurements with PFG NMR—To assess the aggregation state and compactness of αi, we performed NMR diffusion experiments to measure the hydrodynamic radii (Rh) of αN, αi, and βO (Fig. 2) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The obtained radii were 28.3 ± 1.56, 31.9 ± 0.34, and 57.4 ± 3.4 Ä for αN, αi, and βO, respectively. Wilkins et al. (19Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) established empirical relationships between Rh and the number of residues in the polypeptide chain (N): for globular folded proteins, Rh/Ä = 4.75 N0.29, whereas for highly denatured states without disulfide bridges, Rh/Ä = 2.21 N0.57. It was shown that predictions based on these equations agree well with data from dynamic light scattering. HuPrP90–231 comprises 169 residues including the unstructured 26-residue histidine tag construct. The overall fold of αN comprises a globular domain between residues Tyr128 and Tyr226 and two unstructured segments at the N and C termini comprising 70 residues in total. For n = 169, the equations above give Rh = 21.1 and 41.3 Ä, respectively, for a fully folded and a fully unfolded state (with the disulfide bond reduced). A very approximate estimate of Rh can be obtained as follows; considering that 41% of the native protein is naturally unstructured, a simple weighted average of these two values of Rh gives a radius of 29.4 Ä, which compares well with the 28.3 Ä measured for αN. A similar analysis can be performed for βO taking into account its decameric nature (10Tahiri-Alaoui A. Sim V.L. Caughey B. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34171-34178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Assuming no change in the percentage of the monomer unit that is unstructured (an assumption supported by the HSQC spectra discussed below), the radius of βO can be estimated as 10⅓ 29.4 = 63.3 Ä, which is reasonably close to the measured value of 57.4 Ä. In comparison, flow field-flow fractionation measurements and multiple angle light scattering gave a radius of 56 Ä for βO with a mass of about 200 kDa (10Tahiri-Alaoui A. Sim V.L. Caughey B. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34171-34178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and a Stokes radius of 65 Ä was measured with dynamic light scattering (6Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the radius of αi is 10% larger than that of αN (Fig. 2c). This is in good agreement with the observation of a limited loss of tertiary structure (Fig. 1d) and thus a partial unfolding retaining a high degree of compactness and a monomeric state. One- and Two-dimensional NMR Spectroscopy—The effects of oligomerization can be studied with NMR spectroscopy. The spectrum in Fig. 3a is of the native state and shows good chemical shift dispersion and narrow line widths (4Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Given their very different molecular masses, αi and βO can be clearly distinguished as βO shows very broad lines, whereas αi retains relatively sharp ones. The spectrum of αi is clearly distinguishable from the two other states, exhibiting intermediate characteristics between the αN and βO spectra (Fig. 3, a–c). The αi and βO spectra show a loss of high field methyl proton signals when compared with αN, indicating a loss of tertiary structure (Fig. 3, boxed regions). The loss of these resonances is more pronounced for βO than for αi, in agreement with the near UV CD and ANS binding observations above and underlining the intermediate nature of the αi state. Downfield shifts of the backbone α-proton resonances, which appear at around 4.0 ppm, can be observed in both αi and βO spectra. These shifts are most noticeable for βO and correspond well with the observation of a β-sheet-rich secondary structure (26Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Similarly, the amide protons exhibit downfield shifts that are pronounced for βO and less so for αi. Chemical shift differences among the three species also exist for the side chain protons, but these are less obvious than for the α and amide protons and somewhat obscured in the spectra by overlap of resonances. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of αi and βO show a similar set of resonances with almost identical chemical shifts within the random coil region (Fig. 4). Of the 130 resonances expected on the basis of the native αN spectrum (Fig. 4a), only about 70 appear in the spectra of αi and βO (Fig. 4, b and c). The dispersed amide cross-peaks from the core region (residues 128–231) of αN were not observable for αi or βO. The resonances of αi and βO cover a narrow range of 1H chemical shifts in the random coil region between 7.8 and 9.0 ppm and overlap with resonances of the disordered N-terminal segment (residues 90–128) of the native state, αN (4Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Comparison of the spectra of αi and βO with the known chemical shifts of αN (15Hosszu L.L. Jackson G.S. Trevitt C.R. Jones S. Batchelor M. Bhelt D. Prodromidou K. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Collinge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28515-28521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) allows assignment of 30 out of the 35 resonances in the N terminus. The other signals most probably emanate from the C-terminal His tag. The observation of an unstructured highly flexible N terminus is in good agreement with previous observations that βO and PrPSc have different proteinase K cleavage sites. The cleavage site in βO is around residue Ala117, but it is around Met90 in the authentic, infectious PrPSc (8Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B. Aebersold R. Barry R.A. Tempst P.

The failure to detect a large number of the expected resonances in the HSQC spectra of αi and βO can be attributed in both cases to severe line broadening. The core of the βO structure tumbles slowly in solution, consistent with the high molecular mass (∼200 kDa (10Tahiri-Alaoui A. Sim V.L. Caughey B. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34171-34178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) of the oligomer, and has broad NMR lines, whereas the N-terminal domain has a high degree of internal mobility yielding sharp resonances. The same argument applies for the N-terminal region of αi, but having clearly shown the monomeric nature of this state, we propose (below) an alternative source of line broadening for the core region of this species. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the misfolding process, it is generally believed that knowledge of intermediate states is essential. Such intermediates may not be stable at equilibrium, but they might be detectable as transient kinetic intermediates with preformed domains. The refolding process of PrP to its native state, αN, is best described as a sequential three-state reaction with the involvement of an intermediate state (28Apetri A.C. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44589-44592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, hydrogen exchange experiments (29Nicholson E.M. Mo H. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Marqusee S.

https://openalex.org/W2082818269,"We identified a cysteine residue, conserved near the N terminus of Pex5p- and Pex20p-like proteins, that is essential for the cytosolic relocation of peroxisomal Pex20p. Surprisingly, this residue is not completely essential for the function of the protein; its point mutation into a serine in Pex20p(C8S) causes the accumulation of the protein at the peroxisome membrane, but this is quickly followed by its subsequent degradation by an ubiquitin-dependent quality control pathway called RADAR (receptor accumulation and degradation in the absence of recycling). This degradative pathway allows partial growth of the Pex20p(C8S) mutant on peroxisome-requiring medium. Mutation of cysteine 8 (C8S) and lysine 19 (K19R), the target residue of the RADAR pathway within Pex20p, leads to a stable but non-functional protein because it fails to recycle to the cytosol. This suggests a role for Cys-8 in Pex20p recycling and that constitutive degradation of peroxisomal receptors can be a partially functional alternative to receptor recycling. In addition, expression of this mutant protein in wild-type cells confers a dominant-negative, oleate-specific growth defect, which is a useful tool for a better understanding of peroxisomal receptor recycling.

During matrix protein import, the PTS receptors/co-receptors, Pex5p, Pex7p, and Pex20p, cycle between the cytosol and the peroxisome as part of an “extended shuttle,” which implies the “recycling” of the receptors/co-receptors from the peroxisome back to the cytosol (2Kunau W.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Many reports suggest a role for ubiquitin in receptor recycling, and indeed, several peroxins appear to be linked to ubiquitin metabolism (3Erdmann R. Schliebs W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Pex4p is an ubiquitin-carrier protein (or E2) peripheral to the peroxisomal membrane and is required in the late steps of import, likely receptor recycling (4Wiebel F.F. Kunau W.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Collins C.S. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. McCaffery J.M. Gould S.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7516-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Also, three peroxins of the peroxisomal membrane possess a RING domain (Pex2p, Pex10p, Pex12p), often found in ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (or E3s). These proteins may be involved in the retrotranslocation of the co-receptor, named Pex20p (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, a complex of AAA ATPases (Pex1p and Pex6p) is also required for the recycling of Pex5p and Pex20p (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Platta H.W. Grunau S. Rosenkranz K. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Nat.

The situation resembles that at the endoplasmic reticulum, where E2s, E3s, and the AAA ATPase Cdc48p collaborate to extract and degrade misfolded or aberrant proteins from the lumen or membrane in a process called endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (9Romisch K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 435-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). So far, the only ubiquitylated peroxins identified are Pex5p (PTS1 receptor (10Platta H.W. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Kragt A. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Van den Berg M. Distel B. J. Biol.

Acta. 2005; 1745: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) and Pex18p/Pex20p (PTS2 co-receptors (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47684-47689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). Ubiquitylated species of Pex5p were first identified in receptor recycling mutants, suggesting that ubiquitylation might be a prerequisite in the receptor shuttling process (10Platta H.W. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, this ubiquitylation now appears to be linked to a quality control mechanism that is triggered in response to receptor accumulation at the peroxisomal membrane as a consequence of their inability to recycle (13Kiel J.A. Otzen M. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By analogy to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, we termed this mechanism the peroxisomal RADAR pathway (for receptor accumulation and degradation in the absence of recycling, (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, work on Pex18p (14Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47684-47689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and on Pex5p (11Kragt A. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Van den Berg M. Distel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7867-7874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) identified monoubiquitylated species of these proteins, which may be indicative of a role for this modification in recycling. Indeed, monoubiquitylation is often associated with signaling or protein trafficking rather than proteolysis (15Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Therefore, ubiquitin may play dual roles in peroxisome biogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, polyubiquitylation was found to be essential for the recycling step itself, independently of the RADAR (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Pex5p and Pex20p possess a conserved N-terminal domain (described here as “NtD”) (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Deletion of the NtD in Pex20p abolishes its function and leads to a protein that accumulates at the peroxisome instead of being mostly cytosolic, suggesting an involvement of this region in recycling to the cytosol. We studied in greater detail this NtD and observed that one residue, Cys-8, is essential for the recycling of Pex20p to the cytosol. However, we show that this residue is not completely essential for the function of the protein because similar to what happens in the recycling mutants, Pex20p(C8S) is constitutively degraded by the RADAR pathway, leading to a partially functional protein and therefore an alternative to receptor recycling. Yeast Strains, Cultures, and Growth Assay—Strains and culture media were described previously (Ref. 6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and references cited therein). For growth assays, cells were grown overnight in rich (YPD) medium and inoculated again for 8 h prior to transfer in oleate (YNO) medium. Cultures were started at 0.3 A600/ml. After growth for the indicated time, cells were washed free of oleate medium and resuspended in the same volume of water. Growth was assayed by measurement of A600, and the initial A600 was subtracted from this value. Constructs—To construct truncations and mutations within the Pex20p NtD, mutagenesis was performed on pSEB48 (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Vectors were linearized with SalI and inserted at the HIS4 locus in the Δpex20, Δpex14, or wild-type (PPY12) strains. Other constructs were described previously (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on YPD and switched to YNO during exponential phase. The construct pPEX3::PEX3-mRFP (pJCF215) was a kind gift of Dr. J-C Farré, UCSD-Biology. Images were captured on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope (AxioSkop 2 Plus, motorized) coupled to a cooled CCD monochrome camera (AxioCam MRM, Zeiss) and processed using AxioVision software. Crude Extracts—Oleate-grown cells (8 ODs) were collected and resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) containing the following inhibitors (Sigma): yeast protease inhibitor mixture, NaF (50 mm), leupeptin (12.5 μg/ml), aprotinin (50 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm), N-ethylmaleimide (100 mm), and MG-132 (100 μm). Cells were broken with glass beads for 10 min at 4 °C. SDS sample buffer was then added, and samples were denatured for 5 min at 65 °C. Prior to loading, the sample was denatured again and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. 10 μl were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were grown overnight on YPD medium, precultured on YPD for 10 h, and transferred overnight into YNO. Subcellular fractionation has been described previously (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitations—Cells (30 ODs) were prepared as for crude extracts (above) except that after the lysis with glass beads, the extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed on the supernatant, using a mixture of monoclonal GFP antibodies (clones 7.1 and 13.1; Roche Applied Sciences) at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml crude extract. The samples were mixed by rotation for 3 h at 4 °C, and then 50 μl of Gammabind G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Co.) were added for another 1.5 h. The beads were washed six times by rotating the beads for 5 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (once) and then 1 ml of immunoprecipitation wash buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) (5 times). The beads were finally boiled in SDS loading buffer (30 μl). The equivalent of 0.2 OD (input and unbound) or 2.5 ODs (immunoprecipitate) were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis. A Conserved Cysteine Residue Is Required for Pex20p Function in the Absence of RADAR—We showed previously that the NtD of Pex20p is essential for its function; Pex20p(Δ1–19) is non-functional and accumulates in or on peroxisomes (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The conserved lysine present in the NtD (Lys-19 in PpPex20p, Lys-22 in PpPex5p) is a target for polyubiquitylation and degradation by the RADAR pathway but is not directly involved in the recycling step since its substitution to arginine led to functional proteins (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Kiel J.A. Otzen M. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the RADAR pathway is not essential for peroxisome biogenesis. In contrast, deletion of the first 16 residues of Pex20p leads to a partially functional protein. We wondered how a growth defect could arise in the absence of residues 1–19, whereas residues 1–16 are not fully required and Lys-19 mutation has no effect on the protein function. We hypothesized that the NtD and the Lys-19 residue possess a redundant function that leads to no, or mild, phenotypes upon mutation of either of them. In agreement with this idea, we first observed that Lys-19 was required for Pex20p function in the absence of the 16 N-terminal residues (Pex20p(Δ1–16,K19R), Fig. 1, A and B). We then tried to identify which region/residue was required when Lys-19 is missing by performing N-terminal truncations in a K19R mutant background, namely, Pex20p(Δ1–7,K19R) and Pex20p(Δ1–10,K19R) (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, Pex20p(Δ1–7,K19R) fully restored the growth of the Δpex20 strain in oleate medium, as opposed to Pex20p(Δ1–10,K19R), Pex20p(Δ1–16,K19R), or Pex20p(Δ1–19), which failed to complement the Δpex20 growth defect. We concluded that residues 8–10 are required for Pex20p function in the absence of Lys-19. In particular, residue Cys-8 is present in all known or predicted Pex20p and Pex5p proteins (Fig. 1C), supporting the idea that it serves an important function. Although the C8S mutation (Pex20p(C8S)) altered only partially the function of Pex20p, the combination of both C8S and K19R mutations (Pex20p(C8S,K19R)) led to a non-functional protein, suggesting that these two residues have a redundant role regarding Pex20p function. Interestingly, a more detailed look at the intermediate growth of the Δpex20 strain complemented with the Pex20p(C8S) construct (Fig. 1D) indicated that this mutant protein is likely to be functional but may be less efficient, leading to a slower but constant growth on oleate medium that eventually reaches the same OD as wild-type cells after 3 days. Interestingly, similar results were obtained when the same experiment was performed with Pex5p(C10S) mutant, mutated in the conserved cysteine residue (data not shown). These results show that the function of Pex20p relies on the presence of the Cys-8 or Lys-19 residues. Given that the K19R mutation renders Pex20p insensitive to the RADAR pathway (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we conclude that residue Cys-8 is essential when the degradation of Pex20p by RADAR is compromised. Conversely, when Cys-8 is mutated, Lys-19 is essential for Pex20p function. Pex20p(C8S) Is Constitutively Degraded by Polyubiquitylation on Its Lys-19 Residue—Since the RADAR pathway is involved in the degradation of receptors, we checked the steady-state levels of truncated/mutant proteins expressed in the Δpex20 background to see whether they differed from that of the wild-type protein. When crude extracts of oleate-grown cells were analyzed, it appeared that the (Δ1–16) truncation or C8S mutation led to lower steady-state levels of Pex20p (Fig. 2A, see also Fig. 3B), although both complemented the mutant strain (Fig. 1, B and D). This difference was more noticeable when the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was omitted in the lysis buffer (data not shown).FIGURE 3Pex20p(C8S) fails to relocate to the cytosol and as a result, is degraded at the peroxisome. A, subcellular localization of Pex20p, Pex20p(K19R), and Pex20p(C8S,K19R) by fluorescence microscopy and co-localization with a peroxisomal marker (Pex3p-mRFP).

B, subcellular localization of Pex20p and Pex20p(C8S) proteins by subcellular fractionation and effect of overexpression of Ub and Ub-K48R on the localization and steady-state level of Pex20p(C8S). Δpex20 cells expressing the various constructs were grown overnight on oleate medium. FL, full-length Pex20p; WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This lower steady-state level was not observed when the peroxisomal docking factor, Pex14p, was missing (Fig. 2B). In this case, the stabilities of the C8S and C8S,K19R mutants were equivalent, as were those of Pex20p(Δ1–16) and Pex20p(Δ1–16, K19R), suggesting that the instabilities of C8S and (Δ1–16) are not intrinsic to the mutant proteins but rather require an intact peroxisomal import machinery. The Pex20p(C8S) steady-state levels decreased progressively with time after transfer into oleate medium, whereas wild-type Pex20p accumulated (Fig. 2C). Again, this supports the idea that this protein is not naturally unstable but that the lower steady-state level of the C8S mutant is linked with oleate utilization and therefore peroxisome biogenesis. We addressed the origin of this low steady-state level by studying whether it is affected by overexpression of the ubiquitin mutant Ub(K48R), which interferes with Lys-48-branched polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome and therefore inhibits the RADAR pathway. Overexpression of Ub(K48R) not only prevented Pex20p(C8S) degradation in Δpex20 cells but also allowed the detection of polyubiquitylated species of Pex20p(C8S) (Fig. 2D; see also Fig. 3B), indicating that the drop in Pex20p(C8S) steady-state level is likely due to an active degradation after polyubiquitylation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Overexpression of ubiquitin alone had no discernable effect. An obvious candidate for the target residue of this polyubiquitylation within Pex20p(C8S) and Pex20p(Δ1–16) is Lys-19. Indeed, the steady-state levels of Pex20p(C8S,K19R) and Pex20p(Δ1–16,K19R) proteins were dramatically increased, showing an expression level that was even higher that that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2A). In summary, these results demonstrate that Pex20p(C8S) mutant protein is actively degraded in wild-type cells by polyubiquitylation on residue Lys-19 and subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system pathway, in agreement with the hypothesis that Pex20p(C8S) is a target of the RADAR pathway. Pex20p(C8S) Is Degraded by the RADAR Pathway at the Surface of the Peroxisome after a Round of Import because It Fails to Recycle—The above observations indicate that Pex20p(C8S) is constitutively degraded after the import cycle. Since its degradation happens by the RADAR pathway, which functions at the surface of the peroxisome, we checked whether its stabilization by the additional K19R mutation leads to the exclusive localization of the protein at the peroxisome. By fluorescence microscopy, we observed that although Pex20p or Pex20p(K19R) have a mostly cytosolic localization when transformed into the Δpex20 strain, Pex20p(C8S,K19R) behaved like Pex20p(Δ1–19) and was mostly peroxisomal (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that, as stated above, the K19R mutation alone does not alter the location of Pex20p, but by preventing access to the RADAR pathway and stabilizing the protein, it allowed us to determine that the Pex20p(C8S,K19R) protein accumulates at the peroxisome, indicative of a recycling defect. These data suggest the presence of two essential residues, Cys-8 and Lys-19, within the NtD, for recycling and RADAR, respectively. We studied the subcellular localization of Pex20p(C8S) mutant protein when expressed in Δpex20 cells. As described previously, wild-type Pex20p was present mostly in the cytosol and partially in the organelle membrane fraction (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, despite being difficult to detect because of its low steady-state level (Fig. 2A), Pex20p(C8S) was mostly associated with the organelle pellet (Fig. 3B). This was a surprising observation since these constructs are partially functional, and proper function of Pex20p is thought to involve its shuttling between the cytosol and the peroxisome (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Pex20p(C8S) is constitutively degraded at the surface of the peroxisomal membrane. To verify this, post-nuclear supernatants of Δpex20 cells co-expressing Pex20p(C8S) and Ub(K48R) or Ub (as a control) were subjected to differential centrifugation. Although strong, constitutive overexpression of Ub did not affect Pex20p(C8S) localization, overexpression of Ub(K48R) led to the appearance of abundant polyubiquitylated species of Pex20p in the pellet fraction (Fig. 3B). This observation is consistent with constitutive degradation of the mutant protein at the surface of the peroxisome, likely after the completion of an import cycle, since some import occurs with this partially functional construct. This would explain why Pex20p(C8S) has a low steady-state level but is yet functional and also why this protein is functional although it is mostly organelle-associated. This idea is also supported by the fact that stabilization of Pex20p(C8S) by the K19R mutation leads to a mostly peroxisomal protein (Fig. 3A). Pex20p(C8S) is thus constitutively degraded by the RADAR pathway at the surface of the peroxisome, and prevention of this degradation by the K19R mutation leads to a stable, peroxisome-associated, and non-functional protein, presumably because it fails to recycle to the cytosol. Therefore, it is likely that the RADAR pathway can rescue the cells by degrading receptors that fail to recycle and that degradation at the peroxisome can be used as an alternative for recycling. In addition, our data point out to an essential role of residue Cys-8 in Pex20p recycling, and presumably, to a role for Cys-10 Pex5p recycling. Mutations/Truncations in the NtD of Pex20p Do Not Prevent Its Association with the Docking and the RING Subcomplexes—We investigated whether point mutations in, or even the complete absence of, the NtD of Pex20p changed its ability to interact with protein complexes of the peroxisomal membrane. Since Pex20p(Δ1–19) and Pex20p(C8S,K19R) are present at very high levels in the cells (Figs. 2A and 4, top panel), presumably because they are trapped at the peroxisome and cannot be degraded by the RADAR pathway, their immunoprecipitation led to a higher amount of recovered proteins that should be considered when analyzing the co-immunoprecipitation data. However, the results clearly indicate no qualitative change in the ability to interact with the docking proteins such as Pex14p or Pex17p (Fig. 4), in good agreement with the fact that the NtD is not required for the peroxisomal localization of Pex20p (Fig. 3A). We also observed a novel interaction between Pex20p and a member of the RING peroxin subcomplex, as shown by the co-immunoprecipitation of Pex12p with Pex20p (Fig. 4). Once again, mutation of the residue Cys-8, or deletion of residues 1–19 of Pex20p, did not lead to a change in this interaction. This result was expected since the RING peroxins play a role in the retrotranslocation of Pex20p from the peroxisome to the cytosol (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and we report here that Pex20p(C8S) is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting that this retrotranslocation has occurred. Previous results indicate a role for the AAA ATPase complex (Pex1p and Pex6p) in dislocation of Pex5p and Pex20p out of the peroxisomal membrane (7Platta H.W. Grunau S. Rosenkranz K. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the interaction of Pex20p with Pex1p and Pex6p. However, none was detected at a significant level in the co-immunoprecipitate, neither with the wild-type Pex20p nor with the truncated proteins (data not shown). Similarly, with the yeast two-hybrid technique, no interactions were detected between Pex20p and Pex1p or Pex6p (data not shown), similarly to what was observed for Pex5p (16Faber K.N. Heyman J.A. Subramani S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This interaction may happen only in the presence of the full AAA ATPase complex and perhaps only when bound to ATP, a situation that probably was not mimicked in the yeast-two hybrid system. Therefore, the question remains open as to the effect of the C8S mutation on the interaction of Pex20p with the recycling complex. Pex20p(C8S,K19R) Displays a Dominant-negative Phenotype—Since Pex20p(C8S,K19R) accumulates at high steady-state levels in the cells and since it is trapped in or on the peroxisome, we asked whether this situation can have deleterious consequences on peroxisome biogenesis in wild-type cells. First, we observed that when expressed in oleate-grown wild-type PPY12 cells, the Pex20p(C8S,K19R) mutant protein displayed the same subcellular localization as in the Δpex20 strain (Fig. 5A). In addition, we observed that expression of Pex20p(C8S,K19R) in wild-type cells led to an inhibition of growth on oleate (Fig. 5B). This phenotype was not observed when cells were grown on methanol as a carbon source (data not shown), a situation where peroxisomes are required for survival, but where the PTS2 import pathway, and therefore, Pex20p, is not required (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Elgersma Y. Elgersma-Hooisma M. Wenzel T. McCaffery J.M. Farquhar M.G. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This indicates that instead of a general import defect, Pex20p(C8S,K19R) expression leads to a specific defect in the PTS2 pathway. A Conserved Cysteine Is Required for Pex20p Relocation to the Cytosol—We have shown that two routes can be used for the removal of Pex20p from the peroxisomal membrane. First, the recycling to the cytosol requires in cis a conserved cysteine residue in the NtD, and in trans, some specific peroxins, such as Pex1p, Pex6p, and Pex4p (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Second, in the absence of any of these cis or trans recycling components, the RADAR pathway is activated and leads to the degradation of Pex20p by polyubiquitylation of the conserved Lys-19 residue present in the NtD. This is summarized in our current working model (Supplemental Fig. 1). Although neither pathway is strictly essential per se, recycling appears to be the favored route since its impairment has a major effect on peroxisome biogenesis, whereas the RADAR pathway is not essential (6Léon S. Zhang L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J. Cregg J.M. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, our data show that the RADAR pathway, whose existence, but not function, has been known for some time in many organisms (for a review, see Ref. 18Leon S. Goodman J.M. Subramani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1552-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) can be used as a back-up system when recycling is compromised. Although we have not been able to observe a difference in the known protein-protein interactions between Pex20p and Pex20p(C8S,K19R), it is still possible that the C8S mutation modifies the affinity of the Pex20p toward the recycling machinery or a potential adaptor. Our initial observations on the role of Cys-8 of Pex20p in peroxisome biogenesis were made with a cysteine-to-alanine mutant (data not shown). However, cysteine-to-serine mutations, such as the one described herein, are traditionally used because these two amino acids differ only in that the former carries a sulfur atom, whereas the latter has an oxygen, leading to little or no conformational change upon mutation. However, the sulfur-based chemistry, such as redox modifications (disulfide bond formation), thioether (prenylation), or thiolester linkages (S-acylation, palmitoylation, or ubiquitylation), cannot be supported by a serine. Therefore, another intriguing possibility is that Cys-8 is modified during the import cycle, and this modification is essential for recycling. This idea was first supported by the fact that the C8K mutation has a less deleterious effect than its mutation to a serine, an alanine, or even an arginine, 4F. Khan, S. Léon, and S. Subramani, unpublished data. which led us to the tantalizing possibility that this cysteine might be a target for ubiquitylation. Indeed, ubiquitylation plays a clear role in receptor recycling (reviewed in Ref. 19Thoms S. Erdmann R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1621-1628Google Scholar). However, (i) we have been unable to demonstrate that this cysteine is ubiquitylated, and (ii) both Pex20p(C8K) and Pex20p(C8K,K19R) mutations restore the RADAR-mediated degradation by creating a new target site for ubiquitylation at the mutated position. 5F. Khan and S. Subramani, unpublished data. Therefore, whether or not this cysteine is ubiquitylated remains unknown. No other types of modification are described for either Pex20p or Pex5p, but this is still a possibility that should be investigated. Identification of the components and interactions mediating the recycling and RADAR pathways will help in the global understanding of peroxisome biogenesis. The authors would like to acknowledge Drs. Xiumei Cao and Farida Khan (UCSD) for technical help and for unpublished data.

The sequence of elementary reactions that describe filament assembly from profilin-actin at either free or formin-bound barbed ends is not fully understood. Specifically, the identity of the transitory complexes between profilin and actin terminal subunits is not known; and whether ATP hydrolysis is directly or indirectly coupled to profilin-actin assembly is not clear. We have analyzed the effect of profilin on actin assembly at free and FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends in the presence of ADP and non-hydrolyzable CrATP. Profilin blocked filament growth by capping the barbed ends in ADP and CrATP/ADP-Pi states, with a higher affinity when formin is bound. We confirm that, in contrast, profilin accelerates depolymerization of ADP-F-actin, more efficiently when FH1-FH2 is bound to barbed ends. To reconcile these data with effective barbed end assembly from profilin-MgATP-actin, the nature of nucleotide bound to both terminal and subterminal subunits must be considered. All data are accounted for quantitatively by a model in which a barbed end whose two terminal subunits consist of profilin-ATP-actin cannot grow until ATP has been hydrolyzed and Pi released from the penultimate subunit, thus promoting the release of profilin and allowing further elongation. Formin does not change the activity of profilin but simply uses it for its processive walk at barbed ends. Finally, if profilin release from actin is prevented by a chemical cross-link, formin processivity is abolished.

The molecular mechanism that supports processive barbed end assembly of actin filaments by formins has been largely debated and remains controversial. The isolated dimeric FH2 domain was first proposed to act by itself as a processive assembly motor (10Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr.

Watanabe N. Science. 2004; 303: 2007-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Later, measurements of barbed end growth of individual filaments initiated by immobilized formins showed that profilin was required for the processive assembly of actin filaments by the fission yeast Cdc12 (22Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), but was not required for and simply accelerated the processive assembly of actin by mDia1 and other formins (23Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). At variance with this view, profilin was shown to be required for processivity of FH1-FH2 but not FH2, of mDia1 (24Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TMR-actin in complex with the FH2 domain of Bni1 shows that each FH2 protomer interacts with two consecutive actins connected by lateral contacts defining a pseudo-filament structure (25Otomo T. Tomchick D.R. Otomo C. Panchal S.C. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In this structure, FH2 simply caps the exposed barbed end, and large structural rearrangements from the “closed” to an “open” state of actin-bound FH2 have to be postulated to account for the putative processive filament assembly by FH2. These proposed structural transitions would have to be extremely fast to account for the rapid processive filament assembly by formins. The role of ATP hydrolysis in processivity of formins has also been debated. One work showed that the formin mDia1 used the direct coupling of ATP hydrolysis to assembly of profilinactin to support its processive walk at barbed ends (24Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), in an “actoclampin” type of mechanism (26Dickinson R.B. Purich D.L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas a more recent study showed evidence for the processive assembly of ADP-actin and profilin-ADP-actin by several formins including Cdc12 and mDia1 (23Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Understanding how profilin affects the function of formins requires a clear view of the molecular mechanism of profilin itself. However, this issue too is controversial (see Ref. 27Yarmola E.G. Bubb M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar for a recent review). There is general agreement that the profilin-actin complex does not assemble at pointed ends of actin filaments, but can productively associate at barbed ends (28Tilney L.G. Bonder E.M. Coluccio L.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 30Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Profilin thus enhances the efficiency of actin filaments treadmilling, in favoring steady-state barbed end growth events. This property is at the origin of the positive effect of profilin in actin-based motile processes, which are powered by treadmilling (31Pantaloni D. Le Clainche C. Carlier M.F. Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Filament assembly from profilin-actin requires dissociation of profilin from the barbed end following association of profilin-actin, to allow further elongation. Several mechanisms have been proposed. In a first model, the dissociation of profilin from the barbed end is caused by ATP hydrolysis because profilin has a 20-fold lower affinity for ADP-actin than for ATP-actin (29Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 32Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this view, ATP hydrolysis is mechanistically coupled to filament assembly from profilin-actin, which is not the case for assembly from pure actin (33Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Three independent facts are consistent with this view. First, the rate of barbed end growth increases linearly with the concentration of G-actin, but reaches a limit at high concentration of profilin-actin, which was attributed to the rate of ATP hydrolysis at the terminal subunit; second, profilin causes a decrease in the partial critical concentration of G-actin (33Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); third, filaments do not assemble from profilin-ADP-actin nor from profilin-CaATP-actin, which hydrolyzes ATP very slowly (29Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 32Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In a second model, profilin dissociation is due to its lower affinity for filament barbed ends than for G-actin and is not dependent on ATP hydrolysis (34Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In agreement with this view, ATP hydrolysis was found to lag slightly behind profilin-actin assembly, indicating that the release of profilin from barbed ends was not coupled to ATP hydrolysis (35Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To resolve the above discrepancies on profilin and formin mechanisms, we have analyzed the assembly of ADP-actin and CrATP-actin in the absence and presence of profilin, formin, or both profilin and formin. We demonstrate that the dissociation of profilin from barbed ends is directly coupled to ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release on actin. We confirm that profilin binds to ADP-actin at barbed ends and increases the rate of depolymerization (34Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Bubb M.R. Yarmola E.G. Gibson B.G. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24629-24635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Profilin inhibits barbed end assembly from ADP-actin as well as from CrATP-actin by blocking the barbed ends. These fundamental properties of profilin are conserved and enhanced when FH1-FH2 is bound to profilin-actin at barbed ends, and are used to promote the processive assembly by formins. The present results provide new insight into the correlation between mechanical and chemical steps in the processive cycle of formins. Proteins—Actin was purified from rabbit muscle and was pyrenyl- or rhodamine-labeled (33Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D.

Mouse profilin 1 and His-tagged FH2 or FH1-FH2 constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified (24Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 621-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Covalently cross-linked profilin-actin complex (PAcov) was prepared (32Gutsche-Perelroizen I. Lepault J. Ott A. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ADP-Actin Polymerization Assays—ADP-actin was prepared by polymerizing the ATP-actin (1:1) complex (2% pyrenyl-labeled) in the presence of 100 μm ADP and 15 units/ml hexokinase, 5 mm glucose. F-ADP-actin was sedimented by centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μm ADP, 10 μm Ap5A (Sigma), 15 units/ml hexokinase, and 5 mm glucose, incubated on ice for 1 h and gel filtered on G25 in the same buffer. Polymerization was induced by addition of 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 to this solution. The increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin was monitored with a Safas spectrofluorimeter (λex 366 nm, λem 407 nm). Steady-state pyrene fluorescence measurements of F-actin assembly were carried out in a Spex spectrofluorimeter following a 3-h incubation at 20 °C to avoid denaturation of ADP-actin. Polymerization Assay of CrATP-Actin—Polymerization of CrATP-actin was performed (45Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20871-20880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ADP-actin was prepared as described above, except that the F-ADP-actin pellet was resuspended in G0 buffer containing only 100 μm ADP. 5% pyrenyl-labeled ADP-actin was polymerized in I-buffer (5 mm imidazole, pH 6.6, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) with the indicated concentrations of CrATP. CrATP was added at time 0 to minimize dissociation of CrATP into chromiumion and ATP. Fluorescence Microscopy Assay—Filament elongation from a single FH1-FH2 molecule immobilized on a 2-μm diameter microsphere was performed as described (24Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) except that polymerization was performed in 5 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 7 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl, 1.5 mm diazobicyclooctane (DABCO, Sigma), 100 μm MgATP and CrATP as indicated. Electron Microscopy—Filaments of actin, polymerized at 7 μm were negatively stained, using a 2% uranyl acetate solution, and observed at a magnification of ×50,000, under low electron dose conditions (less than 10 electrons per Aå square) in a JEOL JEM 2100F electron microscope. Images were recorded on So163 Kodak films and treated for 12 min using pure D19 developer. Selected micrographs were digitized with a Nikon Cool-scan 9000 microdensitometer, using a sampling distance and a scanning step of 2540 dots per inch, corresponding to a pixel size of 2 × 2-Aå square. Modeling—The capping of barbed ends by profilin in ADP and CrATP and the growth of filaments from profilin and actin in MgATP was analyzed using Scheme 1. In Scheme 1, line 1 describes the interaction between profilin and G-actin. Line 2 describes filament barbed end growth from G-actin. Line 3 represents binding of profilin-actin to the barbed end of a filament that has n subunits (called Fn), making aFn+1P end with profilin bound to the terminal subunit. Line 4 represents binding of profilin to the terminal subunit of a filament that has n subunits, resulting in a FnP filament end. Line 5 represents binding of profilin to a Fn barbed end, resulting in a FnPS end, corresponding to a filament that has n subunits but with a subterminal profilin-actin subunit, hence is structurally different from the FnP filament. Line 6 represents binding of G-actin to a FnP filament, resulting in a Fn+1PS filament. Line 7 represents binding of PA to a FnP filament, resulting in a filament Fn+1PPS that has n+1 subunits and profilin bound to the two terminal subunits. The same Fn+1PPS filament can be obtained by binding of profilin either to Fn+1P (line 8) or to Fn+1PS (line 9). Note that lines 4 and 5 are repeated on a Fn+1 filament, giving Fn+1P and Fn+1PS, as well as lines 8 and 9, giving Fn+1PPS. Lines 10 and 11 describe irreversible hydrolysis of MgATP on the penultimate subunit of actin filaments assembling from profilin-actin, allowing cycles of assembly. The model is restricted to lines 1-9 in ADP and CrATP. In these cases, the profilin-bound filament ends are nonproductive, filament growth occurs only via line 2. The rate of barbed end growth was modeled in ADP, CrATP, and MgATP, with and without formin, using the Madonna-Berkeley software, using the rate constants known for association dissociation of G-actin to free filament ends and using experimentally determined values of equilibrium dissociation constants for profilin binding to G-actin in ADP (K1 = 4 μm in ADP, 0.1 μm in ATP). Identical values were taken for K2 and K3 (1.5 μm in ADP, 0.1 μm in ATP), as well as for K4 and K9 and for K5 and K8, for which best fit values to experimental curves were determined computationally. In the absence of profilin, V0 = k+2·[F0]·[A0] - k-2·[F0]. In the presence of profilin, [A0] = [A] + [PA]; [P0] = [P] + [PA] where [F0], [A0], and [P0] represent the total concentrations of filament-barbed ends, G-actin, and profilin, respectively. [PA] = (½)·{[P0] + [A0] + Kp) ± (([A0] + [P0] + Kp)2 - 4 [P0]·[A0])½}. V = k+2·[F]·[A] - k-2[F] + k+3[F]·[PA] - k-3 [FP] + k+6[FP]·[A] - k-6[FPS] + k+7[FP]·[PA] - k-7[FPPS]. The Madonna-Berkeley software was used to model V/V0 using the above equations. The parameters were adjusted to fit the experimental data in Figs. 2 and 4 in ADP and CrATP, with free and formin-bound barbed ends. Constraints were brought by using the known values of the equilibrium dissociation constant K1 = k-1/k+1 for binding of profilin to G-actin (K1 = 4 μm in ADP and 0.2 μm in MgATP or CrATP), and of the association and dissociation of G-actin to free barbed ends: k+2 = 10 μm-1 s-1 in MgATP or CrATP and 2.5 μm-1 s-1 in ADP; k-2 = 1s-1 in MgATP and 3.75 s-1 in ADP, giving Cc = 0.1 μm in ATP and 1.5 μm in ADP. Other parameters were adjusted. The best fit values are given in Table 1. Whenever applicable, the range of values that equally well fitted experimental data were given.FIGURE 4Profilin blocks filament growth from CrATP-actin at either free or FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends. A, FH1-FH2 nucleates polymerization of CrATP-actin in a dose-dependent fashion. ADP-actin (3 μm, 5% pyrenyl-labeled) was supplemented with 300 μm CrATP and immediately polymerized by addition of 100 mm KCl in the presence of FH1-FH2 as indicated. B, FH1-FH2 induces polymerization from CrATP-actin as well as from MgATP-actin, but profilin blocks barbed end growth in the presence of CrATP-actin and allows productive growth from MgATP-actin. ADP-actin (1.5 μm, 5% pyrenyl-labeled) was supplemented with either 100 μm MgATP (black curves) or 300 μm CrATP (magenta curves) and polymerized in the presence of 50 nm FH1-FH2 and in the absence (thin curves) or presence (thick curves) of 20 μm profilin. C, profilin caps formin-bound CrATP-barbed ends with a higher affinity than free CrATP-barbed ends. The initial rate of elongation of barbed end growth from 1.5 μm actin (5% pyrenyl-labeled) was measured in the presence of 300 μm CrATP (solid lines) at free barbed ends (spectrin-actin seeds, cyan) and at FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends (50 nm FH1-FH2, magenta) in the presence of profilin as indicated. Solid curves are calculated using the model with the values of dissociation constants given in Table 1. Dashed curves (cyan, free barbed ends; magenta, FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends) represent the effect of profilin in MgATP (from Refs. 24Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F.

Previous work has shown that FH1-FH2 binds ADP-F-actin at barbed ends with a KF of 3 nm (10Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 19Pring M. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Zigmond S.H.

Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Consistently, we now find that FH1-FH2 nucleates ADP-actin, although less efficiently than ATP-actin (Fig. 1A). Measurements of F-actin at equilibrium in ADP showed that profilin caused depolymerization of F-ADP-actin both in the absence and presence of FH1-FH2 (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that profilin-ADP-actin cannot participate in F-actin assembly, i.e. profilin sequesters ADP-actin, even if FH1-FH2 is bound to barbed ends. The derived binding constant (Kd) of profilin for ADP-G-actin is 4 μm, in agreement with previous data (29Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In dilution-induced depolymerization assays (Fig. 1C), profilin increased the rate of ADP-actin dissociation from free barbed ends, and even more from FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends, in agreement with previous reports (24Romero S.

Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24629-24635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that profilin actually associates with ADP-bound barbed ends, with equilibrium dissociation constants of 8 μm in the absence of formin and 2 μm in the presence of formin. These values are artifactually higher than the actual binding constant of profilin for ADP-bound barbed ends because for sensitivity purposes, the depolymerization assays had to be carried out using filaments containing 50% pyrenyl-labeled actin to which profilin binds very poorly (37Malm B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We then examined how profilin affected the kinetics of filament growth from ADP-actin at pointed ends and at free or FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends. To avoid residual amounts of ATP on actin, assays were performed in the presence of 15 units/ml of hexokinase, 5 mm glucose, and 10 μm Ap5A, to avoid ATP synthesis from ADP by myokinase, which often contaminates actin preparations (Ref. 38Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Coue M. Lal A.A. Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6274-6283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). Profilin inhibited pointed end growth from ADP-actin in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A) consistent with formation of a non-polymerizable profilin-ADP-actin complex and a binding constant of profilin for ADP-actin of 4 μm, identical to the value derived from measurements of F-actin at equilibrium (Fig. 1B). Altogether, kinetic and equilibrium measurements confirm that profilin has a 20-fold lower affinity for ADP-actin than for ATP-actin (29Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 39Perelroizen I. Marchand J.B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Profilin inhibited barbed end growth from ADP-actin, but the inhibition was not consistent with sequestration of ADP-actin, because the inhibition curve at 9 μm actin (Fig. 2A, red curve) does not superimpose with the curve obtained at pointed ends at the same actin concentration (Fig. 2A, green curve). Half-inhibition of barbed end growth was observed at a total concentration of 3.5 μm profilin, indicating that ADP-bound barbed ends are blocked, by binding either free profilin or profilin-ADP-actin complex. A satisfactory fit was obtained to all curves at both ends by the model described under “Experimental Procedures,” using values of equilibrium and rate parameters summarized in Table 1. In the presence of FH1-FH2, profilin inhibited assembly from ADP-actin much more efficiently at FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends than at free barbed ends (Fig. 2, B and C). Half-inhibition was observed at a total concentration of 0.21 μm profilin. In fluorescence microscopy measurements (Fig. 3, A and B) of individual formin-bound filaments growing from ADP-actin, profilin again blocked barbed end growth with high affinity (K½ = 0.15 μm). In conclusion, in binding to terminal ADP-actin subunits at barbed ends, profilin blocks barbed end"

To probe how ion channels respond to mismatch with lipid bilayers of different thicknesses, we examined the single channel activities of BKCa (hSlo α-subunit) channels in planar bilayers of binary mixtures of DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) with phosphatidylcholines (PCs) of varying chain lengths, including PC 14:1, PC 18:1, PC 22:1, PC 24:1, and with porcine brain sphingomyelin. Bilayer thickness and structure was measured with small angle x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The open probability (Po) of the BKCa channel was finely tuned by bilayer thickness, first decreasing with increases in bilayer thickness from PC 14:1 to PC 22:1 and then increasing from PC 22:1 to PC 24:1 and to porcine brain sphingomyelin. Single channel kinetic analyses revealed that the mean open time of the channel increased monotonically with bilayer thickness and, therefore, could not account for the biphasic changes in Po. The mean closed time increased with bilayer thickness from PC 14:1 up to PC 22:1 and then decreased with further increases in bilayer thickness to PC 24:1 and sphingomyelin, correlating with changes in Po. This is consistent with the proposition that bilayer thickness affects channel activity mainly through altering the stability of the closed state. We suggest a simple mechanical model that combines forces of lateral stress within the lipid bilayer with local hydrophobic mismatch between lipids and the protein to account for the biphasic modulation of BKCa gating.

Ion channel proteins play an important role in the regulation of ion fluxes across cell and organelle membranes. They routinely undergo conformational changes during the ion transport process. The opening and closing of ion channels is sensitive to changes in the physical properties of the lipid bilayer, such as lipid composition (1Turnheim K. Gruber J. Wachter C. Ruiz-Gutierrez V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C83-C90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol.

Biol. 1995; 143: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which provide mechanisms through which lipid bilayers regulate the function of resident ion channels. All of these properties of the lipid bilayer are interrelated. For example, changes in lipid composition will likely alter the surface charge, bilayer thickness, and/or the lateral stress forces associated with the membrane bilayer. Increasing the thickness of the lipid bilayer (with the same kind of lipids) has been shown to increase the lateral stress (or stiffness) of the bilayer (3Perozo E. Kloda A. Cortes D.M. Martinac B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer has been shown to be important in lipid-protein interactions in biological membranes (7Killian J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 8Lundbaek J.A. Birn P. Girshman J. Hansen A.J. Andersen O.S.

Specific examples of enzyme activity influenced by bilayer thickness are the Ca2+Mg2+ ATPase (10East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4144-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11Caffrey M. Feigenson G.W.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2633-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the human erythrocyte hexose transporter (14Carruthers A. Melchior D.L.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8541-8549Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have established that this parameter of the membrane bilayer also plays an important role in regulating the sorting of proteins between the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane. The length of a protein transmembrane domain tends to conform to the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer (16Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 17Sprong H. van der S.P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been well established that within a single plasma membrane there are a number of lipid microdomains (lipid rafts) that are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. These lipid rafts are thicker and more ordered than the rest of the membrane (18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). Some proteins, such as BK channels and other voltage-gated K+ channels, are targeted to these specific domains. This may influence the properties of these proteins, making them more suitable for particular functions (19Martens J.R. Sakamoto N. Sullivan S.A. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol.

BKCa channels possess many of the common structural features of homotetrameric voltage-gated K+ channels, including an ion-selective pore formed by transmembrane segments S5 and S6 and a voltage-sensing module formed by transmembrane segments S1-S4. In addition, BKCa channels have a long intracellular COOH terminus that may form a Ca2+-sensing module. The intracellular COOH terminus of each α subunit of the BKCa channel contributes two RCK (regulator of K+ conductance) domains, and the eight RCK domains from the four α subunits form a gating ring similar to MthK channels (25Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The linker that connects the S6 gate to the RCK domains forms a passive spring with the gating ring and is involved in Ca2+-dependent activation (26Niu X. Qian X. Magleby K.L. Neuron. 2004; 42: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the biophysical properties of voltage and Ca2+ activation of single channel gating have been explored extensively (27Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Rothberg B.S. Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 75-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29McManus O.B.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15612-15619Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the impact of the lipid environment on single channel gating of BKCa remains relatively unexplored. Some of the basic effects of membrane lipid composition on BKCa channel conductance and activity have been characterized in different tissues (5Moczydlowski E. Alvarez O. Vergara C. Latorre R. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 83: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol.

The conductance and open probability of BKCa channels was shown to be increased in lipid bilayers enriched with negatively charged lipids (31Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), an effect attributed to differences in surface charges leading to alterations of local concentrations of Ca2+ and K+ (5Moczydlowski E. Alvarez O. Vergara C. Latorre R. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 83: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Bell J.E. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This conclusion, however, was revised in a recent study using Ba2+ to block the BKCa channel. An enhancement of the Ba2+ block of the BKCa channel in negatively charged membranes, which is predicted by the electrostatic mechanism, was not observed (33Park J.B. Kim H.J. Ryu P.D. Moczydlowski E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 375-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The molecular shape of lipid molecules has also been suggested to influence the activity and conductance of BKCa channels (31Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, Chang et al. (6Chang H.M. Reitstetter R. Mason R.P. Gruener R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) proposed the concept of structural stress to account for the reduction in the conductance and kinetics of BKCa channels that accompanies the incorporation of cholesterol into lipid bilayers. Based on our earlier study of a wide variety of lipid compositions in planar bilayers, we hypothesized that simple differences in bilayer thickness would deform the BKCa channel protein in certain ways and that this deformation was largely responsible for the rather large shifts in conductance we observed (34Yuan C. O'Connell R.J. Feinberg-Zadek P.L. Johnston L.J. Treistman S.N. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3620-3633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we investigate how changes in bilayer thickness (and the accompanying changes in lateral stress and hydrophobic mismatch between BKCa channels and lipid bilayers) affect the gating of the channel. BKCa (hSlo α-subunit) channels were reconstituted into lipid bilayers made from binary mixtures of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) with acyl chain lengths ranging from 14:1 to 24:1 and with brain sphingomyelin (SPM). Small angle x-ray diffraction techniques were used to measure changes in bilayer thickness as a function of increasing acyl chain length. The inclusion of DOPE in these bilayers was necessary to promote the incorporation of the channel protein. SPM was chosen for comparison with the PC series because SPM has the same polar head group as the PCs but has a very high phase transition temperature (45 °C) (35Lee A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 811-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At room temperature, SPM membranes are in a more ordered gel phase and should be thicker than bilayers containing only PCs, all of which are in the liquid crystal phase at room temperature. Moreover, SPM is one of the major components of lipid rafts (besides cholesterol), and analyses of bilayers prepared with this lipid should shed some light on how the BKCa channel functions in native lipid rafts. Additionally, we present a model based on our results that is consistent with developing structure-function analyses of potassium channels. The model suggests that at least two processes account for the influence of bilayer thickness on BK channel kinetics and open probability; lateral stress seems to predominate in thinner bilayers, whereas hydrophobic mismatch seems to be the primary determinant of the effect in thicker bilayers. Materials—The following lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification in these experiments: DOPE, 1,2-dimyristoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC 14:1), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC 18:1), 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC 22:1), 1,2-dinervonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC 24:1), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE), and porcine brain sphingomyelin. Lipids were stored in chloroform at 10 mg/ml at –20 °C until use. Decane and salts were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All aqueous solutions were prepared with 18.3 megaohms/cm Milli-Q water. Membrane Preparation—The cDNA encoding hSlo α, kindly provided by Dr. P. Ahring, NeuroSearch A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark), was overexpressed in HEK-293 cells. Stably transfected HEK-293 cells were grown in artificial medium (36Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Christophersen P. Olesen S.P. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and membrane fragments were prepared using a protocol developed for COS cells with some slight modifications as described elsewhere (2Crowley J.J. Treistman S.N. Dopico A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology Measurements and Data Analyses—Single-channel recordings were performed with standard planar bilayer technology (37Alvarez O. Miller C. Ion Channel Reconstitution. Plenum Press, New York1986: 115-139Crossref Google Scholar). Lipid mixtures of DOPE with PCs (1:1 mole ratio) or with SPM (3:2 mole ratio) were initially dissolved in chloroform. The solvent was removed by evaporation under N2, and the dried lipid film was resuspended in decane to form a final total lipid concentration of 25 mg/ml. A bilayer was formed by painting the lipid solution over a 100-μm hole (38Wonderlin W.F. Finkel A. French R.J. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 289-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) formed in a horizontal plastic coverslip sealed with Tackiwax to a Teflon partition separating an upper and lower chamber. Bilayer capacitance was monitored by noting the current across the bilayer in response to a triangle wave (10 mV/25 ms). Membrane suspensions containing crude membrane fragments (0.2–0.5 μl) were added to the upper cis chamber with a micropipette. In most bilayers this caused the thinned membrane to rupture. Channel incorporation was typically achieved within a few minutes after “brushing” the membrane fraction with fresh lipid solution across the annulus while forming a new bilayer. The cytoplasmic cis solution contained 300 mm KCl, 1.05 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm HEDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The free Ca2+ was estimated to be about 25 μm using the Max-Chelator Sliders program (39Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Nuccitelli R. A Practical Guide to the Study of Calcium in Living Cells. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 3-29Google Scholar). The extracellular (trans) solution in the lower chamber contained 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mm HEDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Single channel currents were recorded with a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-9, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) (40Gillis K.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The trans chamber was connected to ground, and all voltages in the cis chamber were expressed relative to ground. Experiments were done at room temperature (22 °C). Single channel events were sampled at 5 kHz with Pulse software (40Gillis K.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The data were filtered at 1 kHz for analysis and 500 Hz for display. Only recordings containing a single channel were analyzed. This was determined by a long depolarizing step from 0 to +40 mV to ensure that there was only one channel opening in the bilayer. At least 20 s of continuous recording at 0 mV was used to obtain an estimate Po from an all-points histogram. Durations of open and closed times were measured with half-amplitude threshold analysis. Dwell-time data were plotted with a logarithmic time axis along the abscissa and a squareroot ordinate exhibiting the number of events in each bin. The bin density was 20 bins per decade. A lower limit of 0.6 ms was set for the dwell time distribution of open and closed intervals due to the time resolution of sampling and filtering (41Walters F.S. Covarrubias M. Ellingson J.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1107-C1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The occasionally long closed periods (shut intervals, >5 s) were also excluded due to extremely low activity. A maximum-likelihood minimization routine was used to fit the distribution of open and closed times (42Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). All analyses were done using TAC and TAC-fit programs (Bruxton Corp.). Small Angle X-ray Diffraction Analyses—Membrane samples consisting of binary lipid mixtures of DOPE with PCs (1:1 mole ratio) and binary mixtures of DOPE with SPM (3:2 mole ratio) were prepared as follows. Component lipids (in chloroform) were transferred to 13 × 100 test tubes and shell-dried under N2 while vortex mixing. Residual solvent was removed by drying for a minimum of 1 h under vacuum. After desiccation, each membrane sample was resuspended in diffraction buffer (0.5 mm HEPES, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) to yield a final phospholipid concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Multilamellar vesicles were then formed by vortex mixing for 3 min at either 40 °C (for SPM-containing membrane samples) or ambient temperature (for all other samples) (43Bangham A.D. Standish M.M. Watkins J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 238-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3610) Google Scholar). Lipid bilayers were oriented for x-ray diffraction analysis as previously described (44Herbette L. DeFoor P. Fleischer S. Pascolini D. Scarpa A. Blasie J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 103-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μl aliquots (containing 250 μg of total phospholipid) of each multilamellar vesicle preparation were transferred to custom-designed Lucite® sedimentation cells, each containing an aluminum foil substrate upon which the final membrane sample pellets were collected. Samples were then loaded into a Sorvall AH-629 swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor (DuPont) and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 1 h at 5 °C. After orientation, the supernatants were aspirated, and the aluminum foil substrates, supporting the membrane pellets, were removed from the sedimentation cells and mounted onto curved glass slides. The samples were then placed in hermetically sealed brass canisters in which temperature and relative humidity were regulated before and during x-ray diffraction analyses. Saturated solutions of potassium sulfate (K2SO4) were used to establish a relative humidity level of 97% in these experiments, and samples were incubated at this relative humidity for a minimum of 1 h before experimental analysis. The oriented membrane fraction samples were aligned at grazing incidence with respect to a collimated, monochromatic x-ray beam (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54 Ä) produced by a Rigaku Rotaflex RU-200, high brilliance rotating anode microfocus generator (Rigaku-MSC, The Woodlands, TX). The fixed geometry beamline utilized a single Franks mirror providing nickel-filtered radiation (Kα1 and Kα2 unresolved) at the detection plane. Diffraction data were collected on a one-dimensional, position-sensitive electronic detector (Hecus x-ray Systems, Graz, Austria) using a sample-to-detector distance of 150 mm. In addition to direct calibration, crystalline cholesterol monohydrate was used to verify the calibration of the detector. This technique allows for precise measurement of the unit cell periodicity, or d-space, of the membrane lipid bilayer, which is defined as the distance from the center of one lipid bilayer to the next, including surface hydration. In a multilamellar system, the amount of water that separates each membrane bilayer can be kept constant by carefully controlling relative humidity (using saturated salt solutions as noted above). Under these conditions, the d-space is directly affected by changes in the conformation of the membrane bilayer and its lipid constituents. The d-space for any given membrane multibilayer is calculated from Bragg's Law, hλ = 2dsin θ, where h is the diffraction order, λ is the wavelength of the x-ray radiation (1.54 Ä), d is the membrane lipid bilayer unit cell periodicity, and θ is the Bragg angle equal to one-half the angle between the incident beam and scattered beam. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—The lateral organization of supported membranes prepared from DOPE/SPM (3:2 mole ratio) mixtures were examined by AFM. Supported hybrid bilayers were prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett transfer as described elsewhere (45Yuan C. Johnston L.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, a DPPE monolayer was deposited on freshly cleaved, hydrophilic mica at a surface pressure of 45 millinewtons/m and formed a flat, defect-less single layer membrane. The second layer of DOPE/SPM was then deposited on DPPE-coated mica at a surface pressure of 30 millinewtons/m. The resulting bilayers were kept under water in a preset small container and kept under water during transfer to the AFM liquid cell (Molecular Imaging (MI), Phoenix, AZ). The supported bilayer samples were imaged under water with a MAC-mode Picoscan atomic force microscope (Molecular Imaging, Inc., Phoenix, AZ) as described elsewhere (45Yuan C. Johnston L.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These data provided information about the relative bilayer thickness and the phase separation of the bulk structure of the polar head groups in the outer leaflet. Measurements of Membrane Bilayer Thickness—Small angle x-ray diffraction analyses of DOPE/PCs and DOPE/SPM membrane samples at 22 °C, 97% relative humidity yielded well-defined, reproducible diffraction orders that are consistent with a single lamellar lipid bilayer phase (Fig. 1). Membrane periodicity (d-space) values were calculated directly from the collected diffraction patterns and are summarized in Table 1. Overall membrane width increased systematically as a function of increasing acyl chain length, with a maximal increase of 26% observed between PC 14:1 and SPM. These data are consistent with previously reported measurements of hydrophobic thickness in pure PC bilayers (46Lewis B.A. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Differences that exist between comparative d-space and hydrophobic thickness values may be due to the structural contribution of equimolar DOPE, which has a hydrophobic thickness value of 29 Ä (47de Planque M.R. Killian J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to expect that DOPE would slightly increase overall membrane width when added to pure PC 14:1 and PC 18:1 bilayers while slightly decreasing membrane width when added to pure PC 22:1 and PC 24:1 bilayers.TABLE 1Membrane d-space and hydrophobic thickness values Unit cell periodicity (d-space) values were calculated from the diffraction data collected from each membrane sample at 22 °C, 97% relative humidity, as described in Fig. 1. Hydrophobic thickness values are cited from Lewis and Engelman (46Lewis B.A. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar).d-Space for DOPE/PC binary mixtures (mean ± S.D.)aX-ray diffraction measurements were conducted in triplicateHydrophobic thickness reported for PCs or SPM aloneÄÄPC 14:155.9 ± 3.020PC 18:158.0 ± 3.627PC 22:164.5 ± 3.934PC 24:169.7 ± 0.538SPM71.1 ± 1.2N/Aa X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted in triplicate Open table in a new tab The porcine brain sphingomyelin, used for preparing the SPM/DOPE bilayer samples in this study, contains hydrocarbon acyl chains of varying length, with the most prominent ones consisting of 22 and 24 carbons. AFM imaging of SPM/DOPE membranes indicated a phase separation in which SPM is in a thicker and more ordered gel phase because of its high phase transition temperature (Fig. 2). The bilayer thickness for SPM (C24) has been reported as 54 to 56 Ä in the liquid crystal phase and 61 to 63 Ä in the gel phase (∼7 Ä difference in thickness between the two phases, which is equal to roughly 4 carbons in acyl chain length) (48Maulik P.R. Atkinson D. Shipley G.G. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 49Maulik P.R. Shipley G.G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1909-1916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expect that the hydrophobic thickness for brain SPM membranes in the gel phase is around 44 Ä and is thicker than PC 24:1 in the liquid crystal phase. Bilayer Thickness Tunes BKCa Channel Activity—BKCa channels were reconstituted into planar bilayers prepared as binary mixtures of DOPE with PC 14:1, PC 18:1, PC 22:1, PC 24:1, or SPM. BKCa channels show a reciprocal bimodal distribution of conductance and activity in the phase separated SPM/DOPE bilayers; i.e. the BKCa channel has a high conductance and a low Po in the DOPE phase and a low conductance and a high Po in the SPM phase (65O'Connell R.J. Yuan C. Johnston L.J. Rinco O. Treistman I. Treistman S.N. J. Membr. Biol. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). Here we present only the single channel recordings of BKCa channels in the low conductance, SPM phase. Representative single channel current traces and associated all-point histograms, collected from DOPE/PCs and DOPE/SPM membrane samples, are shown in Fig. 3. The Po is an index of channel activity obtained from the all-points histograms of these traces. The BKCa channel Po (calculated from the traces shown in Fig. 3A) was 0.67, 0.394, 0.067, 0.45, and 0.88 in DOPE membranes containing PC 14:1, PC 18:1, PC 22:1, PC 24:1, and SPM, respectively. The same trend was observed for the mean Po, averaged from five single channel recordings of BKCa in each bilayer (Fig. 3C). An increase in the bilayer thickness from PC 14:1 to PC 18:1 resulted in a decrease in channel activity from a mean Po of 0.59 ± 0.09 to 0.39 ± 0.04, respectively; channel activity was further reduced to 0.10 ± 0.02 in membrane bilayers containing PC 22:1.

Recent studies have found a suppression defect of CD4+CD25+(high) T cells in human disease. In this study we measure apoptosis of CD4+CD25+(high) T cells to see if it could contribute to reduced suppressive activity of these cells.T-cell apoptosis was evaluated in children and adolescent 35 females/40 males subjects comprising recent-onset and long-standing T1D subjects and their first-degree relatives, who are at variable risk to develop T1D. YOPRO1/7AAD and intracellular staining of the active form of caspase 3 were used to evaluate apoptosis. Isolated CD4+CD25+(high) and CD4+CD25- T cells were co-cultured in a suppression assay to assess the function of the former cells. We found that recent-onset T1D subjects show increased apoptosis of CD4+CD25+(high) T cells when compared to both control and long-standing T1D subjects p<0.0001 for both groups. Subjects at high risk for developing T1D 2-3Ab+ve show a similar trend p<0.02 and p<0.01, respectively. On the contrary, in long-standing T1D and T2D subjects, CD4+CD25+(high) T cell apoptosis is at the same level as in control subjects p = NS. Simultaneous intracellular staining of the active form of caspase 3 and FoxP3 confirmed recent-onset FoxP3+ve CD4+CD25+(high) T cells committed to apoptosis at a higher percentage 15.3+/-2.2 compared to FoxP3+ve CD4+CD25+(high) T cells in control subjects 6.1+/-1.7 p<0.002. Compared to control subjects, both recent-onset T1D and high at-risk subjects had significantly decreased function of CD4+CD25+(high) T cells p = 0.0007 and p = 0.007, respectively.There is a higher level of ongoing apoptosis in CD4+CD25+(high) T cells in recent-onset T1D subjects and in subjects at high risk for the disease. This high level of CD4+CD25+(high) T-cell apoptosis could be a contributing factor to markedly decreased suppressive potential of these cells in recent-onset T1D subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2087667357,"The 3 million-base pair genome of Sulfolobus solfataricus likely undergoes depurination/depyrimidination frequently in vivo. These unrepaired abasic lesions are expected to be bypassed by Dpo4, the only Y-family DNA polymerase from S. solfataricus. Interestingly, these error-prone Y-family enzymes have been shown to be physiologically vital in reducing the potentially negative consequences of DNA damage while paradoxically promoting carcinogenesis. Here we used Dpo4 as a model Y-family polymerase to establish the mechanistic basis for DNA lesion bypass. While showing efficient bypass, Dpo4 paused when incorporating nucleotides directly opposite and one position downstream from an abasic lesion because of a drop of several orders of magnitude in catalytic efficiency. Moreover, in disagreement with a previous structural report, Dpo4-catalyzed abasic bypass involves robust competition between the A-rule and the lesion loop-out mechanism and is governed by the local DNA sequence. Analysis of the strong pause sites revealed biphasic kinetics for incorporation indicating that Dpo4 primarily formed a nonproductive complex with DNA that converted slowly to a productive complex. These strong pause sites are mutational hot spots with the embedded lesion even affecting the efficiency of five to six downstream incorporations. Our results suggest that abasic lesion bypass requires tight regulation to maintain genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2163546760,"The structure of the human Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ectodomain (ECD) was recently solved by x-ray crystallography, leading to a number of models concerning TLR3 function (Choe, J., Kelker, M.

In addition, there are two loops that protrude from the central solenoid structure of the protein. We examined the recombinant TLR3 ECD for disulfide bond formation, poly(I:C) binding, and protein-protein interaction. We also made over 80 mutations in the residues that could affect these features in the full-length TLR3 and examined their effects in TLR3-mediated NF-κB activation. A number of mutations that affected TLR3 activity also affected the ability to act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild type TLR3. Loss of putative RNA binding did not necessarily affect dominant negative activity.

The recognition of foreign molecules by the innate immune receptors can lead to the activation of a signaling cascade, changes in gene expression, and production of cytokines by effector cells (3Uematsu S. Akira S. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2006; 6: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The consequence of this pathway could dictate the outcome of an immune response through modulation of T- and B-lymphocyte activation in the adaptive immune pathways.At least 11 TLRs 4The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; hTLR, human TLR; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ECD, ectodomain; WT, wild type; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; HEK, human embryonic kidney; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 4The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; hTLR, human TLR; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ECD, ectodomain; WT, wild type; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; HEK, human embryonic kidney; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. have been identified in the human genome (4Lancaster G.I.

These results support a role for TLR3 in modulating the host immune response against microbial challenge and provide a rationale to better understand the mechanism of action of TLR3.Upon ligand binding, TLR3 can, through adaptor proteins, activate the transcription factor NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus to modulate gene expression (5Alexopoulou L.

Biol. 2005; 15: R336-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The site of action for TLR3 activation is probably in or near intracellular vesicles, although some cell surface expression is observed in human embryonic kidney cells (9Matsumoto M. Funami K.

Based on surface charge properties and the location of glycosylations, the region proposed to bind dsRNA was proposed to be free of glycosylation. The structures from the crystal packing suggest that the C-terminal portions of two subunits interact through ionic interactions. TLR3 ECD is also predicted to contain four disulfide bonds near the N and C termini of the solenoid that may stabilize the ECD structure. Last, there are two protruding loops in the TLR3 ECD solenoid that may contribute to TLR3 function.Analysis of how features of the TLR3 ECD structure impact function is an active area of research. All of the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in TLR3 ECD have been mutated, and two contribute to TLR3 activity in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (10Sun J.C. Duffy K.E.

A thorough mutational analysis of residues neighboring H539E and N541A had more modest effects on TLR3 activity (13Bell J.K. Askins J. Hall P.R. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This work also led to the proposal that RNA binding by the TLR3 ECD leads to dimerization.In this study, we have made over 80 mutants in TLR3 that are predicted to affect disulfide bond formation, dimerization, and RNA binding and examined their effects in a cell-based assay for TLR3 activation of downstream reporter expression. Biochemical assays for the properties of the TLR3 ECD produced in human cells are also examined. The effects of select mutants that decreased TLR3 activity were examined for effects on protein expression and cellular localization and for the ability to act as dominant negatives of co-transfected wild type (WT) copy of TLR3.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Antisera to TLR3 and poly(I:C) were purchased from Imgenix Inc. (San Diego, CA). Dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, and trypsin were purchased from Sigma. The water used in all procedures was purified using a Millipore Milli-Q UV Plus purification system. Organic solvents used for mass spectrometry were high pressure liquid chromatography grade, and all of the other chemicals were reagent grade. The fluorescent dye that stains acidic membrane, Lysotracker, was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). A 40-bp poly(I:C) was chemically synthesized (genoMechanix, Gainesville, FL). A 20-bp poly(I:C) was made by treating polyinosinic acid and polycytidylic acid with 1 m NaOH for 5 min, followed by separating the bands on a denaturing gel and cutting out the 20-nucleotide bands with a razor and annealing them.Mass Spectrometry—To obtain biochemical evidence for disulfide bonds in TLR3, we used mass spectrometry to examine the recombinant TLR3 ECD purified from human cells, named hTLR3 ECD. An aliquot of hTLR3 ECD was reduced and alkylated, similar to published protocols (14Sechi S. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The other aliquot was diluted with 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. Each aliquots was then thermally denatured at 90 °C for 15 min and digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin at 37 °C overnight (15Park Z.-Y. Russell D.H. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2667-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of trypsin to protein used was 1:40. Each sample was desalted using a C18 Zip Tip (Millipore) before analysis by mass spectrometry utilizing an ABI 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The matrix was 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid (5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and mixed 1:1 with the desalted sample. All spectra were taken manually. For the tandem mass spectrometry experiments, the acceleration was set at 1 kV, and the collision gas was atmosphere.Mutagenesis—The WT TLR3 plasmid was previously described by Sun et al. (10Sun J.C. Duffy K.E. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J. Masarapu H. Cunningham M. Holzenburg A. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutations were made using oligonucleotides annealed to the target sequence and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Sequences of the oligonucleotides will be made available upon request. Several clones that resulted from the mutational analysis were sequenced to confirm the mutation. Mutant clones with affected activity were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and the absence of unintended changes in the protein.Molecular Modeling—The crystal structure determined by Bell et al. (2Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The manual docking was performed in the Quanta molecular modeling environment (version 2000; Accelrys). The result was rendered using Pymol (version 0.99; DeLano Scientific LLC).Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 4 °C with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AnTi60 rotor. Data were obtained at 30,000 rpm using a two-channel centerpiece containing 1 mm protein or a buffer for reference. Absorbance was measured at 220 nm. The data were analyzed using the computer program SEDFIT and fitted with a Lamm equation to derive the molar mass and the sedimentation coefficient.Microscopy—Cells were plated on LabTek II CC2-treated chamber slides (Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and transfected with plasmids in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Each TLR3 mutant was visualized 24 h post-transfection with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope via immunofluorescence. Briefly, the cells were removed from the incubator and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline before fixation with 4% formal-dehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated at room temperature in the dark for at least 1 h in anti-TLR3 FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Imgenex315A; San Diego, CA). The cells were washed and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) before being mounted in a buffered glycerol aqueous mounting medium.Western Blots—293T cells were transiently transfected with WT TLR3, mutant TLR3, or control pcDNA as described above. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega) and sonicated to degrade chromosomal DNA. Equal amounts of proteins from each sample were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-TLR3 monoclonal antibody IMG315A (Imgenex Inc.). The blots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL-plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).FACS Analysis—FACS analyses were performed with 293T cells grown in 6-well collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/well. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of the appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Eighteen to twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 3% fetal bovine serum, and 0.04% sodium azide) before suspension at ∼2 × 107 cells/ml in FACS buffer. The cells were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human TLR3 monoclonal antibody (TLR3.7; purchased from eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or a negative control mouse IgG1 control antibody. The antibodies were added to cells grown in 96-well plates and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark. The cells were washed twice with FACS buffer to remove unbound antibody and then suspended in FACS buffer. Viaprobe (BD Biosciences) was used to exclude dead cells. The cells were transferred to the appropriate tubes and analyzed using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNF-κB Activation Assay for TLR3 Function—HEK 293T cells were used to analyze how mutations in TLR3 will affect TLR3 function and localization as described in Sun et al. (10Sun J.C. Duffy K.E. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J. Masarapu H. Cunningham M. Holzenburg A. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11144-11151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 293T cells are useful for this assay, since they do not express detectable levels of endogenous TLR3 (Fig. 1A, box). Briefly, cells cultured in 96-well plates to ∼80% confluence were transfected with a mixture of three plasmids: one to express either WT or mutant TLR3, a second to express the firefly luciferase driven from promoter-containing NF-κB binding sites, and a third to express the transfection control, Renilla luciferase, from the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter. Poly(I:C) was used as the ligand to induce TLR3-mediated NF-κB activation. Every TLR3 activity assay result in this work was from a minimum of six independently transfected cell cultures.Our assay can respond to up to 75 ng of the TLR3 plasmid in the transfection (Fig. 1A), but our standard assay uses 15 ng of plasmid per transfection to ensure that the signal will not be saturated. The ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity was calculated for all of the samples induced with poly(I:C) as well as with the buffer alone control. The -fold of poly(I:C) activation over the uninduced control was normalized for each transfection and normalized to the WT control assayed in the same experiment. A minimum of 4-fold induction of TLR3 activity by the addition of poly(I:C) was detected in all of our assays (Fig. 1B). As an example, a mutant TLR3 can reduce activity to background (Fig. 1B).Cysteines Involved in Disulfide Bond Formation—Cysteines that putatively form disulfide bonds to cap the ends of the ECD are as follows: Cys28 and Cys37, Cys95 and Cys122, Cys649 and Cys677, and Cys651 and Cys696 (Fig. 2A) (1Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 2Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The cysteines are conserved in all species in which the TLR3 orthologs have been identified, suggesting that the disulfide bonds they form are important for TLR3 function (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Detection of disulfide bonds in the hTLR3 ECD. A, a hTLR3 ECD structure (Protein Data Bank code 2A0Z) showing the residues near the N- and C-terminal portions of the TLR3 ECD, which participate in disulfide bond formation.

The bottom spectrum is the reduced and alkylated form of the peptide. D, tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the above peptide to confirm the assigned peptide sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We first attempted to determine whether the formation of the disulfides could be detected in tryptic fragments of TLR3 ECD using mass spectrometry (Fig. 2C). Reduced cysteines are acetylated by iodoacetamide, and the ones involved in disulfide bond formation are not. The mass spectrometry spectra obtained in the nonreduced tryptic digest resulted in a signal at 1526.81 m/z, which corresponds to the modified peptide CTVSHEVADCSHLK if a disulfide was originally present (Fig. 2C, top). To confirm the sequence and structural assignment of this peptide, tandem mass spectrometry was performed (Fig. 2D). Nearly the entire C-terminal y ion series (y2-y9) was observed, confirming the peptide sequence assignment. More significant is the observation that the b series ions b10 - b13 were all 2 Da lower than what would be expected for the reduced peptide (16Gorman J.J. Wallis T.P. Pitt J.J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2002; 21: 183-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These results confirm the presence of a disulfide bond between Cys28 and Cys37. The other three pairs of disulfides were not observed despite repeated attempts, suggesting that they may either be present at lower abundances or that the peptides containing these disulfides could not be ionized under the conditions used.To assess the functional relevance of the disulfide bonds, we mutated each participating cysteine to alanine. Mutants C28A, C37A, C95A, C122A, C649A, C651A, and C696A all resulted in TLR3 activities near background (Fig. 3A). We also examined whether replacements of some of the cysteines with serine or methionines would affect activity. All of the changes made in Cys37, Cys95, Cys122, Cys649, Cys651, and Cys696 resulted in activities at or near the background level. Therefore, the cysteines involved in disulfide bond formation are required for TLR3 function. In contrast, mutations of cysteines that are not predicted to participate in disulfide bond formation (Cys242, Cys356, or both) had only minimal effects on TLR3 activity (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Effects of the mutations in the cysteines involved in the disulfide bond formation.

To examine whether TLR3 expression was affected, lysates from transfected cells were subjected to Western blots with a TLR3-specific monoclonal antibody. All cysteine mutants were expressed at levels comparable with WT (Fig. 3B). To examine whether the mutant proteins are affected in their intracellular localization, we immunostained transfected HEK 293T cells and observed that TLR3 was primarily localized to intracellular acidic organelles in a punctate distribution, consistent with the results of Funami et al. (17Funami K. Matsumoto M. Oshiumi H. Akazawa T. Yamamoto A. Seya T. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 1143-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The spots co-localized with acidic vesicles that can be stained with LysoTracker (data not shown). Mutant C242A, which is not implicated in disulfide bond formation and suffered no significant loss of activity in the cell-based assay, has an appearance similar to WT TLR3 (Fig. 3C). Among the mutants involved in disulfide bond formation, C651A and C696A had suffered no obvious changes to WT TLR3 localization (data not shown), whereas C37A and C122A had more diffused signals rather than discrete spots (Fig. 3C). A brighter signal was also seen throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting some loss of localization to intracellular vesicles.We also examined the cell surface distribution for mutants C37A and C122A by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. C37A and C122A were reduced for cell surface expression (Fig. 3D). We concluded that all cysteines involved in disulfide bond formation in TLR3 are important for activity, and the mutants are expressed at levels comparable with WT, but some are affected in their intracellular localization. This change in localization could contribute to the loss of TLR3 activity.Loop1—Structures that project out from the central solenoid structure of TLR3 ECD could provide features important for TLR3 function. A loop within the LRRs of TLR9 has been hypothesized to interact with the ligand, CpG DNA (18Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). TLR3 has two loops in the ECD solenoid. The first, called Loop1, resides in LRR12 (residues 335-343) and is rich in serine residues (Fig. 4, A and B). An examination of the sequence of Loop1 revealed that it is variable in its sequence and length. For example, whereas the mammalian Loop1 is composed of eight residues, the equivalents from fish have only six residues (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Examination of the role of Loop1 in TLR3 function. A, a partial model of TLR3 showing the relative location of Loop1. B, a comparison of the sequences in Loop1 from different species.

Bar in the lower micrograph, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We replaced the central six residues of Loop1 (SISLAS) with the six-residue sequence, CCPGCC, that could bind the FlAsH dye (19Griffin B.A. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 281: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Our intention was to fluorescently label TLR3 by its binding to the FlAsH dye. However, this construct, LI-TCM, did not bind the FlAsH dye, perhaps due to steric constraints. Nonetheless, the construct was as active as the WT for NF-κB reporter activity (Fig. 4C). Next, we changed four of the residues in Loop1 from QSISLASL to QSTALTSH in a construct named L1-4M. Again, more than 85% of the TLR3 activity was retained. Last, we deleted Loop1 altogether (ΔL1) and found the resultant construct to retain greater than 80% of the WT TLR3 activity (Fig. 4C). Western analysis showed that the proteins were made similar to WT (Fig. 4D). In localization experiments, ΔL1 formed intracellular specks in a manner indistinguishable from WT (Fig. 4E). These results demonstrate that Loop1 is not essential for TLR3 function.Loop2—The second loop in TLR3 ECD resides within LRR20 (residues 547-554) (Fig. 5A). Unlike Loop1, several residues are highly conserved (Fig. 5B). When the tetracysteine motif was inserted into the apex of Loop2, construct L2-TCM resulted in a protein that retained 82% of the activity of the WT (Fig. 5C). Replacement of the Loop2 sequence in TLR3 with the comparable sequence from Takifugu in construct L2-Fugu retained 75% of TLR3 function, confirming that there is some flexibility of the Loop2 sequence. However, a deletion of Loop2 in construct ΔL2 resulted in activity near background (Fig. 5C). Both the level of ΔL2 protein and its intracellular distribution were similar to WT (Fig. 5E). Additional examination of Loop2 along with other defective mutants will be presented below.FIGURE 5Examination of the role of Loop2 on TLR3 function.

https://openalex.org/W2008214995,"Interactions of E. coli lac repressor (LacR) with a pair of operator sites on the same DNA molecule can lead to the formation of looped nucleoprotein complexes both in vitro and in vivo. As a major paradigm for loop-mediated gene regulation, parameters such as operator affinity and spacing, repressor concentration, and DNA bending induced by specific or non-specific DNA-binding proteins (e.g., HU), have been examined extensively. However, a complete and rigorous model that integrates all of these aspects in a systematic and quantitative treatment of experimental data has not been available. Applying our recent statistical-mechanical theory for DNA looping, we calculated repression as a function of operator spacing (58-156 bp) from first principles and obtained excellent agreement with independent sets of in-vivo data. The results suggest that a linear extended, as opposed to a closed v-shaped, LacR conformation is the dominant form of the tetramer in vivo. Moreover, loop-mediated repression in wild-type E. coli strains is facilitated by decreased DNA rigidity and high levels of flexibility in the LacR tetramer. In contrast, repression data for strains lacking HU gave a near-normal value of the DNA persistence length. These findings underscore the importance of both protein conformation and elasticity in the formation of small DNA loops widely observed in vivo, and demonstrate the utility of quantitatively analyzing gene regulation based on the mechanics of nucleoprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2015808098,"The facilitating chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, a heterodimer of SSRP1 and Spt16, has been shown to regulate transcription elongation through a chromatin template in vitro and on specific genes in cells. However, its global role in transcription regulation in human cells remains largely elusive. We conducted spotted microarray analyses using arrays harboring 8308 human genes to assess the gene expression profile after knocking down SSRP1 or Spt16 levels in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (H1299) cells. Although the changes of these transcripts were surprisingly subtle, there were ∼170 genes whose transcript levels were either reduced or induced >1.5-fold. Approximately 106 genes with >1.2-fold change at the level of transcripts were the common targets of both SSRP1 and Spt16 (∼1.3%). A subset of genes was regulated by SSRP1 independent of Spt16. Further analyses of some of these genes not only verified this observation but also identified the serum-responsive gene, egr1, as a novel target for both SSRP1 and Spt16. We further showed that SSRP1 and Spt16 are important for the progression of elongation RNA pol II on the egr1 gene. These results suggest that SSRP1 has Spt16-dependent and -independent roles in regulating gene transcription in human cells.

These results suggest that SSRP1 has Spt16-dependent and -independent roles in regulating gene transcription in human cells. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged with core histones and other chromosomal proteins in the form of chromatin, which limits the accessibility of DNA and inhibits the progression of RNA polymerases as they copy genetic information from the DNA. Thus altering the repressive nature of chromatin is necessary for the cells to implement all of the nuclear activities on chromatin (1Formosa T. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 171-201PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three types of protein complexes for this function (1Formosa T. Curr. Top Microbiol.

The first type acts by covalently modifying the histones and non-histone chromatin proteins through phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, and/or methylation (1Formosa T. Curr. Top Microbiol.

The second type of complex uses ATP hydrolysis to mobilize and/or to alter the structure of nucleosomes, such as the SWI/SNF complex (2Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Biochem.

Both Spt16 and SSRP1 are highly conserved in all eukaryotes. Human Spt16 is a 120-kDa protein and contains a highly acidic and serine-rich carboxyl terminus. It binds to H2A-H2B dimers and to mononucleosomes (10Belotserkovskaya R. Oh S. Bondarenko V.A. Orphanides G. Studitsky V.M. Reinberg D. Science. 2003; 301: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). It has 36% identity to its Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog Spt16/Cdc68 (10Belotserkovskaya R. Oh S. Bondarenko V.A. Orphanides G. Studitsky V.M. Reinberg D. Science. 2003; 301: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The yeast Spt16/Cdc68 was identified in two independent screens for genes involved in transcription regulation (11Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell.

Genetic studies in yeast suggest that Spt16/Cdc68 is required for the normal transcription of many loci (11Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has both positive and negative effects on gene expression (12Rowley A. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Spt16/Cdc68 is essential for yeast cell growth because spt16 null mutants are nonviable (11Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of how Spt16/Cdc68 affects transcription is suggested by the placement of Spt16/Cdc68 into a histone group of spt (suppressor of TY) genes that encode histones and also functionally related proteins, including Spt4, Spt5, Spt6, Spt11 and Spt12 (11Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This group of proteins functions by altering chromatin properties and increasing or decreasing their dosage affects on transcription regulation (13Evans D.R. Brewster N.K. Xu Q. Rowley A.

Similar to Spt16, SSRP1 also has an acidic and serine-rich carboxyl terminus that most likely facilitates its binding to histone proteins.

Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition to its general role, SSRP1 also functions as a co-regulator for several transcription activators, such as serum-response factor (SRF) (30Spencer J.A. Baron M.H. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15686-15693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and p63 (31Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite the current knowledge, it remains obscure if SSRP1 has an Spt16-independent role in gene regulation. Also, it is still unclear if FACT plays a global or gene-specific role in transcriptional regulation in human cells. To address these questions, we generated tet-inducible siRNA cell lines for each of these two proteins using H1299 cells that are p53-deficient (31Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using these cell lines, we performed spotted microarray analysis and found that the expression of many genes was altered after ablation of the endogenous SSRP1 or Spt16 levels by siRNA. Surprisingly, the effect was moderate. However, there was a subset of genes (∼170) whose expression was either up-regulated or down-regulated after induction of siRNA against SSRP1 or Spt16. We further characterized some of the genes that displayed more apparent changes and found that SSRP1 and Spt16 shared common targets, as well as individually regulated genes. In particular, we identified the serum-responsive gene, egr1 (early growth response 1), as a novel target for both SSRP1 and Spt16. Either SSRP1 or Spt16 was indispensable for the expression of EGR1 in response to serum stimulation. We further elucidated that SSRP1 and Spt16 are important for the progression of RNA pol II on the coding region of the egr1 gene. Hence, our study suggests that SSRP1 and Spt16 indeed work together for the expression of a number of genes, whereas SSRP1 also appears to have an independent role in regulating the expression of a subset of genes in human cells.

Oligomers of ssrp1 siRNA, spt16 siRNA, and scrambled siRNA (5′-AAGCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTC-3′) were synthesized (Dharmacon). pcDNA3-FLAG-SSRP1 was described previously (31Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Anti-SSRP1 and anti-Spt16 antibodies were used for Western blot assays, as described previously (31Zeng S.X. Dai M.S.

Mouse monoclonal SSRP1 antibody 5B10 was generated by Zymed Laboratories Inc. and purified as described previously (20Landais I. Lee H. Lu H. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1866-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The anti-EGR1, anti-SRF, and anti-Spt16 (used in chromatin immunoprecipitation assay) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The mouse monoclonal RNA polymerase II H5 antibody, which recognizes the RNA pol II Ser-2 phospho-isoform, was purchased from Babco-Covance. The anti-FLAG, anti-α-tubulin, rabbit polyclonal IgG, mouse monoclonal IgG, and mouse monoclonal IgM antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Generation of Inducible Tet-On Cell Line—H1299pcDNA6-TR cells, which stably express the tet repressor, were transfected with pHtetoScramble, pHtetoSSRP1siRNA, or pHtetoSpt16siRNA plasmid and then selected in the medium containing 90 μg/ml hygromycin. Individual colonies were expanded into 12-well plates. To induce the siRNA expression, doxycycline was added to the media at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After doxycycline induction, cells were harvested for cell lysate preparation. SSRP1 or Spt16 expression level was checked by Western blot with anti-SSRP1 or anti-Spt16 antibodies. The colonies, which express significantly reduced levels of SSRP1 or Spt16, were maintained and used for further study. Spotted Microarray—One clone for each cell line (clone 19 of H1299pHtetoSSRP1siRNA and clone 20 of H1299pHteto-Spt16siRNA) was used in the spotted microarray experiment. RNA for the Tet-On (doxycycline treatment) samples and the Tet-Off (no doxycycline treatment) samples were prepared from three independent experiments using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. RNAs prepared from the SSRP1 and Spt16 siRNA Tet-Off samples were pooled as a control to compare between SSRP1siRNA and Spt16siRNA samples. The samples were sent to the Microarray Core at Oregon Health & Science University. The SMChumC8400A array was used in the experiment. All samples were amplified using linear T7 amplification (Message-Amp, Ambion) and examined for integrity using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent). Reverse transcription was used to synthesize a cDNA containing aminoallyl-modified dUTP (CyScribe Post-labeling; Amersham Biosciences). Using aminoallyl-modified dUTP in both strands eliminates the requirement for dye swap experiments. Aminoallyl-modified cDNA was incubated with Cy-dye esters for a nonenzymatic and covalent attachment of either Cy5 or Cy3 to the cDNA. The experimental sample was labeled with Cy5, and the control sample was labeled with Cy3. Following cleanup, selected Cy5 and Cy3 targets were combined and applied to each of two identical slides. Arrays were hybridized using M-series LifterSlips (Erie Scientific) and deep well hybridization chambers (TeleChem). Hybridized arrays were scanned on a ScanArray 4000 XL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using ScanArray Express software, and ImaGene (BioDiscovery) was used to extract data from the image. The resulting data file was loaded into GeneSight for normalization using intensity-based local regression (Lowess). The normalized data were used for further segregation and clustering as described in the figure legend. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells after different treatments, using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol or Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. Reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNA was performed in a 20-μl reaction using SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) reagent, dNTP, and oligo(dT)15 primer. After reverse transcription, 30 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate H2O was added to the reaction. 1 μl of reverse transcription reaction was used in the following PCRs with the following primers: egr1 F, 5′-CTGACCGCAGAGTCTTTTCCTG-3′, and R, 5′-TGGGTGCCGCTGAGTAAATG-3′; dusp5 F, 5′-GTGTTGCGTGGATGTAAAACCC-3′, and R, 5′-GCTCCTCCTCTGCTTGATGTAATC-3′; plau F, 5′-CACACACTGCTTCATTGATTACCC-3′, and R, 5′-TTTTGGTGGTGACTTCAGAGCC-3′; id2 F, 5′-CGTGAGGTCCGTTAGGAAAAACAG-3′, and R, 5′-CTGACAATAGTGGGATGCGAGTC-3′; gapdh F, 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′, and R, 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′; ssrp1 F, 5′-GAGCGATGACTCAGGAGAAG-3′, and R, 5′-TTACTCATCGGATCCTG-3′; spt16 F, 5′-AGATATGTGACGTGTATAACG-3′, and R, 5′-CTTCAGCTTCTCGAGTTTTAT-3′; and β-actin F, 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′, and R, 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′. Real Time PCR—1 μl of RT reaction was used in the real time PCR. A 15-μl reaction was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and amplified on the ABI7900HT. Threshold cycles (Ct) for three replicate reactions were determined using SDS2. The relative transcript abundance was calculated following normalization with the GAPDH amplicon. The data for p21 and EGR1 were collected at 80 °C, and the data for other target genes were collected at 83 °C. The following primers were used: egr1 F, 5′-CCTCCCTCTCTACTGGAGTGGAA-3′, and R, 5′-GAAGAACTTGGACATGGCTGTTTC-3′; dusp5 F, 5′-CTCAGGGTAGGTTCTCGGGACT-3′, and R, 5′-GGCGAACTCTGAGGTGCAAG-3′; plau F, 5′-ATTCCTGCCAGGGAGACTCAG-3′, and R, 5′-TTGTCCTTCAGGGCACATCC-3′; id2 F, 5′-CAGTCCCGTGAGGTCCGTTA-3′, and R, 5′-CACCAGCTCCTTGAGCTTGG-3′; p21 F, 5′-CTGGACTGTTTTCTCTCGGCTC-3′, and R, 5′-TGTATATTCAGCATTGTGGGAGGA-3′; gapdh (83 °C) F, 5′-TGGAGTCCACTGGCGTCTTC-3′, and R, 5′-TTCACACCCATGACGAACATG-3′; and gapdh (80 °C) F, 5′-GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTC-3′, and R, 5′-AGCATCGCCCCACTTGATT-3′. Transient Transfection—H1299 cells (60% confluence in 60-mm plates) were transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FLAG-SSRP1 using TransFectin (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was extracted after 48 h of transfection. siRNA Transient Transfection and Serum Stimulation Assays—H1299 cells (60% confluence in 60-mm plates) were transfected with 30 nm of the scramble, SSRP1siRNA, or Spt16siRNA using SiLentFect (Bio-Rad). At the same time, DMEM containing 10% FBS was changed to DMEM containing 0.25% FBS for serum starvation. After 48 h, cells were cultured in DMEM with 20% FBS for serum stimulation. The cells were harvested at different time points for Western blotting or RNA extraction. For Western blotting, the cell lysates were prepared as described (31Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and 30 μg of cell lysates were used. Cell Growth Assays—H1299pHScramble, H1299pHtetoSSRP1siRNA, and H1299pHtetoSpt16siRNA inducible cell lines were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/60-mm plate and induced for siRNA expression by adding 5 μg/ml doxycycline to the media. After 4 days of induction, the cell number was counted, and viable cells were compared among the scrambled siRNA-, SSRP1siRNA-, and Spt16siRNA-expressing cells. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Real Time PCR—H1299 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.25% FBS for serum starvation. After 48 h, cells were switched to media containing 20% FBS and harvested at 0, 5, and 30 min post-serum stimulation. ChIP assays were carried out as described previously (31Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Gomes N.P. Bjerke G. Llorente B. Szostek S.A. Emerson B.M. Espinosa J.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with the indicated antibodies. After reverse of cross-linking, DNA was purified by miniprep kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer. 1 μl of ChIP DNA or input DNA was used as templates in real time PCRs. A 20-μl reaction was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and amplified on the ABI7300. Threshold cycles (Ct) for three replicate reactions were determined using the 7300 system SDS software. The relative fold change among the ChIP DNA samples was calculated following normalization with the input DNA. The following primers were used in the real time PCR: primers for negative control, egr1 upstream 5990F, 5′-CACGGCCTGAACAGTGCAC-3′, and egr1 upstream 5839R, 5′-AGAAAGCCAGTGGAACCATCC-3′; primers for promoter region, egr1 upstream 440F, 5′-CCCGGAAATGCCATATAAGGAGC-3′, and egr1 upstream 291R, 5′-AGTTCCCGCGTTGCCCCT-3′; egr1 upstream192F, 5′-GGGTGCAGGATGGAGGTGC-3′, and egr1 upstream 37R, 5′-TTGAAGGGTCTGGAACGGCA-3′; primers for coding region, egr1 downstream 1292F, 5′-AACGAGAAGGTGCTGGTGGA-3′, and egr1 downstream 1408R, 5′-CCACAAGGTGTTGCCACTGTT-3′; egr1 downstream 2705F, 5′-TCAGAGCCAAGTCCTCCCTCT-3′, and egr1 downstream 2836R, 5′-GAAGAACTTGGACATGGCTGTTTC-3′; c-myc downstream 4192F, CAGGCTCCTGGCAAAAGGT, and c-myc downstream 4266R, CAGTGGGCTGTGAGGAGGTT. The Establishment of siRNA-inducible Cell Lines—To determine whether SSRP1 and Spt16 are required for global or gene-specific transcription in human cells, we established inducible SSRP1 or Spt16 siRNA tet H1299 cell lines. In the presence of doxycycline, the expression of siRNA can be induced to down-regulate its target mRNA. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1, both the protein and the mRNA levels of either SSRP1 or Spt16 were markedly knocked down when the cells were cultured with doxycycline. As a control, the level of neither α-tubulin nor β-actin was changed in either of the SSRP1- or Spt16-knock-down cells. Also, the mRNA level of Spt16 was not changed in the SSRP1-knockdown cells and vice versa for the Spt16-knockdown cells. These results indicate that we have established tet-inducible siRNA cell lines for SSRP1 and Spt16, respectively. Reduction of SSRP1 or Spt16 Level by siRNA Alters the Transcription of a Common Set of Genes—To compare the gene expression profiles obtained from SSRP1- and Spt16-knock-down cells, we used a common reference (a pool of RNA samples from both of the siRNA cell lines without doxycycline treatment) in spotted microarray. The alterations of 8308 genes were compared between the SSRP1 and Spt16 siRNA samples (three samples per cell line). The genes with more than a 1.2-fold change in both SSRP1 siRNA and Spt16 siRNA samples were displayed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. This analysis revealed that ∼118 genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated with >1.2-fold change in both of the SSRP1 and Spt16 siRNA samples (supplemental Fig. S1A). Most of the genes (106 genes) appeared to be the common targets for both SSRP1 and Spt16, suggesting that the regulation of these genes may be executed by the FACT complex. There were more down-regulated genes (73 or 75 genes) than up-regulated genes (45 or 43 genes) in the SSRP1 or Spt16 siRNA samples. These results suggest that SSRP1 and Spt16 work together to enhance the expression of most of their target genes, although they may also act to repress the expression of a subset of genes in human cells. This result is consistent with previous results in yeast (12Rowley A. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the 118 genes should not be the final number of SSRP1 and Spt16 targets in human cells because the cDNA array used for our study only contained 8308 genes. For example, p21, a previously identified target for SSRP1 (31Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was not in this array. Even with this limited number of genes in the array, our gene expression profile data suggest that FACT may not play a global role in gene transcription, as only ∼1.3% of the tested genes (106 of 8308 genes) displayed similar changes at their transcript levels in both SSRP1 and Spt16 knockdown samples (supplemental Fig. S1A). To further analyze the 118 affected genes, we classified them into 10 different groups based on their functions in biological processes. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1B, they are involved in a broad spectrum of functions, including cell growth/maintenance (23 or 27 of 118), nucleic acid metabolism (19 or 21 of 118), signal transduction (8 or 9 of 118), protein metabolism (11 of 118), biosynthesis (3 of 118), cell adhesion (3 of 118), etc. Most of the SSRP1 and Spt16 target genes (73 or 81 of 118) encode either novel proteins with unknown functions or proteins with unclassified functions or hypothetical proteins, and thus are put into the unclassified group (supplemental Fig. S1B). These results indicate that SSRP1 and Spt16 have a relatively broad role in various cellular activities. However, a majority of them are involved in cell growth and/or maintenance and metabolism, which are essential for cell growth. These data support the notion that SSRP1 and Spt16 are essential for cell viability (17Wittmeyer J. Joss L. Formosa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8961-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, ablation of either SSRP1 or Spt16 by inducible siRNA in H1299 cells severely reduced the number of viable cells (supplemental Fig. S1D). This result was also repeated in 293 cells (data not shown). It was surprising that the changes of gene expression were no more than 4-fold after knockdown of SSRP1 or Spt16 (supplemental Fig. S1, A and C; Tables 1, 2, 3). These moderate changes could be due to two possibilities"
https://openalex.org/W1990366000,"The interaction of C1q with specific cells of the immune system induces activities, such as enhancement of phagocytosis in monocytes and stimulation of superoxide production in neutrophils. In contrast to some other monocyte activators, C1q itself does not induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production, but rather inhibits the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated induction of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines and induces expression of interleukin-10. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which C1q exerts this effect on gene expression, the influence of C1q on the activation of transcription factors of the NFκB family and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was assessed. C1q treatment increased κB binding activity in freshly isolated human monocytes in a time-dependent fashion as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In antibody supershift experiments, anti-p50 antibody supershifted the C1q-induced NFκB complex, whereas anti-p65 antibody had little effect, suggesting that C1q induced the translocation of NFκB p50p50 homodimers. This is in contrast to the dominant induction of p65 containing complexes in parallel monocyte cultures stimulated with LPS. C1q treatment also induced cAMP response element (CRE)-binding activity as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, increased phosphorylation of CREB, and induction of CRE driven gene expression. In contrast, CREB activation was not detected in LPS-treated monocytes. These results suggest that C1q may modulate the cytokine profile expressed in response to inflammatory stimuli (e.g. LPS), by triggering inhibitory and/or competing signals. Because C1q and other defense collagens have been shown to enhance clearance of apoptotic cells, this regulatory pathway may be beneficial in avoiding autoimmunity and/or resolving inflammation.

The transcription factor complexes of the NFκB family have attracted widespread attention because of their rapid induction, the wide range of genes whose expression is influenced by these complexes, and the apparent consequences of its induction in several diseases (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). The NFκB/Rel family of transcription factors, which include p65, p50, p52, RelB, and c-Rel, form homo- and heterodimers resulting in distinct transcription factor complexes that regulate expression of many different genes (2Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwartz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NFκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, the inhibitory protein IκBα dissociates from specific pre-existing cytoplasmic NFκB complexes, allowing the transcription factors to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the expression of target genes (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar).

Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged LPS activation can also induce expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in monocytes, perhaps an important step in regulation of inflammation (4De Waal Malefyt R. Abrams R. Bennett B. Figdor C.G. De Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). Studies suggest that a number of different elements are able to stimulate IL-10 production, including the transcription factors cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and ATF-1 (5Platzer C.

The CREB/ATF family of transcription factors are leucine zipper proteins that bind to the CRE consensus sequence, 5′-TGACGTCA-3′. CREB, the most extensively studied CRE-binding protein, is phosphorylated at serine 133, and this leads to transcriptional activation of genes whose promoters contain the CRE sequence, such as IL-10 (4De Waal Malefyt R.

Signal. 2004; 16: 1211-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) such as protein kinase A, calmodulin kinase, the pp90rsk family of serine/threonine kinases, or protein kinase C. Human C1q, the recognition component of the classical complement cascade, activates human monocytes from peripheral blood resulting in the enhancement of phagocytosis (8Bobak D.A. Frank M.M. Tenner A.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Bobak D.A. Gaither T.G. Frank M.M. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1150-1156PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has also been shown that C1q can play a prominent role in the clearance of apoptotic cells (10Korb L.C. Ahearn J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4525-4528PubMed Google Scholar, 11Botto M.

Med. 2001; 194: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Often concomitant with an activation process, monocytes/macrophages initiate synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, we found that C1q does not trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in human monocytes even under the same conditions in which the enhancement of phagocytosis is seen. Furthermore, C1q down-regulates the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1α and -β in response to LPS and up-regulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (14Fraser D.A. Bohlson S.S. Jasinskiene N. Rawal N. Palmarini G. Ruiz S. Rochford R. Tenner A.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the molecular mechanism by which C1q exerts this effect, an analysis of the influence of C1q on the activation of transcription factors of the NFκB family and CREB was initiated. Media, Reagents, and Antibodies—Raw264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-alanyl l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 nm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Monocytes were cultured in, and luciferase assays were carried out in serum-free HL-1 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 1% l-alanyl-l-glutamine. The human serum albumin (HSA), produced for the American Red Cross by Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Glendale, CA), was obtained from FFF (Temecula, CA). LPS (from Escherichia coli serotype 0127: B8) was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents, except where noted otherwise, were obtained in the highest quality available from Sigma. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies anti-C/EBP-α, anti-CREB-1 (sc-186X), anti-p65 (sc-372X), and anti-p50 (sc-7178X and sc-1190X) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphorylated-CREB (pCREB) (06-519) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit sera 1141, 1207, 1267, and 1319 (against a synthetic peptide mapping within the amino terminus of human p50, human p65, human p52, and human Rel B, respectively) and 1136 (against a synthetic peptide mapping the internal region of human cRel) were generously provided by Dr. Nancy Rice (NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health). C1q was isolated from plasma-derived human serum by the method of Tenner et al. (15Tenner A.J. Lesavre P.H. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 648-653PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Young et al. (16Young K.R. Ambrus Jr., J.L. Malbran A. Fauci A.S. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3356-3364PubMed Google Scholar). The preparations used were fully active as determined by hemolytic titration and homogeneous as assessed by SDS-PAGE, and free of endotoxin to below 1 pg/ml in the C1q concentrations used in these studies as assayed by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (BioWhittaker). Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient (E1%) at 280 nm of 6.82 for C1q (17Reid K.B.M. Lowe D.M. Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 749-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Monocyte Isolation and Stimulation—Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by counterflow elutriation using a modification of the technique of Lionetti et al. (18Lionetti F.J. Hunt S.M. Valera C.R. Methods of Cell Separation. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980Google Scholar) as described. Blood units were collected into CPDA1 at the University of California, Irvine, Medical Center Blood Bank or General Clinical Research Center (Orange, CA). Usually more than 90% of the cells in each preparation were monocytes according to size analysis on a Coulter Channelyzer. For each monocyte preparation, the ability of the cells to respond to C1q with an enhancement of phagocytosis was verified (9Bobak D.A. Gaither T.G. Frank M.M. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1150-1156PubMed Google Scholar). LabTek chambers (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were coated with C1q or HSA (8–16 μg/ml) in coating buffer (0.1 m carbonate, pH 9.6) for 2 h and after washing in phosphate-buffered saline, monocytes in HL-1 media were added, centrifuged at 700 × g for 3 min, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then stimulated with different concentrations of LPS as described in the text. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, or by following a modification of the procedure of Schreiber et al. (19Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Dignam et al. (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acid Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9145) Google Scholar). Briefly, one-well LabTek chambers coated with C1q or HSA were incubated with 5 × 106 monocytes for 30 min. The cells were then stimulated with 30 ng/ml of LPS for the times indicated in the text. Cells were collected by scraping and pelleted in a Sorvall RT6000 centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and spun down at 1,500 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Phosphate-buffered saline was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm sucrose, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/μl of α1-antitrypsin and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) by gently pipetting. After 5–10 min on ice, the nuclei were pelleted by quick spinning at 16,000 × g. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was transferred to a new tube and the nuclei were washed with buffer A and then resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 μg/μl of α1-antitrypsin) and lysed on ice for 30 min. The nuclear extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant fractions were frozen in aliquots at -70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin for the standard curve. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (21Barchowsky A. Dudek E.J. Treadwell M.D. Wetterhahn K.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 22Shumilla J.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Barchowsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar): 10 μg of extracted nuclear protein was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus CRE sequence (Promega), the consensus binding sequence for NFκB (Promega, Madison, WI), or the κB3 site as described in Baer et al. (23Baer M. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Sedon C. Nedospasov S. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5678-5689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature in the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) with 1 μg of poly(dI:dC) (Amersham Biosciences). Non-radiolabeled specific and nonspecific duplex probe were added to the nuclear extracts in binding assay buffer and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before 32P-probe addition to assess the specificity of the EMSA interaction. Samples were then resolved on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and visualized using a phosphorimager. To identify the proteins binding to the radiolabeled probe, specific antibody (1 μl per reaction) was added to nuclear extracts and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 32P-Probe was then added and the mixture incubated for an additional 30 min before electrophoresis as described above. Trans-AM NFκB ELISA—The Trans-AM NFκB kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) was used to determine the levels of p65 and p50 in nuclear extracts as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 μg of nuclear extract, diluted to 20 μl, was added to the wells coated with oligonucleotides containing the NFκB consensus binding site. The primary antibodies used to detect NFκB recognize an epitope on p65 or p50 that is accessible only when NFκB is activated and bound to its target DNA. Following addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and substrate, absorbance was read at 450 nm (with a reference wavelength at 650 nm). To monitor the specificity of the assay, competitive binding assays were performed. Wild-type or mutated consensus oligonucleotides were added to the wells containing immobilized oligonucleotides before the addition of nuclear extracts. Cell Extract and Western Blotting—Monocytes stimulated with C1q or HSA control were harvested into lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1.25 mm sodium orthovanadate) that was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and incubated on ice for 30 min (for CREB Western blots). Nuclear extracts of C1q or HSA control-stimulated monocytes for NFκB Western blots were prepared as for the Trans-AM NFκB ELISA. 20 (whole cell extract) or 10 μg (nuclear extract) of soluble extract per lane was separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked overnight with blocking buffer containing 3% dry milk in TBST (0.05% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) before addition of antibodies to the protein of interest. Antibody reactivity on the Western blots was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Induction of NFκBor CREB transcriptional activity was evaluated using a luciferase reporter gene driven by κ enhancer, pNFκB (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), or CRE (Promega). The IL-10 promoter construct was kindly provided by Dr. A. Kumar, University of Ottawa, Canada (24Gee K. Angel J.B. Ma W. Mishra S. Gajanayaka N. Parato K. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31647-31658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells (NFκB) or THP-1 cells (CRE, IL-10) were transfected with the luciferase reporter construct together with pRL-TK Renilla luciferase internal control vector (Promega) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were replated in HL-1 into two-well Lab-Tek chambers precoated with HSA or C1q and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition of LPS for the time stated. Cells were then harvested and the firefly luciferase activity and the Renilla luciferase activity were measured using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity to control for variability in transfection efficiency and to calculate the relative luciferase activity. C1q Induces NFκB Activity in Human Monocytes—In recent studies, we and others have found that C1q modulates cytokine expression by human monocytes or human peripheral blood-derived dendritic cells (14Fraser D.A. Bohlson S.S. Jasinskiene N. Rawal N. Palmarini G. Ruiz S. Rochford R. Tenner A.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Nauta A.J. Castellano G. Xu W. Woltman A.M. Borrias M.C. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. Roos A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3044-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In human monocytes, C1q decreased expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-1α, and increased the expression of IL-10 (14Fraser D.A. Bohlson S.S. Jasinskiene N. Rawal N. Palmarini G. Ruiz S. Rochford R. Tenner A.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because LPS stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through activation of NFκB, we hypothesized that C1q might be inhibiting the NFκB activation by LPS. Nuclear extracts from human monocytes stimulated with C1q ± LPS were analyzed by EMSA for NFκB binding. Although a basal level of nuclear NF-κB binding activity was present, LPS stimulation induced an increase in NFκB binding activity in nuclear extracts, as expected (Fig. 1). Incubation of monocytes with C1q also reproducibly induced an increase in NFκB binding activity in nuclear extracts both in the presence and absence of LPS (Fig. 1). Unlabeled NFκB probe strongly competed for complex formation, whereas the nonspecific SP1 probe did not (Fig. 1, right lanes), indicating that the complexes activated by C1q and LPS, detected by EMSAs, are specific for the NFκB binding sequence and do not represent nonspecific binding. NFκB DNA Binding Activity Stimulated by C1q Is due to p50p50 Homodimers—The opposing effects of C1q and LPS on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, lead to investigation of the identity of the NF-κB-specific components involved in C1q-induced binding by performing antibody competition EMSAs. As expected, in LPS-stimulated extracts, complex formation with the NFκB probe was either inhibited by anti-p65 or supershifted by anti-p50 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, anti-p50 supershifted C1q-stimulated NFκB complexes, whereas little inhibition of complex formation was seen with anti-p65 suggesting that C1q-stimulated complexes are predominantly p50p50 homodimers (Fig. 2A). Antibodies to other Rel family members (p52, c-Rel, and Rel-B) did not inhibit or supershift the protein-oligonucleotide complex formation (data not shown). The C1q-induced enhancement in NFκB binding was also seen using oligos corresponding to the κB3 site of the murine tumor necrosis factor α promoter (data not shown), which is known to preferentially bind p50 homodimers in vitro (23Baer M. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Sedon C. Nedospasov S. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5678-5689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, whereas C/EBP-α has been detected by others in association with NFκB complexes, antibodies to C/EBP-α did not induce supershift of C1q-induced NFκB complexes (data not shown). In both an ELISA-based assay of p65 and p50 nuclear translocation and Western blots, nuclear localization of p50 but not p65 was enhanced by C1q in comparison to the HSA control (Fig. 3A). In the ELISA, nuclear migration of p50 was rapid, and increased by an average of 3-fold after a 1-h treatment of monocytes with C1q relative to HSA both in the absence and presence of LPS (values of -fold enhancement by C1q ranged from 1.6 to 6.2, and 2.2 to 5.4, respectively, n = 3). Relative levels of p50 but not p65 in the nucleus of C1q-treated monocytes were still enhanced above HSA controls at 2 h (1.6–2.4-fold in the presence of LPS), returning to baseline after 18 h. In this assay, the wild-type consensus oligonucleotide, when used as a competitor for NFκB, completely inhibited NFκB binding to the probe immobilized on the plate (as assessed by both detecting antibodies). However, the mutated consensus oligonucleotide had no effect on the binding of NFκB (data not shown) demonstrating that binding of NFκB to the consensus oligonucleotide was specific. These results were also confirmed by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts using antibodies to p50 and p65 (Fig. 3B). Analysis of band intensities by densitometry showed a greater than 2-fold increase of p50 in the nucleus of monocytes that had been incubated for 2 h on C1q (both with and without LPS) compared with the HSA control cells (Fig. 3C). However, levels of p65 were not greatly altered by incubation on C1q (less than 2-fold). Complete separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments was confirmed by re-probing blots with antibodies to nuclear protein histone-H1 and cytoplasmic protein actin (Fig. 3B). C1q Inhibits LPS-induced NFκB-mediated Transcription— To further validate the effect of C1q on transcriptional activity of NFκB, a luciferase reporter gene expressed under the control of κB elements was transfected into RAW 264.7 cells, murine macrophage-derived cells that are known to induce NFκB activity upon stimulation with LPS (26Ohmori Y. Tebo J. Nedospasov S. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17684-17690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, RAW 264.7 cells are capable of phagocytosing IgG-opsonized targets and respond to C1q with an enhancement of phagocytosis (data not shown). Incubation of transfected cells with C1q alone did not induce NFκB-driven luciferase activity, whereas incubation with LPS increased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, as expected (Fig. 4A, left). However, cells that adhered to C1q and then stimulated with LPS showed significant inhibition of this LPS-induced transactivation (Fig. 4, A and B, left, n = 3). These data demonstrate that C1q mediates an inhibition of NFκB-stimulated promoter activity. Such inhibition may therefore play a significant role in C1q modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in phagocytic cells. In contrast, C1q enhanced IL-10 promoter-driven expression in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4A, right) by 2–2.6-fold in the absence of LPS or presence of 10–100 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 4B), supporting the previously reported C1q-induced up-regulation of IL-10 expression in primary monocytes. C1q Activates CREB—Activation of the transcription factor CREB is regulated by phosphorylation at serine 133 (7Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1211-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of monocyte extracts with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated CREB showed that C1q induces rapid (within 5 min) phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 5). No such induction with LPS (30 ng/ml) was observed (data not shown). Activated CREB is known to engage CREB-binding protein (CBP), and thus could compete with NFκB p65p50 for limiting amounts of CBP, a component required for optimal p65p50-dependent transcription (27Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). This would provide an additional or alternative mechanism for the C1q-mediated inhibition of LPS-triggered pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with C1q and/or LPS were also analyzed for DNA binding activity by gel shift assay using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing the consensus DNA binding sequence for transcription factor CREB. The CRE-DNA binding activity was increased by C1q, whereas LPS did not induce CRE-DNA binding activity (Fig. 6). The C1q-induced CRE binding was inhibited by anti-Creb1 (data not shown). The complex formation was also inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled CRE-oligonucleotide, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled SP-1 oligonucleotide showing that this complex is specific for CRE-binding protein. The transcriptional activity of C1q-activated CREB was measured using a luciferase reporter gene assay. Constructs containing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of CRE elements were transfected into THP-1 cells. Adherence of transfected cells to immobilized C1q resulted in enhanced levels of luciferase activity compared with control cells (Fig. 7). In this study, we explore the molecular basis for our observation that C1q can inhibit LPS-induced expression of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhance secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (14Fraser D.A. Bohlson S.S. Jasinskiene N. Rawal N. Palmarini G. Ruiz S. Rochford R. Tenner A.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by LPS has been shown to involve κB sequence motifs and transcriptional factors from the Rel family (29Collart M.A. Baeuerle P.A. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp.

Each member has a conserved Rel homology domain responsible for DNA-binding, dimerization, and interaction with IκB family members. Di"

A key protein in the maintenance of the electrochemical composition of the endolymph is the Na,K-ATPase. In this study, we have looked for the presence in the rat inner ear of members of the FXYD protein family, recently identified as tissue-specific modulators of Na,K-ATPase. Only FXYD6 is detected at the protein level. FXYD6 is expressed in various epithelial cells bordering the endolymph space and in the auditory neurons. FXYD6 co-localizes with Na,K-ATPase in the stria vascularis and can be co-immunoprecipitated with Na,K-ATPase. After expression in Xenopus oocytes, FXYD6 associates with Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 and α1-β2 isozymes, which are preferentially expressed in different regions of the inner ear and also with gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPases. The apparent K+ and Na+ affinities of α1-β1 and α1-β2 isozymes are different. Association of FXYD6 with Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 isozymes slightly decreases their apparent K+ affinity and significantly decreases their apparent Na+ affinity. On the other hand, association with α1-β2 isozymes increases their apparent K+ and Na+ affinity. The effects of FXYD6 on the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase and the voltage dependence of its K+ effect are distinct from other FXYD proteins. In conclusion, this study defines the last FXYD protein of unknown function as a modulator of Na,K-ATPase.

Among FXYD protein, FXYD6 is unique in its expression in the inner ear, suggesting a role in endolymph composition. The mammalian inner ear is composed of two distinct sensory organs, the cochlea (the organ of hearing) and the vestibule (the organ of equilibrium). Proper functioning of the sensory hair cells depends on the ionic composition of endolymph and perilymph. Whereas perilymph resembles most other interstitial fluids in containing low K+ and high Na+, endolymph has an ionic composition characterized by high K+ and low Na+, similar to the intracellular fluid (1Bosher S.K. Warren R.L. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1968; 171: 227-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Morgenstern C. Amano H. Orsulakova A. Am. J. Otolaryngol. 1982; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Smith C.A. Lowry O.H. Wu M.L. Laryngoscope. 1954; 64: 141-153PubMed Google Scholar). K+ is central to the inner ear physiology, as it is the charge-carrying ion for the sensory transduction. In the cochlea, K+ is secreted by the marginal cells of the stria vascularis to maintain a very high concentration (150 mm) in the endolymph, the extracellular fluid bathing the stereocilia of the sensory hair cells. This results in a positive potential (+90 mV), which provides a large driving force for K+ entry into the sensory hair cell. The unique ionic composition of endolymph, along with a highly positive endocochlear potential, are thus essential to mechanoelectric transduction (by hair cells) and to normal hearing (4Dallos P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kuijpers W. Bonting S.L. Pfluegers Arch. 1970; 320: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Kuijpers W. Bonting S.L. Pfluegers Arch. 1970; 320: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Maintenance of both the ionic composition of endolymph and the endocochlear potential depends on the activity of Na,K-ATPase (5Kuijpers W. Bonting S.L. Pfluegers Arch. 1970; 320: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Kuijpers W. Bonting S.L. Pfluegers Arch. 1970; 320: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase is an ubiquitous enzyme consisting of an α- and a β-subunit, which is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Na+ and K+ gradients across the cell membrane by transporting three Na+ out of and two K+ into the cell. This function is crucial for cell survival and body homeostasis, because the Na+ gradient is used as an energy source to transport ions or solutes and is at the origin of the vectorial Na+ reabsorption in the kidney and of action potentials in excitable tissues. Regulation of the activity and expression of Na,K-ATPase is tight and governed by a variety of mechanisms. Short term regulation involves protein kinases and results in modulation of the cell surface expression of the Na,K-ATPase, whereas long term regulation, mediated by mineralocorticoid or thyroid hormones, leads to a change in the total number of Na,K-ATPase units (for review, see Refs. 7Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 8Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Moreover, the existence of multiple α and β isoforms permits the production of isozymes with different transport properties (9Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.D. Lelievre L. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1976-1986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Finally, recent experimental evidence shows that members of the FXYD protein family specifically associate with and modulate the transport properties of Na,K-ATPase (for review, see Refs. 10Crambert G. Geering K. Science's STKE. 2003; : RE1PubMed Google Scholar and 11Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F241-F250Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The mammalian FXYD family contains seven members that share a common signature sequence encompassing the transmembrane and adjacent regions (12Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Most characterized FXYD proteins exhibit a similar structure with a single transmembrane domain and a type I orientation that is achieved, in some but not all cases, by the cleavage of an N-terminal signal peptide (for references, see Ref. 10Crambert G. Geering K. Science's STKE. 2003; : RE1PubMed Google Scholar). So far, six of the seven members of the FXYD protein family have been shown to regulate Na,K-ATPase in a tissue- and isozyme-specific way. Four FXYD proteins (FXYD1, FXYD3, FXYD4, and FXYD7) affect, in a distinct way, the apparent affinity for extracellular K+ of the Na,K-ATPase, which in the case of the brain-specific FXYD7 may be physiologically relevant in neuronal excitability (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, FXYD1 (phospholemman) (14Crambert G.

These results suggest that at least one common function of all FXYD proteins could be the regulation of Na,K-ATPase transport properties. Given the key role of the Na,K-ATPase in the maintenance of the electrochemical composition of the endolymph and the modulatory role of FXYD proteins on its transport properties, we have looked in this study for the expression of several FXYD proteins in the inner ear. The only FXYD protein that we were able to detect by Western blot was FXYD6. We, therefore, characterized FXYD6, the last member of the FXYD family of unknown function. FXYD6, also known as phosphohippolin, was previously identified as a phospholemman-like protein expressed at high levels in brain and at a lesser level in lung, testis, and colon (21Kadowaki K. Sugimoto K. Yamaguchi F. Song T. Watanabe Y. Singh K. Tokuda M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 125: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the association of FXYD6 with Na,K- and H,K-ATPases, the modulation of Na,K-ATPase function, and its cellular distribution in the inner ear and in PC12 cells. Our results show that FXYD6 has functional characteristics that are distinct from other FXYD proteins and that the protein may have a crucial role in endolymph homeostasis. cDNAs—Mouse FXYD6 cDNA, subcloned between the 5′ and 3′ domains of Xenopus β-globin, was kindly provided by H. Garty (Weizmann Institute of Science). Cloning of rat Na,K-ATPase α1, α2, α3, β1, and β2 cDNAs has been described previously (9Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.D. Lelievre L. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1976-1986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). cDNAs for the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits were kindly provided by G. Sachs (UCLA) and cDNA for rat colonic H,K-ATPase α-subunits by Fréderic Jaisser (INSERM, U478, Paris, France). All cDNAs were introduced into the pSD5 vector, and cRNAs were prepared by in vitro translation (22Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Protein Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Stages V and VI oocytes were obtained from X. laevis as described previously (23Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). cRNAs coding for mouse FXYD6, rat Na,K-ATPase α1-, α2-, α3-, β1-, and β2-subunits, or rabbit gastric or rat colonic H,K-ATPase α and gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunits were injected into oocytes in different combinations, as described in the figure legends. To study protein expression and association, oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution in the presence of 0.7–1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Easy Tag Express [35S]Protein labeling kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oocytes were subjected to a 6-h pulse and to 24–48-h chase periods in modified Barth's solution containing 10 mm cold methionine. After the pulse and chase periods, microsomes were prepared as described previously (23Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoprecipitations with an FXYD6 antibody under non-denaturing conditions (see below). Preparation of Extracts of Rat Inner Ear—Rat cochleae were isolated and ground in a mortar. The tissue was homogenized manually in a phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing antiproteases (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was diluted 1:1 with a lysis buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 2% digitonin, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4°C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—A polyclonal FXYD6 antibody directed against a C-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion peptide of mouse FXYD6 (62-CSFNQKPRAPGDEEAQVENLITTNAAEPQKAEN) was produced by Pascal Béguin. The corresponding cDNA region was cloned in-frame into the pGEX-4T1 vector. After purification using glutathione beads and dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 2The abbreviation used is: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. the fusion protein was used for the immunization of rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals). This antibody was used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments of metabolically labeled Na,K- and H,K-ATPase expressed in Xenopus oocytes under non-denaturing conditions (24Crambert G. Beguin P. Pestov N.B. Modyanov N.N. Geering K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6723-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 5–13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels or SDS-Tricine gels and revealed by fluorography. FXYD1 (14Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) antibodies were used in Western blots to test the expression of FXYD proteins in the inner ear. To demonstrate the association of FXYD6 with Na,K-ATPase in rat cochlea, 50 μg of the protein of cochlear extracts were incubated with a Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit antibody (Bioreagents) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were migrated on a 5–13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose. FXYD6 was revealed with the FXYD6 antibody and chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological measurements were performed 3 days after oocyte injection with rat Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 or α1-β2 cRNAs alone or together with FXYD6 cRNA by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Measurements of the apparent external K+ affinity were carried out as described previously (16Beguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 μm ouabain, which inhibits the endogenous oocyte Na,K-pumps but not the expressed ouabain-resistant rat Na,K-ATPase isozymes. The maximal Na,K pump current and the apparent K+ affinity (K½ K+) measured in the presence of 90 mm external Na+ were obtained by fitting the Hill equation to the data with a Hill coefficient of 1.6 (25Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Measurements of the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase in intact cells were performed as described previously (26Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) by co-expressing rat α1 with rat β1 or β2 cRNAs together with rat epithelial Na+ channel α-, β-, and γ-subunit cRNAs in the presence or absence of FXYD6 cRNA. The maximal current (Imax) and the apparent Na+ affinity (K½ Na+) were fitted by using the Hill equation and a Hill coefficient of 3 (26Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. Immunocytochemistry of FXYD6—The rats were deeply anesthetized and then fixed intra-aortically with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cochleae were dissected, the oval and round windows were opened, and a hole was drilled at the apex before an overnight post-fixation at 4 °C. Cochleae were then transferred to a phosphate buffer containing 20% sucrose for cryoprotection and frozen. Fourteen-micrometer-thick sections were cut with a Reichert-Jung 2800 cryostat microtome and stored at -20 °C until use. The immunohistochemical procedures were similar to those described previously (27Trigueiros-Cunha N. Renard N. Humbert G. Tavares M.A. Eybalin M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sections were rinsed (3–5 min) in PBS, preincubated 1 h in 30% normal goat serum with 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with FXYD6 (1:500), Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit (1:100), and parvalbumin (Swants, 1:750) antibodies diluted in PBS with 1% normal goat serum. They were then rinsed in PBS (3–8 min) and incubated for 2 h with goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:2000 in PBS, anti-mouse-conjugated CY3 (Molecular Probes), and anti-goat-conjugated CY5 (Molecular Probes). The sections were then rinsed in PBS (3–8 min) and mounted in Mowiol. For co-localization experiments of FXYD6 and barttin in the stria vascualris, a chicken barttin antibody (28Shibata T. Hibino H. Doi K. Suzuki T. Hisa Y. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1038-C1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Shinishi Uchida) was used at a dilution of 1:100. The sections were observed with a ZEISS LSM510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope. No immunostaining was observed when the primary antibody was omitted in the first incubation step or when preimmune sera were used. PC12 Cell Culture—Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (kindly provided by Bernard Thorens, CIG, Lausanne, Switzerland), a cell model commonly used to study neurite formation, were maintained in 100-mm2 culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 6% horse serum, 6% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium-pyruvate, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To induce differentiation, culture medium was supplemented with nerve growth factor (10 μg/ml) for 1 week. For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/well on 6-well glass slides. All samples were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and rinsed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100, rinsed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Cells were then co-incubated with an FXYD6 antibody and Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit monoclonal antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:100, and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse, 1:150) for 1 h. Samples were rinsed with PBS and coverslipped with Fluorsave (Calbiochem). Immunolabeling was examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope. Cellular extracts of PC12 cells were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and used for co-immunoprecipitation assays. Location of FXYD6 in the Cochlea and Interaction with Na,K-ATPase in Situ—Previously, expression of several FXYD RNAs has been reported in the inner ear of mice (29Morris K.A. Snir E. Pompeia C. Koroleva I.V. Kachar B. Hayashizaki Y. Carninci P. Soares M.B. Beisel K.W. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2005; 6: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Chen Z.Y. Corey D.P. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2002; 3: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We performed Western blot analysis, which revealed that, of 6 FXYD proteins tested, only FXYD6 could be detected in extracts of rat inner ear (Fig. 1A). FXYD6 expression was low at developmental stage P0 but increased at P12 and P30 (Fig. 1A, lanes 17–19; Fig. 1B). FXYD6 was revealed as a doublet with a major band at ∼20 kDa corresponding to the molecular mass of FXYD6 expressed in brain (21Kadowaki K. Sugimoto K. Yamaguchi F. Song T. Watanabe Y. Singh K. Tokuda M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 125: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a minor band at ∼18 kDa of unknown origin. The cellular localization of the FXYD6 protein in the cochlea was investigated by immunohistochemistry. In the adult rat cochlea, FXYD6 was expressed in various epithelia bordering the endolymph (the interdental cell, the outer sulcus cells and their root process, and the stria vascularis) (Fig. 1C, green). Moreover, the protein was expressed in somas and dendrites of the spiral ganglion neurons. FXYD6 co-localized with Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 1C, red and merged) in several regions including the stria vascularis. A Na,K-ATPase α-subunit antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate FXYD6 in the inner ear at developmental stages P0 and P12 (Fig. 1D), indicating that FXYD6 is associated with Na,K-ATPase. Location of FXYD6 in the Stria Vascularis—FXYD6 is expressed in the stria vascularis where it co-localizes with Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 2A). A strong signal was diffusely detected in the middle part of the stria vascularis where basolateral membranes of marginal cells and apical membranes of intermediate cells are localized (see Fig. 6). The resolution of confocal microscopic analysis was not sufficient to precisely determine the localization of FXYD6, because the basolateral membrane of marginal cells and the apical membrane of intermediate cells are associated in close vicinity of ∼150 –∼200 Ä and prominently invaginated (31Hinojosa R. Rodriguez-Echandia E.L. Am. J. Anat. 1966; 118: 631-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Spicer S.S. Schulte B.A. Hear Res. 2005; 200: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Barttin is a β-subunit of chloride channels specifically expressed in the basolateral membrane of marginal cells (33Estevez R. Boettger T. Stein V. Birkenhager R. Otto E. Hildebrandt F. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2001; 414: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 6). Co-immunolabeling of FXYD6 and barttin showed co-localization of the two proteins (Fig. 2B), suggesting the presence of FXYD6 in the basolateral membrane of marginal cells but not excluding expression in intermediate cells.FIGURE 6Schematic model of the cochlear stria vascularis, K+ secretion into endolymph, and distribution of Na,K-ATPase and FXYD6. For a detailed description, see “Discussion.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subcellular Localization of FXYD6 in PC12 Cells—In addition to brain, Kadowaki et al. (21Kadowaki K. Sugimoto K. Yamaguchi F. Song T. Watanabe Y. Singh K. Tokuda M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 125: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that FXYD6 is expressed in non-differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. To verify whether FXYD6 co-localizes with Na,K-ATPase in these cells, we performed co-immunostaining with FXYD6 and Na,K-ATPase antibodies, which revealed co-localization of FXYD6 and Na,K-ATPase at the plasma membrane of non-differentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 3A, upper panels). Moreover, in differentiated PC12 cells of neuronal phenotype, FXYD6 colocalized with Na,K-ATPase in dendrites and the cell body (Fig. 3A, lower panels). Both in non-differentiated (Fig. 3B, left panel) and differentiated (Fig. 3B, right panel) PC12 cells, FXYD6 was associated with Na,K-ATPase, because it could be co-immunoprecipitated with a Na,K-ATPase α-subunit antibody. Association of FXYD6 with Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase in Xenopus Oocytes—The association of FXYD6 with Na,K-ATPase was investigated after co-expression of FXYD6 in Xenopus oocytes together with Na,K-ATPase α1-β1, α2-β1, α3-β1, or α1-β2 isozymes. After metabolic labeling and various pulse-chase periods, microsomes were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitations under nondenaturing conditions with an FXYD6 antibody. The FXYD6 antibody immunoprecipitated the 20-kDa form of FXYD6 (Fig. 4A). The intensity of the FXYD6 band was intrinsically low, because FXYD6 contains only 1 methionine, which can be metabolically labeled. Western blot analysis confirmed the efficient expression of FXYD6 and also revealed the 18-kDa form of FXYD6 observed in the inner ear (data not shown). Na,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits of all α-β1 isozymes could be co-immunoprecipitated with FXYD6 after the pulse and prolonged chase periods (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–21). Moreover, FXYD6 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated Na,K-ATPase α1-β2 isozymes (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–6), which is the prominent Na,K-ATPase isozyme in the stria vascularis (34Peters T.A. Kuijpers W. Curfs J.H. Eur. Arch. Otorhinolaryngol. 2001; 258: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were performed with gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPase, and they showed that both H,K-ATPases co-expressed with FXYD6 could be co-immunoprecipitated with the FXYD6 antibody over prolonged chase periods (Fig. 4C). Functional Effects of FXYD6 on Na,K-ATPase Transport Properties—The functional effects of FXYD6 on Na,K-ATPase transport properties were investigated by electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 or α1-β2 isozymes with or without FXYD6. As shown in Fig. 5A, Na,K-ATPase α1-β2 isozymes expressed without FXYD6 had a significantly lower apparent K+ affinity than α1-β1 isozymes, and the voltage dependence of the K½ K+ values was more pronounced at negative membrane potentials. FXYD6 produced a small but significant decrease in the apparent K+ affinity of the Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 isozyme at slightly negative and positive membrane potentials. In contrast, FXYD6 produced a significant increase in the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase α1-β2 isozymes at negative membrane potentials (Fig. 5A). FXYD6 also had significant and distinct effects on the apparent affinity for internal Na+ of the two Na,K-ATPase isozymes and produced a 2-fold decrease in the apparent Na+ affinity of the α1-β1 isozyme without significantly affecting maximal Na,K pump currents and a slight increase in the apparent Na+ affinity of the α1-β2 isozyme (Fig. 5B). In this paper, we provide evidence that FXYD6, the last uncharacterized FXYD protein, may also be a tissue-specific regulator of Na,K-ATPase, similar to other members of the FXYD protein family. Indeed, our results show that FXYD6 is associated with Na,K-ATPase in the inner ear and that it modifies the transport properties of different Na,K-ATPase isozymes after co-expression in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of FXYD6 in the Inner Ear—RNA expression of several members of the FXYD family in the inner ear has been reported previously (29Morris K.A. Snir E. Pompeia C. Koroleva I.V. Kachar B. Hayashizaki Y. Carninci P. Soares M.B. Beisel K.W. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2005; 6: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Chen Z.Y. Corey D.P. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2002; 3: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that, of 6 FXYD proteins, only FXYD6 was detected in this organ at the protein level. Thus, the other FXYD proteins are either not expressed or at much lower levels than FXYD6. Interaction of FXYD6 with P-Type ATPases—A common feature of all FXYD proteins so far characterized is their interaction with Na,K-ATPase, both in expression systems and in situ (for review, see Refs. 10Crambert G. Geering K. Science's STKE. 2003; : RE1PubMed Google Scholar and 11Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F241-F250Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). FXYD6 shares this property but shows a broader specificity than other FXYD proteins. Similar to mouse FXYD3 (18Crambert G. Li C. Claeys D. Geering K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), FXYD6 stably interacts also with both gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPases after expression in Xenopus oocytes. In the cochlea, FXYD6 is localized in neurons and, interestingly, in the stria vascularis, which co-expresses Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase at the basolateral side of marginal cells (28Shibata T. Hibino H. Doi K. Suzuki T. Hisa Y. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1038-C1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Further experiments are needed to confirm the potential association of FXYD6 and H,K-ATPase in this organ. Putative Physiological Relevance of the Regulation of Na,K-ATPase by FXYD6 in the Maintenance of the Endolymph Electrochemical Composition—Compared with other FXYD proteins studied, association of FXYD6 modulates the transport properties of Na,K-ATPase in a distinct way. In view of the cellular localization of FXYD6 in the cochlea, we could predict at least two sites of action, which preferentially express either Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 or α1-β2 isozymes. Interestingly, our study shows that these two rat Na,K-ATPase isozymes have different functional properties (Fig. 5A). These results confirm our previous observation that β isoforms can differentially modulate the transport properties of Na,K-ATPase (9Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.D. Lelievre L. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1976-1986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 25Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The first site of action of FXYD6 might be the auditory neurons, mainly expressing Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 isozymes. Intracellular Na+ concentrations in dendrites increase significantly during neuronal activity, passing from 11 to 50 mm (35Rose C.R. Neuroscientist. 2002; 8: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The nearly 2-fold decrease in the apparent Na+ affinity, produced by the association of FXYD6 with Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 isozymes, may be necessary for the efficient extrusion of Na+ during neuronal activity. Upon a rise in intracellular Na+ to 50 mm, Na,K-ATPase α1-β1 isozymes with a K½ Na+ of ∼10 mm (Fig. 5B) would transport at maximal rates. On the other hand, Na,K-ATPase with a K½ Na+ of 20 mm, due to association with FXYD6, would have the capacity to increase its transport rate at increased intracellular Na+ concentrations. A similar decrease in the apparent Na+ affinity of α1-β1 isozymes is produced by FXYD1 (phospholemman) expressed in skeletal and heart muscle and has been related to efficient extrusion of increased intracellular Na+ concentrations during action potentials in contractile tissues (14Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Of course, at present, we cannot exclude that, alternatively or in addition to the observed Na+ effect on α1-β1 Na,K-ATPase isozyme, FXYD6 may be involved in other regulatory mechanisms of the expression or function of Na,K-ATPase isozymes in neuronal cells. The second site of action of FXYD6 might be the stria vascularis. The stria vascularis is made up of three layers of cells, epithelial marginal cells, intermediate cells, and epithelial basal cells (Fig. 6). Marginal cells interdigitate with intermediate cells and are separated by the intrastrial space. K+ coming from the spiral ligament enter basal cells and intermediate cells via a dense network of gap junctions. Thereafter, it is secreted into the intrastrial space by potassium channels and taken up by marginal cells via Na,K-ATPase and other K+ transporters, e.g. H,K-ATPase. Finally, K+ is secreted into the scala media to form the endolymph. FXYD6 is strongly expressed in the marginal cells and possibly in the intermediate cells, which mainly express α1-β2 Na,K-ATPase isozymes (34Peters T.A. Kuijpers W. Curfs J.H. Eur. Arch. Otorhinolaryngol. 2001; 258: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). α1-β2 Na,K-ATPase complexes associated with FXYD6 with a high apparent affinity for Na+ might be necessary to maintain the low intracellular Na+ concentrations in marginal cells that have been reported by Ikeda et al. (36Ikeda K. Morizono T. Hear Res. 1989; 39: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The intrastrial space is critical for the generation of the endocochlear potential. Indeed, the endocochlear potential is essentially a K+ equilibrium potential that is generated by the conjunction of two K+ channels, Kcnj10 (Kir 4.1) and MERG1a located in the intermediate cells of the stria vascularis in conjunction with the very low K+ concentration in the intrastrial fluid and a normally high K+ concentration in the cytosol of intermediate cells (37Takeuchi S. Ando M. Kakigi A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2572-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 38Marcus D.C. Wu T. Wangemann P. Kofuji P. Am. J.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8671-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Intermediate cells might act as glial cells in siphoning the extracellular K+ (40Sontheimer H. Glia. 1994; 11: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase and, as suggested by Nie et al. (39Nie L. Gratton M.A. Mu K.J. Dinglasan J.N. Feng W. Yamoah E.N. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8671-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Kcnj10 may be implicated in this process, which would permit the secretion of K+ by the MERG1a channel. At 1 mm K+ in the intrastrial space (37Takeuchi S. Ando M. Kakigi A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2572-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the α1-β2 isozyme with a K½ K+ of ∼1.7 mm (Fig. 5) would not efficiently transport K+ at a membrane potential of -110 mV characteristic of the intermediate cells (37Takeuchi S. Ando M. Kakigi A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2572-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, an FXYD6-associated α1-β2 complex with a higher apparent affinity for K+ would be able to transport at a more efficient rate and keep a low K+ concentration in the intrastrial space. In conclusion, in this study, we have characterized the last FXYD protein of unknown function. Our results show that FXYD6 associates with Na,K-ATPase as other FXYD proteins and has a distinct functional effect on Na,K-ATPase, indicating that all mammalian FXYD proteins associate with and modulate the transport properties of Na,K-ATPase in a tissue-specific way. The localization of FXYD6 in the inner ear suggests an important role in endolymph production.

https://openalex.org/W1964369824,"The precise role of STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation in RET-mediated cell transformation and oncogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we have shown that familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) mutants RETY791F and RETS891A induced, in addition to Tyr705 phosphorylation, constitutive STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. Using inhibitors and dominant negative constructs, we have demonstrated that RETY791F and RETS891A induce STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation via a canonical Ras/ERK1/2 pathway and that integration of the Ras/ERK1/2/ELK-1 and STAT3 pathways was required for up-regulation of the c-fos promoter by FMTC-RET. Moreover, inhibition of ERK1/2 had a more severe effect on cell proliferation and cell phenotype in HEK293 cells expressing RETS891A compared with control and RETWT-transfected cells. The transforming activity of RETY791F and RETS891A in NIH-3T3 cells was also inhibited by U0126, indicating a role of the ERK1/2 pathway in RET-mediated transformation. To investigate the biological significance of Ras/ERK1/2-induced STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation for cell proliferation and transformation, N-Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells were employed. These cells displayed elevated levels of activated ERK1/2 and Ser727-phosphorylated STAT3, which were inhibited by treatment with U0126. Importantly, overexpression of STAT3, in which the Ser727 was mutated into Ala (STAT3S727A), rescued the transformed phenotype of N-Ras-transformed cells. Immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from FMTC patients showed strong nuclear staining of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Ser727 STAT3. These data show that FMTC-RET mutants activate a Ras/ERK1/2/STAT3 Ser727 pathway, which plays an important role in cell mitogenicity and transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2027731605,"Inadequate treatment practices with antimalarials are considered major contributors to Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine. The longitudinal survey conducted in Dielmo, a rural Senegalese community, offers a unique frame to explore the impact of strictly controlled and quantified antimalarial use for diagnosed malaria on drug resistance.We conducted on a yearly basis a retrospective survey over a ten-year period that included two successive treatment policies, namely quinine during 1990-1994, and chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) as first and second line treatments, respectively, during 1995-1999. Molecular beacon-based genotyping, gene sequencing and microsatellite analysis showed a low prevalence of Pfcrt and Pfdhfr-ts resistance alleles of Southeast Asian origin by the end of 1994 and their effective dissemination within one year of CQ and SP implementation. The Pfcrt resistant allele rose from 9% to 46% prevalence during the first year of CQ reintroduction, i.e., after a mean of 1.66 CQ treatment courses/person/year. The Pfdhfr-ts triple mutant rose from 0% to 20% by end 1996, after a mean of 0.35 SP treatment courses/person in a 16-month period. Both resistance alleles were observed at a younger age than all other alleles. Their spreading was associated with enhanced in vitro resistance and rapidly translated in an increased incidence of clinical malaria episodes during the early post-treatment period.In such a highly endemic setting, selection of drug-resistant parasites took a single year after drug implementation, resulting in a rapid progression of the incidence of clinical malaria during the early post-treatment period. Controlled antimalarial use at the community level did not prevent dissemination of resistance haplotypes. This data pleads against reintroduction of CQ in places where resistant allele frequency has dropped to a very low level after CQ use has been discontinued, unless drastic measures are put in place to prevent selection and spreading of mutants during the post-treatment period."

Here we investigated the roles of PKC in the platelet reactions implicated in thrombus formation as follows: secretion aggregate formation and coagulation-stimulating activity, using inhibitors with proven activity in plasma. In human and mouse platelets, PKC regulated aggregation by mediating secretion and contributing to αIIbβ3 activation. Strikingly, PKC suppressed Ca2+ signal generation and Ca2+-dependent exposure of procoagulant phosphatidylserine. Furthermore, under coagulant conditions, PKC suppressed the thrombin-generating capacity of platelets. In flowing human and mouse blood, PKC contributed to platelet adhesion and controlled secretion-dependent thrombus formation, whereas it down-regulated Ca2+ signaling and procoagulant activity. In murine platelets lacking Gqα, where secretion reactions were reduced in comparison with wild type mice, PKC still positively regulated platelet aggregation and down-regulated procoagulant activity. We conclude that platelet PKC isoforms have a dual controlling role in thrombus formation as follows: (i) by mediating secretion and integrin activation required for platelet aggregation under flow, and (ii) by suppressing Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure, and consequently thrombin generation and coagulation.

In particular, the classical Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms α and βI/II play important but often unclear signaling roles in platelet responses (3Siess W. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 309-318PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tabuchi A. Yoshioka A. Higashi T. Shirakawa R. Nishioka H. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol.

In 1983 it was proposed, and later confirmed, that PKC activity in synergy with Ca2+ regulates the secretion of dense and α-granules following platelet stimulation with phospholipase C-stimulating agonists like collagen and thrombin (5Rink T.J. Sanchez A. Hallam T.J. Nature. 1983; 305: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 6Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PKC may also contribute to the promotion of conformational changes of integrin αIIbβ3, required for fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation (10Van Willigen G. Akkerman J.W.N. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Hers I. Donath J. Litjens P.E.H.M. van Willigen G. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1651-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This regulation is complex, because αIIbβ3 can also be activated in the absence of PKC (12Packham M.A. Livne A.A. Ruben D.H. Rand M.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC and Ca2+ can synergize with another Gi-mediated pathway of αIIbβ3 activation (2Quinton T.M. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Dorsam R.T. Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), putatively via the G-protein exchange factor CalDAG-GEFI (13Crittenden J.R. Bergmeier W. Zhang Y. Piffath C.L. Liang Y. Wagner D.D. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 982-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Conversely, activated integrins themselves may stimulate PKC via outside-in signaling, to result in filopodial formation and platelet spreading (14Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Buensuceso C.S. Obergfell A. Soriani A. Eto K.

Thus, Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms seem to contribute to platelet aggregation in two different ways, directly via integrin phosphorylation and indirectly via secretion. On the other hand, PKC can also have inhibitory effects on platelets. In the 1980s, it was reported that PKC inhibition reduces Ca2+ extrusion from platelets (5Rink T.J. Sanchez A. Hallam T.J. Nature. 1983; 305: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 16Pollock W.K. Sage S.O. Rink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and increases (rather than suppresses) phospholipase C activity (17King W.G. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6070-6074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasts to the later suggestion that PKC stimulates an unidentified Ca2+ influx pathway involved in platelet activation (18Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 159-169Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Another platelet-inhibiting effect of PKC is its ability to desensitize G-protein-coupled receptors (19Hardy A.R. Conley P.B. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Poole A.W. Mundell S.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 3552-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). How these platelet-inhibiting effects of PKC interfere with its activating action is not understood. During hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets have two distinct but additive functions in the formation of thrombi, aggregation and procoagulant activity. Once adhered to vascular collagen, platelets become activated via the signaling immunoreceptor, glycoprotein VI (GPVI), in interplay with the collagen receptor α2β1 (20Chen H. Kahn M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4764-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Kuijpers M.J.E. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Lindhout T. Brakebusch C. Offermanns S. Fässler R. Heemskerk J.W.M. Nieswandt B.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). At high shear flow conditions, this results in αIIbβ3 activation, in the secretion of ADP, and the formation of thromboxane, which activate nearby platelets to form aggregates, e.g. by stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors (24Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 25Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In addition, GPVI activation enhances the coagulation process (26Heemskerk J.W.M. Bevers E.M. Lindhout T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), because it triggers the Ca2+-dependent exposure of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) at the platelet outer surface, where coagulation factors assemble to form thrombin (21Kuijpers M.J.E. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Lindhout T. Brakebusch C. Offermanns S. Fässler R. Heemskerk J.W.M. Nieswandt B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 685-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Siljander P.R.M.

Thrombin, in turn, further activates platelets and mediates fibrin clot formation. Recent in vitro and in vivo investigations with mice have highlighted the dual importance of GPVI in the thrombus-forming process by inducing intravascular platelet aggregation (27Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 28Grüner S.

Concerning the role of PKC, it is only known that under flow conditions PKC contributes to the stable adhesion of platelets to collagen but not to the initial attachment (30Polanowska-Grabowska R. Gear A.R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 3044-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the stimulating and inhibitory properties of all PKC isoforms both in the thrombus-forming process as a whole and in distinct platelet responses, using high affinity PKC inhibitors that were proved to be effective in whole blood. The results provide the first evidence for an overall balancing function of PKC, in controlling the proportions of aggregated and procoagulant platelets.

Human platelets were suspended in buffer composed of 5 mm Hepes, 136 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA (pH 7.45). Murine platelets were washed with buffer consisting of 5 mm Hepes, 136 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mg/ml BSA (pH 7.45). Cells were counted and adjusted to the appropriate concentration. Platelet Aggregation and Flow Cytometry—Platelet aggregation was measured by turbidometry with Chronolog aggregometers. For each sample, 300–500 μlof2 × 108 platelets/ml in Hepes buffer or PRP were used. Samples were preincubated at 37 °C with vehicle (1% Me2SO), 0.1–20 μm RO31, 0.1–20 μm GF10, or 0.025–20 μm Gö6976 for 10 min prior to stimulation with indicated agonists. Flow cytometry of unstirred activated and control platelets in buffer or plasma (2 × 108/ml) was performed using primary FITC-labeled antibodies, as described for human (34Van der Meijden P.E.J. Feijge M.A.H. Giesen P.L.A. Huijberts M. van Raak E.P.M. Heemskerk J.W.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 1128-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and mouse (35Grüner S. Prostredna M. Schulte V. Krieg T. Eckes B. Brakebusch C. Nieswandt B. Blood. 2003; 102: 4021-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) platelets. For flow cytometry, platelets were preincubated with various doses of RO31, GF10, or Gö6976, as described above. Measurement of PKC Activity—PKC activity of platelets in buffer, plasma, or blood was determined by measuring Ser phosphorylation of the modified PKC/cAMP-dependent protein kinase pseudo-substrate, RFARKGSLRQKNV (36Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a biotinylated mAb recognizing this phosphorylated form (Calbiochem). Washed platelets, PRP, or whole blood (normalized to 2 × 108 platelets/ml) was treated with the indicated concentrations of RO31, GF10, or Gö6976 for 10 min and then stimulated as appropriate (PMA 100 nm, convulxin 50 ng/ml, ADP 10 μm). Samples of 1 × 108 cells were centrifuged in a small volume of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, immediately sonicated on ice, and then further processed as indicated by the manufacturer. When required, PRP was isolated from blood prior to assaying. In control experiments, platelets treated with 20 μm RO31, GF10, or Gö6976 were stimulated with 1 μm iloprost and examined for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP (37Cauwenberghs S. Feijge M.A.H.

No influence of this treatment on the phosphorylation was detected (data not shown). Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]i were measured in washed suspensions of Fura-2-loaded platelets (2 × 108/ml) by ratio fluorometry, as described (38Heemskerk J.W.M. Feijge M.A.H. Henneman L. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Final suspensions did not contain aspirin; activations were carried out in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Control calibrations were performed when colored substances were present. Thrombus Formation on Collagen under Flow—PPACK-anticoagulated human and mouse blood was used for perfusion experiments over collagen-coated coverslips, as described before (23Auger J.M. Kuijpers M.J.E. Senis Y.A. Watson S.P. Heemskerk J.W.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Blood was incubated for 15 min with the indicated inhibitors and/or fluorescent probes, placed in a syringe, and perfused over collagen at a shear rate of 150–1000 s–1 for 4 min. After rinsing with Hepes buffer (pH 7.45) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 unit/ml heparin and fluorescently labeled annexin A5 (0.5 μg/ml), bright field phase-contrast images and nonconfocal fluorescence images of adherent platelets were recorded using a two camera system (22Siljander P.R.M. Munnix I.C.A. Smethurst P.A. Deckmyn H. Lindhout T. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R.W. Heemskerk J.W.M. Blood. 2004; 103: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A video recorder was connected to one of the cameras for recording dynamic information (stable platelet adhesion). Platelet surface coverage was analyzed with ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics) for phase-contrast images and Quanticell software (Visitech) for fluorescence images. At least 10 different microscopic fields were averaged per experiment (no image processing). To provide a measure of the proportion of procoagulant platelets independent of platelet deposition, the ratio of annexin A5-binding surface coverage to phase-contrast surface coverage was calculated and was termed procoagulant index (Pi) (22Siljander P.R.M. Munnix I.C.A. Smethurst P.A. Deckmyn H. Lindhout T. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R.W. Heemskerk J.W.M. Blood. 2004; 103: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although the procoagulant area was slightly overestimated through fluorescent glare in the optics, Pi provided a means of distinguishing the treatments of procoagulant expression from those of platelet deposition and aggregation. For single cell Ca2+ measurements under flow, blood was supplemented with 5% autologous Fluo-3-loaded platelets (23Auger J.M. Kuijpers M.J.E. Senis Y.A. Watson S.P. Heemskerk J.W.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence in collagen-adhered Fluo-3-loaded-platelets were obtained by high speed (5 Hz) recording of fluorescence images and off-line analysis of regions-of-interest representing single platelets. Calibration to [Ca2+]i was by pseudo-ratioing to give F/Fo values and fixed calibration values (39Heemskerk J.W.M. Willems G.M. Rook M.B. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 535: 625-635Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For quantitative data, traces from individual cells were superimposed, so that [Ca2+]i initially increased after 3.0 s. Two-photon Laser Scanning Microscopy—For two-photon laser scanning microscopy, coverslips with thrombi were observed with a Bio-Rad 2100 multiphoton system (40Lecut C. Schoolmeester A. Kuijpers M.J.E. Broers J.L.V. van Z voort M.A.M.J. Vanhoorelbeke K. Deckmyn H. Jandrot-Perrus M. Heemskerk J.W.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Excitation was by a Spectra-Physics Tsunami Ti:Sapphire laser, tuned, and mode-locked at 800 nm, producing pulses of 100 fs wide (repetition rate 82 MHz). Excitation at 647 nm was by a parallel-placed red diode laser. Fluorescence was detected using appropriate wave-length filters (29Munnix I.C.A. Strehl A. Kuijpers M.J.E. Auger J.M. van Z voort M.A.M.J. oude Egbrink M. Nieswandt B. Heemskerk J.W.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thrombi in flow chambers, double-labeled with Oregon Green 488 fibrinogen and Alexa Fluor 647-annexin A5, were scanned at the end of perfusions. Optical sections were recorded in Kalman filtering mode; no further image processing was performed. Thrombin Generation Measurement—PRP and platelet-free plasma collected on citrate were used to measure thrombin generation using the thrombogram method (34Van der Meijden P.E.J. Feijge M.A.H. Giesen P.L.A. Huijberts M. van Raak E.P.M. Heemskerk J.W.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 1128-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, normalized PRP (1.5 × 108 platelets/ml) or platelet-free plasma was preincubated with inhibitor for 15 min and then with collagen for 10 min. Samples of PRP or platelet-free plasma (4 volumes) were added to wells of a 96-well plate (Immulon 2HB; Dynex Technologies), containing 1 volume of 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml BSA, and tissue factor (1 pm, final concentration). Coagulation was started by addition of 1 volume thrombin substrate, Z-GGR-AMC. Pre-warmed plates were inserted into a fluorescence well plate reader (Thermolab Systems) and processed at 37 °C. Fluorescence accumulation from cleaved AMC was measured, and first derivative curves of accumulation of fluorescence were generated; calibrations were performed with human thrombin (41Vanschoonbeek K. Feijge M.A.H. van Kampen R.J.W. Kenis H. Hemker H.C. Giesen P.L.A. Heemskerk J.W.M. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Differences between experimental groups were tested for significance with a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS 11.0). p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Partial Blockage of Platelet Aggregation and Integrin αIIbβ3 Activation by PKC Inhibition—To investigate the regulation of thrombus formation by PKC, we first tested several compounds with known selective PKC-inhibiting effects on protein phosphorylation and platelet responses. These compounds were added to platelets in the presence of plasma or in whole blood to establish their efficacy at physiological conditions. The bisindolylmaleimide derivatives, RO318425 (RO31) and GF10, interacting with the ATP-binding site of PKC, were effective in PRP at concentrations ≤20 μm (see below), but the related compound RO318220 had less effect in plasma (data not shown). Using soluble enzymes, it has been reported that RO31 and GF10 inhibit phosphorylation reactions of Ca2+-dependent and -independent PKC isoforms at concentrations of 10–40 nm (42Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We tested the kinase activity in lysates of washed platelets (2 × 108 platelets/ml, ∼80 μm phospholipids), by measuring the Ser phosphorylation of an Ala → Ser-modified PKC pseudo-substrate, RFARKGSLRQKNV (36Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With RO31 or GF10 added to platelet lysate, IC50 values of pseudo-substrate phosphorylation were 0.1 and <0.2 μm, respectively. However, when added to platelets in plasma, these IC50 values increased to 3.0 and 10 μm. In PRP, 20 μm RO31 or GF10 blocked phosphorylation with 85 ± 6 and 79 ± 5%, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 4–5). In both washed platelets (Fig. 1A) and platelets in plasma (not shown), RO31 and GF10 completely suppressed PMA-induced aggregation, as expected. We also tested the effects of these compounds on the aggregation induced by key agonists involved in thrombus formation. Either greatly suppressed platelet aggregation in response to the GPVI-dependent agonist, collagen, but only when added to washed platelets and not in PRP (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained for platelets stimulated with ADP, an agonist that acts via the G protein-coupled receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 (data not shown). Dose-response curves of collagen-induced aggregation in buffer medium showed maximal inhibition from about 10 μm RO31 or GF10 (Fig. 1B). Supporting experiments were performed with the non-maleimide compound, Gö6976, which has a high affinity for the classical PKC isoforms α and βI (42Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro kinase measurements with lysed platelets showed that Gö6976 up to 20 μm inhibited only 40% of pseudo-substrate phosphorylation, which is compatible with its selectivity for PKC α/βI. Gö6976 nearly completely inhibited PMA- and collagen-induced aggregation of washed platelets, the latter already at 1–2.5 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). To understand the difference in effects of PKC inhibitors on platelet aggregation in buffer and plasma, flow cytometry was used to measure integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Inhibitor-treated platelets were stimulated with PMA, convulxin, 5Collagen fibers were not used to prevent interference in the flow cytometric measurements. or ADP. The appearance of activated epitopes on αIIbβ3 was detected with fluorescently labeled PAC1 mAb. In the presence of plasma at 20 μm (Fig. 1C), or in washed platelets at 10 μm (not shown), both RO31 and GF10 fully antagonized PMA-induced PAC1 binding, confirming that PKC-induced integrin activation was completely inhibited. In contrast, these compounds only partly reverted PAC1 binding in response to convulxin and did not affect PAC1 binding with ADP (Fig. 1C). When washed platelets were stimulated with PMA, convulxin, or ADP, RO31 reduced the PAC1 binding with 95 ± 3, 63 ± 6, or 5 ± 4%, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 3). These results confirm the presence of two pathways of integrin activation (2Quinton T.M. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Dorsam R.T. Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 44Shattil S.J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 992-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only one of which appears to be PKC-dependent. Platelet PKC Activity Is Required for Secretion—Expression of P-selectin at the platelet surface is a measure of secretion (exocytosis). Experiments with PRP showed that RO31 and GF10 greatly suppressed the high P-selectin expression induced by PMA or convulxin, and also the lesser P-selectin expression with ADP (Fig. 2A). Dose-response curves were generated to compare effects of the PKC inhibitors in the absence and presence of plasma. In washed platelets, the potency of these compounds to block P-selectin expression was quite similar to their anti-aggregatory activity, in the order of Gö6976 > RO31 ≥ GF10 (Fig. 2B, compare with Fig. 1B). In the presence of plasma, substantially higher concentrations were needed, and the potency of inhibition changed to RO31 > Gö6976 ≥ GF10 (Fig. 2B). With plasma present, 20 μm of all compounds gave complete or substantial inhibition. The relatively high concentrations needed for inhibition in plasma can be explained by binding of the hydrophobic compounds to plasma lipids, which impedes their incorporation into platelets. Typically, RO31 carries a charged primary amino group, which may decrease its binding to plasma proteins and hence favor uptake by platelets. These inhibitor studies suggested that the contribution of PKC to collagen-induced aggregation in washed platelets is mediated by (fibrinogen and/or ADP) secretion. This was confirmed by the observation that addition of 2 mg/ml fibrinogen to"

Cell extrinsic molecules that increase DARPP-32 mRNA and/or protein levels include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), retinoic acid, and estrogen. DARPP-32 induction by BDNF in vitro requires phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), but inhibition of phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt does not entirely abolish expression of DARPP-32. Moreover, the requirement for Akt has not been established. Using pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) and constitutively active and dominant negative PI3K, Akt, cdk5, and p35 viruses in cultured striatal neurons, we measured BDNF-induced levels of DARPP-32 protein and/or mRNA. We demonstrated that both the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and the cdk5/p35 signal transduction pathways contribute to the induction of DARPP-32 protein levels by BDNF and that the effects are on both the transcriptional and translational levels. It also appears that PI3K is upstream of cdk5/p35, and its activation can lead to an increase in p35 protein levels. These data support the presence of multiple signal transduction pathways mediating expression of DARPP-32 in vitro, including a novel, important pathway via by which PI3K regulates the contribution of cdk5/p35.

Langley-Gullion K.C. Greengard P. Brain Res. 1998; 808: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All MSNs receive glutamatergic input from the cortex. In addition, they receive dopamine input from the substantia nigra or ventral tegmental area and are therefore dopaminoceptive, usually expressing only a single dopamine receptor subtype (2Surmeier D.J.

Despite the obvious clinical significance of gene regulation in MSNs and the requirement for cell-specific transcription in the development of the nervous system, few details are available regarding how the MSN phenotype is specified at the molecular level. Indeed, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the specification of most central nervous system neuronal subtypes. Delineation of these pathways presents a major challenge to current molecular neurobiology. DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa) is a homologue of protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 that plays a key role in integrating incoming first messenger signals. A host of transmitters and neuropeptides converges upon DARPP-32 and its state of phosphorylation, and in turn, levels of phospho-DARPP-32 provide moment-to-moment control of the signaling “tone” of over a dozen known protein phosphorylation pathways (8Fienberg A.A.

The potentiation of target protein phosphorylation, mediated by DARPP-32 regulation of protein phosphatase-1, appears to be a required action of the dopaminergic signaling pathway under physiologic conditions. In the absence of DARPP-32, striatal neurons show marked neurophysiological abnormalities in response to dopamine D1 agonists, including decreased spike height in dissociated neurons and a reduced response in vivo, including a decreased release of γ-aminobutyric acid. Phosphorylation of downstream effectors is decreased, including that of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid NR1 subtype. Induction of c-Fos and of ΔFosB after acute or chronic exposure to psychostimulants is highly attenuated. This translates into behavioral differences in that induction of locomotion by psychostimulants is attenuated in knock-out mice but sensitization after chronic administration is up-regulated. DARPP-32 null mice are also less responsive to apomorphine and raclopride, the activities of which likely require synergism between dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, and also to caffeine (23Lindskog M.

In the latter case, the antidepressant effect, as tested in mouse models, was severely reduced, and in the wild type mouse, both the phosphorylation and, most relevant to this study, the total amount of DARPP-32 were altered. Based on our data demonstrating regulation of DARPP-32 mRNA levels by BDNF (18Ivkovic S. Ehrlich M.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5409-5419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ivkovic S. Polonskaia O.

Neuromol. Med. 2004; 5: 11-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 25Hashimoto K. Shimizu E. Iyo M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 45: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that altered transcription of DARPP-32 by BDNF is implicated. Transcriptional dysregulation of DARPP-32 is also implicated in highly prevalent malignancies outside the central nervous system, and the role of PI3K/Akt signal transduction in cancer is well documented (26Bader A.G. Kang S. Zhao L. Vogt P.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of DARPP-32 is linked to anti-apoptosis in both upper and lower gastrointestinal cancers (27Belkhiri A. Zaika A. Pidkovka N. Knuutila S. Moskaluk C. El-Rifai W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6583-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Wang M.S. Pan Y. Liu N. Guo C. Hong L. Fan D. Int. J. Clin. Pract. 2005; 59: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DARPP-32 expression is markedly decreased in breast tumor cell lines, and this transcriptional abnormality appears to be related to the ability of the transformed cells to migrate (29Hansen C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Andersson T. Vogel W.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 4011-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Multiple aspects of central nervous system development, including neurogenesis, migration, and programmed cell death, are dependent on the PI3K/Akt and cdk5/p35 signal transduction pathways (reviewed in Refs. 30Cruz J.C. Tsai L.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar and 31Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway is most notably regulated by multiple growth factors but less is known about upstream factors regulating the cdk5/p35 pathway. However, multiple modes of cross-talk exist between growth factors and the cdk5/p35 system, including regulation of one by the other (32Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y.

We have identified the PI3K pathway as a critical mediator of the BDNF-induced increase in DARPP-32 protein levels in vitro. BDNF up-regulates phosphorylation of Akt at the Ser-473 site and at Thr-308 (35Stroppolo A. Guinea B. Tian C. Sommer J. Ehrlich M.E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 3A. Bogush, S. Pedrini, J. Pelta-Heller, T. Chan, Q. Yang, Z. Mao, E. Sluzas, T. Gieringer, and M. E. Ehrlich, unpublished observations. In this study, we analyze whether Akt is necessary and/or sufficient for expression of DARPP-32 and its induction by BDNF in vitro, and we further dissect the pathways downstream of PI3K. Thus, we also demonstrate a role for mTOR, an important effector of Akt that regulates both translation and transcription and is known to be involved in cell growth and response to extracellular metabolic stimuli (36Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar). We also identify Cdk5/p35 as another regulator of DARPP-32 mRNA and protein levels in vitro. Together, the regulation of MSN gene expression by these two signal transduction pathways has important implications in both normal development and in disease. Cell Culture—Timed-mated Swiss-Webster mouse dams were anesthetized with pentobarbital (day of plug = E0–0.5), and the embryos were removed. The striatum (E15–17) was isolated, and the meninges were removed. The tissue was minced with a scalpel blade and incubated in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution for 8 min at 37 °C in a clinical rotator (40 rpm). The incubation mixture was replaced with 0.01% trypsin/Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, incubated for 8 min, and rinsed twice in Leibovitz's medium (L-15). It was then suspended in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum, glucose (6 mg/ml), glutamine (1.4 mm), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). Cells were triturated through a glass bore pipette and plated onto Lab Tek culture wells (75,000 cells/well) for immunocytochemistry or 12-well plates (2 × 106 cells/well) for Western blotting, coated with polymerized polyornithine (0.1 mg/ml in 15 mm borate buffer, pH 8.4), and air-dried. One hour later, the media were replaced with Neurobasal/B27 with additives, with glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin, as above. In the absence of anti-mitotic agents, these cultures contain 90–95% neurons, almost all of which are γ-aminobutyric acid-positive (18Ivkovic S. Ehrlich M.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5409-5419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An extra slide was plated each time and stained with enolase and γ-aminobutyric acid to confirm uniformity of the cultures between experiments. Treatments included roscovitine and deguelin (Sigma), butyrolactone (Biomol), and LY294,002, rapamycin, and wortmannin (Calbiochem). Cell Immunocytochemistry—Cultures were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and processed using the anti-rabbit secondary antibody and the immunoperoxidase/ABC method (Elite Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Neuronal purity was assessed by staining parallel cultures with neuron-specific enolase (1:5000; Polysciences). The polyclonal anti-DARPP-32 antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used at 1:2000 dilution. Western Blot Analysis—For analysis of phosphoproteins and as a control their respective nonphosphorylated isoforms, total cellular protein was prepared by lysis in boiling sample buffer (20% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue), followed by sonication, 15 min of centrifugation, and recovery of the supernatants. An equal volume of lysate was loaded in each well on a gel, run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and protein content verified by visualization of total protein by Ponceau Red after transfer to nitrocellulose and/or by demonstration of an equal amount of a “marker” protein, e.g. Akt or actin, in each lane. For analysis of holoproteins, nonphosphorylated, e.g. DARPP-32, cells and tissues were harvested in 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, and 10% v/v glycerol, supplemented with 1× Mini-Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane following measurement of protein concentrations with the BCA assay (Pierce) and verified by visualization of total protein by Ponceau Red after transfer to nitrocellulose and/or by demonstration of an equal amount of a marker protein. Blots were developed with PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Densitometric values are obtained using Biosoft ScanAnalysis for Apple (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) and/or by direct UVP Imaging. Effects of treatments were calculated by ANOVA, with Bonferroni post test. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. Each lane contained either 25 or 50 μg from a single well from a 12-well plate, seeded with 2 × 106 neurons at the time of plating, and ultimately yielding 75–100 μg of total protein. Antibodies used included the following: DARPP-32 (1:3000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA); phosphor-Ser-473-Akt and Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); p35 and cdk5 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and actin (1:3000; Sigma). Viral Transduction—Viral infections were performed after cells had attached for 24–48 h. Vector was added in fresh medium, and the medium was changed again 18 h later. BDNF (10 ng/ml) was added when appropriate after another 24–48 h to allow time for expression of proteins from the virus. Cells were harvested or fixed from 24 to 72 h later, i.e. 72–96 h following addition of virus, depending on the experiment. The goal with each vector was to obtain maximal level of infection/expression without toxicity, as measured by the Molecular Probes Live/Dead assay (data not shown), used as per the manufacturer's instructions. PI3K (constitutively active p110 = caPI3K and dominant negative p85 = dnPI3K) constructs were in herpesvirus (courtesy of Drs. Robert Kalb and Rachel Neve (Yale University, New Haven, CT) (37Fryer H.J. Wolf D.H. Knox R.J. Strittmatter S.M. Pennica D. O'Leary R.M. Russell D.S. Kalb R.G. J.

The wild type p35 and dominant negative Cdk5 plasmids (received from Dr. Nancy Ip, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) (32Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y.

Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) were transferred into adenoviral expression constructs and produced and amplified in HEK293A cells as per the manufacturer's instructions (ViraP-ower adenoviral expression system; Invitrogen). DARPP-32 levels were not significantly altered in the presence of control virus (Null virus), and expression of the protein from the virus was confirmed by Western blotting. Multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) ranged from 2 to 10:1. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 3 × 106 cells with the use of an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (RNeasy mini handbook). After the final step, mRNA samples were pretreated with DNase (RQ1 RNase-free DNase; Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 30 min with 1 unit of DNase for 1 μg of RNA in 10 μl of 1 × buffer. For each cDNA synthesis reaction, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Cells-to-cDNA™ II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The amount of synthesized cDNA, ∼50 ng, was then used for simultaneous amplification of DARPP-32 and β-actin in a Gene Amp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) (n = 3 separate platings). The primers were designed with Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) based on published cDNA sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers NM144828 and NM007393, respectively). Primer sequences were as follows: DARPP-32 upstream (5′-CACCACCCAAAGTCGAAGAGA-3′, corresponding to nucleotide residues 540–560); DARPP-32 downstream (5′-CGAAGCTCCCCTAACTCATCCT-3′, corresponding to nucleotide residues 676–655); β-actin upstream (5′-CGATGCCCTGAGGCTCTTT-3′, corresponding to nucleotide residues 846–864); β-actin downstream (5′-TGGATGCCACAGGATTCCA-3′, corresponding to nucleotide residues 904–886). The expected lengths of the RT-PCR products were 137 bp for DARPP-32 and 59 bp for β-actin. Primers for each gene were located in different exons to distinguish from amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. The thermocycle parameters were as follows: 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 20 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 53 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, and final incubation for 7 min at 72 °C. Control reactions were performed to verify that no amplification would occur without cDNA. The number of cycles was determined empirically by sampling product between 10 and 40 cycles to select the approximate midpoint of linear amplification for the PCRs (not shown). Eight microliters from each PCR amplification were loaded onto 4% agarose gels, and the intensity of DNA bands was estimated using UVP BioImaging System (UVP, Inc, Upland, CA) and Lab Works Image Acquisition and Analysis software version 4.00. The abundance of DARPP-32 PCR fragments was normalized by intensity of the β-actin PCR fragment. Statistical analysis was performed as for Western blotting. dnPI3K, caPI3K, and Wortmannin Confirm the Requirement for Activation of PI3K for Induction of DARPP-32 by BDNF— We demonstrated previously in vivo that BDNF is required for normal ontogeny of DARPP-32 and in vitro that BDNF induces the expression of DARPP-32 protein. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K by 50 μm LY294,002 reduced the induction of DARPP-32 by greater than 50% in cultured striatal neurons in the presence of BDNF, while entirely inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt(Ser-473) (18Ivkovic S. Ehrlich M.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5409-5419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ivkovic S. Polonskaia O. Farinas I. Ehrlich M.E. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Stroppolo A. Guinea B. Tian C. Sommer J. Ehrlich M.E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LY294,002 is an inhibitor of PI3K and was used at doses previously used in primary neuronal cultures (35Stroppolo A. Guinea B. Tian C. Sommer J. Ehrlich M.E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To confirm that activation of PI3K is required for the increase in DARPP-32 protein after BDNF treatment, we repeated these experiments using a second chemical inhibitor of PI3K, wortmannin, and transduction with a dominant negative form of p85, a subunit of PI3K. We confirmed our previous results with LY294,002 and also noted that the “control” lanes versus “LY294,002” had lower levels of DARPP-32 (Fig. 1A). Transduction with a dnPI3K p85 subunit almost entirely inhibited the induction of DARPP-32 by BDNF and, importantly, also lowered base-line levels below those of control (Fig. 1A). To confirm that wortmannin was inhibiting PI3K in this system, we demonstrated that BDNF-induced phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited in its presence (Fig. 1B). Levels of pAkt could not be quantified as they were essentially undetectable in the presence of wortmannin. As wortmannin is highly labile in tissue culture media (40Holleran J.L. Egorin M.J. Zuhowski E.G. Parise R.A. Musser S.M. Pan S.S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 41Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conducted experiments in which fresh wortmannin was added to the cultures every 8 h, and the cells were harvested at 24 h. Under these conditions, the increase in DARPP-32 protein following treatment with BDNF was decreased by an average of 50% in the presence of wortmannin plus BDNF (Fig. 1C), despite the total abolition of phosphorylation of Akt by BDNF. Finally, transduction with a constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K was sufficient to increase levels of DARPP-32 protein (Fig. 1D). Quantitation was performed with the addition of 1 μl of virus (m.o.i. = 5). We concluded that PI3K is both necessary and sufficient for induction of the DARPP-32 protein, with or without BDNF, in MSNs in vitro. In addition, PI3K appears to be necessary for maintaining base-line levels of DARPP-32 protein in cultures containing B27, but its inhibition does not totally eliminate expression of DARPP-32 and, in several cases, also does not entirely inhibit the increase in DARPP-32 protein in the presence of BDNF. Deguelin, dnAkt, and Rapamycin Prevent Induction of DARPP-32 by BDNF, and caAkt Induces DARPP-32 Protein— Based on the requirement for PI3K, we sought to determine whether activation of Akt, a well characterized downstream effector of PI3K, is necessary and/or sufficient for induction of DARPP-32 by BDNF. There are three Akt isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, that are 80% homologous (42Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). It is frequently assumed, but not always proven, that inhibition of one with a dominant negative construct likely inhibits the others. We therefore first treated the cultures with a pan-Akt inhibitor, deguelin (10-9 to 10-7 m) (43Chun K.H. Kosmeder II, J.W. Sun S. Pezzuto J.M. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Lee H.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of BDNF. Of note, although controversial, deguelin appears to inhibit PI3K-dependent and -independent activation of Akt (43Chun K.H. Kosmeder II, J.W. Sun S. Pezzuto J.M. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Lee H.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We found that the BDNF-induced increase in DARPP-32 protein was markedly reduced in the presence of deguelin, but interestingly, base-line levels were not significantly altered (Fig. 2A) We also transduced cultures with a dnAkt virus expressing Akt1-CAAX (39van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We first found that Akt1-CAAX (m.o.i. = 10) entirely prevented phosphorylation of endogenous Akt by BDNF (data not shown). We also found that it reduced the induction of DARPP-32 protein by BDNF but did not reduce base-line levels of DARPP-32 protein (Fig. 2B). Finally, transduction with a constitutively active Akt1, in which the pleckstrin homology domain has been deleted and an Src myristoylation sequence has been added (44Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), increased levels of DARPP-32 protein by 3-fold (Fig. 2C). We concluded that Akt1 is necessary for BDNF induction of DARPP-32 protein in vitro and alone is sufficient to increase DARPP-32 protein levels in MSNs in vitr"

We have investigated the mode of binding of the first aminoacyl-tRNA in translation initiation mediated by the IGR-IRES. Binding ability of aminoacyl-tRNA to the first codon within the IGR-IRES/80 S ribosome complex was very low in the presence of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) alone but markedly enhanced by the translocase eEF2. Moreover, eEF2-dependent GTPase activity of the IRES/80 S ribosome complex was 3-fold higher than that of the free 80 S ribosome. This activation was suppressed by addition of the antibiotics pactamycin and hygromycin B, which are inhibitors of translocation. The results suggest that translocation by the action of eEF2 is essential for stable tRNA binding to the first codon of the PSIV-IRES in the ribosome. Chemical probing analysis showed that IRES binding causes a conformational change in helix 18 of 18 S rRNA at the A site such that IRES destabilizes the conserved pseudoknot within the helix. This conformational change caused by the PSIV-IRES may be responsible for the activation of eEF2 action and stimulation of the first tRNA binding to the P site without initiation factors.

Translation initiation in eukaryotes requires participation of multiple initiation factors and generally also involves the 5′-cap structure of mRNAs. Translation of some viral mRNAs, however, is initiated by an alternative mechanism mediated by an RNA known as the internal ribosome entry site or IRES 2The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PSIV, Plautia stali intestine virus; CrPV, cricket paralysis virus; IGR, intergenic region; PK, pseudoknot; EM, electron microscopy; eEF, eukaryotic elongation factor; GMPPNP, guanyl-5′-yl imidophosphate; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; CMCT, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimidemetho-p-toluene. 2The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PSIV, Plautia stali intestine virus; CrPV, cricket paralysis virus; IGR, intergenic region; PK, pseudoknot; EM, electron microscopy; eEF, eukaryotic elongation factor; GMPPNP, guanyl-5′-yl imidophosphate; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; CMCT, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimidemetho-p-toluene.

This process is quite mysterious, because the first aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A site and its translocation occurs in the absence of deacylated tRNA in the P site. Furthermore, in usual translation the translocation is an event involving peptidyl-tRNA, not aminoacyl-tRNA (14Dorner S Brunelle J.L. Sharma D. Green R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although this process has been demonstrated by toeprinting assays in a system reconstituted with eEF1A, eEF2, ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNA, and CrPV IRES (11Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 2003; 15: 181-186Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Jan E. Kinzy T.G. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15410-15415Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it remains to be clarified how the IRES binding affects each activity of eEF1A or eEF2 on the ribosome. The cryo-electron microscopic structure of the IGR-IRES-ribosome complex shows that IRES induces conformational changes in the 40 S subunit, which consists of a rotation of the head relative to the body as well as the relative positions of helices 18 and 34 (9Spahn C.M.T. Jan E. Mulder A. Grassucci R.A. Sarnow P. Frank J. Cell. 2004; 118: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, binding of the IGR-IRES to the 80 S ribosome largely changes conformational ordering of the P protein stalk located in the GTPase-associated center of the 60 S subunit (9Spahn C.M.T. Jan E. Mulder A. Grassucci R.A. Sarnow P. Frank J. Cell. 2004; 118: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is highly likely that these IRES-dependent conformational changes of the ribosome make the unusual first elongation cycle possible. We here report the effect of binding of the PSIV IGR-IRES to the ribosome on each activity of isolated eEF1A and eEF2 in the first elongation cycle of the IGR-IRES-mediated translation. We show that aminoacyl-tRNA for the first codon is very unstable at the A site in the presence of eEF1A alone, but stabilized at the P site only after translocation by the actions of both eEF1A and eEF2. The ribosomal eEF2-dependent GTPase activity increases 3-fold upon IRES binding, suggesting that IRES activates the ribosomal GTPase-associated center. In addition, IRES markedly enhances chemical modification of bases in helix 18 of 18 S rRNA located at the A site. These effects of IRES binding on ribosomal structure and function seem to be closely related to the unique process of IGR-IRES-mediated translation initiation. Plasmids—The region encompassing nucleotides 5961–6300 of the PSIV sequence that includes domains 1 to 3 (see Fig. 1A) and a part of the coding sequence for capsid protein (designated here as Domain 1-2-3) was amplified by PCR using the dicistronic plasmid pT7CAT-5375 (5Sasaki J. Nakashima N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The amplified fragment was inserted between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pT7Blue (Novagen) and cloned. The resultant plasmid pT7-IRES5961–6300 was used as template to introduce mutations into pseudoknots I to III (mut-PK I to mut-PK III, see Fig. 1A) by primer-directed PCR mutagenesis. A region covering nucleotides 6005–6149 that includes domain 1 and 2 (designated as Domain 1-2) was also amplified and cloned. Ribosomes, Elongation Factors, and Aminoacyl-tRNA—High salt-washed 80 S ribosomes and 40 S subunits were prepared from cysts of the brine shrimp Artemia salina as described previously (16Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Uchiumi T. Wahba A.J. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5580-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The isolated ribosomes showed no contaminating eEF1A and eEF2 activity. Eukaryotic elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2 were isolated from pig liver as described (16Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y.

Each isolated sample appeared as a single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Escherichia coli total tRNA purchased from Roche Applied Science was charged with [14C]glutamine or [14C]phenylalanine (both from GE Healthcare) using aminoacyl-tRNA partially purified from the supernatant S-100 fraction of E. coli Q13 (20Nishimura S.

Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1728-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RNA Synthesis and Renaturation—The plasmids described above were linearized with EcoRI and used as templates for transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. RNAs were synthesized and purified as described previously (22Uchiumi T. Nomura T. Shimizu T. Katakai Y. Mita K. Koike Y. Nakagaki M. Taira H. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35116-35121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The isolated RNA fragments were heated at 70 °C for 3 min and then cooled on ice in a solution containing 1–10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Acrylamide-Agarose Composite Gel Electrophoresis—The 40 S ribosomal subunits (10 pmol) were mixed with 40 pmol of the IGR-IRESs (Domain 1-2-3 or its mutants) in 10 μl of solution containing 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NH4Cl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to form the complex. The complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on acrylamide-agarose composite gels composed of 3% (w/v) acrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 19:1) and 0.5% (w/v) agarose as described previously (23Tokimatsu H. Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. JMB. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with 0.2% Azur B. Aminoacyl-tRNA Binding—The 80 S ribosomes (20 pmol) were mixed with 80 pmol of the IGR-IRESs (Domain 1-2-3 or its mutants) in 25 μl of solution containing 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to form the complex. In the experiments to test the effect of antibiotics, 80 S ribosomes were preincubated with 1 mm pactamycin or hygromycin B. The reaction mixture was mixed with another solution (25 μl) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 pmol [14C]Gln-tRNA (400cpm/pmol), 120 pmol eEF1A, and 3 mm GTP or guanyl-5′-yl imidophosphate (GMPPNP) that had been preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The resultant reaction mixture containing IGR-IRES-80 S ribosome complexes [14C]Gln-tRNA and eEF1A was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (type HA, 0.45-mm pore size; Millipore). The membrane was washed with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Radioactivity retained on the filter was counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka). In the experiment to test the effect of the addition of eEF2 on the aminoacyl-tRNA binding, the same incubation and filtration experiments were performed after addition of 20 pmol eEF2 to the reaction mixture containing the IGR-IRES-80 S ribosome complexes, [14C]Gln-tRNA, and eEF1A as described above. Toeprinting Assay—The toeprinting assay was carried out basically as described by Takyar et al. (24Takyar S. Hickerson R.P. Noller H.F. Cell. 2005; 120: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In brief, 1.5 pmol IGR-IRES (Domain 1-2-3) was annealed to 10 pmol primer, which was complementary to nucleotides 6281–6300 of the coding region of PSIV, in 100 mm KCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (10 μl), by heating to 60 °C for 3 min and placing on ice. After addition of MgCl2 to 3 mm, the primer-annealed IRES was incubated with 6 pmol A. salina 80 S ribosomes in 30 μl of binding buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) at 37 °C for 5 min. An aliquot (10 μl) of the IRES-80 S complex (1 pmol) was incubated with 2 pmol Gln-tRNA, 4 pmol eEF1A, 4 pmol eEF2, 1.5 mm GTP at 37 °C for 10 min. After translocation, aliquots (5 μl each) of the reactions were extended by addition of 3 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and four dNTPs mixed with [α-32P]dCTP at 37 °C for 40 min. The products were resolved on a 6% sequencing gel. eEF2-dependent GTPase—The IGR-IRES-80 S ribosome complexes (5 pmol) were incubated with 10 pmol eEF2 and 3 nmol [γ-32P]GTP (40 cpm/pmol) in a solution (20 μl) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm pactamycin or hygromycin B. The amount of inorganic [γ-32P]phosphate liberated was determined as described previously (25Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eEF2-GDP Binding Assay—The IGR-IRES-80 S ribosome complexes (17 pmol) were incubated with 80 pmol [3H]GDP (750 cpm/pmol) and 30 pmol eEF2 in a solution (20 μl) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2. The mixture was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane and the bound [3H]GDP was counted as described previously (26Mizumoto K. Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. 1974; 76: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chemical Probing of rRNA—The 80 S ribosomes (8.5 pmol) were incubated with an excess of the IGR-IRES or its mutants in solution (50 μl) containing 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2. The ribosome samples were reacted with DMS. The same samples were also reacted with CMCT as described by Moazed and Noller (27Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 985-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). RNA extraction, primer extension, and gel electrophoresis were also as described (27Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 985-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Effect of IGR-IRES Binding to the Ribosome on Each Action of Isolated eEF2 and eEF1A—In this study, we used PSIV IGR-IRES containing domains 1, 2, 3 and 108 nucleotides of coding sequence (Domain 1-2-3) and its various mutants (Fig. 1A), including mut-PK I, mut-PK II, and mut-PK III, which disrupted PK I, PK II, and PK III, respectively, as well as Domain 1-2 deficient in domain 3 and coding region. The ability of these IGR-IRES mutants to bind to the 40 S subunits was examined by acrylamide-agarose composite gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). The electrophoretic mobility of the 40 S-IRES complex was higher than that of free 40 S subunits in this gel system, because the gel mobility depends more on the negative charge of IRES RNA bound to the 40 S subunits than on the size of complexes. The band of free 40 S subunits (lane 1) was clearly shifted by addition of Domain 1-2-3 (lane 2), suggesting tight binding of the IRES RNA to the 40 S subunit. Mut-PK I (lane 3) and mut-PK II (lane 4) also strongly bound to the 40 S subunit, whereas the binding ability of mut-PK III (lane 5) was significantly lower than the other mutants. Domain 1-2 showed slightly reduced ability to bind to the 40 S subunit (lane 6). Elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2 were isolated from pig liver according to Iwasaki and Kaziro (16Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as described previously (18Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Terao K. Iwasaki K. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Uchiumi T. Ogata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9668-9671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified factors were active in ribosome-coupled GTPase, [14C]Phe-tRNA binding, and polyphenylalanine synthesis dependent on poly(U) using ribosomes isolated from brine shrimp A. salina (data not shown) and were used in subsequent experiments. It was of great interest to us to test the effect of IGR-IRES binding on ribosomal eEF2-dependent GTPase activity, because IGR-IRES changes the conformation of the ribosomal P protein complex (9Spahn C.M.T. Jan E. Mulder A. Grassucci R.A. Sarnow P. Frank J. Cell. 2004; 118: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which is responsible for the GTPase activity (28Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The effect of additions of IGR-IRES and its mutants on ribosomal-uncoupled GTPase activity dependent on eEF2 was therefore assayed (Fig. 2A). The GTPase activity of brine shrimp ribosomes was stimulated 3-fold by addition of the wild type IGR-IRES (Domain 1-2-3). A similar level of stimulation was observed by addition of mut-PK I, whereas only partial stimulation could be observed upon addition of the Domain 1-2 mutant. No stimulation of activity was detected by addition of mut-PK II and mut-PK III. A possible explanation for the IGR-IRES-dependent stimulation of GTPase turnover is that IRES binding may enhance eEF2-GDP release from the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. To test this possibility, eEF2-[3H]GDP binding to the ribosome was checked by filter binding assays in low salt conditions in the presence or absence of IRES (Fig. 2B). As expected, addition of Domain 1-2-3 to the ribosome markedly reduced ribosomal ability to bind to eEF2-[3H]GDP. Addition of Domain 1-2 gave a partial effect. The activity of eEF1A was assayed by aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A site by a membrane filtration method (19Uchiumi T. Ogata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9668-9671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When A. salina 80 S ribosomes (20 pmol) preincubated with poly(U) and deacylated tRNA were mixed with excess amount of [14C]Phe-tRNA, eEF1A, and GMPPNP, 11.5 pmol [14C]Phe-tRNA bound to the ribosomes. Using the same method, we tested eEF1A-dependent binding of [14C]Gln-tRNA to the 80 S ribosome in the presence of IGR-IRES, whose first codon is CAA, which codes for glutamine. As shown in Fig. 3A, [14C]Gln-tRNA failed to bind to the ribosome-IRES complex in the presence of either GTP or GMP-PNP. However, addition of eEF2 to the reaction mixture caused the amount of [14C]Gln-tRNA binding to be significantly increased, although eEF2 alone gave no stimulation effect. It is inferable from these results that [14C]Gln-tRNA is stabilized only at the P site after translocation through the action of eEF2. When mut-PK I and mut PK II were used instead of Domain 1-2-3, no binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA was detected even in the presence of both eEF1A and eEF2 (data not shown). To confirm the translocation in our reconstitution system, we performed toeprinting analysis. After an oligonucleotide primer was annealed to a downstream coding sequence of the IGR-IRES, it was bound to the 80 S ribosome. By addition of reverse transcriptase the primer was extended until the extension was blocked by the bound ribosome. The extension was arrested at the 14–16-nt downstream regions of the cytosine base at the 5′-side of the CUU sequence, which is a part of PK I and presumably placed at the P site considering previous biochemical and cryo data (8Nishiyama T.

Westhof E. Spahn C.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Addition of Gln-tRNA, together with eEF1A and eEF2, to the IGR IRES-80 S ribosome complex gave other arrested signals at the 17–19 downstream regions (lane 3), indicating that Gln-tRNA and mRNA are translocated from the A site to the P site in the presence of both elongation factors. Inhibitors of Translocation Suppress Binding of Aminoacyl-tRNA to the First Codon of IGR-IRES—It is known that the antibiotics pactamycin and hygromycin B bind to the highly conserved rRNA regions (29Woodcock J. Moazed D. Cannnon M. Davies J. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Carter A.P. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 2000; 103: 1143-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and inhibit translocation of the A site tRNA to the P site (31Gonzalez A. Jimenez A. Vazquez D. Davies J.E. Schindler D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 521: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Dions G. Wilson D.N. Teraoka Y. Szaflarski W. Fucini P. Kalpaxis D. Nierhaus K.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because these antibiotics did not block ribosome binding to the IGR-IRES (data not shown), the effects of these antibiotics on IGR-IRES-induced ribosome function were examined (Fig. 4). Although binding of the IGR-IRES to 80 S ribosomes enhanced eEF2-dependent GTPase activity 3-fold as shown in Fig. 2A, this enhancement was considerably suppressed by pactamycin and partially suppressed by hygromycin B (Fig. 4A). Binding of [14C]Gln-tRNA to the IGR-IRES-80 S ribosome complex, which depends on both eEF1A and eEF2, decreased to 30% of control upon addition of pactamycin and to 50% of control upon adding hygromycin B (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that binding of aminoacyl-tRNA for the first codon within the IGR-IRES-80 S ribosome complex is correlated with activated eEF2-dependent GTPase and translocation. Conformational Change of 18 S rRNA at the A Site Induced by PSIV IGR-IRES—To examine conformational changes of rRNAs responsible for the IGR-IRES-induced characteristics of the ribosome reported here, we performed chemical probing experiments. A. salina 80 S ribosomes were treated with the chemical reagents DMS and CMCT in the presence or absence of IGR-IRES (Domain 1-2-3) and the chemical modifications in 18 S rRNA monitored by primer extension. The IRES binding gave no base protection to full-length 18 S rRNA (data not shown) but enhanced the modifications of some bases of a single stem-loop region, helix 18 (Fig. 5). Domain 1-2-3 enhanced DMS modification of G-505, G-506, and C-507 (E. coli numbering) and slightly enhanced the modification of A-532 (lane 2 compared with lane 1). Domain 1-2-3 also enhanced CMCT modification of G-505 and gave slight enhancement of modification of G-506 and C-507 (compare lane 8 with lane 7). It is interesting that G-505, G-506, and C-507 are the bases involved in the functionally important pseudoknot structure in helix 18 (33Woese C.R. Gutell R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3119-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Powers T. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2203-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). These enhanced chemical modifications were compared with the effects of the various mutants of Domain 1-2-3 used in eEF2-dependent GTPase assays (Fig. 2A). The binding of mut-PK I was also found to enhance the modification of bases G-505, G-506, C-507, and A-532 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 9). The extent of enhancement is comparable with that by wild type IRES (Domain 1-2-3, lanes 2 and 8). However, mut-PK II (lanes 4 and 10) and mut-PK III (lanes 5 and 11) hardly enhanced modification. Domain 1-2 gave enhancement for all the bases (lanes 6 and 12), but the extent of enhancement was smaller than that by Domain 1-2-3 (lanes 2 and 8). The enhancement of chemical modification seems to be correlated with the activation of eEF2-dependent GTPase shown in Fig. 2A. This PSIV IGR-IRES-dependent enhancement of chemical modification in helix 18 was also observed when 80 S ribosomes from rat liver and silkworm were used instead of A. salina ribosomes. However, it was not observed when the IGR-IRESs of the other dicistroviruses Himetobi P virus and Taura syndrome virus were used instead of PSIV IGR-IRES. Binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the first codon downstream of the IGR-IRES in dicistroviruses is unusual, because the process occurs without tRNA in the P site. Here we have described the molecular mode of the binding of the first Gln-tRNA to PSIV IGR-IRES. By investigating the effect of the IRES binding on individual actions of eEF1A and eEF2, we have demonstrated that the first Gln-tRNA cannot bind efficiently through the action of eEF1A alone, but only bind efficiently upon addition of both eEF1A and eEF2 (Fig. 3A). Because eEF2 alone does not function in Gln-tRNA binding at all, eEF1A should play an essential role in temporal binding of Gln-tRNA to the ribosomal A site and then eEF2 efficiently translocating it to the P site. The translocation in our reconstituted assay system using PSIV IGR-IRES was demonstrated by toeprinting assay (Fig. 3B), as shown in previous reports with CrPV IGR-IRES (11Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 2003; 15: 181-186Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Jan E. Kinzy T.G. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15410-15415Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and by inhibition studies using pactamycin and hygromycin B (Fig. 4B), which bind to helices 23/24 and helix 44, respectively, (29Woodcock J. Moazed D. Cannnon M. Davies J. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Carter A.P. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 2000; 103: 1143-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and which both inhibit translocation (31Gonzalez A. Jimenez A. Vazquez D. Davies J.E. Schindler D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 521: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Dions G. Wilson D.N. Teraoka Y. Szaflarski W. Fucini P. Kalpaxis D. Nierhaus K.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We also observed that Gln-tRNA bound by the actions of eEF1A and eEF2 protected a base, A-532, 3H. Yamamoto and T. Uchiumi, unpublished data. that is located in the P site (27Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 985-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence clearly indicate that the aminoacyl-tRNA for the first codon of the IGR-IRES stably binds only to the P site after translocation from the A site. The presence of deacylated tRNA at the P site is required for translocation in usual translation, but not in the translation initiation mediated by IGR-IRES. It has been assumed that a part of the IGR-IRES including PK I mimics tRNA at the P site (3Pisarev A.V. Shirokikh N.E. Hellen C.U. C. R. Biol. 2005; 328: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Sarnow P. Cevallos R.C. Jan E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1479-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This may be one of the essential factors to make the translocation possible. Another essential part of the mechanism that we infer from our results is that there is a change in the mode of action of the translocase eEF2 upon binding of IGR-IRES. In the present study, we show that eEF2-dependent GTPase is enhanced 3-fold by binding of PSIV IGR-IRES to 80 S ribosomes. This enhancement of the GTPase seems to be due to IGR-IRES-induced changes of ribosomal structural features that are involved in the interaction between the ribosome and eEF2. This view is supported by our finding of destabilization of the 80 S ribosome-eEF2-GDP complex upon IRES binding (Fig. 2B) and also by previous cryo-EM data showing that the CrPV-IRES binding changes the conformation of the P protein stalk (9Spahn C.M.T. Jan E. Mulder A. Grassucci R.A. Sarnow P. Frank J. Cell. 2004; 118: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Such a rearrangement of eEF2 binding site in the ribosome is likely correlated with the unusual translocation mediated by the IGR-IRES. We have also shown that binding of IGR-IRES enhances chemical modification of 4 bases within helix 18 of 18 S rRNA, although it did not protect any bases. Among the enhanced bases, G-505, G-506, and C-507 are known to be involved in formation of a pseudoknot structure by base pairing with C-526, C-525, and G-524, respectively (34Powers T. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2203-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Enhancement of the chemical modification of these bases indicates a conformational change of helix 18 of 18 S rRNA. It is highly likely that the base pairs G-505:C-526, G-506:C-525, and C-507:G-524 are destabilized and the pseudoknot structure is, at least partially, disrupted by IRES binding. The IGR-IRES-dependent conformational change in helix 18 inferred from our work is supported by the cryo-EM evidence that shows that the relative locations of helices 18 and 34 in the 80 S ribosome are changed upon binding of CrPV (9Spahn C.M.T. Jan E. Mulder A. Grassucci R.A. Sarnow P. Frank J. Cell. 2004; 118: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because helix 18, together with ribosomal protein S12, lies in the A site and presumably participates in correct codon-anticodon base pairings in bacterial ribosomes (39Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), the conformational change in helix 18 would be expected to significantly affect ribosome function. This is shown to be the case as IGR-IRES markedly reduces eEF1A-dependent aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A site in the presence of either GTP or GMPPNP (Fig. 3A) and also reduces stability of the complex between 80 S ribosome and eEF2-GDP (Fig. 2B) as described above. These results are consistent with the fact that mutations that disrupt the pseudoknot of helix 18 in E. coli cells lead to lethality (34Powers T. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2203-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We suggest from these facts that the conformational change of helix 18 including the pseudoknot structure is one of the important events in translation initiation by PSIV IGR-IRES. However, such a conformational change of the pseudoknot structure in helix 18 seems not to be essential for translation initiation of the other dicistroviruses Himetobi P virus and Taura syndrome virus, because bindings of IGR-IRES of the latter two viruses to the 80 S ribosome did not enhance the base modifications in helix 18. The structural and binding features unique to PSIV IGR-IRES may be responsible for induction of the unique conformational change of helix 18. Further extensive studies are required to explain the discrepancy. Interestingly, one mutant of IRES in which PKI is disrupted (mut-PKI) still stimulates GTPase to a level comparable with wild type whereas another mutant in which PKII is disrupted (mut-PKII) gives no enhancement of GTPase activity, despite the retention of ability to bind strongly to the ribosome (Fig. 1B). Another mutant, Domain 1-2 lacking domain 3 of IRES, shows a partial effect of the GTPase enhancement. Because PKII seems to participate in the correct folding of RNA that leads domain 3 toward the P site of the decoding center within the ribosome, the orientation of domain 3 as well as its presence within the ribosome is responsible for the GTPase activation. The enhancement of translocase-dependent GTPase is also observed when tRNA exists in a P/E hybrid state on the E. coli ribosome (35Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3933-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Zavialov A.V. Ehrenberg M.

Dontsova O.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6048-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because cryo-EM observation indicates that the CrPV IRES binds in the intersubunit space overlapping binding sites for E, P, and A site tRNAs, it may be possible that a part of the IRES structure including domain 3 mimics the P/E state tRNA. If this is the case, the GTPase activation by IRES can be explained by a mode similar to the E. coli system in which the P/E hybrid tRNA activates the ribosomal GTPase activity, although the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. Nierhaus (15Nierhaus K.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4997-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and his colleagues discovered that tRNA binding to the E site lowers the affinity of the A site for aminoacyltRNA in an allosteric manner, although the molecular basis of how the allosteric signal from the E site reaches the A site within the ribosome is not yet clear. We infer that tight binding of IGR-IRES to the ribosomal P/E site allosterically changes the functional structures of the A site and also of the P protein stalk at the GTPase-associated center, because the binding of Domain 1-2 lacking domain 3 still gives some effect on enhancement of the chemical modifications in helix 18 and the eEF2-dependent GTPase activity. Therefore, the IGR-IRES may be a useful tool for studying the allosteric signaling mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2089508267,"Background The time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning. We quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions. Methods and Findings The model constructed for this time delay accounts for: (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. Conclusions The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2028572223,"Crystal structures of an Escherichia coli clamp loader have provided insight into the mechanism by which this molecular machine assembles ring-shaped sliding clamps onto DNA. The contributions made to the clamp loading reaction by two subunits, chi and psi, which are not present in the crystal structures, were determined by measuring the activities of three forms of the clamp loader, gamma(3)deltadelta', gamma(3)deltadelta'psi, and gamma(3)deltadelta'psichi. The psi subunit is important for stabilizing an ATP-induced conformational state with high affinity for DNA, whereas the chi subunit does not contribute directly to clamp loading in our assays lacking single-stranded DNA-binding protein. The psi subunit also increases the affinity of the clamp loader for the clamp in assays in which ATPgammaS is substituted for ATP. Interestingly, the affinity of the gamma(3)deltadelta' complex for beta is no greater in the presence than in the absence of ATPgammaS. A role for psi in stabilizing or promoting ATP- and ATPgammaS-induced conformational changes may explain why large conformational differences were not seen in gamma(3)deltadelta' structures with and without bound ATPgammaS. The beta clamp partially compensates for the activity of psi when this subunit is not present and possibly serves as a scaffold on which the clamp loader adopts the appropriate conformation for DNA binding and clamp loading. Results from our work and others suggest that the psi subunit may introduce a temporal order to the clamp loading reaction in which clamp binding precedes DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2158761853,"Alpha-tocopherol (aT), the predominant form of vitamin E in mammals, is thought to prevent oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the lung, aT is perceived to be accumulated in alveolar type II cells and secreted together with surfactant into the epithelial lining fluid. Conventionally, determination of aT and related compounds requires extraction with organic solvents. This study describes a new method to determine and image the distribution of aT and related compounds within cells and tissue sections using the light-scattering technique of Raman microscopy to enable high spatial as well as spectral resolution. This study compared the nondestructive analysis by Raman microscopy of vitamin E, in particular aT, in biological samples with data obtained using conventional HPLC analysis. Raman spectra were acquired at spatial resolutions of 2-0.8 microm. Multivariate analysis techniques were used for analyses and construction of corresponding maps showing the distribution of aT, alpha-tocopherol quinone (aTQ), and other constituents (hemes, proteins, DNA, and surfactant lipids). A combination of images enabled identification of colocalized constituents (heme/aTQ and aT/surfactant lipids). Our data demonstrate the ability of Raman microscopy to discriminate between different tocopherols and oxidation products in biological specimens without sample destruction. By enabling the visualization of lipid-protein interactions, Raman microscopy offers a novel method of investigating biological characterization of lipid-soluble compounds, including those that may be embedded in biological membranes such as aT."
https://openalex.org/W2058718835,"Background Spatially restricted morphogen expression drives many patterning and regeneration processes, but how is the pattern of morphogen expression established and maintained? Patterning of Drosophila leg imaginal discs requires expression of the DPP morphogen dorsally and the wingless (WG) morphogen ventrally. We have shown that these mutually exclusive patterns of expression are controlled by a self-organizing system of feedback loops that involve WG and DPP, but whether the feedback is direct or indirect is not known. Methods/Findings By analyzing expression patterns of regulatory DNA driving reporter genes in different genetic backgrounds, we identify a key component of this system by showing that WG directly represses transcription of the dpp gene in the ventral leg disc. Repression of dpp requires a tri-partite complex of the WG mediators armadillo (ARM) and dTCF, and the co-repressor Brinker, (BRK), wherein ARM•dTCF and BRK bind to independent sites within the dpp locus. Conclusions/Significance Many examples of dTCF repression in the absence of WNT signaling have been described, but few examples of signal-driven repression requiring both ARM and dTCF binding have been reported. Thus, our findings represent a new mode of WG mediated repression and demonstrate that direct regulation between morphogen signaling pathways can contribute to a robust self-organizing system capable of dynamically maintaining territories of morphogen expression."

The additional CAR-expressing cell lines, human embryonic kidney 293A and human cervical HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rock-ville, MD). Cells were maintained (unless stated otherwise) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, and an antibiotic mixture (final concentration of 30 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml) (Invitrogen). Fusion Proteins—To create the GST-CAR fusion protein the intracellular domain (nucleotides 778-1098, encoding amino acids 259-365) of CAR (GenBank™ accession Y07593) was cloned into pGEX-3X plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). BL21 bacteria (Promega, Madison, WI) were transformed with pGEX-3X-CAR (778-1098). GST and GST-CAR fusion proteins were produced by overnight growth, followed by a 4-h induction with 1 and 0.5 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada), respectively. Bacterial cells were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cleared bacterial lysate was incubated with gluthathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche).

This fusion protein contains the domains that are common to the two full-length CAR isoforms (m1 and m2 (34Bergelson J.M. Krithivas A. Celi L. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. Wickham T. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 415-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) but lacks the distal most 26 amino acids of the m1 isoform, including the PDZ binding residues (SIV). GST Pulldown Assay—A 70-80% confluent 15- or 10-cm2 plate of U87CAR or 293A cells, respectively, was used for affinity binding to GST-CAR. Cell lysates (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease tablet mixture (Roche)) were pre-cleared by incubating with unbound gluthathione-Sepharose beads, followed by GST-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl, 2 h each at 4 °C under rotation) to remove any nonspecific binding. The pre-cleared lysate was then incubated with 50 μl of GST-CAR-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer. Interacting proteins were eluted by boiling with 2× Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). Samples were electrophoresed on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by silver staining for mass spectroscopic analysis, or transblotting for Western blot analysis. Proteomic Analysis—Following SDS-PAGE, silver staining was performed using a protocol that was compatible with subsequent mass spectrometry. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol overnight and washed twice in water for 30 min each. Sensitization was performed for 1 min with 0.02% thiosulfate followed by two rinses of 20 s with water. Gels were stained in 0.2125% silver nitrate, 0.0259% formaldehyde and washed twice for 15 s in water. Development occurred by treatment with 3% potassium, 0.00925% formaldehyde, 0.00125% thiosulfate for 2 min. The reaction was stopped with 3% Tris, 2% acetic acid for 1 min and rinsed twice for 10 min in water. Gels were kept in storage solution of 2% acetic acid and bands were selected for further mass spectroscopy processing. Gel slices were excised and digested with trypsin (6 ng/μl)for 5 h on a MassPrep robotic work station (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). Peptides were extracted in a final volume of 45 μl of 0.5% formic acid (v/v) and 9% acetonitrile (v/v). Tryptic peptides were analyzed on an LC-QToF (liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight) mass spectrometer (Micro-Mass). Briefly, the sample was applied to a 10 × 75-cm Pico Frit column containing BioBasic C18 packing. Peptides were eluted from the column using a gradient of 10-95% acetonitrile (v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid (v/v) throughout at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Eluted peptides were electrosprayed as they exited the column and doubly or triple charged ions were selected for passage into a collision cell. Fragmentation was induced by collision with argon gas and data collected in 1-s scans for up to 5 s. Peaklists of MS/MS data were prepared using Masslynx software (MicroMass) and submitted to Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) for identification by analysis against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant data base. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed as previously described (33Huang K.C. Altinoz M. Wosik K. Larochelle N. Koty Z. Zhu L. Holland P.C. Nalbantoglu J. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For Coomassie Blue staining, protein polyacrylamide gels were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stain (Bio-Rad) in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid and destained overnight in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cells grown in a 10-cm2 dish were washed twice in PBS, then scraped into 1 ml of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet, Roche)) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 3,600 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was kept and spun again at 17,500 × gmax in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min. The insoluble pellet (which contained the majority of microtubules) was discarded and the soluble supernatant was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of antipan β-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (Clone Tub 2.1, Sigma) pre-coupled to protein G-Sepharose. Beads were then washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and bound protein eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE buffer for Western blot analysis. Blots were incubated with a polyclonal anti-CAR antibody (RP291), which reacts against the cytoplasmic domain of CAR m1 isoform (23Sollerbrant K. Raschperger E. Mirza M. Engstrom U. Philipson L.

Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY). Cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked for 30 min with 1% milk, PBS, washing once with PBS between each step. Antibodies RP291 (anti-CAR) and anti-tubulin (Clone Tub 2.1, Sigma) were diluted 1:1000 and 1:2000, respectively, in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody was washed off three times and Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse diluted at 1:250 (Invitrogen) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the chambers were removed and the coverslip applied. Controls consisted of chambers processed similarly but in the absence of primary antibody. Slides were visualized under an oil immersion objective (×63) on a Leica DMIRE2 (Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) wide-field fluorescence microscope. The same exposure time was used for all samples. The images were processed using Openlab (Lexington, MA) software. In some experiments, images were collected using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.) equipped with argon (488 nm) and krypton (568 nm) lasers and a Plan Apochromat ×100/1.4 oil immersion objective lens. For the nocodazole treatments, cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 on coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic mixtures for 2 days. The culture medium was aspirated and replaced with culture medium of the same composition supplemented with 4 μm nocodazole (Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were then rinsed once with PBS and then with PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) after which cells were incubated with PEM containing 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and 0.3% glutaraldehyde for 10 min for simultaneous fixation of microtubules and extraction of unpolymerized tubulin heterodimers. After fixation, cells were rinsed with PBS and further permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 20 min to quench uncross-linked glutaraldehyde. The cells were then washed once with PBS, blocked in blocking solutions, stained for β-tubulin and visualized as outlined above. All microphotographs were taken at the same exposure time and magnification. Cytotoxicity Assays—Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5000 cells/well. The next day, cells were treated with paclitaxel (Sigma) at 2:3 serial dilutions of 15.8 nm in triplicate. After 72 h incubation, cells were fixed and survival calculated with the sulforhodamine B cytotoxicity assay, as previously described (36Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8855) Google Scholar). Tubulin Binding Affinity Measurements—Purified bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) at 10 μm dimer concentration in binding buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm GTP, 10% glycerol) was placed on ice for 30 min to ensure complete depolymerization. The tubulin sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble aggregates and then diluted into 250-μl aliquots at different final concentrations from 50 nm to 3.7 μm and added to a fixed amount (10 μl) of GST fusion protein slurry (50%) for 4 h at 4 °C after which the samples were spun down and washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer. Tubulin bound to the beads was released by SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot analysis. The amount of tubulin bound to the GST fusion protein beads was quantitated against a tubulin standard curve by densitometry using Gene-Tool software (Syngene, Frederick, MD). A dissociation curve was constructed and the dissociation constant (Kd) calculated using Prism software (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Microtubule (MT) Preparation—Pre-formed MTs used for microtubule-binding protein spin down assays, microtubule binding affinity measurements, and electron microscopy were prepared using a microtubule binding protein spin-down assay kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.) immediately before use as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2.5 μl of cushion buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm EGTA, 50% glycerol) was added to 20-μl aliquot of 5 mg/ml tubulin protein in general tubulin buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm EGTA) and incubated at 37 °C. After 20 min of incubation, the MTs were diluted with 200 μl of general tubulin buffer plus 2 μl of 2 mm paclitaxel for stabilization and the prepared MTs were used at room temperature. Microtubule-binding Protein Spin-down Assay—The ability of fusion protein constructs and test proteins to bind to microtubules was assessed using a microtubule-binding protein spindown assay kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 20 μl of Taxol-stabilized MT were added to 30 μl of purified MAP2, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or purified GST-CAR fusion protein or His6-tagged CAR fusion protein at room temperature. After 30 min of incubation, the samples were placed on top of a 100-μl Taxol (20 μm)-supplemented cushion buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at room temperature for 40 min in a Beckman Airfuge (Mississauga, ON, Canada). After centrifugation, the supernatants were carefully removed by pipetting off 50 μl from the top. A volume of 12 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was then added for SDS-PAGE analysis. The cushion buffer was then gently removed from the ultracentrifugation tubes and the microtubule pellets collected by washing the bottom of the tube with 1× SDS gel loading buffer and loaded on gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. For peptide competition assays, an excess of preformed microtubules were preincubated with varying concentrations of peptides for 30 min at room temperature. The CAR peptide (amino acids 340-365) was VAAPNLSRMGAVPVMIPAQSKDGSIV (Mr 2609; pI 8.9). The control peptide was CSSRGRNTPGKPMREDTMKLH (Mr 2401; pI 10). After this preincubation, GST-CAR proteins were added into the mixture and incubated for 30 min as usual before the spindown. Microtubule Binding Affinity Measurements—Purified GST-CAR protein was eluted from glutathione beads using freshly prepared 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). This was then dialyzed for 24 h in general tubulin buffer after which the protein concentration was quantified using the BCA protein assay reagent concentrate as per manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The protein sample was diluted into 45-μl aliquots of concentrations ranging from 5.63 μm to 0.115 μm in general tubulin buffer. A volume of 5 μl of MT prepared as above was then mixed with each of the diluted GST-CAR protein samples and incubated for 1 h at room temperature at which time the samples were spun down at 100,000 × g at room temperature for 40 min on top of a 100 μl of Taxol-supplemented cushion buffer as in the MT-binding protein spin-down assay described above. The MT pellets were then collected and analyzed by Western blot analysis for the presence of GST-CAR protein. The amount of GST-CAR protein that had bound and spun-down with the MTs was quantitated by comparing the intensity of the bands against standard curves using the Syngene computer software. Constant MT quantity in the pellets of all of the samples was also monitored using Western blot analysis. A dissociation curve was constructed and the Kd calculated using Prism software (Graph Pad). Electron Microscopy of Microtubules—For electron microscopic analysis of fusion protein binding to MTs, fusion proteins (GST or GST-CAR) at 5.63 μm were incubated with MTs as in the microtubule binding affinity measurement described above. After incubation, the samples were applied to a carbon-supported copper 300 mesh electron microscope grid (Canemco Inc., Lakefield, Quebec, Canada), air dried, and counterstained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate for examination with a JEOL (St-Hubert, QC, Canada) 100 CX transmission electron microscope. The magnification used was ×5000. Cell Migration Assays—Glioma migration was assessed using a Boyden transwell chemotactic assay adapted from those described in Refs. 37Perego C. Vanoni C. Massari S.

The transwell chamber consisted of upper chambers with 8-μm polycarbonate filter inserts (Corning, Acton, MA) placed in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc). Serum-starved glioma cells (5000 cells), suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 1 mg/ml BSA, were seeded into the top compartment of each chamber. In some experiments, U87CAR cells were infected at a multiplicity of 50 with control adenovirus recombinant expressing blue fluorescent protein (AdVBFP) or antisense full-length CAR (AdVAS) (both generated with the AdEasy system (QBiogene, Montreal, QC, Canada). The bottom well contained U251 glioma conditioned medium to act as directional chemoattractant. In selected experiments, the bottom well was supplemented with 0.5 nm paclitaxel (Sigma). After 16 h of incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and stained with Hoechst dye (Molecular Probes, Burlington, ON, Canada) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS for"

We investigated whether FGF-2 uses PI 3-kinase to facilitate phosphorylation of p27 on serine 10 (Ser-10) and threonine 187 (Thr-187) and whether the two phosphorylation sites were differentially regulated. FGF-2 stimulation dramatically increased p27 phosphorylation at Ser-10 and Thr-187 using differential kinetics, and the FGF-2-induced p27 phosphorylation was completely blocked at both sites by LY294002. We determined the physical and biochemical interaction of p27 with the Cdk2-cyclin E complex in response to FGF-2 stimulation. Maximal p27 binding to Cdk2-cyclin E occurred at 12 h; the maximal level of p27 phosphorylation at Thr-187 in the ternary complex was observed at 16 h; ubiquitination of the Thr-187-phosphorylated p27 (pp27Thr-187) was observed starting at 12 h and continuing up to 24 h. However, maximum p27 phosphorylation at Ser-10 occurred in the nucleus 6 h after FGF-2 stimulation; maximal export of Ser-10-phosphorylated p27 (pp27Ser-10) occurred 8 h after FGF-2 treatment, and pp27Ser-10 was simultaneously ubiquitinated. We further investigated which of the two phosphorylated p27 was involved in G1/S progression. LY294002 blocked 64% of the cell proliferation stimulated by FGF-2. Use of leptomycin B to block nuclear export of pp27Ser-10 greatly decreased the FGF-2-stimulated cell proliferation (44%), suggesting that phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 is the major mechanism for G1/S transition. Our results suggest that differential kinetics are observed in p27 phosphorylation at Ser-10 and Thr-187 and that pp27Thr-187 and pp27Ser-10 may represent two populations of p27 observed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

Corneal endothelium is a monolayer of differentiated cells located in the posterior portion of the cornea. Recent work shows that human corneal endothelial cells (CECs) 2The abbreviations used are: CECs, corneal endothelial cells; p27kip1, p27; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RCFM, retrocorneal fibrous membrane; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; hKIS, human kinase-interacting stathmin; LMB, leptomycin B; EMT, endothelial mesenchymal transformation; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; DTT, dithiothreitol; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: CECs, corneal endothelial cells; p27kip1, p27; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RCFM, retrocorneal fibrous membrane; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; hKIS, human kinase-interacting stathmin; LMB, leptomycin B; EMT, endothelial mesenchymal transformation; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; DTT, dithiothreitol; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. remain arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle throughout their life span (1Joyce N.C. Navon S.E. Roy S. Zieske J.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1566-1575PubMed Google Scholar, 2Senoo T. Joyce N.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 660-667PubMed Google Scholar). Such characteristic behavior of cell proliferation dictates most of the wound healing processes occurring in the corneal endothelium: CECs do not use cell division to replace the lost cells but use migration and attenuation to cover the denuded area. Alternatively, in a small fraction of wound healing processes, CECs are transformed into mesenchymal cells that subsequently produce fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) in the basement membrane environment. Thus, corneal fibrosis represents a significant pathophysiological problem, one that causes blindness by physically blocking light transmittance. One clinical example of corneal fibrosis observed in corneal endothelium is the development of a retrocorneal fibrous membrane (RCFM) in Descemet’s membrane (the basement membrane of corneal endothelium) (3Brown S.I. Kitano S. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1966; 75: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Kay E.P. Cheung C.C. Jester J.V. Nimni M.E. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1982; 22: 200-212PubMed Google Scholar). In RCFM, CECs are converted to fibroblast-like cells: the contact-inhibited monolayers of CECs are lost, resulting in the development of multilayers of fibroblast-like cells (5Kay E.P. Gu X. Ninomiya Y. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 663-672PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435PubMed Google Scholar). These morphologically altered cells simultaneously resume their proliferation ability and deposit a fibrillar ECM in Descemet’s membrane. Our in vitro model elucidated the molecular mechanism of RCFM formation and demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) directly mediates the endothelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) observed in CECs (7Lee H.T.

Sci. 2005; 46: 4495-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We reported that, among the phenotypes altered during EMT, FGF-2 directly regulates cell cycle progression through the action of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and that this phenotype alteration leads to a marked stimulation of cell proliferation (7Lee H.T. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as opposed to the G1-arrested CECs. We further reported that FGF-2 phosphorylates p27kip1 (p27) at Thr-187 via the PI 3-kinase pathway and that the Thr-187-phosphorylated p27 (pp27Thr-187) is degraded in the nuclei (7Lee H.T. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The PI 3-kinase pathway is centrally involved in cell proliferation and survival, and the importance of p27 as a regulator of PI 3-kinase-mediated cell cycle progression is well established (10Roymans D. Slegers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Liang J. Slingerland J.M.

Protein kinase B (commonly known as Akt) is an important downstream effector of the PI 3-kinase pathway. Recently Akt has been shown to directly phosphorylate p27 on Thr-157 in breast cancer cell lines; the Thr-157 site is present within the nuclear localization signal of p27. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr-157 causes retention of p27 in the cytoplasm (13Shin I. Yakes F.M. Rojo F. Shin N.Y. Bakin A.V. Baselga J. Arteaga C.L. Nat.

Beniston R. Franssen E. Slingerland J.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Akt also phosphorylates Thr-198, promoting 14-3-3 association and cytoplasmic retention; the Thr-198-phosphorylated p27 exists only in the cytoplasm (16Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Among the multiple sites of phosphorylation of p27, the major phosphorylation site is Ser-10 (17Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), known to be phosphorylated by either human kinase-interacting stathmin (hKIS), the nuclear serine-threonine kinase (18Boehm M.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is likely that phosphorylation of p27 on the Ser-10 residue by either enzyme takes place in the nuclei, after which the Ser-10-phosphorylated p27 (pp27Ser-10) is exported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the CRM1-dependent pathway (19Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and is further involved in protein stability (20Kotake Y. Nakayama K. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol.

Of great interest, all of the phosphorylated p27s, other than pp27Thr-187, are primarily localized in the cytoplasm. Such cytoplasmic localization of p27 prevents it from inhibiting the cell cycle progression in the nucleus.Although phosphorylation as a major post-translational modification of p27 has been studied extensively, the means by which p27 phosphorylation is coordinated at multiple sites remains unclear. Does p27 undergo phosphorylation at all sites per molecule? If so, are the events of p27 phosphorylation sequential, with each one leading to another phosphorylation? Hara et al. (21Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K. Hatakeyama S. J. Biol.

Degradation of p27 at the G0–G1 transition is also known to be independent of Skp2 and to occur in the cytoplasm (22Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This information, thus, suggests differential regulation of the two populations of the phosphorylated p27 (pp27Thr-187 and pp27Ser-10) at different phases of the cell cycle. These data further indicate that at least the two populations of p27 respectively regulate the different stage of the cell cycle: pp27Ser-10 regulates via the nuclear export of p27 during reentry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle, while pp27Thr-187 regulates the cell cycle during late G1-S transition. Most importantly, it has not been determined whether the different phosphorylation sites of p27 were sequentially phosphorylated or whether there were two populations of p27 that are respectively phosphorylated. Furthermore, the method by which p27 phosphorylation at respective sites is regulated at a single cell level has not been studied.Most studies of the negative activity of p27 during cell cycle have employed the strategy of overexpressing exogenous mutant proteins in cultured cells. Such transfection conditions could not determine the kinetics of p27 phosphorylation. We, therefore, determined the kinetics of p27 phosphorylation at Thr-187 and Ser-10 sites in response to mitogenic signals at a single cell level. In the present study, we show that phosphorylation of Ser-10 occurred much earlier than phosphorylation of Thr-187 (maximum phosphorylation time: 6 h versus 16 h following FGF-2 stimulation). We also showed that pp27Ser-10 was no longer observed 12 h after FGF-2 stimulation, whereas pp27Thr-187 had only reached half its maximum level of phosphorylation, suggesting that the two phosphorylated p27s are two different populations. Thus, we have shown that at least two respective populations of p27 undergo phosphorylation and that each of these two populations of p27 functions at a different stage of the G1 phase of the cell cycle in response to mitogenic signals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—LY294002 and monoclonal antibodies against β-actin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-Cyclin E, anti-phospho-histone H1 antibody, and purified histone H1 protein were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-p27 antibody and anti-lamin B antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-pp27Ser-10 and anti-pp27Thr-187 were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Leptomycin B and anti-ubiquitin antibody were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). FGF-2 and anti-Cdk2 antibody were obtained from Calbiochem and BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mounting solution and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA).Cell Culture—Rabbit eyes were purchased from Pel Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR). Isolation and establishment of rabbit CECs were performed as previously described (23Kay E.P. Smith R.E. Nimni M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7116-7121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the corneal endothelium-Descemet’s membrane complex was treated with 0.2% collagenase and 0.05% hyaluronidase (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) for 90 min at 37 °C. Primary cultured cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA) and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin (DMEM-15) in a 5% CO2 incubator. For subculture, confluent primary cultures were treated with 0.05% trypsin and 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. First passage CECs maintained in DMEM-15 were used for all experiments. Heparin (10 μg/ml) was added to cell cultures treated with FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) since our previous study showed that CECs require the addition of supplemental heparin for FGF-2 activity to occur (5Kay E.P. Gu X. Ninomiya Y. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 663-672PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, pharmacologic inhibitors were used in the presence of FGF-2 stimulation: LY294002 (20 μm), or leptomycin B (10 ng/ml).Cell Proliferation Assays—Cell proliferation was assayed by the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well. On the following day, the medium was changed from DMEM-15 to DMEM, and the cells were incubated for 30 h. The serum-starved cells were then subjected to the respective experimental conditions for 24 h, with each culture containing BrdU (10 ng/ml). Cells were then fixed and permeabilized, and the DNA was denatured by treatment with fixative/denaturing solution. Detector peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody was then used, and the color reaction was developed using the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine. The product was quantified using a spectrophotometric plate reader at dual wavelengths of 370 and 492 nm.Cell Cycle Analysis—CECs were synchronized by starvation in DMEM and released after 30 h by adding DMEM containing FGF-2. PCNA immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (24Lee J.G. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We counted the number of PCNA-stained cells per ten 400× viewing fields and determined the percentage of labeled nuclei in a total of over 300 nuclei using four coverslips per experimental condition.Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Protein Extractions—CECs cultured in each culture condition on 100-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with sterile PBS, followed by incubation in an Enzyme-free Cell Dissociation Solution (Chemicon) for 3 min at room temperature. Cells were detached by scraping, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and pelleted at 5,000 × g for 1 min. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using a Nuclear Extraction kit containing cytoplasmic lysis buffer and nuclear lysis buffer (Chemicon), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the harvested cells were resuspended in two cell pellet volumes of cold cytoplasmic lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the swollen cells were incubated an additional 5 min on ice followed by homogenization with a 27-gauge needle. Nuclei were pelleted at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cytosolic portion was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -80 °C until further use. The remaining pellet containing the nuclear portion was washed by centrifugation with cold nuclear extraction buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm DTT and then resuspended in 2/3 of the original cell pellet volume of cold nuclear extraction buffer. Nuclei were disrupted by drawing and ejecting 10 times, using a syringe and a 27-gauge needle. Nuclear proteins were extracted at 4 °C for 60 min, with gentle agitation using an orbital shaker. The nuclear protein extract was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then dialyzed with the Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Unit, 7K MWCO (Pierce). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To verify the purity of the fractions, 15 μg of nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins were immunoblotted with lamin B and α-tubulin antibodies. These nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting.Protein Preparation, Protein Assay, SDS-PAGE, Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting Analysis, Immunofluorescent Analysis, and Confocal Microscopy—All details of methods and procedures have been presented previously (24Lee J.G.

The following concentrations of gel were used to separate proteins: a 12.5% gel for p27, Cdk2, and phosphohistone H1, and a 10% gel for cyclin E, actin, and lamin B.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (8Lee H.T. Lee J.G. Na M. Kay E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32325-32332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with some modifications. CECs were lysed in a rehydration buffer containing 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mm DTT, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 0.2% ampholyte (pH 3–10). For the one-dimensional isoelectric focusing gel, cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were applied to an IPGStrip (11 cm, pH 4–7; Bio-Rad). The strips were covered with immersion oil to prevent samples from evaporation and rehydrated at room temperature overnight. The immersion oil was then removed from the surface. One-dimensional isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis was carried out using a Protean Isoelectric Focusing Cell Apparatus (Bio-Rad) for 20 min at 0 V, 3 h at 250 V, and 3 h at 8000 V. After focusing, the IPG-Strips were soaked for 15 min in equilibration buffer (0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6.0 m urea, 2% SDS, and 2% DTT) at room temperature with gentle shaking, then for 10 min in the same buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide. The separated and equilibrated proteins were resolved in the second dimension by standard PAGE on a 4–16% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and subjected to immunoblot analysis.Protein Phosphorylation Assay in Vitro—Phosphorylation of histone H1 by activated Cdk2-associated kinase activity was carried out as described previously (27Bhattacharjee R.N. Banks G.C. Trotter K.W. Lee H.L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Immune complexes precipitated with anti-p27, anti-pp27Ser-10, and anti-pp27Thr-187 antibody were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) containing 100 μm ATP. One microgram of commercially purified histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was then added to the immunoprecipitates, and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated histone H1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphohistone H1-specific antibody. For positive control experiments, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk2 antibody, and the immune complex was assayed for Cdk2-associated kinase activity using histone H1 as a substrate as stated above.RESULTSEffect of FGF-2 on Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle—In our previous study (7Lee H.T. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we reported that CECs required prolonged and continuous treatment with FGF-2 for cell proliferation. Because one goal of this study is to determine the kinetics of p27 phosphorylation, it is important to confirm the experimental conditions previously used in which CECs were treated with FGF-2 for a designated time and were further maintained under serum-free conditions for a total incubation time of 24 h. We confirmed the characteristic cell proliferation pattern of CECs stimulated by FGF-2 using BrdU incorporation into DNA (data not shown). G1/S phase transition was determined with PCNA staining in CECs; Fig. 1A demonstrated that CEC progression to S phase in response to FGF-2 stimulation took 16 h. Another control experiment was performed to determine the time period for CECs to re-enter G0 phase following serum starvation. Fig. 1B demonstrated that CECs maintained in serum-free medium for 24 h still possess Cdk2 activity, confirming that our experimental conditions were adequate to pursue the kinetic study. On the other hand, in light of the Cdk2 activity observed in cells starved of serum for 24 h, we chose to starve the cells of serum for 30 h before stimulating the cells with FGF-2 in the following experiments.Effect of FGF-2 on Phosphorylation of p27—Phosphorylation kinetics were determined in CECs treated with FGF-2 for 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24 h. The total protein level of p27 was gradually decreased in a time-dependent manner in response to FGF-2 stimulation (Fig. 2A); the serum-starved CECs maintained the highest level of p27, whereas cells treated with FGF-2 for 24 h demonstrated 40% of the p27 level observed in the serum-starved cells. Unlike p27 expression, FGF-2 did not change the expression of Cdk2 over the time studied, confirming the previous study (28Aikawa T. Segre G.V. Lee K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29347-29352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When the kinetics of p27 phosphorylation at Thr-187 and Ser-10 were determined using specific antibodies to either pp27Thr-187 or pp27Ser-10, differential kinetics were observed: the maximum phosphorylation of p27 at the Ser-10 residue was observed in cells stimulated for 4 h with FGF-2; this high level was maintained for up to 8 h, after which pp27Ser-10 rapidly disappeared from the 12-h treatment condition. In contrast, pp27Thr-187 was barely detectable in cells treated for 8 h, after which the degree of phosphorylation was gradually enhanced, reaching the maximum phosphorylation after 16 h of treatment. The observation may suggest two populations of p27: one being phosphorylated at the Ser-10 residue during the early stage of FGF-2-mediated stimulation; the other being phosphorylated at Thr-187 much later. We further determined how early Ser-10 was phosphorylated in response to FGF-2 stimulation; cells were treated with FGF-2 for 30 min and 1, 1.5, 2., 2.5, 3, 3.5, or 4 h. Fig. 2B showed that phosphorylation at the Ser-10 residue was gradually increased in a time-dependent manner, reaching a 4-h maximum phosphorylation. The total protein level of p27 was slightly decreased in a time-dependent manner, reaching 80% of the p27 level observed in the serum-starved cells, confirming the findings of Fig. 2A. We, therefore, used the 4-h treatment time for the study of pp27Ser-10 in the following experiments.FIGURE 2Effect of FGF-2 on phosphorylation of p27 at Thr-187 and Ser-10. When cells reached ∼70% confluence, they were starved of serum for 30 h. The serum-starved cells were treated with FGF-2 for 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h (A) or at 30-min intervals up to 4 h (B), and then the stimulated cells were maintained in DMEM-0 for up to 24 h. At the end of the treatment, cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting with designated antibodies. The relative density of immunoblotted bands was determined using a gel documentation system. Data were normalized to β-actin (a loading control). Relative fold differences were then compared with the values of unstimulated CECs (0 h). The results represent data obtained in four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The differential phosphorylation kinetics were further confirmed using immunocytochemistry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis. When cells were stained with antibody specific to pp27Thr-187, positive staining of pp27Thr-187 was barely observed in the nuclei of cells treated with FGF-2 for 8 h, after which the staining potential was enhanced for up to 16 h treatment of cells with FGF-2 (Fig. 3A). Positive staining with anti-pp27Thr-187 antibody was greatly decreased in cells treated with FGF-2 for 24 h. On the other hand, the specific antibody to pp27Ser-10 could not be used for immunocytochemical studies. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to p27 (pp27Thr-187 or pp27Ser-10) was, therefore, employed to distinguish the differential kinetics of phosphorylation patterns of p27. When the spots separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis were stained with anti-p27 antibody, cells maintained in the absence of serum showed only the p27 spot (Fig. 3B). When cells were stimulated with FGF-2 for up to 24 h, the intensity of the p27 spots was decreased in a time-dependent manner, while the intensity of the phosphorylated p27 spots was not greatly altered throughout the time studied. When these immunoreactive spots with anti-p27 antibody were further examined using specific antibodies to the phosphorylated p27, antibodies specific to pp27Ser-10 demonstrated a strong positive spot in cells treated with FGF-2 for 4 and 8 h; the spot was barely detectable in cells treated with FGF-2 for 12 h. These findings are similar to those observed in Fig. 2A. On the other hand, maximal intensity of the spot detected with anti-pp27Thr-187 antibody was observed in cells treated for 16 h, confirming the findings of Fig. 2A.FIGURE 3Time-dependent phosphorylation of p27 at Thr-187 and Ser-10 by FGF-2. A, serum-starved cells were treated with FGF-2 for 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h and maintained in DMEM-0 for up to 24 h. The cultured cells were fixed and labeled"
https://openalex.org/W2084450936,"The cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is a bZIP family transcription factor implicated as an oncoprotein and neuron survival factor. CREB is activated in response to cellular stimuli, including cAMP and Ca2+, via phosphorylation of Ser-133, which promotes interaction between the kinase-inducible domain (KID) of CREB and the KID-interacting domain of CREB-binding protein (CBP). We previously demonstrated that the interaction between CREB and CBP is inhibited by DNA-damaging stimuli through a mechanism whereby CREB is phosphorylated by the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein kinase. We now show that the ATM phosphorylation sites in CREB are functionally intertwined with a cluster of coregulated casein kinase (CK) sites. We demonstrate that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of CREB occurs in three steps. The initial event in the CREB phosphorylation cascade is the phosphorylation of Ser-111, which is carried out by CK1 and CK2 under basal conditions and by ATM in response to ionizing radiation. The phosphorylation of Ser-111 triggers the CK2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-108 and the CK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-114 and Ser-117. The phosphorylation of Ser-114 and Ser-117 by CK1 then renders CREB permissive for ATM-dependent phosphorylation on Ser-121. Mutation of Ser-121 alone abrogates ionizing radiation-dependent repression of CREB-CBP complexes, which can be recapitulated using a CK1 inhibitor. Our findings outline a complex mechanism of CREB phosphorylation in which coregulated ATM and CK sites control CREB transactivation potential by modulating its CBP-binding affinity. The coregulated ATM and CK sites identified in CREB may constitute a signaling motif that is common to other DNA damage-regulated substrates.

Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role of this protein in transcriptional control, a recent whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure identified ∼6000 different genomic loci that are occupied by CREB in vivo (2Impey S. McCorkle S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H.

These include a large number of genes with annotated functions in the nervous system, which is consistent with critical roles for CREB in memory, circadian rhythm entrainment, and neuron survival (4Lonze B.E.

The current compendium of CREB target genes also includes a significant number of anti-apoptosis factors, cell cycle regulators, and DNA repair enzymes, suggestive of a role for CREB in the response to DNA damage (2Impey S.

This role, however, remains uncharacterized. The transactivation potential of CREB is enhanced by stimuli, including cAMP and Ca2+ that induce its phosphorylation on Ser-133, which lies within a phosphorylation site-rich region spanning amino acids 100–160 called the kinase-inducible domain (KID) (1Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-133 promotes an interaction between the KID and the KIX domain of the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) (5Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M.

The fact that several distinct signaling pathways converge at the point of Ser-133 phosphorylation suggests that modulation of CREB-dependent transcriptional programs is a common homeostatic response to changes in the extracellular environment. Although Ser-133 phosphorylation status is a key determinant of CREB transcriptional activity, in some instances phosphorylation of this residue does not correlate with CBP binding activity or transactivation potential (15Mayr B.M. Canettieri G. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10936-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may reflect modulatory effects of other post-translational modifications on the CREB-CBP interaction. In addition, CREB can be activated through CBP-independent mechanisms. For example, a family of proteins designated TORCs (transducers of regulated CREB activity) bind to the carboxyl terminus of CREB and strongly activate its transcriptional activity in response to glucogenic stimuli (16Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

The KID also contains consensus casein kinase 1 (CK1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) sites at Ser-108, Ser-111, Ser-114, and Ser-117 (22Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). CK1 and CK2 are two unrelated, constitutively active protein kinases that participate in a wide variety of cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle control, and circadian rhythm entrainment (25Knippschild U. Gocht A. Wolff S. Huber N. Lohler J. Stoter M. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 26Meggio F. Pinna L.A.

Cell. 2004; 117: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To date, hundreds of in vitro substrates for these kinases have been identified (25Knippschild U. Gocht A. Wolff S. Huber N. Lohler J. Stoter M. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 26Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). CK1 and CK2 preferentially phosphorylate Ser residues flanked by Asp, Glu, or phosphorylated Ser residues in the +3or –3 position, respectively (25Knippschild U. Gocht A. Wolff S. Huber N. Lohler J. Stoter M. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 26Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). This property of the enzymes often leads to the processive phosphorylation of substrates harboring clusters of SXXS motifs. In mammalian CREB, the CK1/CK2 sites are spaced such that phosphorylation of Ser-108, Ser-111, Ser-114, or Ser-117 could trigger the processive phosphorylation of the remaining sites. The CK1/CK2 sites are conserved in Drosophila CREB, where they have been reported to negatively regulate DNA binding activity (28Horiuchi J. Jiang W. Zhou H. Wu P. Yin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12117-12125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, although CK1/CK2 site mutations alter the electrophoretic mobility of CREB, suggestive of phosphorylation (29Saeki K. Yuo A. Takaku F. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), definitive evidence that mammalian CREB is phosphorylated on the CK1/CK2 sites in vivo is still lacking, and the precise biochemical functions of these residues remain unknown. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that CREB is a phosphorylation target of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein kinase. ATM is a DNA damage-activated protein kinase that plays critical roles in cell cycle checkpoint activation, DNA repair, and regulation of apoptosis in response to genotoxic stimuli (30Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (459) Google Scholar). CREB contains consensus ATM sites at Thr-100, Ser-111, and Ser-121 within the KID, and by using a phospho-specific antibody, we demonstrated that ATM directly phosphorylates CREB on Ser-121 in response to ionizing radiation (IR), H2O2, and other genotoxic agents (31Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Dodson G.E. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1692-1697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The IR-dependent phosphorylation of CREB inhibited the interaction between CREB and CBP in an ATM phosphorylation site-dependent manner, suggesting that ATM antagonizes CREB transcriptional activity in response to genotoxic stress. These findings are also consistent with the idea that CREB may be a key determinant of the transcriptional response to DNA damage. Their close proximity suggests that the CK1/CK2 and ATM sites may collaborate to modulate CREB function. In this report we provide definitive evidence that the CK1/CK2 sites are phosphorylated in intact cells and show that CK1 is a critical mediator of DNA damage-dependent CREB phosphorylation and regulation. We outline a complex phosphorylation cascade whereby CK1-mediated phosphorylation events license CREB for ATM-dependent phosphorylation on Ser-121, which switches CREB into a low affinity CBP-binding state. These findings provide new insights into the biochemical mechanisms of CREB regulation and suggest that, under some circumstances, CK1 and CK2 function as amplifiers of ATM substrate phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. Cell Culture and Antisera—HEK 293T cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. The α-pCREB-108/111/114 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a triply phosphorylated CREB peptide (CIAEpSEDpSQEpSVD) (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). The peptide was synthesized in collaboration with Dr. Gary Case at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. The resulting antisera were affinity-purified using the CREB phosphopeptide coupled to Sulfo-Link beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s conditions. After three passages (6 ml of raw serum) over phosphopeptide-conjugated resin and washing with PBS, the bound antibodies were eluted with 200 mm glycine (pH 2.50) in 1000-μl fractions and immediately neutralized with 50 μlof1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.00). A pool of antibody-containing fractions (∼4 ml) was dialyzed against PBS and stored in PBS containing 50% glycerol at –20 °C. The α-pCREB-108/111/114 antibody was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for immunoblotting. Other antibodies used in this study were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. These include α-ATM (Genetex), α-pATM-1981 (Rockland), α-CREB (Cell Signaling), α-pCREB-121 (Novus Biologicals), α-pCREB-133 and α-tubulin (Upstate), and α-FLAG (Sigma). The CK1 inhibitor D4476 and the CK2 inhibitor TBB were obtained from EMD Biosciences. D4476 and TBB were added 3 h prior to application of DNA damage and were used at concentrations of 75 and 50 μm, respectively. The ATM inhibitor, KU-55933 (33Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M.B. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), was prepared in Me2SO and added to a final concentration of 10 μm 1 h prior to cell irradiation. Plasmids and Transfections—Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation procedure. Cells were harvested 36 h later and extracts prepared as described previously (34Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Seventy five μg of total protein was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% dried milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep antimouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Where indicated, band pixel intensities were determined using the GelPlot2 function of ScionImage (Scion Corp.). Values were normalized for lane-to-lane differences in total CREB band intensity. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-KIX pulldown assays were performed as described (35van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange method (Stratagene) and the following oligonucleotide primer pairs: CREB108A (5′-CAGATTTCAACTATTGCAGAAGCTGAAGATTCACAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGTGAATCTTCAGCTTCTGCAATAGTTGAAATCTG-3′ (reverse)); CREB111A (5′-CCACTGACTCCTCTGCATCTTCACTTTCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGAAAGTGAAGATGCACAGGAGTCAGTGG-3′ (reverse)); CREB114A (5′-GAAGATTCACAGGAGGCAGTGGATAGTGTAACTGATTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAATCAGTTACACTATCCACTGCCTCCTGTGAATCTTC-3′ (reverse)); CREB117A (5′-GGAGTCAGTGGATGCTGTAACTGATTCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGAATCAGTTACAGCATCCACTGACTCC (reverse)); CREB121A (5′-GGATAGTGTAACTGATGCCCAAAAGCGAAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCTTCGCTTTTGGGCATCAGTTACACTATCC-3′ (reverse)); and CREB112D (5′-GCAGAAAGTGAAGATTCAGACGAGTCAGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACTGACTCGTCTGAATCTTCACTTTCTGC-3′(reverse)). The template for mutagenesis was a full-length CREB cDNA in the vector pCMV-pSPORT6 (31Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Where indicated, we also employed a FLAG-CREB expression construct that was generated by PCR cloning the CREB open reading frame, encoding an amino-terminal FLAG tag, into the NheI-NotI sites of pcDNA3.1-Zeo (Invitrogen). Primers used were 5′-GCTAGCCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGACCATGGAATCTGGAGCCGAGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTAATCTGATTTGTGGCAGTAAAG-3′ (reverse). All oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). To observe subtle DNA damage-dependent changes in CREB electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2B), we resolved whole-cell extracts on 24-cm, 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Each gel was electrophoresed at 40 mA for 12 h under cooling conditions. Kinase Assays—CK1 and CK2 kinase assays were performed using purified, recombinant CK1 δ and CK2 α/β enzymes (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s conditions. Two micrograms of purified, His6-tagged CREB (His-CREB) were used for each assay (31Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). His-CREB was incubated with 0.4 μl of CK1, CK2, or both enzymes in the presence of 200 μm ATP in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Reactions were performed for 1 h at 30 °C in the absence or presence of D4476 or TBB, and terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample loading buffer. Phosphorylation of CREB was monitored by immunoblotting with α-pCREB-108/111/114 and α-CREB antibodies. Effects of CK1 and CK2 Inhibitors on DNA Damage-induced CREB Phosphorylation—We previously showed that ATM directly phosphorylates CREB on Ser-121 in response to DNA damage and provided circumstantial evidence that Ser-111 was also a DNA damage-inducible ATM phosphorylation site (31Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an S111A mutation strongly suppressed IR-induced phosphorylation of Ser-121, suggesting that CREB is processively phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (31Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ser-111 is also a consensus CK1/CK2 site, and examination of the CREB amino acid sequence reveals the possibility of linked phosphorylation between Ser-111, Ser-108, Ser-114, and Ser-117 (Fig. 1A). Specifically, the phosphorylation of Ser-111 creates a consensus CK2 site at Ser-108 and consensus CK1 sites at Ser-114 and Ser-117. A subset of the candidate ATM and CK1/CK2 sites are also present in the KID of Drosophila CREB, suggesting potentially conserved functions. The juxtaposition of the ATM and CK1/CK2 sites led us to consider the potential roles of CK1 and CK2 in the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of CREB. To this end we examined the effects of specific inhibitors of CK1 (D4476) (36Rena G. Bain J. Elliott M. Cohen P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and CK2 (TBB) (37Sarno S. Reddy H. Meggio F. Ruzzene M. Davies S.P. Donella-Deana A. Shugar D. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) on the IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-121. HEK 293T cells were pretreated with vehicle, TBB, or D4476 for 3 h prior to exposure to 0, 5, or 10 Gy of IR. Under these conditions, TBB strongly suppressed the basal phosphorylation of CREB, as evidenced by a decrease in the relative abundance of the slow electrophoretic mobility form. However, TBB did not inhibit the IR-induced CREB electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the CK1 inhibitor, D4476, abolished the IR-induced CREB electrophoretic mobility shift in addition to blocking basal CREB phosphorylation. In D4476-treated cells, the suppression of the IR-induced electrophoretic mobility shift was accompanied by a nearly complete defect in Ser-121 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, middle panel). TBB also caused a modest but reproducible attenuation of Ser-121 phosphorylation in response to IR, which was further revealed in a dose-response experiment (Fig. 1C). These findings strongly suggest that CK1 and CK2 contribute to the IR- and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-121 and that CK1 activity is a critical determinant of Ser-121 phosphorylation status in DNA-damaged cells. Contributions of Individual CK1 and CK2 Sites to DNA Damage-induced CREB Phosphorylation—Our next objective was to define the contributions of individual CK1/CK2 phosphorylation sites to basal and IR-induced CREB phosphorylation. As observed previously (31Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), mutation of Ser-111 (CREB111A) or all three ATM consensus sites (CREB3A) completely suppressed the IR-induced CREB electrophoretic mobility shift and blocked ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-121 in transiently transfected HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2A). Mutation of the CK2 site at Ser-108 (CREB108A) or the CK1 site at Ser-114 (CREB114A) also inhibited the IR-induced CREB electrophoretic mobility shift and Ser-121 phosphorylation to different degrees. Mutation of Ser-108 had a small inhibitory effect on IR-induced Ser-121 phosphorylation, whereas the S114A mutation exhibited a Ser-121 phosphorylation defect nearly as severe as the CREB111A mutant (Fig. 2A). To more carefully examine the effects of individual phosphorylation site mutations on CREB electrophoretic mobility, and to potentially gain insight into the order of phosphorylation, we resolved wild-type and mutant CREB proteins using prolonged electrophoresis conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). For this experiment we transiently transfected HEK 293T cells with FLAG-tagged CREB constructs so that comparison of electrophoretic mobility shifts was not confounded by endogenous CREB. As expected, the CREB111A mutant exhibited a severe electrophoretic mobility shift defect in comparison to CREBWT, either in the absence or presence of IR (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that the overexpression of CREB is sufficient to induce its hyperphosphorylation in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2B and Ref. 31Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and thus, the majority of CREBWT migrated as the slow mobility form. The electrophoretic mobility of CREB108A was slightly enhanced relative to CREBWT, whereas CREB114A demonstrated an electrophoretic mobility intermediate between CREB108A and CREB111A (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-108 and Ser-114 contributes to CREB electrophoretic mobility retardation and that the phosphorylation of these sites occurs subsequent to the phosphorylation of Ser-111. The phosphorylation of Ser-114 is predicted to generate a consensus CK1 site at Ser-117, which we identified as an in vivo CREB phosphorylation site through mass spectrometry sequencing (data not shown). Therefore, the effect of an S117A mutation on CREB electrophoretic mobility and IR-induced Ser-121 phosphorylation was investigated. The CREB117A mutant exhibited a subtle electrophoretic mobility shift defect, as well as an ∼80% reduction in IR-induced Ser-121 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). From the combined experiments we conclude that the CK1/CK2 sites contribute to IR-dependent CREB electrophoretic mobility shifts and that phosphorylation of the Ser-111, Ser-114, and Ser-117 residues is required for optimal CREB phosphorylation on Ser-121 by ATM. The results also implicate Ser-108 as an in vivo phosphorylation site and suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser-111 is the key initiating event in the CREB phosphorylation cascade. Enhanced CREB Phosphorylation by CK2 Lowers the Threshold for DNA Damage-induced Phosphorylation of Ser-121—In light of the above findings, we reasoned that enhanced CK1/CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-111 would lower the threshold of DNA damage required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-121. One way to test this hypothesis is to incorporate specific amino acid mutations that enhance the CK2- and/or CK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-111 while not enhancing its phosphorylation by ATM. To this end, we generated a CREB112D mutant harboring a Q112D substitution. The incorporation of an acidic residue in the +1 position is predicted to enhance phosphorylation of Ser-111 by CK2 (26Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because glutamine in the +1 position is critical for substrate phosphorylation by ATM and ATR (38Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), the same substitution should compromise Ser-111 phosphorylation by ATM. Therefore, we compared the phosphorylation profiles of CREBWT and CREB112D in untreated and IR-treated HEK 293T cells. The CREB112D mutant exhibited basal Ser-121 phosphorylation, which was not observed for CREBWT, and also showed enhanced IR-dependent phosphorylation of this residue (Fig. 2D, top panel). In addition, although CREBWT migrated as a partially resolved doublet in undamaged cells (Fig. 2D, denoted by arrows), CREB112D migrated exclusively as the slow electrophoretic mobility, hyperphosphorylated form on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that the Q112D mutation"

In this study, unusual nonstoichiometric burst kinetics of the steady state reaction were observed and analyzed in detail, revealing that a reversible inactivation process occurs during turnover, associated with a slow isomerization of the substrate complex. We have investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of this kinetic behavior by preparing recombinant barley oxalate oxidase in three distinct oxidation states (Mn(II), Mn(III), and Mn(IV)) and producing a nonglycosylated variant for detailed biochemical and spectroscopic characterization. Surprisingly, the fully reduced Mn(II) form, which represents the majority of the as-isolated native enzyme, lacks oxalate oxidase activity, but the activity is restored by oxidation of the metal center to either Mn(III) or Mn(IV) forms. All three oxidation states appear to interconvert under turnover conditions, and the steady state activity of the enzyme is determined by a balance between activation and inactivation processes.

Dunwell J.M. Goodenough P.W. Marvier A.C. Pickersgill R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Structural characterization of the glycolate (substrate analog) complex of OXO suggest that two asparagine residues (Asn75 and Asn85) may play a role in orienting and stabilizing complexes of substrate or intermediates. Site-directed mutagenesis of these two residues in recombinant barley OXO demonstrates that they are essential for activity (16Opaleye O. Rose R.-S. Whittaker M.M. Woo E.-J. Whittaker J.W.

Biophys. 2005; 433: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has resulted in a number of proposals for the OXO turnover reaction based on a reduced Mn(II) as a starting point, consistent with the previous enzyme characterization (8Requena L.

In this paper, we describe the preparation of homogenous forms of OXO in distinct oxidation states (Mn(II), Mn(III), and Mn(IV)), which allows us to spectroscopically and biochemically characterize each of these species and correlate catalytic activity with the metal oxidation state for the first time. These new results provide insight into the origin of unusual burst kinetics associated with OXO turnover.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBiological Materials—Recombinant barley oxalate oxidase from P. pastoris was purified as described previously (10Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). P. pastoris X33 was obtained from Invitrogen. Nonglycosylated oxalate oxidase was produced by site-directed mutagenesis (S49A) using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the 5′phosphorylated primer 5′-GCT GGT AAC ACC GCC ACC CCG AAC-3′. Protocatechuate dioxygenase was prepared from Brevibacterium fuscum (ATCC 15993) as previously described (17Whittaker J.W. Lipscomb J.D. Kent T.A. Munck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4466-4475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant manganese superoxide dismutase was isolated from Escherichia coli (18Whittaker J.W. Whittaker M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5528-5540Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and recombinant manganese catalase was isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum as previously described (19Whittaker M.M. Barynin V.V. Igarashi T. Whittaker J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1102-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Reagents—Oxalic acid dihydrate was obtained from Fluka. Sodium m-periodate (NaIO4) and hydroxylamine sulfate ((NH2OH)2·H2SO4) were purchased from Sigma, and peracetic acid was from Aldrich. Deuterium oxide (D2O) was obtained from Aldrich or from CDN Isotopes (LaValle, Canada), and glass-distilled deuterium oxide was purchased from Aldrich. Deuterium oxide was further purified by passage through a column containing carbon filter (2 g) for organic adsorption and mixed bed ion exchange resin (1 g) (Nanopure, Barnstead, Dubuque, IA), topped with2gof Dowex AG501-X8(D) indicating mixed bed ion exchanger (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 12 bed volumes of D2O (120 ml) before collecting solvent for enzyme kinetics.The purity of the D2O was evaluated by mass spectrometry (performed by Lorne Isabelle, Mass Spectrometry Facilities, Department of Environmental and Biomolecular Systems, Oregon Health and Sciences University). For estimation of dissolved organics, a sample of D2O was incubated for 20 min with a Carbowax Solid Phase microextraction fiber (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Adsorbed material was volatilized and analyzed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences TurboMass Gold mass spectrometer equipped with an Autosystem XL GC. Isotopic purity was estimated by injection of a small amount of the solvent directly into the GC port for analysis of the mass distribution. Mass spectral analysis indicated that the deuterium content of the purified solvent was ≥95 atom % deuterium.Biochemical Analysis—Protein concentration of purified oxalate oxidase was determined by optical absorption measurements, using the molar extinction coefficient (ε = 8400 m–1 cm–1 at 278 nm) (8Requena L. Bornemann S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metal ion analyses were performed using a Varian Instruments SpectrAA graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Oxalate oxidase activity was measured by oxygen uptake assay with a Clark oxygen electrode in a thermostated cell (25 °C) with a glass plug to restrict air access to the assay mixture. The electrode current was converted to a voltage signal using a high sensitivity amplifier circuit, the signal was digitized using a National Instruments DAQPad 6020E 12-bit A/D converter, and data were collected using the National Instruments Lab-View 8 interface. The response of the electrode was routinely calibrated using the protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate dioxygenase reaction (21Whittaker M.M. Ballou D.P. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8426-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The oxalate oxidase assay mixture (final volume 1.9 ml) contained 50 mm sodium succinate buffer adjusted to the specified pH value using sodium hydroxide (pH range 2.5–5.0) or sodium phosphate (pH 5.5 and 6.0). Oxalate substrate stock solution (100 or 250 mm) was also adjusted to the specified pH value using sodium hydroxide. Oxalate oxidase (10 μg) in H2O (or 10 μg of S49A OXO in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5) was added at 25 °C, and the oxygen uptake progress curve was recorded for ∼10 min. For activity measurements in deuterium oxide mixtures, the enzyme was preincubated in the isotopic solvent for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate (oxalate, 1 mm).Kinetic Analysis—Experimental progress curves were imported into data processing software (Kaleidograph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The data were fit to an empirical burst kinetics model using the program's nonlinear regression and statistical analysis utilities to obtain estimates of initial and steady state velocities. Detailed mechanistic models were tested by simulation of the experimental progress curves through numerical integration of the differential equations describing the model, using the program Scientist (Micromath, St. Louis, MO). A complete system of differential equations (ODEs) describing a kinetic model (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975: 28-29Google Scholar) was entered for every initial substrate concentration used in the experimental data to be fit, with appropriate indexing to link each set of equations to the appropriate time course data. Simultaneous fitting of all of the data sets by nonlinear regression yielded a global fit to the collective data and best fit estimates of the shared parameters (the elementary rate constants). Each optimization step in this process involves numerical solution of the ODEs to obtain progress curves, which are compared with the experimental data. Although all of the ODE solvers available within the Scientist program were able to perform this analysis, the EPISODE algorithm for stiff equations proved most robust.Redox Modifications—All redox transformations were performed at room temperature. The superoxidized Mn(IV) oxalate oxidase was prepared by the addition of 2 eq (based on manganese content) of NaIO4 to the purified enzyme (in 50 mm sodium succinate, pH 4, or 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7) and desalting by gel filtration. The oxidized Mn(III) oxalate oxidase was obtained by treating Mn(IV)-containing enzyme with ascorbic acid (2 mm free acid in the same buffers as described above), and the excess ascorbate was removed by gel filtration. Reduction of both Mn(IV) and Mn(III) enzyme complexes to the limiting Mn(II) form was achieved by the addition of hydroxylamine to the oxidized enzyme. Oxidation of oxalate oxidase by peracetic acid was performed by adding 2.5 μl of 47.5 mm peracetic acid to a cuvette containing oxalate oxidase (3 mg/ml, 30 μm manganese) in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium succinate buffer, pH 4, to give a final peracetic acid concentration of 120 μm, with less than 50 μm hydrogen peroxide based on the manufacturer's analytical specifications. The solution was rapidly mixed and incubated for 2 min at room temperature before scanning the absorption spectrum. Turnover-generated, superoxidized oxalate oxidase was produced by the addition of oxalate (10–20 mm) to a solution of enzyme in D2O, followed by purging with pure oxygen for 5 min at room temperature, and the product was desalted by gel filtration for assaying activity. Oxidation of resting Mn(II) enzyme by dioxygen was studied by incubating Mn(II) oxalate oxidase (in 50 mm sodium succinate buffer, pH 4) under an atmosphere of pure oxygen for 6 h in a sealed cuvette. UV extinction coefficients for the oxidized OXO modifications were evaluated by optical titration with oxidant or reductant combined with Lowry protein analysis. The values obtained for recombinant barley OXO were ε280 nm = 11,200 m–1 cm–1 for Mn(IV) OXO and ε280 nm = 9000 m–1 cm–1 for Mn(III) OXO.Stability Analysis of Mn(IV) OXO—Barley OXO (15 mg/ml in 25 mm sodium succinate buffer, pH 4, or 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7) was titrated to the Mn(IV) end point with 10 mm sodium periodate (∼1.2 eq based on manganese content), monitored by optical absorption spectroscopy. The oxidized Mn(IV) OXO was immediately desalted by gel filtration, diluted in the same buffer to 3 mg/ml, and incubated at room temperature. The optical spectrum of the complex was recorded periodically over 2 days. For mass spectrometric analysis, the oxidized protein was dialyzed against 5 mm ammonium acetate. Protein mass spectra were measured on an Applied Biosystems QStar XL mass spectrometer operating in electrospray mode by Debra McMillen of the Proteomics Shared Resource at Oregon Health and Science University.Spectroscopic Measurements—Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Instruments Cary 500 UV-visible-NIR absorption spectrometer. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using an AVIV Associates model 40DS UV-visible-NIR spectrometer. EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker E500 X-Band EPR spectrometer equipped with a SuperX bridge, a super HiQ cavity resonator, a ER4116DM biomodal microwave resonator, and an Oxford ESR 900 continuous flow cryostat. EPR spectra were simulated using XSophe simulation software and the Bruker Xepr interface.EPR spin quantitation was performed by double integration of the experimental spectra to give an integrated intensity (I0), which was corrected for the effects of g anisotropy following the method of Aasa and Vängård (23Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Res. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar), Icorr=I0/gav(Eq. 1) where gav=23gx2+gy2+gz23+gx+gy+gz9(Eq. 2) Circular dichroism spectra were deconvoluted into Gaussian components after importing the experimental data into Scientist (Micromath, St. Louis, MO). A model composed of five Gaussian components represented in the area form (Equation 3), y=∑i(Ai/(wiπ/2))exp(−[4(x−x0,i)/wi]2)(Eq. 3) was fit to each experimental spectrum, optimizing the center (x0), width (w), and area (A) parameters for each peak by nonlinear regression.RESULTSSteady State KineticsBurst Kinetics—Oxalate oxidase catalysis may be directly monitored by measuring the uptake of the co-substrate, dioxygen, with an oxygen-sensitive Clark electrode (Fig. 1). Progress curves at low oxalate concentration are monophasic and nearly linear, as expected in the early stages of the reaction before the substrate concentration has changed appreciably ([S] ≈ [S]0). As the oxalate concentration is increased, the initial velocity increases, but the biphasic character to the time courses also becomes more pronounced, particularly at the highest oxalate concentration range (Fig. 1, curve 20). Based on the overall amplitude, this biphasic character is not the result of depletion of either of the substrates and has the general appearance of a kinetic burst. However, the amplitude of the burst is nonstoichiometric with the amount of enzyme in the assay mixture and represents a more than 100-fold excess over the active sites.In general, the reaction progress curves characteristic of burst kinetics reflect a relaxation between two limiting forms of the enzyme, each with distinct kinetic properties, and the relaxation process is defined by the burst rate constant, k (24Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Equation 4). [P]t=[S]0−[S]t=Vs·t−((Vs−Vi)(1−e−kt)/k)(Eq. 4) Here, [P]t and [S]t are product and substrate concentrations at time t, [S]0 is the initial substrate concentration, and the limiting forms of the enzyme have kinetic parameters Vi (associated with the initial burst phase) and Vs (associated with the steadystate phase after the burst), respectively. This empirical equation may be used to analyze burst kinetics time courses without any detailed mechanistic assumptions.The results of applying the burst equation analysis to the experimental time courses for oxalate oxidase turnover are shown in Fig. 2. The dependence of the initial velocity (Vi) on oxalate concentration follows a regular hyperbolic saturation form (Fig. 2A), and fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation yields estimates of Km(oxalate) = 0.78 ± 0.03 mm and kcat = 9.7 ± 0.1 s–1 in air-saturated buffer (pH 4) after correction for manganese content. These values are very similar to those previously reported for oxalate oxidase (8Requena L. Bornemann S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxalate dependence of Vs (Fig. 2B) is strikingly different and exhibits a dramatic biphasic form, which may be fit with the classic substrate inhibition rate equation (Equation 5), −d[S]/dt=Vmax·[S]/(Km+[S](1+[S]/KI))(Eq. 5) where KI is the inhibition constant for the reaction. The Vs data may be fit by this equation with Km = 1.4 ± 0.9 mm and KI = 0.2 ± 0.1 mm (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the obvious substrate concentration dependence of Vi and Vs, the burst rate constant (k) appears to be essentially independent of substrate concentration above 0.5 mm (Fig. 2C). Below 0.5 mm, the burst rate constant appears to decrease, but evaluation of k also becomes more problematic in that region, when Vi and Vs are nearly the same.FIGURE 2Steady state parameter analysis for oxalate oxidase burst kinetics. The progress curves (Fig. 1) were individually fit to the burst equation (Equation 4) to evaluate initial velocity (Vi), steady-state velocity (Vs), and the burst rate constant (k). The average value for each data point and the S.D. for the triplicate measurements are shown. A, substrate concentration dependence of Vi.

Differential equations describing a burst kinetics model for oxalate oxidase (Scheme 1) were numerically integrated and globally fit to experimental progress curves spanning 10 different substrate concentrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rate constants corresponding to substrate binding steps (k1f and k5f) were both fixed at a value of 1 × 106 m–1 s–1 to reduce the number of variables in the fitting process. The best fit set of rate constants is as follows: k–1r = 743 s–1; k2(O2) = 9.7 s–1; k3 = 1000 s–1; k4f = 0.026 s–1; k4r = 0.048 s–1; k5r = 179 s1. The theoretical progress curves corresponding to these values are shown as solid lines in the figures. Oxalate concentrations were as follows: 0.1 mm (□); 0.2 mm (○); 0.3 mm (diao); 0.4 mm (▵); 0.6 mm (*); 1.2 mm (▿); 1.8 mm (+); 5 mm (×); 10 mm (); 20 mm ().View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)pH Dependence of Kinetic Parameters—The steady state behavior of oxalate oxidase was examined over a range of pH values (from 2.5 to 6.0) in a direct assay by recording the oxygen uptake kinetics and analyzing the progress curves as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. The results of the analysis are given in Table 2 and Fig. 2D. The catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) increases continuously to low pH, rather than reaching a maximum at pH 4, as previously described for turnover at 37 °C using a peroxidase-coupled assay (25Kotsira V.P. Clonis Y.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Km evaluated from initial velocity data exhibits a strong pH dependence (Fig. 2D) with limiting slopes (versus pH) of 0.9 ± 0.01 (below pH 4) and 1.50 ± 0.03 (above pH 4). In contrast to the strong pH dependence of Km, Vi(max) is nearly independent of pH over the range from 3 to 5.TABLE 2pH dependence of the steady state kinetic parameters for oxalate oxidasepHaOxalate oxidase activity was assayed with a Clark oxygen electrode in air-saturated 50 mm sodium succinate or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer.

Open table in a new tab Solvent Kinetic Isotope Effect—The effect of the isotopic composition of the solvent on the kinetic parameters was investigated by assaying oxalate oxidase in buffer prepared from H2O/ D2O mixtures. Kinetic parameters were evaluated by fitting the progress curves to the burst equation (Equation 4), and the isotope sensitivity of the parameters was determined (Fig. 4). The initial rate shows a modest normal solvent isotope effect (kH2O/kD2O = 1.59 ± 0.05) that appears to exhibit a linear proton inventory plot (Fig. 4, top), consistent with a single proton being involved in the isotope-sensitive transition state. The burst rate constant is essentially insensitive to the isotopic composition of the solvent (kH2O/kD2O = 1.027 ± 0.04) (Fig. 4, middle). In contrast, the effects of varying the deuterium content of the solvent on the steady state rate (Vs) were relatively dramatic (Fig. 4, bottom). The limiting values of Vs lead to an estimate of the overall solvent kinetic isotope effect kH2O/kD2O = 8.5 ± 1.3, suggesting that the full primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect is being expressed. The proton inventory is also markedly parabolic, deviating from linear solvent isotope concentration dependence. This type of curved proton inventory plot is consistent with multiple protons being involved in the transition state for the inactivation process (26Venkatasubban K.S. Schowen R.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), as indicated by the quality of the fit to a quadratic form (Fig. 4, bottom, dashed line). Alternatively, this behavior may be interpreted as evidence for isotopic fractionation. In the latter view, an equilibrium isotope effect associated with the hydrogen/deuterium exchange reaction would lead to enrichment of deuterium over hydrogen at a kinetically significant site in the protein. Isotope fractionation is well established and in fact forms the basis for one of the methods for D2O enrichment. The fractionation factors may be evaluated from the expe"
https://openalex.org/W2005286798,"Previous studies of HIV-1 p55Gag immunization of mice have demonstrated the usefulness of targeting antigens to the cellular compartment containing the major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) complex molecules by use of a DNA antigen formulation encoding Gag as a chimera with the mouse lysosome-associated membrane protein (mLAMP/gag). In the present study, we have analyzed the magnitude and breadth of Gag-specific T-lymphocyte and antibody responses elicited in Rhesus macaques after immunization with DNA encoding a human LAMP/gag (hLAMP/gag) chimera. ELISPOT analyses indicated that the average Gag-specific IFN-γ response elicited by the hLAMP/gag chimera was detectable after only two or three naked DNA immunizations in all five immunized macaques and reached an average of 1000 spot-forming cells (SFC)/106 PBMCs. High IFN-γ ELISPOT responses were detected in CD8+-depleted cells, indicating that CD4+ T-cells play a major role in these responses. The T-cell responses of four of the macaques were also tested by use of ELISPOT to 12 overlapping 15-amino acids (aa) peptide pools containing ten peptides each, encompassing the complete Gag protein sequence. The two Mamu 08 immunized macaques responded to eight and twelve of the pools, the Mamu B01 to six, and the other macaque to five pools indicating that the hLAMP/gag DNA antigen formulation elicits a broad T-cell response against Gag. Additionally, there was a strong HIV-1-specific IgG response. The IgG antibody titers increased after each DNA injection, indicating a strong amnestic B-cell response, and were highly elevated in all the macaques after three immunizations. Moreover, the serum of each macaque recognized 13 of the 49 peptides of a 20-aa peptide library covering the complete Gag amino acid sequence. In addition, HIV-1-specific IgA antibodies were present in the plasma and external secretions, including nasal washes. These data support the findings of increased immunogenicity of genetic vaccines encoded as LAMP chimeras, including the response to DNA vaccines by non-human primates."
https://openalex.org/W2004252300,"The formation of enduring internal representation of sensory information demands, in many cases, convergence in time and space of two different stimuli. The first conveys the sensory input, mediated via fast neurotransmission. The second conveys the meaning of the input, hypothesized to be mediated via slow neurotransmission. We tested the biochemical conditions and feasibility for fast (NMDA) and slow (dopamine) neurotransmission to converge on the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase signaling pathways, crucial in several forms of synaptic plasticity, and recorded its effects upon synaptic transmission. We detected differing kinetics of ERK2 activation and synaptic strength changes in the CA1 for low and high doses of neurotransmitters in hippocampal slices. Moreover, when weak fast and slow inputs are given together, they converge on ERK2, but not on p38 or JNK, and induce strong short-term synaptic depression. Surprisingly, pharmacological analysis revealed that a probable site of such convergence is the NMDA receptor itself, suggesting it serves as a detector and integrator of fast and slow neurotransmission in the mature mammalian brain, as revealed by ERK2 activation and synaptic function."

Fast fibers express the IID/X, IIB, or IIA isoform of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC), 3The abbreviations used are: MyHC, myosin heavy chain; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein; CsA, cyclosporin A; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEF-2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; MKK, MAPK kinase; MKP-1, MAPK phophatase-1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DM, differentiation medium; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; P-p38, phosphorylated p38. 3The abbreviations used are: MyHC, myosin heavy chain; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein; CsA, cyclosporin A; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEF-2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; MKK, MAPK kinase; MKP-1, MAPK phophatase-1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DM, differentiation medium; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; P-p38, phosphorylated p38. whereas slow fibers predominantly express the type I/β isoform. The functional, biochemical, and morphological differences between fiber types are a consequence of different fiber-specific gene expression patterns. Fibers are characterized by a remarkable plasticity and can be modulated by chronic low frequency electrical stimulation depending on the imposed activity pattern (2Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologically, this transformation process in fiber type occurs in response to altered demands, such as increases in muscle activity (3Goldspink G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 285-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fiber type shifts are also observed during aging and disease. The importance of changes in intracellular Ca2+ as a trigger for fiber type transformation has clearly been demonstrated by a Ca2+-ionophore-induced fast-to-slow transformation in primary skeletal muscle cells (4Kubis H.P. Haller E.A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Meissner J.D. Kubis H.P. Scheibe R.J. Gros G. J. Physiol. 2000; 523: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The involvement of calcineurin, a Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine phosphatase, in transducing the Ca2+-signal into altered gene expression in skeletal muscle has been established (6Meissner J.D. Gros G. Scheibe R.J. Scholz M. Kubis H.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Chin E.R. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2004; 63: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 is pivotal for muscle differentiation based on studies with myogenic cell lines (8Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 9Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Unlike the prototypical activation program of p38 by stress and proinflamatory cytokines (10Shi Y. Gaestel M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1519-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), an independent and persistent p38 activation occurs in differentiating muscle cells (11Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the p38 MAPK has been implicated in adaptive processes in heart (12Molkentin J.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) as well as in skeletal muscle (13Long Y.C. Widegren U. Zierath J.R. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2004; 63: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Sakamoto K. Goodyear L.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). So far, little is known about a possible role for p38 in the regulation of gene expression in adult skeletal muscle cells. Four isoforms of p38 have been identified and characterized (10Shi Y. Gaestel M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1519-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Isoforms α and β are expressed ubiquitously, whereas p38γ is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle. Isoform δ is not expressed in skeletal muscle. The kinases are activated via phosphorylation through the upstream dual specificity kinases MAPK kinase (MKK) 3 and 6 (15Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Constitutively active MKK6 (MKK6EE) reportedly promotes expression of fast but not slow MyHC protein while enhancing differentiation of C2C12 muscle cells (16Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6600-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, in C2C12 myotubes fast MyHCIIa promoter activity was found to be unaffected by p38 inhibition (17Allen D.L. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45323-45330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The p38 MAPK pathway promotes skeletal muscle differentiation at least in part via muscle regulatory factors, recruitment of chromatin remodelling enzymes, and the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2C (MEF-2C) (9Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 18Lluis F. Perdiguero E. Nebreda A.R. Munoz-Canoves P. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The MEF-2 family is a key factor for controlling gene expression in myocytes (19Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The four isoforms A, B, C, and D are highly expressed in skeletal muscle in distinct but overlapping patterns during differentiation and in the adult muscle. Binding sites of MEF-2 are important for expression of many muscle-specific genes (19Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). MEF-2 together with other transcription factor binding activities are thought to be linked to quantitative differences in MyHC isoform expression in mouse skeletal muscle (20Allen D.L. Weber J.N. Sycuro L.K. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17126-17134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the MEF-2A and C isoforms is stimulated by p38α and β2 through direct phosphorylation (21Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 22Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23Yang S.H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 24Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Combinatorial action of MEF-2 through protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators, or corepressors (19Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 25McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) are well known. For example, during muscle differentiation, MEF-2 interacts directly with muscle regulatory factors (26Black B.L. Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and also with coactivator p300 (27Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The transactivation function of transcription factors is often mediated by coactivators with histone acetyltransferase activity like p300 and the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) (28Kalkhoven E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase activity is important for chromatin remodeling to facilitate access of transcription factors and of the basal transcriptional machinery to DNA (28Kalkhoven E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In addition, histone acetyltransferases can modify transcription factors and serve as a scaffold for building of multicomponent transcriptional complexes (29Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their modulation of transcription factors alters gene expression. The interaction of p300 with MEF-2C in differentiating C2C12 cells and subsequent acetylation of the transcription factor resulted in enhanced DNA binding and transcriptional activity (30Ma K. Chan J.K. Zhu G. Wu Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3575-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Despite their high degree of homology, p300 and CBP are not completely redundant but play unique and distinct roles in gene regulation (28Kalkhoven E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). They can differentially associate with other proteins and show differences in substrate specificity. Transcriptional coactivators are controlled by an array of various covalent modifications, suggesting the existence of a “coactivator code” that regulates their function in transcriptional gene regulation (31Gamble M.J. Freedman L.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 165-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, the function of both p300 and CBP can be regulated by phosphorylation (32Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the emerging role of transcriptional coactivators as primary targets of physiological signals (33Spiegelman B.M. Heinrich R. Cell. 2004; 119: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that p38 MAPK regulates gene activities in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. We used myotubes of the C2C12 cell line and of a rabbit primary skeletal muscle cell culture that has been shown previously to develop exclusively adult MyHC isoforms (4Kubis H.P. Haller E.A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Meissner J.D. Kubis H.P. Scheibe R.J. Gros G. J. Physiol. 2000; 523: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that inhibition of p38α/β MAPKs resulted in the down-regulation of fast adult MyHCIId/x gene activity. In turn, activated p38α/β MAPKs mediated MyHCIId/x gene expression via recruitment of transcriptional coactivator CBP to a MEF-2C/D heterodimer complex at a proximal MEF-2-binding site in the promoter. Recruitment of CBP was inhibited by Ca2+-ionophore or electrical stimulation. Our data reveal a new role for p38α/β MAPKs in regulating MyHCIId/x gene activity during fiber type transformation in skeletal muscle. Cell Culture and Electrical Stimulation—Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were grown on Petri dishes in growth medium, consisting of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At confluency, growth medium was replaced by differentiation medium (DM, DMEM plus 5% horse serum). COS-7 cells (ATCC) were grown in 10% DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The mouse embryonic fibroblasts p38α-/- cells, derived from p38α knockout mice by targeted inactivation of the mouse p38α gene (34Porras A. Zuluaga S. Black E. Valladares A. Alvarez A.M. Ambrosino C. Benito M. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and wild type cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the medium was replaced every 24 h. In some experiments, the cells were treated with 0.1 μm of Ca2+-ionophore A23187 (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 1 μm SB203580 (Sigma) or 0.1 μm Ca2+-ionophore in the presence or absence of different calcineurin inhibitors. To inhibit calcineurin, 500 ng/ml cyclosporin A (CsA) (Sigma), 80 ng/ml FK506 (Alexis Biochemicals), or 50 μm cell-permeable calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (11R-CaN-AID) (Calbiochem), respectively, were used. In addition, some cultures were transiently transfected with an expression vector for constitutively active MKK6, pcDNA3-MKK6EE. Rabbit primary skeletal muscle cells were isolated, cultured for 14 days, and stimulated electrically with a slow fiber type activity pattern (45-min stimulation periods with 1 Hz for 15 min followed by a 30-min pause) for additional 4 or 6 days as described previously (6Meissner J.D. Gros G. Scheibe R.J. Scholz M. Kubis H.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—To generate mutated MEF-2C T293A that cannot be phosphorylated by p38 in muscle cells (24Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), full-length MEF-2C (GenBank™ accession number NM025282) was mutated by changing nucleotide 849 A to G using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MEF-2C expression plasmid pcDNA1-MEF-2C (35Martin J.F. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. E. Olson. To generate MyHCIId/x-2.8ΔMEF2, again the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays—C2C12 myoblasts were transfected in growth medium at 50–60% confluency with 1.5 μg of promoter DNA (32Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar), 0.35 μg of pCMV-Gal, 0.75 μg of expression plasmid or empty expression vector, and 2.5 μl/μg DNA of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After further 24 h, growth medium was replaced by DM (DMEM plus 5% horse serum), and myotubes were harvested 3 days after transfection. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected at 70% confluency with 1.5 μg of MyHC promoter DNA, 0.35 μg of pCMV-Gal, 0.75 μg of expression plasmid or empty expression vector, and 2.5 μl/μg DNA of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent and harvested 2 days after transfection. COS-7 cells were transfected at 60–70% confluency with 1.0 μg of promoter DNA, 0.3 μg of pCMV-Gal, 0.5 μg of expression plasmid or empty expression vector, and 1.5 μl/μg DNA of Transfectam transfection reagent (Promega) and harvested 3 days after transfection. Treatment of cells (see above) started 1 day after transfection. After lysis in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), luciferase activity was determined using a Lumat Luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The luciferase assay reagent was composed of 200 mm Tricine, 10.7 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2 × 5H2O, 26.7 mm MgSO4 × 7H2O, 333 mm dithiothreitol, 5.3 mm ATP, 2.74 mm coenzyme A, and 470 μm d-luciferin (Applichem). The cells were cotransfected with pCMV-Gal as an internal reference. The β-galactosidase activity was estimated in a standard assay (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). RNA Interference Assays—C2C12 myoblasts transfected with MyHCIId/x promoter DNA and MKK6EE or MEF-2C expression vector, or empty expression vector, respectively, were cotransfected after 1 day with 0.825 μg of a pool of double-stranded 20–25-nucleotide siRNA that specifically target mouse CBP (siRNA CBP) or a nonspecific double-stranded control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and 8 μl/μg siRNA of siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence Studies—For immunofluorescence studies C2C12 myoblasts were seeded on glass coverslips and cultured for 6 days in DM. After 2 days in DM, the cells were treated with 0.1 μm of Ca2+-ionophore A23187, or 500 ng/ml CsA, or ionophore plus CsA for a period of 4 d. For immunofluorescence studies C2C12 myoblasts were seeded on glass coverslips and cultured for 7 days in DM as controls. After 3 days in DM, other cells were subjected to different treatments as described above for a period of 4 d. The cells were washed, fixed, and stained as described previously (37Kubis H.P. Scheibe R.J. Meissner J.D. Hornung G. Gros G. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence studies anti-p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-P-p38 (New England BioLabs, Inc.), anti-fast MyHC (Sigma), and secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies were used. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). The stained cells were photographed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems) at a magnification of 400×. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extracts preparation and EMSAs were performed as previously described (38Darby T.G. Meissner J.D. Ruhlmann A. Mueller W.H. Scheibe R.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 μg of in vitro translated protein or 5 μg of nuclear extract were incubated on ice with 10,000 cpm of [γ-32P]dATP-labeled oligonucleotide probe (200–300 ng). In competition experiments, unlabeled annealed probe oligonucleotide (200-fold excess) was added. Antibody supershift assays were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts or in vitro translated proteins with preimmune, anti-MEF-2C, anti-MEF-2D, or anti-CBP antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After incubation, the samples were fractionated at 4 °C in 5% polyacrylamide gels for 1 h at 33 mA. The oligonucleotide probe contains a proximal MEF-2 consensus binding site (5′-CAA CTC AAA TTA TTT ATA GGA GAC TGA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides –242 to –216 of the porcine fast MyHCIId/x promoter), or a MEF-2-binding site TTA GGG ATA G mutated at nucleotides –230 to –228. Antibody supershift assays were performed with preimmune, anti-MEF-2C or -MEF-2D, or anti-CBP antibodies (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Inc.). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (39Scheibe R.J. Moeller-Runge I. Mueller W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21300-21305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-P-p38 (New England BioLabs, Inc.), antifast MyHC (Sigma), or anti-α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with either anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega). Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. p38 MAPK Inhibition by Electrical Stimulation and Ca2+-Ionophore Induces a Decrease in Fast Type MyHCII Protein Expression and MyHCIId/x Promoter Activity—We investigated a possible role of p38 MAPK in regulating fiber typespecific gene expression. First, immunofluorescence microscopy of C2C12 cells grown in differentiation media for 7 days revealed multinuclear myotubes with a high expression of fast MyHCII (Fig. 1A) and minor expression of slow protein isoforms (data not shown and Ref. 40Meissner J.D. Umeda P.K. Chang K.C. Gros G. Scheibe R.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 211: 138-148Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), representing a fast fiber type-like character of the cells. Following addition of 0.1 μm Ca2+-ionophore A23187 a decrease in fast adult MyHCII (Fig. 1, A and B) and an increase in slow MyHCI proteins (data not shown and Ref. 40Meissner J.D. Umeda P.K. Chang K.C. Gros G. Scheibe R.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 211: 138-148Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis, indicating a fast-to-slow transformation. In our second cell system, primary rabbit skeletal muscle cells were grown in suspension culture for 2–3 weeks. These cultures have been shown previously to develop myotubes expressing predominantly fast adult MyHC isoforms (4Kubis H.P. Haller E.A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Electrical stimulation of primary skeletal muscle myotubes with a slow fiber type activity pattern for 6 days caused a reduction of fast adult MyHCII protein (Fig. 1, A and B). We further determined p38 MAPK activation in C2C12 myotubes and rabbit skeletal muscle cells by analyzing the level of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B) revealed P-p38 MAPK in unstimulated or untreated myotubes, indicating activation of p38 MAPK in these cells. Electrical stimulation of rabbit skeletal muscle cells using a slow fiber type pattern or treatment of C2C12 myotubes with Ca2+-ionophore inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation and therefore significantly decreased enzyme activation.FIGURE 2The p38 MAPK in C2C12 myotubes and primary rabbit skeletal muscle cells is inhibited by Ca2+-ionophore and electrical stimulation. A and B, immunofluorescence (A) and Western blot analysis (B) of phosphorylated (activated) (P-p38) and total p38 MAPK (p38) in C2C12 myotubes and primary skeletal muscle myotubes as demonstrated by probing the blot with anti-P-p38 and reprobing with anti-p38 antibodies. The cells were grown in the presence or absence of p38α/β inhibitor SB203580, Ca2+-ionophore, Ca2+-ionophore plus SB203580, or Ca2+-ionophore in the presence or absence of calcineurin inhibitors CsA, FK506, or cellpermeable calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (11R-CaN-AID), respectively, for 4 days as indicated. C and D, immunofluorescence (C) and Western blot analysis (D) of phosphorylated (activated) and total p38 MAPK in C2C12 cells transfected with MKK6EE (+) or the empty expression vector (-) and cultured for 3 days in the presence or absence of Ca2+-ionophore as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been shown in cardiac myocytes that activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin with Ca2+-ionophore can enhance MAPK phophatase-1 (MKP-1) expression and decrease p38 activity (41Lim H.W. New L. Han J. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15913-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown recently that the calcineurin has a small but significant effect on the activity of the MyHCIId/x promoter (40Meissner J.D. Umeda P.K. Chang K.C. Gros G. Scheibe R.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 211: 138-148Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility of cross-talk between calcineurin and p38 was investigated by using calcineurin inhibitors CsA (500 ng/ml) (42Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar), FK506 (80 ng/ml), or cell-permeable calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (11R-CaN-AID, 50 μm) (43Terada H. Matsushita M. Lu Y.F. Shirai T. Li S.T. Tomizawa K. Moriwaki A. Nishio S. Date I. Ohmoto T. Matsui H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), respectively. The addition of CsA, or FK508, or 11R-CaN-AID, respectively, to controls did not affect the level of phosphorylated p38 and did not abolish the prominent decrease in the level of phosphorylated p38 in Ca2+-ionophore-treated cells (Fig. 2A). To conclude, Ca2+-ionophore treatment induces a decrease in p38 activation in a calcineurin-independent manner in C2C12 myotubes. To establish a functional link between p38 MAPK inhibition and down-regulation of the MyHCII gene, we tested whether inhibition of p38 MAPK by addition of 1 μm of the pyridinyl imidazole compound SB203580 has an effect on MyHCII protein expression and the activity of a –2.8kb MyHCIId/x promoter luciferase construct. SB203580, a pharmacological inhibitor specific for p38α/β MAPKs does not affect the phosphorylation status (Fig. 2A) but inhibits kinase activity by binding to its active site (44Kumar S. Jiang M.S. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 45Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). In C2C12 cells, SB203580 inhibited fast MyHCII protein expression (Fig. 1, A and B) and the activity of the transiently transfected –2.8 kb MyHCIId/x promoter (Fig. 3A). As detected with MyHCII protein levels (Fig. 1A), MyHCIId/x promoter activity was also lowered by the addition of Ca2+-ionophore to C2C12 cells (Fig. 3A). We next investigated whether p38 MAPK activation can be restored in Ca2+-ionophore-treated C2C12 myotubes by transient transfection of a constitutively active mutant of the direct upstream MAP kinase 6, MKK6EE. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, C and D) revealed a significant increase in p38 phosphorylation. In untreated C2C12 myotubes, p38 MAPK phosphorylation was slightly increased. In line with the effect of inhibition of p38α/β MAPKs, in myotubes overexpressing MKK6EE increased MyHCIId/x promoter activity occurred in the absence of Ca2+-ionophore (Fig. 3A). In addition, the inhibitory effect on MyHCII protein expression (Fig. 1, compare A and C) and MyHCIId/x promoter activity (Fig. 3A) by i"
https://openalex.org/W1987740553,"We previously demonstrated that hDREF, a human homologue of Drosophila DNA replication-related element binding factor (dDREF), is a DNA-binding protein predominantly distributed with granular structures in the nucleus. Here, glutathione S-transferase pulldown and chemical cross-linking assays showed that the carboxyl-terminal hATC domain of hDREF, highly conserved among hAT transposase family members, possesses self-association activity. Immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that hDREF self-associates in vivo, dependent on hATC domain. Moreover, analyses using a series of hDREF mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the hATC domain revealed that conserved hydrophobic amino acids are essential for self-association. Immunofluorescence studies further showed that all hDREF mutants lacking self-association activity failed to accumulate in the nucleus. Self-association-defective hDREF mutants also lost association with endogenous importin β1. Moreover, electrophoretic gel-mobility shift assays revealed that the mutations completely abolished the DNA binding activity of hDREF. These results suggest that self-association of hDREF via the hATC domain is necessary for its nuclear accumulation and DNA binding. We also found that ZBED4/KIAA0637, another member of the human hAT family, also self-associates, again dependent on the hATC domain, with deletion resulting in loss of efficient nuclear accumulation. Thus, hATC domains of human hAT family members appear to have conserved functions in self-association that are required for nuclear accumulation.

In vivo and in vitro studies from our and other groups have shown that dDREF positively regulates processes involved not only in DNA replication but also cell growth and differentiation (5Hirose F.

Biol. 2005; 25: 5590-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been reported that dDREF is a component of a transcription initiation complex containing Drosophila TATA-binding protein-related factor 2 (dTRF2), so that it might direct dTRF2 complexes to dDRE-containing genes (7Hochheimer A. Zhou S. Zheng S. Holmes M.C. Tjian R. Nature. 2002; 420: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, dDREF might function as an antagonist of the boundary element-associated factor, which is involved in establishing insulators of several hundred regions of the Drosophila genome (8Hart C.M. Cuvier O. Laemmli U.K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1999; 108: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Yoshida H. Inoue Y.H. Hirose F. Sakaguchi K. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and plays a role in the determination of chromatin structures by interacting with Drosophila Mi-2 (10Hirose F. Ohshima N. Kwon E.J. Yoshida H. Yamaguchi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5182-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The available data suggest that dDREF makes important contributions to the regulation of higher order chromatin structures.We have identified a human homologue of dDREF (hDREF; also called as ZBED1, ALTE, TRAMP, and KIAA0785) by a computer search for amino acid sequences homologous to three highly conserved regions (CR1, CR2, and CR3) found in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis DREFs (11Takahashi Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Ohshima N. Takahashi M. Hirose F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22928-22938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a previous study (12Ohshima N. Takahashi M. Hirose F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22928-22938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) we determined a consensus nucleotide sequence for hDREF binding (hDRE, 5′-TGTCG(C/T)GA(C/T)A-3′) and showed its presence in promoter regions of human genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation, similar to dDRE sequences in Drosophila. Indeed, we could demonstrate that hDREF is a potent activator of the histone H1 gene, whose expression is stringently coupled with DNA replication. Importantly, RNA interference against hDREF resulted in inhibition of S-phase entry. These results suggest that hDREF regulates the expression of human genes related to cell proliferation, similar to dDREF.As evidenced by the similarity in amino acid sequences, hDREF is a member of the hAT transposase family (13Esposito T. Gianfrancesco F. Ciccodicola A. Montanini L. Mumm S. D'Urso M. Forabosco A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), like fruit fly hobo, maize Activator, and snapdragon Tam3, defined by sharing close structural and functional characteristics with McClintock's Activator (14Kempken F. Windhofer F. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2001; 110: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). hAT transposons are known to exist in genomes of fungi, nematodes, and fish as well as man. CR1 and CR3 of hDREF correspond to two domains conserved among the family, the amino-terminal BED zinc finger and carboxyl-terminal hATC domains, respectively. The BED (boundary element-associated factor and DREF) zinc finger domain (conserved domain data base (CDD) accession number pfam02892) is thought to be a DNA binding domain of chromatin boundary element-binding proteins and transposases (15Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 421-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, our and other groups demonstrated earlier that BED zinc finger domains of dDREF and boundary element-associated factor possess DNA binding activity (16Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The hATC domain (CDD accession number pfam05699) has been designated as a dimerization domain as assessed by in vitro cross-linking experiments and yeast two-hybrid assays using the family members Activator and housefly Hermes (18Essers L. Adolphs R.H. Kunze R. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Michel K. O'Brochta D.A. Atkinson P.W. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the functions of hATC domains of the human hAT family members have hitherto not been elucidated.Despite the importance of hDREF for cell proliferation, the mechanisms underlying its regulation are poorly understood. In this study we demonstrated that hDREF self-associates in vivo and that conserved hydrophobic amino acids in the hATC domain are essential for this purpose. Interestingly, hDREF mutants that fail to self-associate neither accumulate in the nucleus nor bind to hDRE sequences.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (amino acids (aa) 1-694) was described previously (12Ohshima N. Takahashi M. Hirose F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22928-22938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3-HA vector contains a sequence encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) peptide, YPYDVPDYA, and both T7 and cytomegalovirus promoters. For constructing carboxyl-terminal-truncated mutants of pcDNA3-HA-hDREF, cDNAs encoding the truncated polypeptides were amplified by PCR with appropriate phosphorylated oligonucleotides, digested with NheI, and inserted between the NheI and blunt-ended XbaI sites of pcDNA3-HA vector. Base substitutions were made by site-specific mutagenesis employing the overlap extension method (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar) with a combination of the appropriate oligonucleotides and confirmation by DNA sequencing. Amplified DNA fragments carrying base substitutions in full-length hDREF cDNA were then digested with NheI and ApaI and then inserted between the NheI and ApaI sites of the pcDNA3-HA vector. To construct pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (ΔhATC) (the deleted cDNA region encoding aa 571-651), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 1-570 was amplified by PCR with phosphorylated oligonucleotides containing EcoRV site at the 5′-end, digested with NheI, and inserted between the NheI and blunt-ended XhoI sites of the pcDNA3-HA vector. A cDNA fragment encoding aa 652-694 was amplified by PCR, digested with EcoRV and ApaI, and inserted between the EcoRV and ApaI sites of pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (aa 1-570). For constructing pEYFP-hDREF (aa 1-694), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 1-694 obtained by digesting pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (aa 1-694) with XhoI and ApaI was inserted between the SalI and ApaI sites of the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech), which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter and an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) coding sequence. For construction of pEYFP-hDREF (aa 1-624), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 1-624 obtained by digesting pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (aa 1-694) with XhoI and BamHI was inserted between the SalI and BamHI sites of the pEYFP-C1 vector. For constructing pEYFP-hDREF (aa 520-551), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 520-551 obtained by digesting pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (aa 1-694) with BglII was blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment and then inserted into the SmaI site of the pEYFP-C1 vector. pEYFP-hDREF (aa 106-624) was constructed by digesting pEYFP-hDREF (aa 1-624) with SmaI and XhoI, filling in the sticky end with the Klenow fragment, and self-ligation. pEYFP-hDREF (aa 567-651) was constructed by amplifying a cDNA encoding aa 1-651 by PCR with pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (aa 1-694) as a template, digesting the PCR product with SphI, creating a blunt end by a filling-in reaction with the Klenow fragment, and then insertion into the blunt-ended EcoRI site of the pEYFP-C1 vector. For constructing pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (aa 567-651), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 567-651 obtained by digesting pEYFP-hDREF (aa 567-651) with XhoI and ApaI was inserted between the XhoI and ApaI sites of the pcDNA3-HA vector. To construct pEGFP-GST-hDREF (aa 520-551), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 520-551, obtained by digesting pEYFP-hDREF (aa 520-551) with EcoRI and BamHI, was inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-GST vector (a gift from Drs. Okada and Yagisawa) (21Okada M. Fujii M. Yamaga M. Sugimoto H. Sadano H. Osumi T. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter and coding sequences for an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). For constructing pGEX-4T-2-hDREF (aa 567-651) and pMAL-c2-hDREF (aa 567-651), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 567-651 obtained by digesting pEYFP-hDREF (aa 567-651) with BglII and SalI was inserted between the BamHI and SalI sites of the pGEX-4T-2 vector (GE Healthcare), which contains a GST coding sequence, and pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs), which contains an maltose-binding protein (MBP) coding sequence, respectively.ZBED4/KIAA0637 cDNA in pBluescript KS(-) (22Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute. pcDNA3-HA-ZBED4/KIAA0637 (aa 1-1171) was constructed by amplifying full-length ZBED4/KIAA0637 cDNA by PCR in pBluescript KS(-) as a template, digesting the product with NheI and XbaI, and insertion between the NheI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3-HA vector. To construct pcDNA3-HA-ZBED4/KIAA0637 (ΔhATC) (the deleted cDNA region encoding aa 1086-1171), a cDNA fragment encoding aa 1-1085 was amplified by PCR, digested with NheI and ApaI, and inserted between the NheI and ApaI sites of the pcDNA3-HA vector. For constructing pEYFP-ZBED4/KIAA0637 (aa 1-1171 or ΔhATC), cDNA fragments encoding aa 1-1171 or 1-1085, obtained by digesting pcDNA3-HA-ZBED4/KIAA0637 (aa 1-1171 or ΔhATC) with NheI, filling in the sticky end with Klenow fragment, and digesting with ApaI, were inserted between the ApaI and blunt-ended EcoRI sites of the pEYFP-C1 vector.To construct phGFP105-RanQ69L, a cDNA fragment encoding human RanQ69L mutant obtained by digesting pQE-80L/RanQ69L (a gift from Dr. Imamoto) (23Tachibana T. Hieda M. Miyamoto Y. Kose S. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with BamHI and EcoRI was inserted between the BglII and EcoRI sites of the phGFP105-C1 vector expressing a GFP mutant protein with an increased brightness (24Yamasaki M.

All PCR reactions described above were performed with KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). All plasmids were purified using a Qiagen plasmid kit (Qiagen).Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides were used for constructing the carboxyl-terminal-truncated mutants of pcDNA3-HA-hDREF, 5′-tacggtgggaggtctatata-3′ as a common forward primer, and 1-651 (5′-gcgttctcatacagaaacacc-3′), 1-624, (5′-gatccgaagagacgctcaggg-3′), 1-551 (5′-atctcggccagcatgttgttg-3′), and 1-523 (5′-accgggaagatcttgtcctcag-3′) as reverse primers for the mutants indicated.For creating base-substituted mutants of pcDNA3-HA-hDREF, 5′-tacggtgggaggtctatata-3′ and 5′-agtcgaggctgatcagcgagc-3′ were used as the common forward and reverse primers, respectively. The following oligonucleotides were used as site-specific forward and reverse primers: K530A/K531A/R534A, 5′-gcctcccgtcGCGGCGctcatgGCGacatccacg-3′ and 5′-cgtggatgtCGCcatgagCGCCGCgacgggaggc-3′; W590A/W591A, 5′-gaccccctcaagGCGGCGtcagaccgcctg-3′ and 5′-caggcggtctgaCGCCGCcttgagggggtc-3′; P599A, 5′-gccctcttcGCCctgctgccca-3′ and 5′-tgggcagcagGGCgaagagggc-3′; L600A/L601A, 5′-cctcttccccGCGGCGcccaaggtgc-3′ and 5′-gcaccttgggCGCCGCggggaagagg-3′; V604A/L605A, 5′-gctgcccaagGCGGCGcagaagtac-3′ and 5′-gtacttctgCGCCGCcttgggcagc-3′; LLVL/AAAA, 5′-cctcttccccGCGGCGcccaaggcgg-3′ and 5′-ccgccttgggCGCCGCggggaagagg-3′; E619A/R620A, 5′-gtcgcccctGCGGCTctcttcggatc-3′ and 5′-gatccgaagagAGCCGCaggggcgac-3′; F622A, 5′-tgagcgtctcGCCggatccgcc-3′ and 5′-ggcggatccGGCgagacgctca-3′; R633A, 5′-cagcgccaagGCGaaccggctg-3′ and 5′-cagccggttCGCcttggcgctg-3′. As a template, pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (V604A/L605A) was employed for constructing pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (LLVL/AAAA), whereas pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (wild type) was used for constructing other pcDNA3-HA-hDREF mutants. Underlining and capital letters denote the substituted nucleotides and the codons encoding the substituted amino acids, respectively. For creating the hATC domain-deleted mutant of pcDNA3-HA-hDREF, the following oligonucleotides containing EcoRV sites were used: 1-570, 5′-agatatcctccaccacctgggcatg-3′; 651-694, 5′-tatagatatccggagtggggcagaggcg-3′.For creating a full-length construct of pcDNA3-HA-ZBED4/KIAA0637, 5′-tgggctagcatggagaataacttgaaaact-3′ and 5′-tcgtctagatcaatactgaaagtatattaa-3′ were used as forward and reverse primers. For constructing the hATC domain-deleted mutant of pcDNA3-HA-ZBED4/KIAA0637, 5′-atagggccctcacaccatggcttcaggcag-3′, containing an ApaI site, was used.Cell Culture, Synchronization, and DNA Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. To obtain populations of cells in mitosis, synchronization was performed with a double thymidine block. HeLa cells were blocked for 20 h in medium containing 2.5 mm thymidine (Wako), released for 9 h by washing out the medium, and then blocked again in medium containing 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h to arrest all the cells at the beginning of S phase. The cells released from the second block then progressed through G2 phase and mitosis synchronously.Transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (25Yamashita D. Yamaguchi T. Shimizu M. Nakata N. Hirose F. Osumi T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The DNA/calcium phosphate precipitates were removed 4 h after the addition of precipitates, and the cells were cultured in fresh medium for 20 h. Precipitates containing 3, 6, 12, and 24 μg of expression plasmids in total were added to HeLa cells in 12- and 6-well plates and 6- and 10-cm dishes, respectively. The lack of expression plasmids was compensated with an empty vector, pBluescript KS(-) (Stratagene).Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-hDREF polyclonal antibody (12Ohshima N. Takahashi M. Hirose F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22928-22938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (632459) from Clontech; rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10) from Roche Applied Science; rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10) polyclonal antibody (mitosis marker, 06-570) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; goat anti-karyopherin (importin) β1 polyclonal antibody (C-19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; rabbit anti-MBP antiserum (E8030) from New England Biolabs; normal goat IgG from Sigma; anti-rabbit IgG species-specific antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (NA934) from GE Healthcare; anti-rat IgG species-specific antibody linked to HRP (712-035-153) from Jackson ImmunoResearch; anti-goat IgG species-specific antibody linked to HRP (sc-2020) from Santa Cruz; anti-rat and anti-rabbit species-specific antibodies linked to Alexa fluor 594 (A-11007) and 488 (A-11034) dyes, respectively, from Molecular Probes. Expression of GST-ZBED4/KIAA0637 fusion protein, production of antibody against GST-ZBED4/KIAA0637, and affinity purification of anti-ZBED4/KIAA0637 IgG were performed as described previously (12Ohshima N. Takahashi M. Hirose F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22928-22938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml amidino-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma)) for 30 min. The lysates were passed through 29-gauge needles 10 times and then cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C. The samples were centrifuged to remove nonspecific proteins binding to the beads, and the supernatants were incubated with an appropriate antibody for 1 h at 4°C and then with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under standard conditions, and the resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon-NC membranes (Millipore) using a semi-dry apparatus. The membranes were then probed with the indicated primary antibodies in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and finally with appropriate secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase. Bands were detected using an ECL kit (GE Healthcare).Chemical Cross-linking Assay—HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3-HA-hDREF (aa 567-651) were harvested in PBS supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture. Collected cells were subjected to chemical cross-linking by the addition of disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (5 mg/ml) at final concentrations of 0.17 mg/ml. Cross-linking reactions were performed at 25 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and HA-hDREF (aa 567-651) was detected by Western blotting as described above.GST Pulldown Assay—Recombinant GST- and MBP-fused proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) and amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 100 ng of purified recombinant MBP or MBP-hDREF (aa 567-651) proteins was added to 16 μl of the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads bound to 1 μg of recombinant GST or GST-hDREF (aa 567-651) proteins and incubated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, the protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for 6 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with buffer A supplemented 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Bound proteins to the beads were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Half of each sample was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-MBP antiserum.Blue Native (BN)-PAGE and Two-dimensional BN-PAGE/SDS-PAGE—Samples for two-dimensional BN-PAGE/SDS-PAGE were prepared as follows. Subconfluent HeLa cells cultured in 6-cm dishes were collected in a Tris-buffered salinebased buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml amidino-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated 10 times for 20 s each with 1-min intervals using a Bioruptor (CosmoBio). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and protein amounts in the supernatants were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Supernatant samples containing 80 μg of proteins were subjected to BN-PAGE. BN-gels were prepared as described (26Schägger H. Membrane Protein Purification and Crystallization: A Practical Guide.2nd Ed.

A high molecular weight calibration kit for electrophoresis (GE Healthcare) in solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl) was used for molecular mass markers (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; lactate dehydrogenase, 140 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa). Electrophoresis was performed at 50 V and 4 °C while the samples moved in the stacking gel and then at 250 V and 4 °C while the samples migrated in the separating gel.For further separation in second-dimension SDS-PAGE, the lanes from first-dimension BN-PAGE were cut out, dried in a DNA SpeedVac (Savant) for 30 min, and placed onto a second-dimension SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the same thickness and overlaid with 1% H14-agarose (TaKaRa) containing 1-fold SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed at 1 mA during stacking and at 10 mA during separation. Western blotting was performed as described above.Immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Microscopy—For observing YFP- and GFP-fused proteins, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Cells were again washed with PBS and finally mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS containing 25 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane.For immunofluorescence, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and then treated with 2% bovine serum albumin, PBS blocking buffer before incubation with primary antibodies in the same buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Then they were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody in 2% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was stained with Hoechst dye or propidium iodide when necessary, and samples were finally mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS containing 25 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane. With an IX-70 microscope (Olympus) or with a LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss), fluorescence images from more than 100 cells expressing HA-tagged YFP- or GFP-fused proteins with moderate expression levels were examined for each experiment, and representative examples are illustrated in the figures as indicated in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 7.FIGURE 4Analysis of the subcellular distribution of truncated hDREF mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2003519944,"Neurons throughout the rat vibrissa somatosensory pathway are sensitive to the angular direction of whisker movement. Could this sensitivity help rats discriminate stimuli? Here we use a simple computational model of cortical neurons to analyze the robustness of directional selectivity. In the model, directional preference emerges from tuning of synaptic conductance amplitude and latency, as in recent experimental findings. We find that directional selectivity during stimulation with random deflection sequences is strongly dependent on the mean deflection frequency: Selectivity is weakened at high frequencies even when each individual deflection evokes strong directional tuning. This variability of directional selectivity is due to generic properties of synaptic integration by the neuronal membrane, and is therefore likely to hold under very general physiological conditions. Our results suggest that directional selectivity depends on stimulus context. It may participate in tasks involving brief whisker contact, such as detection of object position, but is likely to be weakened in tasks involving sustained whisker exploration (e.g., texture discrimination)."
https://openalex.org/W2033718810,"The role of spliceosomal introns in eukaryotic genomes remains obscure. A large scale analysis of intron presence/absence patterns in many gene families and species is a necessary step to clarify the role of these introns. In this analysis, we used a maximum likelihood method to reconstruct the evolution of 2,961 introns in a dataset of 76 ribosomal protein genes from 22 eukaryotes and validated the results by a maximum parsimony method. Our results show that the trends of intron gain and loss differed across species in a given kingdom but appeared to be consistent within subphyla. Most subphyla in the dataset diverged around 1 billion years ago, when the ""Big Bang"" radiation occurred. We speculate that spliceosomal introns may play a role in the explosion of many eukaryotes at the Big Bang radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1966138340,"The Ad E1B 55-kDa protein (E1B) is a potent transcriptional repressor. In vitro biochemical studies revealed that direct p53-E1B interaction is essential for E1B to block p53-activated transcription and a corepressor may be involved. To understand how E1B represses p53-mediated transcription in vivo, we expressed E1B in several tumor cell lines that express wild type p53. Here we show that E1B strongly suppresses the expression of p53 target genes such as p21 and Puma-α in normal growth conditions or after cells were treated with p53-activating chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that E1B-mediated gene repression is dominant and cannot be reversed via p53 activation. Interestingly, we found that E1B binds to corepressor mSin3A. Mutagenesis analysis indicated that the sequence motif “LHLLA” near the NH2 terminus of E1B is responsible for mSin3A binding, and this motif is conserved among E1B proteins from different Ad serotypes. The conserved paired amphipathic helix domain 1 of mSin3A is critical for mSin3A-E1B interaction. Surprisingly, E1B mutants that cannot bind to mSin3A can still repress p53 target genes, indicating that it is not the corepressor required for E1B-mediated gene repression. In support of this notion, repression of p53 target genes by E1B is insensitive to HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. We further show that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of E1B are required for the repression function. Therefore, E1B employs a unique repression mechanism to block p53-mediated transcription.

The p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways are inactivated in virtually all human cancers regardless of their etiology (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 2Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms of these pathways is at the center stage of current research efforts in cancer biology. Small DNA tumor viruses such as adenoviruses (Ad), 3The abbreviations used are: Ad, adenovirus; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; aa, amino acid; Ad12, adenovirus type 12; CBP, CREB-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HDAC, histone deacetylases; IP, immunoprecipitation; ORF, open reading frame; PAH, paired amphipathic helix domain; PIC, transcriptional preinitiation complex; SD, synthetic dropout medium; TAD, transactivation domain; TBP, TATA-binding protein; WT, wild type; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; TSA, trichostatin A. human papillomaviruses, and SV40 can transform cells and cause cancer (3Beck Jr., G.R.

American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 225-251Google Scholar). Each of these viruses produces several proteins that disable both p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways in infected cells. Ad E1A proteins physically associate with pRb and release it from E2F transcription factors that activate expression of genes required for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. The Ad 1B region encodes two major proteins in two overlapping ORFs: E1B 55- and 19-kDa, both of which are required for efficient cell transformation. The E1B 19-kDa functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis by binding to proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak (5White E. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and E1B 55-kDa (hereafter called E1B) participates in transformation by inactivating the p53 pathway (6Berk A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7673-7685Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Several functions of E1B contribute to the inhibition of p53. Apart from sequestration of p53 in the cytoplasm that blocks p53-mediated apoptosis (7Zhao L.Y. Liao D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13171-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), E1B can inhibit acetylation of p53 and disrupt the interaction between p53 and coactivator p300/CBP-associated protein (8Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Early studies clearly showed that the transcriptional repression function of E1B, but not p53-E1B interaction per se, is critical for Ad-mediated cell transformation (9Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 10Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3620-3627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that (i) direct physical interaction between p53 and E1B is required for E1B to repress p53, (iii) E1B stabilizes the p53-DNA complex, and (iii) a corepressor may be involved (9Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 11Martin M.E. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Martin M.E. Berk A.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3146-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, E1B associates with DNA-bound p53 and converts p53 from an activator to a repressor (6Berk A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7673-7685Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It is well documented that E1B binds to the NH2-terminal TAD of p53. Several hydrophobic residues including Leu22 and Trp23 in the TAD are required for p53-mediated transcription, and they presumably constitute the binding sites for coactivators and/or components of basal transcriptional machinery. These residues are probably also in direct contact with E1B, because the p53 L22Q/W23S double mutant that is essentially inert in transactivation can no longer bind to E1B (14Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of E1B to the TAD of p53 might occlude the sites that are required for binding of factors and cofactors that are involved in p53-dependent transcription. Consistent with this, CBP binds to the TAD of p53 and the L22Q/W23S mutation also abolishes CBP-p53 interaction (15Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that E1B might block the association of CBP with p53. Recently, An et al. (16An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) demonstrated that p300, a paralog of CBP, and histone arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and CARM1 are coactivators of p53. They bind directly to p53; p300 and PRMT1 binds to p53 TAD, and CARM1 binds to the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of p53. Sequential modifications of histones 3 and 4 by these three coactivators, rather than p53 per se, depend strictly on the presence of p53, and such p53-directed histone modifications are critical for transactivation of p53 target genes (16An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Together, these three coactivators cooperatively stimulate p53-dependent transcription in vitro and in transfected cells, and such activation directly correlates with the recruitment of these coactivators by chromatin-bound p53 and subsequent histone lysine acetylation and arginine methylation at specific residues (16An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Because PRMT1 binds to aa 1–43 of p53, association of E1B with the TAD of p53 might also prevent p53-PRMT1 interaction. Thus, E1B-p53 interaction can potentially block the recruitment of multiple coactivators by p53 to its target promoters. Besides interactions with the aforementioned coactivators, the TAD of p53 also interacts with components of basal transcriptional machinery or the Mediator complex (for a recent review see Ref. 17Laptenko O. Prives C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). These contacts stimulate the recruitments of TFIID and TFIIA, and stabilize the preinitiation complex (PIC) assembled on the DNA template containing p53-binding sites (17Laptenko O. Prives C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), which contributes to p53-mediated transactivation. It has been shown that binding of MDM2 to the TAD of p53 masks the binding sites for these basal components, thereby canceling the effects of TAD (18Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Additionally, MDM2 can directly inhibit transcription when tethered to the promoter in the absence of p53. Thus, it was proposed that MDM2 inhibits p53-mediated transcription by dual mechanisms: masking the TAD and inhibiting the functions of other components of the basal machinery, as MDM2 can also bind to the p34 subunit of TFIIE (18Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although a corepressor is not needed for MDM2 to repress transcription in vitro using highly purified basal transcription factors (18Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), it can recruit corepressor CtBP2 to suppress p53-dependent transcription (20Mirnezami A.H. Campbell S.J. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Johnson P.W. Blaydes J.P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1234-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Additionally, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 may hinder binding of MDM2 to the TAD of p53, and thus alleviating inhibition of p53 by MDM2 (21Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). E1B and MDM2 bind to an overlapping but not identical sequence of the p53 TAD. Thus, E1B could exert similar TAD-masking effects on p53-dependent transcription (9Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 11Martin M.E. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Martin M.E. Berk A.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3146-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a corepressor is probably critical for E1B to repress transcription, as an Ad2 E1B mutant (R443) that can still bind to p53 is unable to repress transcription (9Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 13Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Indeed, an unknown corepressor that copurifies with RNA polymerase II seems to be required for E1B-mediated repression (11Martin M.E. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The identity of this corepressor remains unknown. Our current understanding of the mechanism underlying E1B-mediated repression of p53 is largely based on pioneering biochemical studies or reporter gene assays in cell culture (11Martin M.E. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). How E1B blocks transcription of p53 target genes from their endogenous loci has not been examined. We have expressed Ad12 E1B in several tumor cell lines that express WT p53 via lentiviral vector. We report here that E1B strongly suppresses the expression of p21 and Puma-α, two prototypical p53 target genes. This repression is not affected by p53-activating agents, which contrasts with the observed alleviation of MDM2-mediated inhibition of p53 upon DNA damage-induced phosphorylation (21Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite a highly specific E1B-mSin3A interaction, corepressor mSin3A is not involved in E1B-mediated repression of p53. Consistently, HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) does not alleviate repression by E1B. These findings suggest a unique mechanism of gene repression by E1B. Cell Culture and Transfection—The human tumor cell lines HCT116, LN-229, Saos2, G401 (a rhabdoid kidney tumor cell line), and its derivative G401-CC3, which was stably transfected with a vector expressing Ad12 E1B (7Zhao L.Y. Liao D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13171-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Steegenga W.T. Van Laar T. Shvarts A. Terleth C. Van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Virology. 1995; 212: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with various DNA plasmids using the Effectene transfection reagent kit from Qiagen. Construction of Lentiviral Vector for E1B Expression—The GFP-E1B fusion was cloned into a lentiviral vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resulting plasmid was cotransfected along with pCMV-VSV-G and pCMVδR8.2 plasmids into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The viral supernatant was collected 48 h after transfection, and used for transducing various cell lines. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The DNA fragments spanning different regions of the ORF for the mouse mSin3A or Ad12 E1B were fused either to the DNA sequence encoding the yeast Gal4 TAD in plasmid pGAD-C(x) or to that for the Gal4 DBD in plasmid pGBDU-C(x). Various combinations of these plasmids were introduced into yeast strain PJ69-4A (23James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed yeast colonies were replica plated on synthetic dropout (SD) medium lacking histidine but containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole and SD medium lacking adenine, essentially as described previously (8Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Zhao L.Y. Liu Y. Bertos N.R. Yang X.J. Liao D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8316-8329Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—The luciferase reporter construct p21-Luc contains 2.4 kb of the p21 promoter with two upstream p53-binding sites, as described previously (25Zhao L.Y. Niu Y. Santiago A. Liu J. Albert S.H. Robertson K.D. Liao D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9445-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 48-well plates. The reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into cells alone or with other plasmids as indicated in the legend to Fig. 7. Twenty-four hours after transfection, doxorubicin alone or together with TSA was added to the transfected cells to the final concentration of 1 (doxorubicin) and 0.4 μg/ml (TSA). The cells were then processed for dual-luciferase assays (Promega) 48 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized against sea pansy luciferase activity as described previously (26Zhao L.Y. Liu J. Sidhu G.S. Niu Y. Liu Y. Wang R. Liao D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50566-50579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation (IP)—HEK293 cells were infected with a recombinant Ad vector carrying the coding sequence for the GFP-Ad12 E1B fusion. Cells were harvested 24 h after infection and fractioned into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using the Nuclear Complex Co-IP kit from Active Motif. IP was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. In each IP, 200 μg of nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts were mixed with 1.5 μgof antibody. The antibodies used for IP were: the rabbit polyclonal anti-mSin3A antibody AK11 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the rabbit polyclonal anti-NusG antibody as the matched control IgG (27Liao D. Lurz R. Dobrinski B. Dennis P.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody from Babco, and the mouse monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody as the matched control IgG (clone 40–1A, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—We followed a typical ChIP protocol as described (25Zhao L.Y. Niu Y. Santiago A. Liu J. Albert S.H. Robertson K.D. Liao D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9445-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Glioblastoma LN-229 cells and flow-sorted LN-229-E1B cells that stably express GFP-E1B were grown on 10-cm dishes, and the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was neutralized by the addition of glycine to 125 mm (final concentration). Cells were scraped off the dishes and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold swelling buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 100-fold diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of SDS-lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The chromatins were sonicated to an average fragment size of ∼500 bp. The fragmented chromatins were aliquoted and one part is used as input. Each aliquot was subjected to ChIP using 5 μl of rabbit serum for anti-Ad12 E1B (28Liao D. Yu A. Weiner A.M. Virology. 1999; 254: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The immune complexes were captured using 50 μl of Protein G-agarose beads (50% slurry, Roche Applied Science) with rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The agarose beads were collected and washed sequentially with 1 ml of low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and twice with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The chromatin-protein complexes were eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) at 65 °C for 15 min with shaking. The supernatant was heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse cross-linking. Samples were treated with RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min and then digested with proteinase K (40 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were diluted and passed through a Qiagen mini-prep column. After the wash, DNA was eluted with 100 μl of TE (pH 7.4). PCR was performed with one step at 95 °C for 5 min and 31–35 cycles of 95, 60, and 72 °C each for 95 s and a final step at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR primers used were (from 5′ to 3′): p21-p53BS1: forward, CATTGTTCCCAGCACTTCCTCTC and reverse, ATCCCCTTCCTCACCTGAAAAC; p21-p53BS2: forward, ATCCCCACAGCAGAGGAGAAAG and reverse, AAACAGAACCCAGGCTTGGAGC; p21-proximal: forward, GGTAAATCCTTGCCTGCCAGAG and reverse, ACTTCCCTCCTCCCCCAGTC; Bax: forward, ACAAACAGAAAAGCAGGCCTG and reverse, CCAATGAGCATCTCCCGATAAG; Chromosome 4 centromere: forward, CTGTCCATAAAATATCGAAATACCCTA and reverse, GTACAGTATATAAATACATAATTTGGGC. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. E1B Represses p21 Expression in Glioblastoma LN-229 Cells—To understand the precise mechanism underlying E1B-mediated transcriptional repression, we have sought to establish a cell-based system that permits us to analyze the detailed molecular events associated with gene repression due to E1B expression. Because a recent study suggests that Ad preferentially transforms cells of neuronal origin (29Shaw G. Morse S. Ararat M. Graham F.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), we reason that E1B should elicit robust gene repression in cells descended from neural stem cells. Glioblastoma LN-229 cells have normal p53 pathway, although a proline to leucine substitution occurs at position 98 (30Ishii N. Maier D. Merlo A. Tada M. Sawamura Y. Diserens A.C. Van Meir E.G. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Despite this, p53 is phenotypically considered as WT in this cell line (31Weller M. Winter S. Schmidt C. Esser P. Fontana A. Dichgans J. Groscurth P. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Trepel M. Groscurth P. Malipiero U. Gulbins E. Dichgans J. Weller M. J. Neurooncol. 1998; 39: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have transduced LN-229 cells with lentiviral vector for GFP (LV-GFP) or GFP-E1B (LV-GFP-E1B). Almost all the cells stably express GFP or GFP-E1B after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (see supplemental Fig. S1). To assess whether E1B can repress p53-dependent transcription, the parental LN-229 cells or the transduced cells were mock treated with vehicle (Me2SO), the HDAC inhibitor TSA, chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU, or a combination of TSA and 5-FU. As expected, E1B expression resulted in p53 stabilization (lane 3 in the p53 panel in Fig. 1). E1B expression reduced the p21 levels in mock-treated cells (lane 3, top), despite increased p53 levels, indicating that E1B suppresses p53-mediated activation of p21. Consistent with reports in the literature (33Lagger G. Doetzlhofer A. Schuettengruber B. Haidweger E. Simboeck E. Tischler J. Chiocca S. Suske G. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2669-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 34Gui C.Y. Ngo L. Xu W.S. Richon V.M. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), TSA markedly induced p21 expression (lanes 4–6 in the p21 panel). The p53 levels were also increased in TSA-treated cells. However, despite increased levels of p53, the levels of p21 in LN-229-E1B cells were noticeably lower (lane 6), suggesting that E1B can still repress p21 in the presence of TSA. This provided the first evidence that E1B-mediated repression of p21 is independent of HDACs. It is worth noting that the levels of p21 were still much higher in cells treated with TSA than that in the control (cf. lanes 3 and 6), despite E1B expression. This is likely due to p53-independent activation of p21 by TSA and such activation could not be suppressed by E1B. We then wished to assess whether p53-activating chemotherapeutical agents could relieve E1B-mediated repression. In keeping with published reports (26Zhao L.Y. Liu J. Sidhu G.S. Niu Y. Liu Y. Wang R. Liao D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50566-50579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), 5-FU activated p53 and induced p21 expression in LN-229 or LN-229-GFP cells, but p21 expression was dramatically suppressed in LN-299-E1B cells (cf. lane 9 with lanes 7 and 8). A similar pattern of p21 expression was also observed in cells treated with both TSA and 5-FU (lanes 10–12 in Fig. 1). E1B can similarly repress p21 expression in LN-229 cells treated with doxorubicin (data not shown, but see Fig. 2). The expression of GFP-E1B from an Ad vector also resulted in similar p21 repression (see supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that vectors themselves had no effects on p21 expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that E1B represses p53-activated p21 expression and this repression cannot be reversed by TSA. Furthermore, p53-activating drugs could not alleviate E1B-exerted gene repression.FIGURE 2Repression of p53 target genes by Ad12 E1B in colon cancer HCT116 cells. The cells were either uninfected or transduced with lentiviral vector for expressing GFP (LV-GFP) or GFP-Ad12 E1B (LV-GFP-E1B). The cells were either untreated or treated with doxorubicin (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The cells were harvested for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Equal amounts of total cell extracts (30 μg) were loaded in each lane. The asterisk in the GFP-E1B blot denotes a cross-reactive band to the anti-GFP antibody and is served as an independent marker for loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Repression of p53 Target Genes by E1B in Colon Cancer HCT116 Cells—To assess whether E1B can also represses p21 and other p53 target genes in other cell types, we expressed GFP or GFP-E1B via lentiviral vector in colon cancer HCT116 cells, which has WT p53 and a normal p53 pathway (36Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The parental and transduced cells were either non-treated or treated with doxorubicin, and the cells were then analyzed for the expression of various p53 target genes. As shown in Fig. 2, in untreated cells, E1B substantially repressed the expression of p21 and Puma-α. In doxorubicin-treated cells, the expression of Puma-α was also obviously repressed by E1B. p21 expression was again inhibited, although to a lesser extent than Puma-α. Intriguingly, Mdm2 expression was only slightly affected. Thus, it appears likely that E1B may repress p53 in a gene-specific manner. Taken together, our data demonstrated that E1B can effectively repress p53 target genes in different cell types. Ad12 E1B Binds to the PAH1 Domain of mSin3A—Because mSin3A corepressor was shown to be present in the immunoprecipitates of an antibody against Ad2 E1B (37Punga T. Akusjarvi G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we tested whether there is specific interaction between E1B and mSin3A using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Fusion of full-length ORF of the Ad12 E1B with Gal4 DBD was tested for interactions with various mSin3A ORF fragments fused with the coding sequence for Gal4 TAD. Data presented in Fig. 3 showed that Ad12 E1B only interacts with mSin3A fragments containing the conserved PAH1 (Fig. 3, A and B, sectors 2, 3, and 18). To further test the specificity of the interaction between Ad12 E1B and PAH1 of mSin3A, we exploited the structural information based on the solution structure of the complex of the mSin3A PAH2 and the Mad1 Sin3 interaction domain (38Brubaker K. Cowley S.M. Huang K. Loo L. Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Radhakrishnan I. Cell. 2000; 103: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the Sin3 interaction domain-PAH2 complex, the structure of PAH2 consists of a left-handed four-helix bundle, whereas the Sin3 interaction domain motif forms an amphipathic α helix that is wedged within a deep hydrophobic pocket defined mainly by two helices (α1 and α2) in PAH2; another two α helices also contribute side chains to the pocket (38Brubaker K. Cowley S.M. Huang K. Loo L. Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Radhakrishnan I. Cell. 2000; 103: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequences of PAH1 and PAH2 are highly conserved (38Brubaker K. Cowley S.M. Huang K. Loo L. Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Radhakrishnan I. Cell. 2000; 103: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it is generally assumed that they might adopt similar structures. We therefore introduced point mutations that changed Leu130 or Leu148 to Pro (Pro is known to disrupt α helix), and both mutations are expected to disrupt two α helices corresponding to α1 and α2 of PAH2. As shown in Fig. 3C, both mutations abolished the Ad12 E1B-mSin3A interaction, whereas mutations at Val168 and Leu178 to Pro within the putative α3 and α4 did not affect this interaction. Next, we tested whether mutations in the corresponding region of PAH2 affect Ad12 E1B-mSin3A interaction. Val311 and Leu329 in PAH2 are at the equivalent"
