https://openalex.org/W2164358316,"A rapid and convenient method for peptide mapping of proteins has been developed. The technique, which is especially suitable for analysis of proteins that have been isolated from gels containg sodium dodecyl sulfate, involves partial enzymatic proteolysis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and analysis of the cleavage products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pattern of peptide fragments produced is characteristic of the protein substrate and the proteolytic enzyme and is highly reproducible. Several common proteases have been used including chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus protease, and papain."

Both OKT1 and OKT3 reacted with all human peripheral T cells and 5 to 10 percent of thymocytes but differed in their reactivities with T cel- lines. By contrast, OKT4 reacted with 55 percent of human peripheral T cells and 80 percent of thymocyted in that they did not react with normal B cells, null cells, monocytes, or granulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2047621648,"Current concepts of the pathogenesis of emphysema suggest that it results from an imbalance of elastase and antielastase activity within the alveolar structures. Although emphysema that is associated with hereditary deficiency of serum alpha 1-antitrypsin conforms to this scheme, the major risk factor in the more common form of emphysema is cigarette smoking. A study was designed to evaluate the premise that cigarette smoking may be associated with an acquired, functional defect in lung alpha 1-antitrypsin. Determination of the antielastase activity of alpha 1-antitrypsin obtained from the lungs of smoking and nonsmoking individuals revealed a nearly twofold reduction in the functional activity of this elastase inhibitor in the lungs of cigarette smokers. These data suggest that cigarette smokers may lose some of the normal antielastase protective screen of the lower respiratory tract, making them more vulnerable to destructive lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2001154029,"The frequency of normal murine B lymphocytes initiating growth in diluted suspension cultures in the presence of a B cell mitogen, such as lipopolysaccharide, can be increased approximately 10(4) fold by the addition of 2 X 10(6) normal thymus cells per ml. This increase in the frequency of growing cells by thymus cells can also be observed with X63-AG8 myeloma tumor cells secreting IgG1. Thus thymus cells may not contribute growth-stimulating factors, but may supply growth-supporting factors. Culture medium and plastic dishes can be conditioned by preincubation with thymus cells for a day after which the thymus cells may be omitted from further culture for maximal B cell growth. Irradiation of thymus cell abolishes their growth-enhancing properties. Thymus cells can be syngeneic and allogeneic with the growing B cells. The frequency of growing LPS-reactive, normal B cells in spleen of 6-8 week old C3H/Tif mice was determined by limiting dilution analysis to be one of three splenic B cells. With this limiting dilution analysis, it was also shown that the cloning efficiency of XB3-AG8 myeloma tumor cells in suspension culture in the presence of thymus cells is practically 100%. Analysis of the growth kinetics of single clones of LPS-reactive, normal B cells shown that these B cells divide every 18 hr. Within the first 126 hr of growth, every B cell in the clone divides, and every dividing B cell in this clone secretes sufficient immonoglobulin to form a hemolytic plaque. The conditions of in vitro suspension cultures of murine B lymphocytes are therefore perfect to the extent that every B cell capable of growth will grow as a single clone."
https://openalex.org/W2070454645,"Brief inhalation exposure of rats to three or six puffs of cigarette smoke significantly decreases elastase inhibitory capacity per milligram of α1-antitrypsin in lung lavage fluid. This effect is not observed in ozone-tolerant rats and can be reversed by treating the lung lavage fluid from smoke-exposed rats with reducing agents. Samples of human serum obtained immediately after smoking also show decreased elastase inhibitory capacity per milligram of α1-antitrypsin. Again, elastase inhibitory capacity can be restored by treatment with a reducing agent. Cigarette smoking may cause emphysema by inactivating α1-antitrypsin through oxidation."

https://openalex.org/W1587897730,"The deoxyribonuclease specified by the recB and recC genes of Escherichia coli (recBC DNase; exonuclease V) has been purified to near homogeneity by a new procedure. Although hydrolysis of even a single nucleotide from a duplex DNA molecule by the pure enzyme is absolutely dependent upon ATP, the extent of phosphodiester hydrolysis is strongly inhibited by ATP concentrations of 0.2 mm or greater, and the initial rate is unaffected. Under these conditions, the extent of DNA hydrolysis is proportional to enzyme concentration. In contrast, neither the rate nor the extent of hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA nor ATP is affected by high concentrations of ATP. The amount of large single-stranded polynucleotide generated by the action of the recBC DNase increases as the ATP concentration increases and, at 0.5 mM ATP, becomes equivalent to the amount of acid-soluble nucleotide formed. These findings suggest that high intracellular concentrations of ATP affect the mechanism of the recBC DNase so as to limit the extent of hydrolysis of duplex DNA, while at the same time favoring the formation of single-stranded regions within the duplex. Such regions may be essential intermediates in the recombination process."

When fed on these compounds, the rodents exhibited decreased uterine weight, inhibition of follicular development, and a cessation of breeding activity.

https://openalex.org/W2047498733,"The fertilization membrane of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus undergoes changes in morphology, solubility, and permeability during the process of hardening. As the fertilization membrane elevates from the egg surface, it retains casts of the tips of the microvillous processes of the plasma membrane. The dome-shaped microvillar casts become angular at the same time that the fertilization membrane becomes resistant to solubilization in mercaptan solutions. 2-4 min after this morphological and chemical transition, the fertilization membrane becomes impermeable to the lectin conconavalin A, as monitored by binding of 125I- or fluorescein-labeled concanavalin A. Glycine ethyl ester inhibits the changes in morphology, solubility, and permeability, whereas sodium sulfite inhibits only the permeability block and resistance to solubilization by mercaptans. Parthenogenetic activation with the divalent ionophore, A23187, elicits fertilization membrane elevation more rapidly than does activation by fertilization; however, the morphological and permeability changes characteristic of hardening proceed more slowly. Elevation and hardening of the fertilization membrane thus appear to be discrete, multiple-step assembly processes that occur in fixed sequence, with kinetics that are affected by the mechanism of cortical granule exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1488921227,"An in vitro protein-synthesizing system completely dependent on added valine tRNA (valyl-tRNAval) and programmed with RNA from the phage MS2 has been used to investigate the incorporation into MS2 coat protein of valine from isoaccepting valyl-tRNAsval with the anticodons U AC (U represents 5-oxyacetic acid uridine monophosphate), GAC, and IAC in response to the four valine codons GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG. By examining the incorporation of valine into NH2-terminal and internal positions of three tryptic peptides from the MS2 coat protein it has been established that these anticodons each recognize all four valine codons. We therefore conclude that under our conditions of in vitro protein synthesis the genetic code, as far as the valine codons are concerned, is operationally a two letter code, i.e. the third codon nucleotide has no absolute discriminating function."

They result from both cis and trans addition of the N6 amino group of ademine to the 10 position of both enantiomers of BDPE. This was determined from studies of the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, mass spectra, and circular dichroism spectra, as well as from their pKa values and chemical reactivities."

https://openalex.org/W1607590368,Two glycopeptides were obtained from alpha 1-protease inhibitor after extensive pronase digestion and chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 and concanavalin A-Sepharose. these glycopeptides were characterized by compositional analysis and sequential exoglycosidase digestion followed at each step by methylation analysis. The partially methylated alditol acetates obtained were resolved by gas chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. The proposes structures of the oligosaccharide moieties of the glycopeptides are given below. (formula: see text) The relative amounts of the two glycopeptides isolated from concanavalin A-Sepharose suggest that each protein molecule contains four carbohydrate chains; one large chain (A) and three small chains (B).

https://openalex.org/W2029047604,"Previous studies indicated that the potent tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) enhances transformation of rat embryo cells (2°RE) by a mutant of human Ad5 (H5ts125). This study examines the effect of TPA, its structural analogs and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on anchorage-independent growth of a cloned population of H5ts125-transformed 2°RE cells (clone E11). Both TPA and EGF (∼10−8 M) induced a 3–5 fold increase in agar cloning efficiency of E11 cells. In addition, macroscopic colonies appeared earlier and were larger and more diffuse. The TPA analogs phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PDD) and ingenol3,20-dibenzoate also enhanced growth in agar of E11 cells, whereas phorbol, 4αPDD and 4-0-meTPA, which are inactive as tumor promoters, failed to enhance agar growth. In contrast to the results obtained with E11 cells, TPA, PDD or ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate failed to induce growth in agar of normal 2°RE cells. Dexamethasone (10−5–10−6 M), trans retinoic acid (10−5–10−6 M) and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, antipain and elastatinol did not inhibit the ability of TPA to enhance the growth of E11 cells in agar. The TPA-enhanced anchorage independence was a stable property, since subclones of E11 cells isolated from TPA-agar plates had a higher agar cloning efficiency than the parental E11 cells when retested in the absence of TPA. This effect of TPA does not appear to reflect simple selection of a subpopulation of cells. When the parental E11 cells were first cloned in monolayer culture in the absence of TPA, all ten randomly picked clones showed enhanced growth in agar in the presence of TPA. In addition, prior growth of E11 cells in monolayer culture in the presence of TPA did not enhance their subsequent growth in agar. This system therefore provides an example in which TPA appears to enhance the acquisition of a stable cell property, and thus may be a useful model for studying mechanisms of tumor promotion and progression."

https://openalex.org/W1532271329,VA-RNA I is a low molecular weight RNA produced in large amounts in cells infected with adenoviruses. The 3' terminus of this RNA may represent a transcription termination site. We have demonstrated that this RNA occurs in infected cells in several forms which differ in the number of uridylic acid residues at the 3' ends. The nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment overlapping the 3' end of VA-RNA I has been determined. The DNA could encode up to 4 uridylic acid residues at the 3' end of the RNA. The DNA sequence shows some similarity to known transcription termination sequences in prokaryotic systems.
https://openalex.org/W1601645068,"The patterns of serine metabolism into phospholipids of cultured brain cells was examined. Labeled serine was incorporated predominantly into serine- ad ethanolamine-containing phospholipids and sphingolipids. The highest rates of labeling were observed in the (1)acyl-(2)acyl- and (1)alkyl-(2)acyl-serine phosphoglyceride fractions. Serine incorporation into both compounds appears to proceed via a base exchange mechanism. A decrease in the rate of serine phosphoglycerides labeling and a depletion of the ATP levels were observed when oligomycin or the calcium ionophore A23187 was added to the incubation medium. The inhibition of serine incorporation by A23187 could be partially reversed following addition of 10 mM CaCl2. Based on these findings it is suggested that in addition to demonstrating the energy-independent calcium-stimulated pathway, there may also be an energy related pathway. Formation of ethanolamine phosphoglycerides, as a result of serine phosphoglycerides decarboxylation, has been analyzed by using a simplified compartmental model. Of the 0.67 nmol/mg of protein turned over per h in the diacylserine phosphoglyceride compartment, 0.14 nmol/mg of protein are converted into the ethanolamine phosphoglycerides. In a similar manner, of the 0.09 nmol/mg of protein turned over per h in the (1)alkyl-(2)acyl-serine phosphoglyceride compartment, 0.014 nmol/mg of protein is converted into the (1)alkyl-(2)acyl-ethanolamine phosphoglyceride. These figures provide a first indication that a considerable portion of the ethanolamine phosphoglycerides in cultured brain cells is formed via a direct decarboxylation of the serine phosphoglycerides. In estimating the rates of (1)alkenyl-(2)acyl-ethanolamine phosphoglyceride formation from (1)alkyl-(2)acyl-ethanolamine phosphoglyceride the precursor-product specific activity crossover point could not be established. Mathematical analysis, however, enabled us to estimate the flux from the former into the latter as 0.04 nmol/mg of protein per h. A scheme for the possible metabolic interconversions of the ether bond containing serine and ethanolamine phosphoglycerides is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1981954116,The response of differentiating MEL cells to the nucleotide analogue cordycepin reveals a previously unrecognized aspect of the molecular events which cause commitment of these cells to terminal erythroid differentiation. Cordycepin rapidly inhibits commitment of DMSO-treated MEL cells in a dose range which does not cause cytotoxicity. Reversal of cordycepin treatment in the presence of inducer leads to a rapid and synchronous commitment of a significant proportion of cells in the culture. These results suggest that MEL cells can be blocked just prior to the point of commitment by cordycepin treatment.
https://openalex.org/W1969034585,"Abstract Murine spleen cells stimulated in vitro with pokeweed mitogen were fused with a HAT-sensitive AKR thymoma (BW5147) to produce T-cell hybridomas secreting hemopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). A stable cloned T-cell hybridoma has been isolated which expressed the H-2 antigens of both fusion parents, has a median chromosome number of 56 and secretes a factor(s) which stimulates the growth of granulocyte-macrophage and eosinophil colonies. The CSF-secreting hybridoma exhibited only the Thy 1.1 associated with the parent tumor, but no markers normally associated with normal T-cells or macrophages were detected. No CSF was secreted by the parent tumor line, but the hybridoma-conditioned medium, when used at 10% (v/v), contained sufficient CSF to stimulate 10–30 colonies per 10 5 bone marrow cells. Lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/ml) stimulated the production of CSF by the hybridoma cells 3 fold. CSF production also increased when the cells were held at high density in serum-free medium. The colony-stimulating factor(s) secreted by the hybridoma exhibited similar molecular properties to those produced by pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cells, and both the GM- and EO-CSFs had an apparent molecular weight by gel filtration of approximately 35,000."

https://openalex.org/W2036914163,"The rate of in vitro transcription of the rRNA genes of E. coli is more than 20 fold higher than the averaged transcription rate of other genome segments of the same size. This ""preferential transcription"" of rRNA genes reflects a high efficiency of their promoters in chain initiation. We show that the high initiation rate at rRNA promoters results from a high rate of RNA polymerase binding to these promoters as measured by the formation of heparin-resistant RNA polymerase-DNA complexes. The results indicate that the preferential binding of RNA polymerase to rRNA promoters is mainly due to their large binding capacity rather than to a high rate constant of polymerase binding to a single binding site. The polymerase binding capcity of rRNA promoters was estimated from the number of rRNA chains initiated by heparin-resistant complexes under conditions of template saturation and from the number of rRNA transcription units participating in the binding reaction. At least 30 RNA polymerase molecules were found to be protected from heparin per rRNA transcription unit. The rest of the genome (99.4%; possibly sufficient to encode 4000 nonribosomal RNA species) protects under these conditions 2000 enzyme molecules. These results suggest that a high multiplicity of RNA polymerase binding may be responsible for the high efficiency of rRNA promoters. The validity of this hypothesis is discussed."

Four of these enzymes showed a lag in the time curve during the early phase of the first catalytic turnover of the enzyme. In each case, the lag period could be abolished by preincubating the ligase with amino acid, ATP, and Mg2+ under conditions known to give an aminoacyl adenylate-enzyme complex. With all five ligases the steady state rate of transfer from the preformed aminoacyl-adenylate complex to tRNA was approximately the same as that of the overall reaction."

The use of the experimental protocol described in this work established that between 25-40% of the base pairs in the genes argF and argl have changed since they diverged from a hypothetical ancestral gene. The extent of divergence of the genes was determined by mRNA-DNA hybridization utilizing arginine transducing DNA as a hybridization probe and mRNA prepared in vivo from appropriate bacterial strains and with mRNA synthesized in vitro using template DNA isolated from the specialized transducing phages gammacI857dargl and phi80dargF."

https://openalex.org/W1545905553,"The effects of polyamines on the equilibrium between prokaryotic ribosomal subunits and 70 S ribosomes have been studied as a function of concentration of Mg2+ from 2.5 to 7.5 mM. Run-off ribosomes were obtained from Escherichia coli and were washed with buffered 1 M NH4C1. Spermidine at 1 mm favors association of subunits at all concentrations of Mg2+. Putrescine, at concentrations above 8 mM, favors net dissociation at concentrations of Mg2+ below 4.5 mM. Streptomycin behaves like spermidine, while putrescine behaves like initiation factor 1 and initiation factor 3. The effect of putrescine on dissociation is time-dependent and appears to have a half-life of about 3.5 min at 30 degrees. When added after the effects of spermidine or streptomycin on association have occurred, putrescine still causes dissociation. The data suggests that putrescine may reduce net formation of vacant 70 S ribosomes. Another possibility is that putrescine and spermidine may act antagonistically to maintain a labile equilibrium between ribosomal subunits and vacant 70 S ribosomes. It may be significant that the putrescine effect is observed at the concentration of Mg2+ found to be optimum for initiation."

Incubation of postconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells in serum-free medium containing lactalbumin hydrolysate resulted in enhanced synthesis and release of plasminogen activator. Sephadex G-100 gel filtration of concentrated, dialyzed lactalbumin hydrolysate revealed two fractions, LH-FI and LH-FII. LH-FI elutes at the void volume, indicative of high molecular weight, and contains all plasminogen activator stimulatory activity of the original lactalbumin hydrolysate, whereas LH-FII has no activity. In addition, LH-FI also induces DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells in a dose-dependent fashion, 1 to 2 microgram/ml being equivalent to 10% fetal calf serum. Again, LH-FII is without effect. Induction of DNA synthesis in LH-FI or serum-stimulated quiescent sparse cells followed essentially identical kinetics at least through the first 20 h. Furthermore, LH-FI also enhances 3T3 cell growth. Preliminary results of Sepharose 4B filtration of LH-FI reveal the presence of five subfractions each with plasminogen activator stimulatory as well as mitogenic activity."
