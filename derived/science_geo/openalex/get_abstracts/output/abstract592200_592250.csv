https://openalex.org/W2741989799,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers regulate access to genetic information by controlling nucleosome positions in vivo. However, the mechanism by which remodellers discriminate between different nucleosome substrates is poorly understood. Many chromatin remodelling proteins possess conserved protein domains that interact with nucleosomal features. Here we used a quantitative high-throughput approach, based on the use of a DNA-barcoded mononucleosome library, to profile the biochemical activity of human ISWI family remodellers in response to a diverse set of nucleosome modifications. We show that accessory (non-ATPase) subunits of ISWI remodellers can distinguish between differentially modified nucleosomes, directing remodelling activity towards specific nucleosome substrates according to their modification state. Unexpectedly, we show that the nucleosome acidic patch is necessary for maximum activity of all ISWI remodellers evaluated. This dependence also extends to CHD and SWI/SNF family remodellers, suggesting that the acidic patch may be generally required for chromatin remodelling. Critically, remodelling activity can be regulated by modifications neighbouring the acidic patch, signifying that it may act as a tunable interaction hotspot for ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers and, by extension, many other chromatin effectors that engage this region of the nucleosome surface."
https://openalex.org/W2739549032,"The organic anion transporters OAT1 (SLC22A6) and OAT3 (SLC22A8) have similar substrate specificity for drugs, but it is far from clear whether this holds for endogenous substrates. By analysis of more than 600 metabolites in the Oat3KO (Oat3 knockout) by LC/MS, we demonstrate OAT3 involvement in the movement of gut microbiome products, key metabolites, and signaling molecules, including those flowing through the gut–liver–kidney axis. Major pathways affected included those involved in metabolism of bile acids, flavonoids, nutrients, amino acids (including tryptophan-derivatives that are uremic toxins), and lipids. OAT3 is also critical in elimination of liver-derived phase II metabolites, particularly those undergoing glucuronidation. Analysis of physicochemical features revealed nine distinct metabolite groups; at least one member of most clusters has been previously validated in transport assays. In contrast to drugs interacting with the OATs, endogenous metabolites accumulating in the Oat1KO (Oat1 knockout) versus Oat3KO have distinct differences in their physicochemical properties; they are very different in size, number of rings, hydrophobicity, and molecular complexity. Consistent with the Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis, the data support the importance of the OAT transporters in inter-organ and inter-organismal remote communication via transporter-mediated movement of key metabolites and signaling molecules (e.g. gut microbiome–to–intestine–to–blood–to–liver–to–kidney–to–urine). We discuss the possibility of an intimate connection between OATs and metabolite sensing and signaling pathways (e.g. bile acids). Furthermore, the metabolomics and pathway analysis support the view that OAT1 plays a greater role in kidney proximal tubule metabolism and OAT3 appears relatively more important in systemic metabolism, modulating levels of metabolites flowing through intestine, liver, and kidney.

https://openalex.org/W2740658361,"The CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA system has recently become a popular tool for genome editing and a very hot topic in the field of medical research. In this system, Cas9 protein is directed to a desired location for gene engineering and cleaves target DNA sequence which is complementary to a 20-nucleotide guide sequence found within the sgRNA. A lot of experimental efforts, ranging from in vivo selection to in silico modeling, have been made for efficient designing of sgRNAs in CRISPR/Cas9 system. In this article, we present a novel tool, called CRISPRpred, for efficient in silico prediction of sgRNAs on-target activity which is based on the applications of Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. To conduct experiments, we have used a benchmark dataset of 17 genes and 5310 guide sequences where there are only 20% true values. CRISPRpred achieves Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC-Curve), Area Under Precision Recall Curve (AUPR-Curve) and maximum Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as 0.85, 0.56 and 0.48, respectively. Our tool shows approximately 5% improvement in AUPR-Curve and after analyzing all evaluation metrics, we find that CRISPRpred is better than the current state-of-the-art. CRISPRpred is enough flexible to extract relevant features and use them in a learning algorithm. The source code of our entire software with relevant dataset can be found in the following link: https://github.com/khaled-buet/CRISPRpred."
https://openalex.org/W2602810336,"Both adult and larval zebrafish have been demonstrated to show behavioural responses to noxious stimulation but also to potentially stress- and fear or anxiety- eliciting situations. The pain or nociceptive response can be altered and modulated by these situations in adult fish through a mechanism called stress-induced analgesia. However, this phenomenon has not been described in larval fish yet. Therefore, this study explores the behavioural changes in larval zebrafish after noxious stimulation and exposure to challenges that can trigger a stress, fear or anxiety reaction. Five-day post fertilization zebrafish were exposed to either a stressor (air emersion), a predatory fear cue (alarm substance) or an anxiogenic (caffeine) alone or prior to immersion in acetic acid 0.1%. Pre- and post-stimulation behaviour (swimming velocity and time spent active) was recorded using a novel tracking software in 25 fish at once. Results show that larvae reduced both velocity and activity after exposure to the air emersion and alarm substance challenges and that these changes were attenuated using etomidate and diazepam, respectively. Exposure to acetic acid decreased velocity and activity as well, whereas air emersion and alarm substance inhibited these responses, showing no differences between pre- and post-stimulation. Therefore, we hypothesize that an antinociceptive mechanism, activated by stress and/or fear, occur in 5dpf zebrafish, which could have prevented the larvae to display the characteristic responses to pain."
https://openalex.org/W2742071918,"While white-nose syndrome (WNS) has decimated hibernating bat populations in the Nearctic, species from the Palearctic appear to cope better with the fungal skin infection causing WNS. This has encouraged multiple hypotheses on the mechanisms leading to differential survival of species exposed to the same pathogen. To facilitate intercontinental comparisons, we proposed a novel pathogenesis-based grading scheme consistent with WNS diagnosis histopathology criteria. UV light-guided collection was used to obtain single biopsies from Nearctic and Palearctic bat wing membranes non-lethally. The proposed scheme scores eleven grades associated with WNS on histopathology. Given weights reflective of grade severity, the sum of findings from an individual results in weighted cumulative WNS pathology score. The probability of finding fungal skin colonisation and single, multiple or confluent cupping erosions increased with increase in Pseudogymnoascus destructans load. Increasing fungal load mimicked progression of skin infection from epidermal surface colonisation to deep dermal invasion. Similarly, the number of UV-fluorescent lesions increased with increasing weighted cumulative WNS pathology score, demonstrating congruence between WNS-associated tissue damage and extent of UV fluorescence. In a case report, we demonstrated that UV-fluorescence disappears within two weeks of euthermy. Change in fluorescence was coupled with a reduction in weighted cumulative WNS pathology score, whereby both methods lost diagnostic utility. While weighted cumulative WNS pathology scores were greater in the Nearctic than Palearctic, values for Nearctic bats were within the range of those for Palearctic species. Accumulation of wing damage probably influences mortality in affected bats, as demonstrated by a fatal case of Myotis daubentonii with natural WNS infection and healing in Myotis myotis. The proposed semi-quantitative pathology score provided good agreement between experienced raters, showing it to be a powerful and widely applicable tool for defining WNS severity."
https://openalex.org/W2741972575,"To assess a potential role of Bruch´s membrane (BM) in the biomechanics of the eye, we measured its thickness and the density of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in various ocular regions in eyes of varying axial length.Human globes, enucleated because of an ocular tumor or end-stage glaucoma were prepared for histological examination. Using light microscopy, the histological slides were histomorphometrically examined applying a digitized image analysis system.The study included 104 eyes with a mean axial length of 27.9±3.2 mm (range:22.6mm-36.5mm). In eyes without congenital glaucoma, BM was significantly thickest (P<0.001) at the ora serrata, followed by the posterior pole, the midpoint between equator and posterior pole (MBEPP), and finally the equator. BM thickness was not significantly correlated with axial length (ora serrata: P = 0.93; equator:P = 0.31; MBEPP:P = 0.15; posterior pole:P = 0.35). RPE cell density in the pre-equatorial region (P = 0.02; regression coefficient r = -0.24) and in the retro-equatorial region (P = 0.03; r = -0.22) decreased with longer axial length, while RPE cell density at the ora serrata (P = 0.35), the MBEPP (P = 0.06; r = -0.19) and the posterior pole (P = 0.38) was not significantly correlated with axial length. Highly myopic eyes with congenital glaucoma showed a tendency towards lower BM thickness and lower RPE cell density at all locations.BM thickness, in contrast to scleral and choroidal thickness, was independent of axial length in eyes without congenital glaucoma. In association with an axial elongation associated decrease in the RPE cell density in the midperiphery, the findings support the notion of a biomechanical role BM may play in the process of emmetropization/myopization."
https://openalex.org/W2742158642,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) correlate with recurrence, metastasis and poor survival in clinical studies. Encouraging results from clinical trials of CSC inhibitors have further validated CSCs as therapeutic targets. ONC201 is a first-in-class small molecule imipridone in Phase I/II clinical trials for advanced cancer. We have previously shown that ONC201 targets self-renewing, chemotherapy-resistant colorectal CSCs via Akt/ERK inhibition and DR5/TRAIL induction. In this study, we demonstrate that the anti-CSC effects of ONC201 involve early changes in stem cell-related gene expression prior to tumor cell death induction. A targeted network analysis of gene expression profiles in colorectal cancer cells revealed that ONC201 downregulates stem cell pathways such as Wnt signaling and modulates genes (ID1, ID2, ID3 and ALDH7A1) known to regulate self-renewal in colorectal, prostate cancer and glioblastoma. ONC201-mediated changes in CSC-related gene expression were validated at the RNA and protein level for each tumor type. Accordingly, we observed inhibition of self-renewal and CSC markers in prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived glioblastoma cells upon ONC201 treatment. Interestingly, ONC201-mediated CSC depletion does not occur in colorectal cancer cells with acquired resistance to ONC201. Finally, we observed that basal expression of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7 and TCF3) significantly correlate with ONC201 efficacy in >1000 cancer cell lines and combining the expression of multiple genes leads to a stronger overall prediction. These proof-of-concept studies provide a rationale for testing CSC expression at the RNA and protein level as a predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarker of ONC201 response in ongoing clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2741006688,"Creative exploration is central to science, art and cognitive development. However, research on creative exploration is limited by a lack of high-resolution automated paradigms. To address this, we present such an automated paradigm, the creative foraging game, in which people search for novel and valuable solutions in a large and well-defined space made of all possible shapes made of ten connected squares. Players discovered shape categories such as digits, letters, and airplanes as well as more abstract categories. They exploited each category, then dropped it to explore once again, and so on. Aligned with a prediction of optimal foraging theory (OFT), during exploration phases, people moved along meandering paths that are about three times longer than the shortest paths between shapes; when exploiting a category of related shapes, they moved along the shortest paths. The moment of discovery of a new category was usually done at a non-prototypical and ambiguous shape, which can serve as an experimental proxy for creative leaps. People showed individual differences in their search patterns, along a continuum between two strategies: a mercurial quick-to-discover/quick-to-drop strategy and a thorough slow-to-discover/slow-to-drop strategy. Contrary to optimal foraging theory, players leave exploitation to explore again far before categories are depleted. This paradigm opens the way for automated high-resolution study of creative exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2740147992,"Objectives To assess salivary flow in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and its association with xerostomia. Methods Cross-sectional clinical study conducted with older patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least one year receiving treatment at the Integrated Center for Diabetes and Hypertension of Ceará (CIHD) in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Northeastern Brazil. Oral clinical examination was carried out to assess the decayed, missing and filled teeth index (DMFT). Perception of the presence of xerostomia/dry mouth was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale. Stimulated salivary flow was measured and samples were obtained using an extra-soft silicone device. Results 120 older patients with diabetes (60 insulin-dependent and 60 non-insulin-dependent) aged 65–91 years, with a mean age of 72.26 ± 6.53 years, were assessed. Of these, 111 (92.5%) presented a decrease in salivary flow while 59 (49.2%) reported moderate to severe xerostomia/dry mouth. The DMFT Index presented a mean of 27.53 ± 4.86 teeth. Conclusions Reduced salivary flow was found in the group assessed in the present research; however, this finding is not in accordance with the perception of xerostomia/dry mouth reported by the patients."
https://openalex.org/W2740201706,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (IPV-PTSD), associated neural activity in response to mother-child relational stimuli, and child psychopathology indicators at child ages 12-42 months and one year later. The study tested the hypothesis that decreased maternal neural activity in regions that subserve emotion regulation would be associated with child symptoms associated with emotional dysregulation at both time points. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of 42 mothers with or without violence-exposure and associated IPV-PTSD were assessed. Their child's life-events and symptoms/behaviors indicative of high-risk subsequent PTSD diagnosis on a maternal-report questionnaire were measured one year later. Maternal IPV-PTSD severity was significantly associated with decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation in response to mother-child relational stimuli. Maternal IPV-PTSD severity and decreased vmPFC activation were then significantly associated with a child attachment disturbance at 12-42 months and symptoms/behaviors one year later, that were correlated with emotional dysregulation and risk for child PTSD. Maternal IPV-PTSD and child exposure to IPV were both predictive of child PTSD symptoms with maternal IPV-PTSD likely mediating the effects of child IPV exposure on child PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that maternal IPV-PTSD severity and associated decreased vmPFC activity in response to mother-child relational stimuli are predictors of child psychopathology by age 12-42 months and one-year later. Significant findings in this paper may well be useful in understanding how maternal top-down cortico-limbic dysregulation promotes intergenerational transmission of IPV and related psychopathology and, thus should be targeted in treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2739603833,"Background Improved systematic screening of high-risk groups is a key component of the tuberculosis (TB) elimination strategy endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). We used a multiplex microbead immunoassay to measure antibody responses to 28 M. tuberculosis (M.tb) antigens, and assessed whether combinations of antibody responses achieve accuracy thresholds required for a TB screening test. Methods A random selection of plasma samples obtained from consecutive HIV-negative adults who were admitted to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda with cough ≥2 weeks’ but <6 months’ duration were analyzed for serological response to 28 M.tb antigens using an in-house multiplex microbead immunoassay. We compared the median difference of the antibody response to each antigen between patients with and without culture-confirmed TB, ranked each antigen according to variable importance (VIM), and assessed the sensitivity and specificity of combinations of antibody responses using an advanced classification algorithm, SuperLearner. Results Among the 237 patients included in the analysis, 119 (50%) were female, median age was 32 years (IQR 25, 46), and 113 (48%) had TB. Median antibody levels to eight antigens were significantly different between patients with and without TB. A panel including eight of the top ranked antigens had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI 89.4, 93.8) and a specificity of 88.6% (95% CI 78.2, 97.6) (Ag85B, Ag85A, Ag85C, Rv0934-P38, Rv3881, BfrB, Rv3873, and Rv2878c). With sensitivity constrained to be >90%, specificity remained close to 70% with as few as 3 antigens included in the panels. Conclusions Measuring antibody responses to combinations of antigens could facilitate TB screening and should be further evaluated in populations being targeted for systematic screening."

This study aimed to assess the risk of HPV-16 LCR variants for cervical cancer in women of Southwest China. 2146 cervical scrapings of volunteer outpatients and 74 cervical cancer tissues were screened.14 entire HPV-16 LCRs from asymptomatic carriers and 34 entire HPV-16 LCRs from cervical cancer patients were successfully amplified and sequenced to align to others described. 58 different point mutations were detected in 54 nucleotide sites of HPV-16 LCR. G7193T and G7521A variants, accounting for 100% of the infections, were predicted to locate at the binding site for FOXA1 and SOX9, respectively. A7730C variant which showed a high mutation frequency in cervical cancer was predicted to be a binding site for the cellular transcription factor PHOX2A. In addition, phylogenetic analysis displayed a high prevalence of A lineage in HPV-16 LCR in this Southwest China population. This study may help understanding of the intrinsic geographical relatedness and the correlations between LCR mutations and the development of carcinogenic lesions in Southwest China population. And it provides useful data for the further study of the biological function of HPV-16 LCR variants."
https://openalex.org/W2741135952,"To understand beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) estuarine use in the Nelson River estuary, southwest Hudson Bay, we recorded and examined beluga movements and habitat associations for the July through August period in 2002-2005. We compared locations of belugas fitted with satellite transmitters (""tags"") (2002-2005) and aerial-surveyed (2003 and 2005) belugas for years of differing freshwater flow from the Nelson River which is influenced by hydroelectric activity. Using the beluga telemetry location data, we estimated an early August behavioral shift in beluga distribution patterns from local estuarine use to a progressively more migratory behavior away from the estuary. The timing of this shift in behavior was also apparent in results of beluga aerial surveys from the 1940s-1960s, despite environmental changes including later freeze-up and warming ocean temperatures. Overall, during the higher than average discharge (""wet"") year of 2005, the three tagged belugas ranged farther from the Nelson River but not farther from the nearest shore along southwestern Hudson Bay, compared to the 10 tagged belugas tracked during the ""dry"" years of 2002-2004 with below average discharges. Aerial survey data for 2003 and 2005 display a similar dry vs. wet year shift in spatial patterns, with no significant change in overall density of belugas within the study area. In the Nelson estuary, proximity to the fresh-salt water mixing area may be more important than the shallow waters of the upper estuary. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) were observed in the Churchill area (200 km northwest) during each year of study, 2002-05, and belugas may benefit from the proximity to shallow estuary waters that provide protection from the larger-bodied predator. Study results contribute to an understanding of the influence of environmental variation on how and why belugas use estuaries although considerable uncertainties exist and additional research is required."
https://openalex.org/W2741381748,"Exocytosis involves fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, thereby delivering membrane proteins to the cell surface and releasing material into the extracellular space. The tethering of the secretory vesicles before membrane fusion is mediated by the exocyst, an essential phylogenetically conserved octameric protein complex. Exocyst biogenesis is regulated by several processes, but the mechanisms by which the exocyst is degraded are unknown. Here, to unravel the components of the exocyst degradation pathway, we screened for extragenic suppressors of a temperature-sensitive fission yeast strain mutated in the exocyst subunit Sec3 (sec3-913). One of the suppressing DNAs encoded a truncated dominant-negative variant of the 26S proteasome subunit, Rpt2, indicating that exocyst degradation is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The temperature-dependent growth defect of the sec3-913 strain was gene dosage-dependent and suppressed by blocking the proteasome, Hsp70-type molecular chaperones, the Pib1 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and the deubiquitylating enzyme Ubp3. Moreover, defects in cell septation, exocytosis, and endocytosis in sec3 mutant strains were similarly alleviated by mutation of components in this pathway. We also found that, particularly under stress conditions, wild-type Sec3 degradation is regulated by Pib1 and the 26S proteasome. In conclusion, our results suggest that a cytosolic protein quality control pathway monitors folding and proteasome-dependent turnover of an exocyst subunit and, thereby, controls exocytosis in fission yeast.

During exocytosis, secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, thereby delivering membrane proteins to the cell surface and releasing material into the extracellular space. Importantly, exocytosis also provides lipids for membrane extension, which is required for growth, cell polarity, and division and is therefore critical for cell function and tissue development. In yeasts, exocytosis of hydrolytic enzymes is necessary to dissolve the cell wall (septum) between two daughter cells to complete cytokinesis (1Martín-Cuadrado A.B. Dueñas E. Sipiczki M.

In general, cargoes derived from organelles are transported by motor proteins along cytoskeletal tracks toward specific areas of the plasma membrane. The initial contact between the secretory vesicles and the target membrane is mediated by tethering factors that are thought to bridge SNARE complexes on opposing membranes to allow vesicle docking and fusion with the plasma membrane (2Cai H.

Typically, these rely on molecular chaperones that capture misfolded proteins and either refold them or guide them to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). How cells discern misfolded from native proteins remains incompletely understood but is likely to involve recognition of exposed hydrophobic regions in misfolded proteins. A number of proteins involved in targeting the misfolded proteins for degradation have been identified, particularly in yeast cells, where mutants in UPS components were identified as extragenic suppressors of point mutants in essential genes (20Gardner R.G.

These observations suggest that PQC is highly diligent and thus prone to target proteins that are only slightly structurally perturbed and still functional.

In contrast, cytosolic quality control is less well defined, although recent studies in budding yeast have shown that misfolded cytosolic proteins are often transported to the nucleus prior to degradation (28Park S.H.

Here we show that degradation of the exocyst subunit Sec3 depends on the proteasome, Hsp70-type molecular chaperones, the Pib1 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and the deubiquitylating enzyme Ubp3. The fission yeast sec3-913 strain carries a point mutation in the sec3 gene that renders the cell temperature-sensitive (11Jourdain I. Dooley H.C. Toda T. Fission yeast sec3 bridges the exocyst complex to the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the exocyst, we performed a screen for extragenic suppressors of the sec3-913 temperature-sensitive growth defect at 35 °C. One of the suppressing plasmids contained a genomic DNA fragment of chromosome II encoding the first 658 bp (219 amino acids) of the proteasome subunit Mts2/Rpt2 (Fig. 1A). Because full-length Rpt2 is a 361-residue essential ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome (32Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Defective mitosis due to a mutation in the gene for a fission yeast 26S protease subunit.Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we predicted this truncated Rpt2 version to function in a dominant-negative manner, as has been shown before (21Kriegenburg F. Jakopec V. Poulsen E.G. Nielsen S.V. Roguev A. Krogan N. Gordon C. Fleig U. Hartmann-Petersen R. A chaperone-assisted degradation pathway targets kinetochore proteins to ensure genome stability.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004140Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To test the effect of proteasome mutations further, we combined the sec3-913 mutant with a deletion in the proteasome assembly factor nas6+. In agreement with the sec3-913 temperature-sensitive phenotype being suppressed by reducing proteasome activity, we observed a strong restoration of growth at the restrictive temperature in the sec3-913nas6Δ double mutant (Fig. 1B). In budding yeast, deletion of the gene encoding the proteasome subunit Sem1 (Dss1 in fission yeast) was found to suppress various exocyst mutations (33Jäntti J. Lahdenranta J. Olkkonen V.M. Söderlund H. Keränen S. SEM1, a homologue of the split hand/split foot malformation candidate gene Dss1, regulates exocytosis and pseudohyphal differentiation in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test whether this was also the case for fission yeast Dss1, a sec3-913dss1Δ double mutant was constructed and analyzed for growth at the restrictive temperature. In S. pombe, deletion of the dss1+ gene results in a temperature-sensitive growth defect (34Paraskevopoulos K. Kriegenburg F. Tatham M.H. Rösner H.I. Medina B. Larsen I.B. Brandstrup R. Hardwick K.G. Hay R.T. Kragelund B.B. Hartmann-Petersen R. Gordon C. Dss1 is a 26S proteasome ubiquitin receptor.Mol. Cell. 2014; 56: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unlike the situation in budding yeast, we did not observe any effect of Dss1 on the growth defect of the sec3-913 mutant in fission yeast (Fig. 1C). However, because Dss1/Sem1 is also linked to non-proteasomal functions (35Kragelund B.B. Schenstrøm S.M. Rebula C.A. Panse V.G. Hartmann-Petersen R. DSS1/Sem1, a multifunctional and intrinsically disordered protein.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 446-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), including transcription and mRNA maturation, this is likely to obscure a positive genetic interaction between dss1 and sec3 in S. pombe cells. However, as a further control, we also analyzed the growth of wild-type and sec3-913 cells on medium containing sublethal amounts of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZ). In agreement with the genetic interaction data, addition of bortezomib suppressed the growth defect in a temperature- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). We therefore conclude that the sec3-913 temperature-dependent growth defect is suppressed by blocking the proteasome. This phenotype suppression suggests that Sec3-913 is a substrate of the UPS. To test this, we followed the degradation of V5-tagged wild-type Sec3 and Sec3-913 in cultures treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Both at the permissive and restrictive temperature, the wild-type Sec3 protein appeared to be fairly stable during the experiment. In contrast, degradation of the Sec3-913 protein occurred rapidly at the permissive temperature and was even more pronounced at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1E). By densitometry of Western blots, we estimated the half-life of Sec3-913 at 36 °C to be <2 h (Fig. 1F), whereas wild-type Sec3 under the same conditions displayed a half-life of ∼8 h (Fig. 1F). The observed degradation was proteasome-dependent because addition of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib blocked the degradation (Fig. 1, E and F). Accordingly, addition of bortezomib and deletion of nas6 increased the steady-state level of the Sec3-913 protein (Fig. 1, G and H). Addition of bortezomib did not lead to a general stress response because we did not observe any induction of Hsp70 (Fig. 1G). We conclude from these experiments that the Sec3-913 protein is a target of the UPS. Our observation that the sec3-913 temperature-sensitive growth defect is suppressed by deletion of nas6+ or addition of bortezomib suggests that the Sec3-913 protein at least partly retains function at the restrictive temperature. To test this prediction, we generated strains in which the endogenous sec3 promoter was replaced with the strong nmt1 promoter, leading to enhanced synthesis of Sec3 and Sec3-913. When sec3-913 was overexpressed, we no longer observed any temperature-sensitive growth defect (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Sec3-913 is functional at the restrictive temperature. Thus, the temperature-sensitive growth defect is likely a consequence of a meticulous PQC pathway, leading to an insufficient cellular quantity of the Sec3-913 protein. In S. pombe, Sec3 is required for the exocytosis of hydrolytic enzymes to dissolve the septum between two daughter cells during cytokinesis but also for actin patch localization and endocytosis (11Jourdain I. Dooley H.C. Toda T. Fission yeast sec3 bridges the exocyst complex to the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To test whether these functions of Sec3-913 were restored when protein degradation was inhibited, we first monitored cell septation by calcofluor staining. The septation defect of the sec3-913 strain appeared gradually upon shifting the cells to the restrictive temperature. After the cells were incubated for 4 h at 36 °C, we observed about 60% septated sec3-913 cells, of which several displayed multiple septa. Addition of bortezomib led to a strong reduction in the number of septated and multiseptated cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, bortezomib treatment also reduced the thickness of the septa (Fig. 2C). To rule out that these results were caused by an off-target effect of bortezomib, we also analyzed septation in untreated sec3-913nas6Δ double mutant cells. We observed full restoration of the sec3-913 septation defect upon deletion of nas6 (Fig. 3A). A defect in exocytosis can also be observed by transmission electron microscopy and quantified as the proportion of secretory vesicles per unit of cytoplasm. In wild-type and nas6Δ cells, the vesicle/cytoplasm ratio was very low, presumably because secretory vesicles efficiently fuse with the plasma membrane. In sec3-913 cells, secretory vesicles accumulated in the cytoplasm, whereas this increase was not as extensive in the sec3-913nas6Δ double mutant (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, the secretory defects observed in sec3-913 cells are at least partially caused by the degradation of Sec3-913. To monitor whether the reported endocytosis defect of the sec3-913 strain (11Jourdain I. Dooley H.C. Toda T. Fission yeast sec3 bridges the exocyst complex to the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) could be restored by deletion of nas6, we followed the uptake of the dye FM4-64 over time. As described previously (36Gachet Y. Hyams J.S. Endocytosis in fission yeast is spatially associated with the actin cytoskeleton during polarised cell growth and cytokinesis.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4231-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), added FM4-64 first associates with the plasma membrane in zones of active growth and is then incorporated into endosomes, which later fuse with the vacuolar membranes. Clearly, FM4-64 incorporation in sec3-913 endosomes was delayed compared with the situation in the nas6Δ and sec3-913nas6Δ double mutant (Fig. 3D, arrowheads). Hence, after 1 h, FM4-64 began to accumulate in endosomes in the sec3-913 single mutant strain, whereas this occurred already after 30 min in the sec3-913nas6Δ double mutant (Fig. 3D). This reveals that inhibiting degradation also restores the endocytic function of the Sec3-913 protein. Our observations so far suggest that the UPS targets the Sec3-913 protein. Because Sec3-913 is encoded by a mutant gene, is unstable, and interacts less efficiently with its binding partner Sec8 (11Jourdain I. Dooley H.C. Toda T. Fission yeast sec3 bridges the exocyst complex to the actin cytoskeleton.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we speculated that Sec3-913 is targeted for the UPS by a protein quality control mechanism, although Sec3-913 is still partly functional and, therefore, probably only slightly misfolded. Molecular chaperones are key players in PQC, where they catalyze folding and/or target misfolded proteins for degradation. To test whether molecular chaperones were involved in the folding or degradation of Sec3-913, we first crossed the sec3-913 strain to different chaperone mutants to obtain double mutants. The growth of the double mutants was then compared with the single mutants at various temperatures. Deletion of the Hsp70-type chaperones sks2, ssa1, and ssa2 led to partial suppression of the temperature-sensitive growth defect (Fig. 4A), indicating that these chaperones are not very active in folding Sec3-913 (because this would lead to a phenotype enhancement) but, rather, may play a role in targeting Sec3-913 for degradation. In case of ssa2Δ, we observed that the cells displayed a general growth defect that, surprisingly, appeared to be somewhat stronger at 29 °C than at higher temperatures (Fig. 4A). Mutation of the cdc48 segregase did not affect the growth of the sec3-913 strain, whereas deletion of the hsp104 chaperone led to a slight but reproducible synthetic growth defect at 33 °C. In agreement with deletion of sks2 and ssa1 only partially suppressing the sec3-913 growth defect, we only observed a modest suppression of the septation defect in the sec3-913sks2Δ and sec3-913ssa1Δ double mutants (Fig. 4B), and we were unable to detect any change in Sec3-913 protein levels (Fig. 4C). To identify E3s involved in targeting Sec3-913 for degradation, we took an approach similar to the one for the molecular chaperones. In yeast, the principal nuclear quality control E3 is San1 (37Rosenbaum J.C. Fredrickson E.K. Oeser M.L. Garrett-Engele C.M. Locke M.N. Richardson L.A. Nelson Z.W. Hetrick E.D. Milac T.I.

However, in all cases, double mutants displayed a similar growth pattern as the sec3-913 single mutant (Fig. 5), which strongly indicates that, on their own, none of these E3s contribute significantly to Sec3-913 degradation. More recently, the budding yeast E3, Rsp5 (human NEDD4), has been connected to degradation of misfolded proteins following heat stress (30Fang N.N. Chan G.T. Zhu M. Comyn S.A. Persaud A. Deshaies R.J. Rotin D. Gsponer J. Mayor T. Rsp5/Nedd4 is the main ubiquitin ligase that targets cytosolic misfolded proteins following heat stress.Nat.

Deubiquitinase activity is required for the proteasomal degradation of misfolded cytosolic proteins upon heat-stress.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The S. pombe genome encodes three genes, pub1+, pub2+, and pub3+, which display high similarity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSP5. When we tested these, only deletion of pub1 led to partial rescue of the sec3-913 temperature-sensitive growth defect (Fig. 5). This suggests that Pub1 contributes to the degradation of Sec3-913. Because double deletion mutants of pub1, pub2, and pub3 display synthetically sick/lethal phenotypes (43Tamai K.K. Shimoda C.

Here, we aim to investigate the phylogeny and historical biogeography of the group, which was previously thought to be vicariant in origin, and examine the biogeographic origins of the genus Moggridgea using a dated multi-gene phylogeny. Moggridgea specimens were sampled from southern Australia and Africa, and Bertmainus was sampled from Western Australia. Sanger sequencing methods were used to generate a robust six marker molecular dataset consisting of the nuclear genes 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, ITS rRNA, XPNPEP3 and H3 and the mitochondrial gene COI. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods were used to analyse the dataset, and the key dispersal nodes were dated using BEAST. Based on our data, we demonstrate that Moggridgea rainbowi from Kangaroo Island, Australia is a valid member of the otherwise African genus Moggridgea. Molecular clock dating analyses show that the inter-specific divergence of M. rainbowi from African congeners is between 2.27–16.02 million years ago (Mya). This divergence date significantly post-dates the separation of Africa from Gondwana (95 Mya) and therefore does not support a vicariant origin for Australian Moggridgea. It also pre-dates human colonisation of Kangaroo Island, a result which is further supported by the intra-specific divergence date of 1.10–6.39 Mya between separate populations on Kangaroo Island. These analyses provide strong support for the hypothesis that Moggridgea colonised Australia via long-distance trans-Indian Ocean dispersal, representing the first such documented case in a mygalomorph spider."
https://openalex.org/W2739620438,"Objective There is a lack of consensus regarding the extent to which cognitive dysfunctions may recover upon cessation of alcohol intake by alcohol-dependents (AD), and the divergent findings are most likely due to methodological differences between the various studies. The present study was aimed at conducting a very strict longitudinal study of cognitive recovery in terms of assessment points, the duration of abstinence, control of age and duration of the addiction, and by use of individual analyses in addition to mean group comparisons. Our study further focused on the 2–3 week phase of alcohol detoxification that is already known to positively affect many biological, emotional, motivational, as well as neural variables, followed by longer-term therapies for which good cognitive functioning is needed. Methods 41 AD inpatients undergoing a detoxification program, and 41 matched controls, were evaluated twice in terms of five cognitive functions (i.e., short-term memory, working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and verbal fluency) within a three-week interval [on the first day (T1) and the 18th day (T2) of abstinence for AD patients]. Emotional (positive and negative affectivity and depression) and motivational (craving) variables were also measured at both evaluation times. Results Although verbal fluency, short-term memory, and cognitive flexibility did not appear to be affected, the patients exhibited impaired inhibition and working memory at T1. While no recovery of inhibition was found to occur, the average working memory performance of the patients was comparable to that of the controls at T2. Improvements in emotional and motivational dimensions were also observed, although they did not correlate with the ones in working memory. Individual analysis showed that not all participants were impaired or recover the same functions. Conclusions While inhibition deficits appear to persist after 18 days of detoxification, deficits in working memory, which is a central component of cognition, are greatly reduced after alcohol detoxification. Individual differences in the trajectory of recovery do arise however, and it might be worth implementing individual assessments of impaired functions at the end of the detoxification phase in order to maximize the chances of success in longer-term treatments and abstinence."
https://openalex.org/W2739962629,"The Hajar Mountains of south-eastern Arabia form an isolated massif surrounded by the sea to the east and by a large desert to the west. As a result of their old geological origin, geographical isolation, complex topography and local climate, these mountains provide an important refuge for endemic and relict species of plants and animals. With 19 species restricted to the Hajar Mountains, reptiles are the vertebrate group with the highest level of endemicity, becoming an excellent model for understanding the patterns and processes that generate and shape diversity in this arid mountain range. The geckos of the Ptyodactylus hasselquistii species complex are the largest geckos in Arabia and are found widely distributed across the Arabian Mountains, constituting a very important component of the reptile mountain fauna. Preliminary analyses suggested that their diversity in the Hajar Mountains may be higher than expected and that their systematics should be revised. In order to tackle these questions, we inferred a nearly complete calibrated phylogeny of the genus Ptyodactylus to identify the origin of the Hajar Mountains lineages using information from two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes. Genetic variability within the Hajar Mountains was further investigated using 68 specimens of Ptyodactylus from 46 localities distributed across the entire mountain range and sequenced for the same genes as above. The molecular phylogenies and morphological analyses as well as niche comparisons indicate the presence of two very old sister cryptic species living in allopatry: one restricted to the extreme northern Hajar Mountains and described as a new species herein; the other distributed across the rest of the Hajar Mountains that can be confidently assigned to the species P. orlovi. Similar to recent findings in the geckos of the genus Asaccus, the results of the present study uncover more hidden diversity in the northern Hajar Mountains and stress once again the importance of this unique mountain range as a hot spot of biodiversity and a priority focal point for reptile conservation in Arabia."

In the study, the principle of dust concentration detection using laser scattering is studied, and the detection basis of Mie scattering theory is determined. Through simulation, the influence of the incident laser wavelength, dust particle diameter, and refractive index of dust particles on the scattered light intensity distribution are obtained for determining the scattered light intensity curves of single suspended dust particles under different characteristic parameters. A genetic algorithm was used to study the inverse particle size distribution, and the reliability of the measurement system design is proven theoretically. The dust concentration detection system, which includes a laser system, computer circuitry, air flow system, and control system, was then implemented according to the parameters obtained from the theoretical analysis. The performance of the designed system was evaluated. Experimental results show that the system performance was stable and reliable, resulting in high-precision automatic dust concentration measurement with strong anti-interference ability."
https://openalex.org/W2741831089,"The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill damaged thousands of km2 of intertidal marsh along shorelines that had been experiencing elevated rates of erosion for decades. Yet, the contribution of marsh oiling to landscape-scale degradation and subsequent land loss has been difficult to quantify. Here, we applied advanced remote sensing techniques to map changes in marsh land cover and open water before and after oiling. We segmented the marsh shorelines into non-oiled and oiled reaches and calculated the land loss rates for each 10% increase in oil cover (e.g. 0% to >70%), to determine if land loss rates for each reach oiling category were significantly different before and after oiling. Finally, we calculated background land-loss rates to separate natural and oil-related erosion and land loss. Oiling caused significant increases in land losses, particularly along reaches of heavy oiling (>20% oil cover). For reaches with ≥20% oiling, land loss rates increased abruptly during the 2010–2013 period, and the loss rates during this period are significantly different from both the pre-oiling (p < 0.0001) and 2013–2016 post-oiling periods (p < 0.0001). The pre-oiling and 2013–2016 post-oiling periods exhibit no significant differences in land loss rates across oiled and non-oiled reaches (p = 0.557). We conclude that oiling increased land loss by more than 50%, but that land loss rates returned to background levels within 3–6 years after oiling, suggesting that oiling results in a large but temporary increase in land loss rates along the shoreline."

Among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), we estimated prevalence of potential PNS and selected autoimmune conditions and compared their incidence rates with those of equivalent conditions in the general population cohort, using hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for baseline comorbidity. Results There were 35,319 patients with NSCLC and 6,711 patients with SCLC. The incidence rates per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval) of any potential PNS or selected autoimmune disorders were 135.4 (131.9–139.1) among NSCLC patients and 237.3 (224.4–250.5) among SCLC patients. Adjusted HRs for any potential PNS or selected autoimmune disorders were 4.8 (4.7–5.0) for NSCLC and 8.2 (7.6–8.8) for SCLC. Conclusion Incidence rate of any potential PNS or selected autoimmune disorders among patients with lung cancer was greater than that in the general population and was greater after SCLC than after NSCLC. Impact These results provide context to discerning PNS from adverse effects of novel immunotherapies during the clinical course of NSCLC and SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2739489650,"While homeostatic apoptosis is immunologically silent, macrophage apoptosis during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection can potentially induce an immune response against the mycobacteria. To examine the role of dendritic cells in this response, macrophage apoptosis was induced by incubating the macrophage with cell wall extracts of mycobacteria expressing LpqH. The apoptogenic proteins of the cell wall extracts were engulfed by the macrophage and then were translocated from the cytosol to the nuclei of the dying cells. Dendritic cells that engulfed the apoptotic macrophages acquired an immunogenic phenotype that included upregulation of MHC-I, increased expression of the costimulatory molecules, CD40, CD80, and CD86, and increased production of IL-12, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-β. In addition, the dendritic cells triggered a proliferative response of CD8+ T cells with IFN-γ production via cross-presentation. Taken together, these findings support a model in which phagocytosis of whole apoptotic cells carrying mycobacterial antigens promotes a potentially protective immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2739597516,"The Acheulean materials documented in FLK West dated c. 1.7 Ma. are the focus of the present work. An original techno-functional approach is applied here to analyze the origin of Acheulean tools. According to the results, these tools were employed in different functional contexts in which tasks of different durations that transformed resources with different resistances were carried out. The exploitation of large and resistant resources suggests that the economic mechanism governing the manufacture of these tools was an increase in the demand of the work load. The decision processes underlying the production of these tools have thus an evident functional motivation. However, the presence of a refined handaxe in the studied sample indicates that the design form and production principles of handaxe manufacture were the result of an abrupt emergence rather than a long gradual development. The integration of mechanical and ergonomic investigation in our research has been crucial to explain how a core-and-flake industry gave way to a technology based on the production of large and heavy shaped tools."
https://openalex.org/W2740098447,"Amanita ballerina and A. brunneitoxicaria spp. nov. are introduced from Thailand. Amanita fuligineoides is also reported for the first time from Thailand, increasing the known distribution of this taxon. Together, those findings support our view that many taxa are yet to be discovered in the region. While both morphological characters and a multiple-gene phylogeny clearly place A. brunneitoxicaria and A. fuligineoides in sect. Phalloideae (Fr.) Quél., the placement of A. ballerina is problematic. On the one hand, the morphology of A. ballerina shows clear affinities with stirps Limbatula of sect. Lepidella. On the other hand, in a multiple-gene phylogeny including taxa of all sections in subg. Lepidella, A. ballerina and two other species, including A. zangii, form a well-supported clade sister to the Phalloideae sensu Bas 1969, which include the lethal “death caps” and “destroying angels”. Together, the A. ballerina-A. zangii clade and the Phalloideae sensu Bas 1969 also form a well-supported clade. We therefore screened for two of the most notorious toxins by HPLC-MS analysis of methanolic extracts from the basidiomata. Interestingly, neither α-amanitin nor phalloidin was found in A. ballerina, whereas Amanita fuligineoides was confirmed to contain both α-amanitin and phalloidin, and A. brunneitoxicaria contained only α-amanitin. Together with unique morphological characteristics, the position in the phylogeny indicates that A. ballerina is either an important link in the evolution of the deadly Amanita sect. Phalloideae species, or a member of a new section also including A. zangii."
https://openalex.org/W2741848811,"Cervical cancer is the fourth common cancer in women resulting worldwide in 266,000 deaths per year. Belonging to the carcinomas, new insights into cervical cancer biology may also have great implications for finding new treatment strategies for other kinds of epithelial cancers. Although the transcription factor NF-κB is known as a key player in tumor formation, the relevance of its particular subunits is still underestimated. Here, we applied CRISPR/Cas9n-mediated genome editing to successfully knockout the NF-κB subunit c-REL in HeLa Kyoto cells as a model system for cervical cancers. We successfully generated a homozygous deletion in the c-REL gene, which we validated using sequencing, qPCR, immunocytochemistry, western blot analysis, EMSA and analysis of off-target effects. On the functional level, we observed the deletion of c-REL to result in a significantly decreased cell proliferation in comparison to wildtype (wt) without affecting apoptosis. The impaired proliferative behavior of c-REL-/- cells was accompanied by a strongly decreased amount of the H2B protein as well as a significant delay in the prometaphase of mitosis compared to c-REL+/+ HeLa Kyoto cells. c-REL-/- cells further showed significantly decreased expression levels of c-REL target genes in comparison to wt. In accordance to our proliferation data, we observed the c-REL knockout to result in a significantly increased resistance against the chemotherapeutic agents 5-Fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine (5-FUDR) and cisplatin. In summary, our findings emphasize the importance of c-REL signaling in a cellular model of cervical cancer with direct clinical implications for the development of new treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2739541514,"In 2015 meningococcal group W was declared endemic in the UK, with the meningococcal ACWY vaccination (MenACWY) subsequently introduced amongst adolescents and first-year university students. This study aimed to determine MenACWY uptake amongst students and to evaluate how this was influenced by demographics and via the Health Belief Model (HBM).This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a British university amongst first-year undergraduate students aged 18-25 years. Data collection was via an electronic questionnaire encompassing demographics, the HBM and vaccination status. Univariable analysis of the associations between demographics, health beliefs and vaccination was performed, followed by multiple logistic regression.401 participants were included in analysis. Vaccine uptake was 68.1%. Variables independently associated with vaccination upon multiple regression were age, gap-year, perceived effectiveness of the vaccine and knowledge about risk of meningitis. Compared to 18 year-olds, the odds of vaccination were reduced for 19 year-olds (aOR = 0.087, 95% CI = 0.010-0.729), 20 year-olds (aOR = 0.019, 95% CI = 0.002-0.161) and 21-25 year-olds (aOR = 0.003, 95% CI = <0.001-0.027). In contrast, taking a gap year (aOR = 2.939, 95% CI = 1.329-6.501), higher perceived vaccine effectiveness (aOR = 3.555, 95% CI = 1.787-7.073) and knowledge about meningitis risk (aOR = 2.481, 95% CI = 1.165-5.287) were independently associated with increased uptake.MenACWY uptake amongst students in this study and in other sources is above the national coverage for all adolescents (35.3%), indicating that this vaccination programme may be increasing health inequalities. Older students are less likely to become vaccinated due to differing vaccination policy in this age-group. In future, strategies that focus on specific student cohorts and that highlight vaccine effectiveness and the risk of meningitis should be considered. National evaluation of this vaccination programme is recommended to clarify its impact on health inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2953143617,"Interactions between microbes are central to the dynamics of microbial communities. Understanding these interactions is essential for the characterization of communities, yet challenging to accomplish in practice. There are limited available tools for characterizing diffusion-mediated, contact-independent microbial interactions. A practical and widely implemented technique in such characterization involves the simultaneous co-culture of distinct bacterial species and subsequent analysis of relative abundance in the total population. However, distinguishing between species can be logistically challenging. In this paper, we present a low-cost, vertical membrane, co-culture plate to quantify contact-independent interactions between distinct bacterial populations in co-culture via real-time optical density measurements. These measurements can be used to facilitate the analysis of the interaction between microbes that are physically separated by a semipermeable membrane yet able to exchange diffusible molecules. We show that diffusion across the membrane occurs at a sufficient rate to enable effective interaction between physically separate cultures. Two bacterial species commonly found in the cystic fibrotic lung, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia, were co-cultured to demonstrate how this plate may be implemented to study microbial interactions. We have demonstrated that this novel co-culture device is able to reliably generate real-time measurements of optical density data that can be used to characterize interactions between microbial species."
https://openalex.org/W2739670800,"Background To investigate the effect of a simplified prevention bundle with alcohol-based, dual hand hygiene (HH) audit on the incidence of early-onset ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP). Methods This 3-year, quasi-experimental study with interrupted time-series analysis was conducted in two cardiovascular surgery intensive care units in a medical center. Unaware external HH audit (eHH) performed by non-unit-based observers was a routine task before and after bundle implementation. Based on the realistic ICU settings, we implemented a 3-component bundle, which included: a compulsory education program, a knowing internal HH audit (iHH) performed by unit-based observers, and a standardized oral care (OC) protocol with 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate. The study periods comprised 4 phases: 12-month pre-implementation phase 1 (eHH+/education-/iHH-/OC-), 3-month run-in phase 2 (eHH+/education+/iHH+/OC+), 15-month implementation phase 3 (eHH+/education+/iHH+/OC+), and 6-month post-implementation phase 4 (eHH+/education-/iHH+/OC-). Results A total of 2553 ventilator-days were observed. VAP incidences (events/1000 ventilator days) in phase 1–4 were 39.1, 40.5, 15.9, and 20.4, respectively. VAP was significantly reduced by 59% in phase 3 (vs. phase 1, incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.41, P = 0.002), but rebounded in phase 4. Moreover, VAP incidence was inversely correlated to compliance of OC (r2 = 0.531, P = 0.001) and eHH (r2 = 0.878, P < 0.001), but not applied for iHH, despite iHH compliance was higher than eHH compliance during phase 2 to 4. Compared to eHH, iHH provided more efficient and faster improvements for standard HH practice. The minimal compliances required for significant VAP reduction were 85% and 75% for OC and eHH (both P < 0.05, IRR 0.28 and 0.42, respectively). Conclusions This simplified prevention bundle effectively reduces early-onset VAP incidence. An unaware HH compliance correlates with VAP incidence. A knowing HH audit provides better improvement in HH practice. Accordingly, we suggest dual HH audit and consistent bundle performance does matter in quality-of-care VAP prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2742152294,"Shigellosis or bacillary dysentery is an important cause of diarrhea, with the majority of the cases occurring in developing countries. Considering the high disease burden, increasing antibiotic resistance, serotype-specific immunity and the post-infectious sequelae associated with shigellosis, there is a pressing need of an effective vaccine against multiple serotypes of the pathogen. In the present study, we used bio-informatics approach to identify antigens shared among multiple serotypes of Shigella spp. This approach led to the identification of many immunogenic peptides. The five most promising peptides based on MHC binding efficiency were a putative lipoprotein (EL PGI I), a putative heat shock protein (EL PGI II), Spa32 (EL PGI III), IcsB (EL PGI IV) and a hypothetical protein (EL PGI V). These peptides were synthesized and the immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice by ELISA and cytokine assays. The putative heat shock protein (HSP) and the hypothetical protein elicited good humoral response, whereas putative lipoprotein, Spa32 and IcsB elicited good T-cell response as revealed by increased IFN-γ and TNF-α cytokine levels. The patient sera from confirmed cases of shigellosis were also evaluated for the presence of peptide specific antibodies with significant IgG and IgA antibodies against the HSP and the hypothetical protein, bestowing them as potential future vaccine candidates. The antigens reported in this study are novel and have not been tested as vaccine candidates against Shigella. This study offers time and cost-effective way of identifying unprecedented immunogenic antigens to be used as potential vaccine candidates. Moreover, this approach should easily be extendable to find new potential vaccine candidates for other pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2740317059,"Background SH2 domain containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP1) is an important modulator of innate and adaptive immunity. In mice, loss of SHIP1 provokes severe ileitis resembling Crohn’s disease (CD), as a result of deregulated immune responses, altered cytokine production and intestinal fibrosis. Recently, SHIP1 activity was shown to be correlated to the presence of a CD-associated single nucleotide polymorphism in ATG16L1. Here, we studied SHIP1 activity and expression in an adult cohort of CD patients. Methods SHIP1 activity, protein and mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CD patients in clinical remission were determined by Malachite green assay, Western blotting and qRT-PCR respectively. Genomic DNA was genotyped for ATG16L1 rs2241880. Results SHIP1 protein levels are profoundly diminished in a subset of patients; however, SHIP1 activity and expression are not correlated to ATG16L1 SNP status in this adult cohort. Conclusions Aberrant SHIP1 activity can contribute to disease in a subset of adult CD patients, and warrants further investigation."

We hypothesize that circulating levels of collagen deposition markers are elevated in patients with SRV remodeling and this elevation may have a predictive value. Methods We prospectively evaluated 56 patients with D-TGA after the atrial switch procedure (mean age 25.6 ± 4.8, range 18–37 years; 67% males). Serum levels of procollagen type III amino-terminal propeptide (PIIINP), collagen type I carboxy-terminal telopeptide (CITP), procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 1, MMP 9) and a tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP 1) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) were measured and compared with healthy controls. The relationship between these serum markers, echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance parameters and the outcome at a follow-up of 61 months (range, 24–85 months) was determined. Results Compared with the healthy control group, the study group had significantly higher levels of TIMP1, PIIINP, CITP, PINP and NT-pro-BNP (p<0.05, each). The levels of PIIINP and CITP were significantly higher among patients with an SRV mass index above the mean value. The level of PIIINP was significantly higher among patients with an SRV EDV index above the mean value. CITP was significantly elevated in SRV late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) positive patients, compared to patients without SRV LGE. MMP9 and TIMP1 predicted an adverse clinical outcome on univariate Cox proportional hazard survival analysis in addition to well proven predictors of outcome (SRV EF and NYHA). Conclusions We demonstrated a pattern of altered collagen turnover adversely related with the indices of SRV remodeling and an adverse clinical outcome in patients with SRV."
https://openalex.org/W2740160212,"For hares (Lepus spp., Leporidae, Lagomorpha, Mammalia) from Ethiopia no conclusive molecular phylogenetic data are available. To provide a first molecular phylogenetic model for the Abyssinian Hare (Lepus habessinicus), the Ethiopian Hare (L. fagani), and the Ethiopian Highland Hare (L. starcki) and their evolutionary relationships to hares from Africa, Eurasia, and North America, we phylogenetically analysed mitochondrial ATPase subunit 6 (ATP6; n = 153 / 416bp) and nuclear transferrin (TF; n = 155 / 434bp) sequences of phenotypically determined individuals. For the hares from Ethiopia, genotype composition at twelve microsatellite loci (n = 107) was used to explore both interspecific gene pool separation and levels of current hybridization, as has been observed in some other Lepus species. For phylogenetic analyses ATP6 and TF sequences of Lepus species from South and North Africa (L. capensis, L. saxatilis), the Anatolian peninsula and Europe (L. europaeus, L. timidus) were also produced and additional TF sequences of 18 Lepus species retrieved from GenBank were included as well. Median joining networks, neighbour joining, maximum likelihood analyses, as well as Bayesian inference resulted in similar models of evolution of the three species from Ethiopia for the ATP6 and TF sequences, respectively. The Ethiopian species are, however, not monophyletic, with signatures of contemporary uni- and bidirectional mitochondrial introgression and/ or shared ancestral polymorphism. Lepus habessinicus carries mtDNA distinct from South African L. capensis and North African L. capensis sensu lato; that finding is not in line with earlier suggestions of its conspecificity with L. capensis. Lepus starcki has mtDNA distinct from L. capensis and L. europaeus, which is not in line with earlier suggestions to include it either in L. capensis or L. europaeus. Lepus fagani shares mitochondrial haplotypes with the other two species from Ethiopia, despite its distinct phenotypic and microsatellite differences; moreover, it is not represented by a species-specific mitochondrial haplogroup, suggesting considerable mitochondrial capture by the other species from Ethiopia or species from other parts of Africa. Both mitochondrial and nuclear sequences indicate close phylogenetic relationships among all three Lepus species from Ethiopia, with L. fagani being surprisingly tightly connected to L. habessinicus. TF sequences suggest close evolutionary relationships between the three Ethiopian species and Cape hares from South and North Africa; they further suggest that hares from Ethiopia hold a position ancestral to many Eurasian and North American species."
https://openalex.org/W2740927147,"Pharmacoperones are small molecules that diffuse into cells and rescue misfolded, mistrafficked protein mutants, restoring their function. These substances act with high target specificity, serving as templates to fold (or refold) receptors, enzymes, ion channels or other proteins and enable them to pass the scrutiny of the cellular quality control system (“rescue”). In the present study we demonstrate that a rescued mutant (L83Q) of the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R), shows a strong bias for Gs coupling unlike the WT V2 receptor, which couples to both Gs and Gq/11. Failure of the mutant to couple to Gq/11 was not due to a limiting quantity of G-proteins since other Gq/11-coupled receptors (WT V2R, histamine receptor and muscarinic receptor) responded appropriately to their ligands. Transfection with DNA encoding Gq enabled the V2 receptor mutant to couple to this G protein, but only modestly compared with the WT receptor. Fourteen V2R mutant pharmacoperones, of multiple chemical classes, obtained from a high throughput screen of a 660,000 structure library, and one V2R peptidomimetic antagonist rescues L83Q. The rescued mutant shows similar bias with all pharmacoperones identified, suggesting that the bias is intrinsic to the mutant protein’s structure, rather than due to the chemical class of the pharmacoperone. In the case of V2R mutant Y128S, rescue with a pharmacoperone revealed constitutive activity, also with bias for Gs, although both IP and cAMP were produced in response to agonist. These results suggest that particular rescued receptor mutants show functional characteristics that differ from the WT receptor; a finding that may be important to consider as pharmacoperones are developed as therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2741301848,"The host immunophilin cyclophilin A (CypA) binds to the capsid protein (CA) of HIV-1 and regulates its infectivity. Depending on the target cell type, CypA can either promote or inhibit HIV-1 infection. The ability of CypA to promote HIV-1 infection has been extensively studied and linked to several steps in early replication including uncoating, reverse transcription and nuclear import. By contrast, the mechanism by which CypA inhibits infection is less well understood. We investigated the mechanism by which CypA potentiates restriction of HIV-1 by the tripartite motif-containing protein 5 (TRIM5α). Depletion of TRIM5α in the African green monkey cell line Vero, resulted in a loss of inhibition of infection by CypA, demonstrating that inhibition by CypA is mediated by TRIM5α. Complementary genetic and biochemical assays failed to demonstrate an ability of CypA to promote binding of TRIM5α to the viral capsid. TRIM5α inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcription in a proteasome-dependent manner; however, we observed that inhibition of proteasome activity did not reduce the ability of CypA to inhibit infection, suggesting that CypA acts at a step after reverse transcription. Accordingly, we observed a CypA-dependent reduction in the accumulation of nuclear HIV-1 DNA, indicating that CypA specifically promotes TRIM5α inhibition of HIV-1 nuclear import. We also observed that the ability of CypA to inhibit HIV-1 infection is abolished by amino acid substitutions within the conserved CPSF6-binding surface in CA. Our results indicate that CypA inhibits HIV-1 infection in Vero cells not by promoting TRIM5α binding to the capsid but by blocking nuclear import of the HIV-1 preintegration complex."
https://openalex.org/W2740689514,"Background Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia (ARVC/D) is an inherited cardiomyopathy mainly caused by heterozygous desmosomal gene mutations, the major gene being PKP2. The genetic cause remains unknown in ~50% of probands with routine desmosomal gene screening. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of whole exome sequencing (WES) in ARVC/D with negative genetic testing. Methods WES was performed in 22 patients, all without a mutation identified in desmosomal genes. Putative pathogenic variants were screened in 96 candidate genes associated with other cardiomyopathies/channelopathies. The sequencing coverage depth of PKP2, DSP, DSG2, DSC2, JUP and TMEM43 exons was compared to the mean coverage distribution to detect large insertions/deletions. All suspected deletions were verified by real-time qPCR, Multiplex-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification (MLPA) and cGH-Array. MLPA was performed in 50 additional gene-negative probands. Results Coverage-depth analysis from the 22 WES data identified two large heterozygous PKP2 deletions: one from exon 1 to 14 and one restricted to exon 4, confirmed by qPCR and MLPA. MLPA identified 2 additional PKP2 deletions (exon 1–7 and exon 1–14) in 50 additional probands confirming a significant frequency of large PKP2 deletions (5.7%) in gene-negative ARVC/D. Putative pathogenic heterozygous variants in EYA4, RBM20, PSEN1, and COX15 were identified in 4 unrelated probands. Conclusion A rather high frequency (5.7%) of large PKP2 deletions, undetectable by Sanger sequencing, was detected as the cause of ARVC/D. Coverage-depth analysis through next-generation sequencing appears accurate to detect large deletions at the same time than conventional putative mutations in desmosomal and cardiomyopathy-associated genes."

Termites are evolutionarily related to cockroaches, cohabitate in human dwellings, and represent an increasing pest problem in the United States. The Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus) is one of the most common species in the southern United States. Several assays were used to determine if C. formosanus termite proteins cross-react with cockroach allergens. Expressed sequence tag and genomic sequencing results were searched for homology to cockroach allergens using BLAST 2.2.21 software. Whole termite extracts were analyzed by mass-spectrometry, immunoassay with IgG and scFv antibodies to cockroach allergens, and human IgE from serum samples of cockroach allergic patients. Expressed sequence tag and genomic sequencing results indicate greater than 60% similarity between predicted termite proteins and German and American cockroach allergens, including Bla g 2/Per a 2, Bla g 3/Per a 3, Bla g 5, Bla g 6/Per a 6, Bla g 7/Per a 7, Bla g 8, Per a 9, and Per a 10. Peptides from whole termite extract were matched to those of the tropomyosin (Bla g 7), arginine kinase (Per a 9), and myosin (Bla g 8) cockroach allergens by mass-spectrometry. Immunoblot and ELISA testing revealed cross-reaction between several proteins with IgG and IgE antibodies to cockroach allergens. Several termite proteins, including the hemocyanin and tropomyosin orthologs of Blag 3 and Bla g 7, were shown to crossreact with cockroach allergens. This work presents support for the hypothesis that termite proteins may act as allergens and the findings could be applied to future allergen characterization, epitope analysis, and clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2741589216,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is believed to be irreversible although no component of the pathophysiology is irreversible. We show here with a network model that the apparent irreversibility is contributed by the structure of the network of inter-organ signalling. A network model comprising all known inter-organ signals in T2DM showed bi-stability with one insulin sensitive and one insulin resistant attractor. The bi-stability was made robust by multiple positive feedback loops suggesting an evolved allostatic system rather than a homeostatic system. In the absence of the complete network, impaired insulin signalling alone failed to give a stable insulin resistant or hyperglycemic state. The model made a number of correlational predictions many of which were validated by empirical data. The current treatment practice targeting obesity, insulin resistance, beta cell function and normalization of plasma glucose failed to reverse T2DM in the model. However certain behavioural and neuro-endocrine interventions ensured a reversal. These results suggest novel prevention and treatment approaches which need to be tested empirically."

Curiously, it ADP-ribosylates the DNA duplex, resulting in apoptosis of various cancer cells, which has raised interest in pierisin-1 as an anti-cancer agent. However, both the structure and the mechanism of DNA ADP-ribosylation are unclear. Here, we report the crystal structures of the N-terminal catalytic domain of pierisin-1, its complex with βNAD+, and the catalytic domain with the linker connecting it to the ricin B–like domains. We found that the catalytic domain possesses a defined, positively charged region on the molecular surface but that its overall structure is otherwise similar to those of protein-targeting ADP-ribosyltransferases.

Furthermore, the structure of the catalytic domain with the linker revealed an autoinhibitory mechanism in which the linker occupies and blocks both the βNAD+- and DNA-binding sites, suggesting that proteolytic cleavage to remove the linker is necessary for enzyme catalysis.

Some of these core structures and key residues are also conserved in poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases (3Hottiger M.O. Hassa P.O. Lüscher B. Schüler H. Koch-Nolte F.

Mutation analysis based on the 3D structure has also been used to clarify important residues for target recognition. The catalytic mechanisms of exotoxin A and ι toxin have also been proposed based on their crystal structures in complex with target proteins (4Jørgensen R. Merrill A.R. Yates S.P. Marquez V.E.

The enzyme is composed of 850 amino acid residues and consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain (amino acid residues 1–233) and a C-terminal ricin B–like HA33 domain (residues 267–850) (Fig. 1A) (11Watanabe M.

The N-terminal domain is homologous with ADP-ribosyltransferases of various bacterial toxins and transfers the ADP-ribose moiety of βNAD+ to an acceptor molecule to modulate the molecular function.

Unlike the protein ADP-ribosyltransferases mentioned above, pierisin-1 is a unique mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that targets DNA as the acceptor molecule, with the N-terminal catalytic domain transferring the ADP-ribose moiety to the N2 amino group of guanine (14Takamura-Enya T.

To understand the acceptor recognition and catalytic mechanisms of pierisin-1, we determined the crystal structures of the N-terminal catalytic domain of the enzyme with and without a linker (residues 234–267) (pierisin(1–267) and pierisin(1–233)) and βNAD+-bound pierisin(1–233) and demonstrate that pierisin-1 has a binding activity toward dsDNA, not ssDNA. We also identified the amino acid residues important for dsDNA binding by mutation analysis using EMSA. We demonstrate that the linker between the N- and C-terminal domains controls catalysis by regulating how βNAD+ and DNA access their binding sites. mosquitocidal toxin Protein Data Bank phosphate–nicotinamide loop ADP-ribosylating turn-turn loop 6-carboxyfluorescein Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. To understand the DNA-binding mechanism, the catalytic domain of pierisin-1, pierisin(1–233), and the catalytic domain with a linker between the catalytic and Ricin B–like domains, pierisin(1–267), were produced in Escherichia coli and subjected to X-ray crystallographic analyses. To reduce the cytotoxicity of pierisin-1, Glu165, a catalytic residue, was replaced with glutamine. We determined the crystal structures of pierisin(1–233)E165Q and pierisin(1–233)E165Q in complex with βNAD+ at 1.9 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively (form 1 crystal) (Table 1 and Fig. 1B (left and center)). We also determined those structures in another space group at 1.8 and 1.9 Å (form 2 crystal) (Table 1). The structures in two forms were essentially the same (supplemental Fig. S1), and the electron density around βNAD+ is clearer for form 1 than for form 2 (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, we treat the form 1 structure as the pierisin(1–233)E165Q. Pierisin(1–233)E165Q possesses two β-sheets (one consisting of β4, β6, and β7 and the other consisting of β3, β5, β8, β9, and β10) surrounded by six α-helices (Fig. 1B). β3 and β4 are twisted relative to each other by 90°. We define β3, β5, β4, and β7 across the two β-sheets as a core structure.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCrystal formPierisin(1–233)E165Q (form 1)Pierisin(1–233)E165Q + βNAD+ (form 1)Pierisin(1–233)E165Q (form 2)Pierisin(1–233)E165Q + βNAD+ (form 2)Pierisin(1–267)E165QData collection Space groupP3221P3221P43212P43212P21 Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)134.7, 134.7, 73.1134.7, 134.7, 73.193.4, 93.4, 120.693.4, 93.4, 120.652.1, 110.5, 133.6 α, β, γ °90, 90, 12090, 90, 12090, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 91.3, 90 No. of protein molecules/asu22224 X-ray sourcePF BL17APF BL17APF BL5APF BL17APF BL5A Wavelength (Å)1.00001.00001.00001.00001.0000 Resolution (Å)49.54 to 1.90 (1.94 to 1.90)45.67 to 2.10 (2.16 to 2.10)50.00 to 1.80 (1.86 to 1.80)43.52 to 1.90 (1.94 to 1.90)30.00 to 1.80 (1.83 to 1.80) No. of observations726,225479,548223,980552,439496,050 No. of unique reflections60,37745,13447,58642,294132,652 Redundancy12.0 (11.7)10.6 (9.0)4.7 (2.2)13.1 (10.8)3.7 (2.2) Rmerge (%)aRmerge = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) − 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the ith measurement.6.3 (35.6)13.1 (35.0)7.7 (40.9)8.7 (71.2)7.1 (53.0) Rpim (%)bRpim = Σh(1/(N(h) − 1))½ Σi|Ii(h) − 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣiIi(h).1.9 (11.3)4.1 (12.4)2.4 (20.2)2.5 (27.2)4.5 (41.8) CC½cCC½ = Σ(x − 〈x〉)(y − 〈y〉)/(Σ(x − 〈x〉)2Σ(y − 〈y〉)2)½.0.999 (0.996)0.995 (0.958)0.998 (0.864)0.999 (0.826)0.996 (0.664) Completeness99.999.695.098.994.9 〈I/σ(I)〉26.5 (6.8)13.5 (5.4)16.7 (1.7)20.9 (1.9)9.6 (1.2)Refinement RworkdRwork is the crystallographic R-factor (Rcryst) for the working set used for the refinement.

Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D,.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) demonstrates that pierisin(1–233)E165Q is similar to mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases, such as MTX (PDB code 2VSE), cholera toxin (PDB code 2A5D), heat-labile enterotoxin IIB (PDB code 1TII), and pertussis toxin (PDB code 1BCP) with Z scores of 25.7, 11.5, 10.8, and 9.3, respectively, and less similar to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1; PDB code 4HHZ) with a Z score of 4.0. From a large number of biochemical and crystallographic studies of mono- and poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases, the core structure, important motifs, and key residues have been identified (2Holbourn K.P.

Of these, the core structure is conserved among all ADP-ribosyltransferases. Particularly in the R-S-E type of ADP-ribosyltransferases, an Arg residue, a Ser-Thr-Ser (STS) motif, and a Gln- or Glu-X-Glu ((Q/E)XE) motif play crucial roles in βNAD+ binding and catalysis and are conserved (3Hottiger M.O.

As shown in Fig. 1C, an Arg residue (Arg70), STS motif (Ser114-Thr115-Thr116), and (Q/E)XE motif (Gln163 and Glu165) are located on β3, β4, and a loop, termed the ADP-ribosylating turn-turn loop (ARTT loop) (27Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. Crystal structure and novel recognition motif of Rho ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum: structural insights for recognition specificity and catalysis.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which precedes β7, respectively. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain with a linker region (pierisin(1–267)E165Q) was also determined (Table 1 and Fig. 1B (right)) at 1.8 Å resolution. The crystal of pierisin(1–267)E165Q and the form 1 and 2 crystals of pierisin(1–233)E165Q contain four and two molecules in the asymmetric unit, respectively. The structures in each asymmetric unit were essentially the same, with a root mean square deviation of 1.1 Å, with the exception of a portion of the phosphate–nicotinamide loop (PN loop; Lys117–Gly135) (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, no substantial structural difference was observed between pierisin(1–233)E165Q, βNAD+-bound pierisin(1–233)E165Q, and pierisin (1–267)E165Q, indicating that neither βNAD+ binding nor the presence of the linker affects the structure of the catalytic domain. The binding of βNAD+ induced no significant change around the βNAD+ binding pocket as described above. The interaction between pierisin(1–233)E165Q and βNAD+ is shown in Fig. 2. The nicotinamide moiety of βNAD+ is buried deep in the βNAD+ binding pocket, which is formed by the STS motif (residues 114–116), the main chain of Trp71, and the side chains of Arg70, Trp127, Gln163, and Gln165. In the absence of βNAD+, this pocket was occupied by water molecules and an ethylene glycol molecule used for cryoprotection in X-ray diffraction experiments at 100 K (supplemental Fig. S3A). The carboxyamide group of the nicotinamide moiety is recognized by backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Trp71. The 2′-OH group of the nicotinamide ribose moiety is bound to the side chain of Gln165, which replaces the catalytic Glu165, through a hydrogen bond. The two phosphate groups are bound to the guanidinium group of Arg70 by ionic interactions and also to the OH group of Ser114 in the STS motif by hydrogen bonds. The 2′-OH group of adenine ribose contacts the carboxyl group of Asp72 by van der Waals interactions. The adenine moiety of βNAD+ interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg74 via π-π stacking, and the NH2 group of the adenine moiety (AN6) is bound to the main chain of Val85 by a hydrogen bond. Many interactions observed between pierisin-1 and βNAD+ are conserved in cholera toxin (28O'Neal C.J. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP.Science. 2005; 309: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). However, the hydrogen bond network mediated through water molecules is different in pierisin-1 and cholera toxin. We studied the interaction between pierisin-1 and DNA by EMSA. EMSA with pierisin(1–233)E165Q and dsDNA shows a clearly shifted band, but this is not the case with ssDNA (Fig. 3A), indicating that the binding affinity for ssDNA is much lower than that for dsDNA. This result is compatible with the fact that pierisin-1 and -2 prefer dsDNA to ssDNA as a substrate (14Takamura-Enya T. Watanabe M. Totsuka Y. Kanazawa T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of 2′-deoxyguanosine residue in DNA by an apoptosis-inducing protein, pierisin-1, from cabbage butterfly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochem. 2004; 135: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, pierisin(1–267)E165Q has no binding activity toward dsDNA with or without βNAD+, whereas pierisin(1–233)E165Q does bind (Fig. 3B). This indicates that the linker region (residues 234–267) inhibits dsDNA binding. To identify the dsDNA-binding region, a series of pierisin(1–233)E165Q mutants were prepared and then subjected to EMSA to test dsDNA-binding activity. Probable candidates for mutation are positively charged residues on the molecular surface. The electrostatic surface potential of pierisin(1–233)E165Q shows a characteristic positively charged surface suitable for dsDNA binding (Fig. 4A). Another candidate is the ARTT loop that has been identified as a substrate binding site for a protein-targeting mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (30Han S. Tainer J.A. The ARTT motif and a unified structural understanding of substrate recognition in ADP-ribosylating bacterial toxins and eukaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferases.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Likewise, an area around the βNAD+ binding pocket is also a candidate dsDNA-binding site. These candidate amino acids are mapped onto Fig. 4B. Lys117, Arg120, Lys122, Lys123, and Lys124 are positioned in the PN loop, and Arg181 and Arg187 are components of a basic surface identified by electrostatic surface potential calculation. Trp160 is located in the ARTT loop. Arg73, His108, Trp127, Arg130, and Arg134 are positioned around the βNAD+ binding pocket, with Arg73, Arg130, and Arg134 forming a basic knob. SDS-PAGE of these mutant preparations gave single bands, indicating that the preparations are homogeneous (supplemental Fig. S4). The results of the mutagenesis demonstrated that DNA-binding activity was slightly reduced by the mutations R120S, W127A, and R187A but not significantly reduced by R73A, H108A, K117A, R130A, R134A, and W160A (Fig. 4C). A single mutation of R181A considerably reduced the DNA-binding activity, and double mutagenesis of R181A and R187A completely abolished the binding activity. Furthermore, triple mutation of K122N, K123N, and K124N also completely abolished the DNA-binding activity (Fig. 4C). However, among single mutations of K122A, K123A, and K124A, K122A and K124A significantly reduced the DNA binding activity, whereas K123A did not measurably affect it (Fig. 4C, bottom). In addition, these three Lys residues in the loop are conserved among the group of all six pierisin members as described below (supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting a contribution of Lys123 to the DNA binding. Taken together, these results indicated that the two residues Lys122 and Lys124, and probably Lys123 on the PN loop and Arg181 and Arg187 on a basic cleft near the PN loop, are required for dsDNA binding. Thus, pierisin-1 binds dsDNA via electrostatic interactions. This is also supported by a gel filtration chromatography analysis of the pierisin-1 interacting with dsDNA (supplemental Fig. S6). Under high-salt conditions, pierisin(1–233)E165Q and dsDNA elute separately, and an elution peak for a complex between pierisin(1–233)E165Q and dsDNA is not observed. In contrast, in low-salt conditions, pierisin(1–233)E165Q and dsDNA associate and elute as a single complex. Mutational analysis of DNA binding of pierisin(1–233)E165Q and its derivatives (DNA-binding mutants) revealed the amino acid residues responsible for DNA binding. However, what effect they have on the DNA ADP-ribosylating activity was not examined because they lack the DNA"

Human LKB1 rescues the functions of Drosophila Lkb1 essential for viability, but these males are sterile, revealing a new function for this genes in fly. We also identified a testis-specific transcript generated by an alternative promoter and that only differs by a longer 5’UTR. We show that dLKB1 is required in the germline for the formation of the actin cone, the polarized structure that allows spermatid individualization and cytoplasm excess extrusion during spermiogenesis. Three of the nine LKB1 classical targets in the Drosophila genome (AMPK, NUAK and KP78b) are required for proper spermiogenesis, but later than dLKB1. dLkb1 mutant phenotype is reminiscent of that of myosin V mutants, and both proteins show a dynamic localization profile before actin cone formation. Together, these data highlight a new dLKB1 function and suggest that dLKB1 posttranscriptional regulation in testis and involvement in spermatid morphogenesis are evolutionarily conserved features."
https://openalex.org/W2739954053,"Background We performed a systematic screening of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues to investigate whether mismatch repair (MMR) status and ERCC1 protein expression could be predictive of clinical outcomes for these patients following the recommendation of The Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice of Prevention (EGAPP). Methods The expression of four MMR genes and ERCC1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) from cancer tissue samples of 2233 consecutive CRC patients. Results We observed that most CRC patients with a proficient MMR (pMMR) status tended to have simultaneous ERCC1 protein expression (P< 0.001). Stage III CRC patients with deficient MMR (dMMR) had higher prognoses than the same stage patients with pMMR (DFS: 74% vs 65%, P = 0.04; OS: 79% vs 69%, P = 0.04). Here, dMMR is also associated with poorer survival for stage II patients after chemotherapy (DFS: 66% vs 78%, P = 0.04). Stage II and III patients that were shown to express ERCC1 protein had higher DFS and OS than those that were deficient in expression (stage II, DFS: 83% vs 70%, P = 0.006; OS 85% vs 73%, P = 0.02. Stage III, DFS: 67% vs56%, P = 0.03; OS: 71% vs 57%, P = 0.04). Conclusions Our results indicate that dMMR appeared to predictive of a survival benefit for stage III CRC patients. We also found the determination of ERCC1 expression to be useful for predicting DFS or OS for stage II and III CRC patients. In addition, the expression of MMR genes and ERCC1 showed a significant relationship."

Accumulation of NO may cause cytotoxic effects. The response to this nitrosative (NO-triggered) stress is controlled by the Crp/Fnr-type transcriptional regulator DnrF. We analyzed the response to NO and the mechanism of NO sensing by the DnrF regulator. Using reporter gene fusions and transcriptomics, here we report that DnrF selectively repressed nitrate reductase (nap) genes, preventing further NO formation. In addition, DnrF induced the expression of the NO reductase genes (norCB), which promote NO consumption. We used UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy to characterize heme binding to DnrF and subsequent NO coordination. DnrF detects NO via its bound heme cofactor. We found that the dimeric DnrF bound one molecule of heme per subunit. Purified recombinant apo-DnrF bound its target promoter sequences (napD, nosR2, norC, hemA, and dnrE) in electromobility shift assays, and we identified a specific palindromic DNA-binding site 5′-TTGATN4ATCAA-3′ in these target sequences via mutagenesis studies. Most importantly, successive addition of heme as well as heme and NO to purified recombinant apo-DnrF protein increased affinity of the holo-DnrF for its specific binding motif in the napD promoter.

Many microorganisms can replace oxygen as terminal electron acceptor with nitrate during electron transport-dependent ATP generation. Several modes of the corresponding nitrate respiration are known. During the ecologically central process of denitrification, nitrate (NO3−) is reduced via nitrite (NO2−), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to molecular nitrogen (N2) (1Zumft W.G. Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar). The intermediate nitric oxide is cytotoxic by accumulation. As a consequence, the transition process from oxygen respiration to denitrification is tightly controlled. Many bacteria utilize so-called Crp (cAMP receptor protein)/Fnr (fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator) superfamily regulators for this purpose. This highly flexible group of transcription factors shares a low overall amino acid sequence identity (2Körner H. Sofia H.J. Zumft W.G. Phylogeny of the bacterial superfamily of Crp-Fnr transcription regulators: exploiting the metabolic spectrum by controlling alternative gene programs.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 559-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, they all contain a C-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and an N-terminal sensory domain formed by multiple antiparallel β-strands that are connected by a long dimerization helix (2Körner H.

Binding sites upstream of or even overlapping with the −35 region of a standard bacterial promoter lead to transcriptional activation. Binding sites overlapping with or downstream of the −10 region are usually mediating gene repression (2Körner H. Sofia H.J. Zumft W.G.

One prominent example of Crp/Fnr regulators is the global transcription factor Fnr of Escherichia coli forming together with the homologous proteins Anr, FnrA, FnrL, and FnrP, a major subgroup of Crp/Fnr regulators. All of them sense oxygen via an oxygen-labile [4Fe-4S] cluster (5Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Functional versatility in the CRP-FNR superfamily of transcription factors: FNR and FLP.Adv. Microb.

This subgroup possesses four conserved cysteine residues at the N or C terminus for ligation of the oxygen and NO-sensitive iron–sulfur clusters (6Green J. Guest J.R.

NsrR of Bacillus subtilis, another Fe-S cluster-containing regulator, plays a major role in NO detoxification (12Yukl E.T. Elbaz M.A. Nakano M.M. Moënne-Loccoz P. Transcription factor NsrR from Bacillus subtilis senses nitric oxide with a 4Fe-4S cluster.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13084-13092Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NsrR with intact Fe-S cluster represses hmp gene expression under anaerobic conditions (13Nakano M.M. Geng H. Nakano S. Kobayashi K. The nitric oxide-responsive regulator NsrR controls ResDE-dependent gene expression.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The hmp gene, encoding a flavohemoglobin, plays a central role in B. subtilis for the response to nitrosative stress (14Nakano M.M.

Nitric oxide signaling and transcriptional control of denitrification genes in Pseudomonas stutzeri.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2516-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Dnr regulators are lacking the conserved cysteine residues of Fnr involved in iron–sulfur cluster ligation.

Redox Signal. 2012; 17: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In response to the binding of the effector molecule NO, a conformational change of heme-bound Dnr was proposed, which results in efficient DNA binding (24Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Johnson K.A.

An initial EMSA study showed DNA binding solely for the P. aeruginosa Dnr with bound heme, whereas apo-Dnr failed to bind the nirS promoter sequence (24Giardina G. Rinaldo S. Johnson K.A.

Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a Texas Red-labeled nor promoter fragment bound to P. aeruginosa holo-Dnr revealed DNA binding with a KD of 44 ± 9 nm only in the presence of NO. Holo-Dnr without bound NO and the CO-bound form of the regulator failed to bind the promoter, even if the regulator is provided in a 50-fold excess over the DNA (21Lobato L. Bouzhir-Sima L.

In P. aeruginosa the binding sites for Dnr and the Fnr analogue Anr can optically not be distinguished (27Rompf A. Hungerer C. Hoffmann T. Lindenmeyer M. Römling U. Gross U. Doss M.O. Arai H. Igarashi Y. Jahn D. Regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa hemF and hemN by the dual action of the redox response regulators Anr and Dnr.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both regulators recognize the palindromic sequence TTGATN4ATCAA. However, clear-cut Anr, Dnr, and Anr + Dnr (both regulators regulate the same gene via one binding site) regulons can be defined using transcriptomics (19Trunk K. Benkert B. Quäck N. Münch R. Scheer M. Garbe J. Jänsch L. Trost M. Wehland J. Buer J. Jahn M. Schobert M. Jahn D. Anaerobic adaptation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: definition of the Anr and Dnr regulons.Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 12: 1719-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying promoter specificity and transcriptional activation by Dnr after binding to the promoter remains to be determined. The marine bacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12T (DSM 16493), as one representative of the highly abundant Roseobacter group of marine bacteria, possesses a fine-tuned hierarchical network for the adaptation to anaerobic conditions (28Ebert M. Laass S. Thürmer A. Roselius L. Eckweiler D. Daniel R. Härtig E. Jahn D. FnrL and three Dnr regulators are used for the metabolic adaptation to low oxygen tension in Dinoroseobacter shibae.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One FnrL and three Dnr regulators (DnrD, DnrE, and DnrF) mediate the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions by activating denitrification genes in the presence of nitrate (28Ebert M. Laass S. Thürmer A. Roselius L. Eckweiler D. Daniel R. Härtig E. Jahn D. FnrL and three Dnr regulators are used for the metabolic adaptation to low oxygen tension in Dinoroseobacter shibae.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In D. shibae nitrate gets reduced to nitrite using a periplasmic dissimilatory nitrate reductase (nap-type), a periplasmic cd1-type nitrite reductase (NirS), a membrane-localized NO reductase (NorCB), and a periplasmic N2O reductase (NosZ) (29Wagner-Döbler I. Ballhausen B. Berger M. Brinkhoff T. Buchholz I. Bunk B. Cypionka H. Daniel R. Drepper T. Gerdts G. Hahnke S. Han C. Jahn D. Kalhoefer D. Kiss H. et al.The complete genome sequence of the algal symbiont Dinoroseobacter shibae: a hitchhiker's guide to life in the sea.ISME J. 2010; 4: 61-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes as well as corresponding maturation and regulatory proteins are encoded in a large denitrification gene cluster. In a previous study, we determined the role of FnrL and the three Dnr regulators (DnrD, DnrE, and DnrF) for their response to anaerobiosis in the presence of nitrate (28Ebert M. Laass S. Thürmer A. Roselius L. Eckweiler D. Daniel R. Härtig E. Jahn D. FnrL and three Dnr regulators are used for the metabolic adaptation to low oxygen tension in Dinoroseobacter shibae.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). FnrL and DnrD were identified as key players for the regulation of the transition process. Here, we investigated the regulatory function of DnrF. Because the toxic gas NO is produced during denitrification and released, the organism requires a fast and effective stress response. It must include detection of NO and a subsequent gene regulatory scenario that leads to a stop of NO production and enhances NO consumption. DnrF was identified as the NO stress regulator of D. shibae, where NO is detected via a bound heme. Repression of the nitrate reductase genes by DnrF prevented further NO production, although the parallel induction of the NO reductase genes ensures the consumption of the harmful N-oxide. During the process of denitrification, several dangerous N-oxides, including NO, are generated as intermediates. From previous experiments we knew that the nirS gene, encoding the enzyme nitrite reductase, responsible for NO generation, is controlled by NO. To determine the role of sublethal NO concentrations as signal for gene expression in D. shibae, we grew the wild-type strain DFL12T harboring a nirS-lacZ reporter gene fusion under aerobic conditions until an optical density at 578 nm of 0.5 was reached. Subsequently, the cells were shifted to anaerobic conditions. Depletion of oxygen was determined using a PreSense Fibox 3 trace assay in combination with a PSt3-type oxygen sensor (detection limit 15 ppb dissolved oxygen, 0–100% oxygen). When all oxygen was consumed by the culture, we added NO-saturated water to final NO concentrations of 50, 1000, 10,000, and 70,000 nm and monitored growth and β-galactosidase activities from the nirS-lacZ fusion after 15, 30, and 60 min (Fig. 1). These highly different NO concentrations were used because in the literature quite diverse NO concentrations were employed to study NO-dependent transcriptional changes. In P. stutzeri 50 nm NO caused an inducing effect on nirS gene expression. In contrast, in P. aeruginosa 10,000 nm were used to induce norC-lacZ reporter gene expression (20Vollack K.-U. Zumft W.G.

The transcription factor DNR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa specifically requires nitric oxide and haem for the activation of a target promoter in Escherichia coli.Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and in Gram-positive organisms like B. subtilis survival of 50,000 nm NO can be observed (31Moore C.M. Nakano M.M. Wang T. Ye R.W. Helmann J.D. Response of Bacillus subtilis to nitric oxide and the nitrosating agent sodium nitroprusside.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4655-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After shifting the cells to gas tide serum flasks, oxygen consumption occurred within 15 min. Because of the loss of an electron acceptor, growth stopped after the anaerobic shift indicating a major metabolic crisis for D. shibae (32Laass S. Kleist S. Bill N. Drüppel K. Kossmehl S. Wöhlbrand L. Rabus R. Klein J. Rohde M. Bartsch A. Wittmann C. Schmidt-Hohagen K. Tielen P. Jahn D. Schomburg D.

Chem. 2014; 289: 13219-13231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After addition of 50, 1000, and 10,000 nm NO, a slight decrease in optical density was recorded, but after that the cell density remained stable. However, 70,000 nm NO leads to a significant drop in cell density indicating cell death and cell lysis (Fig. 1A). For β-galactosidase assays, samples were taken 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after the addition of indicated NO concentrations (Fig. 1B). At time point 0, background levels of 4–6 Miller units were measured for all cultures. Without addition of NO, β-galactosidase activity increased up to 9 Miller units after 15 min, 69 Miller units after 30 min, and 79 Miller units after 60 min (Fig. 1B). This NO-independent increase of nirS-lacZ expression is due to an anaerobic induction mediated by FnrL (28Ebert M. Laass S. Thürmer A. Roselius L. Eckweiler D. Daniel R. Härtig E. Jahn D. FnrL and three Dnr regulators are used for the metabolic adaptation to low oxygen tension in Dinoroseobacter shibae.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Addition of 50 nm NO led to β-galactosidase activities of 16 Miller units after 15 min, 93 Miller units after 30 min, and 119 Miller units after 60 min. The presence of 50 nm NO increased the nirS-lacZ reporter gene expression by a factor of 1.5. Addition of 1000 or 10,000 nm resulted in β-galactosidase activities comparable with the untreated anaerobic culture. The NO concentration of 70,000 nm led to a loss in activity presumably caused by the cell death generated by the toxic effect of NO. Thus, 50 nm was identified as the NO concentration with best gene-inducing effect without severe toxic effects at the same time. The anaerobic NO-dependent global gene expression was investigated by DNA arrays comparing transcripts from D. shibae wild-type cells grown anaerobically in the presence and absence of 50 nm NO. For this purpose, shift experiments as outlined above were performed using a final concentration of 50 nm NO. RNA samples were collected 30 min after the anaerobic shift and 30 min after the addition of NO. A differential gene expression was assumed for genes with log2 fold changes higher or equal to 0.8. Overall, five genes were found induced and 10 repressed by the presence of NO (supplemental Table S1). The denitrification gene cluster appeared to be the major target for NO-dependent gene expression. Genes significantly up-regulated after NO treatment were nirH and nirG as part of the nir operon encoding proteins for the maturation of the nitrite reductase, and norC encoding the small subunit of the nitric-oxide reductase. Moreover, the dnrE gene encoding the transcription factor DnrE was induced (supplemental Table S1). To determine the role of the DnrF regulator in mediating NO-dependent regulation, its regulon was defined by comparing the transcriptome of the wild-type strain with the corresponding mutant strain DS004 (ΔdnrF). A large NO-dependent regulon was found for DnrF with 365 induced and 199 repressed genes compared with wild type, indicating a major regulatory function of DnrF (supplemental Table S2). The comparison of the NO-mediated response of the wild-type strain and the DnrF regulon using a heat map analysis revealed significant overlap in the regulation of the denitrification gene cluster (Fig. 2). The napDAGHBC operon, encoding the dissimilatory periplasmic nitrate reductase, was found to be repressed by DnrF, which was indicated by the increased transcription in the ΔdnrF mutant strain compared with the wild type (Fig. 2). This finding is in accordance with previous observations (28Ebert M. Laass S. Thürmer A. Roselius L. Eckweiler D. Daniel R. Härtig E. Jahn D. FnrL and three Dnr regulators are used for the metabolic adaptation to low oxygen tension in Dinoroseobacter shibae.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This repression is mediated via the palindromic sequence 5′-TTGATN4ATCAA-3′, which is located 96.5 bp upstream of the napD translational start site (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, a DnrF-dependent activation was found for the nirSECFDGHJN operon, indicated by a reduced transcription in the ΔdnrF mutant strain compared with the wild type (Fig. 2). Interestingly, only nirG and nirH exhibited a significant alteration in gene expression but lacked an assignable regulator-binding site. Moreover, a significant activation was found for the norC/B genes encoding nitric-oxide reductase. A corresponding potential DnrF regulator-binding site was found 67.5 bp upstream of the translational start site (Fig. 2). However, no significant alteration in transcription of the nosRZDFYLX operon dependent on DnrF was found after NO treatment. Overall, the observed regulatory scenario with an NO-dependent repression of the NO-producing system (nitrate reductase Nap) and an induction of the NO-consuming enzyme (NO reductase NorCB) finally identifies DnrF as NO stress regulator of D. shibae.Figure 5Identification of the DnrF-binding site in the napD promoter. A, EMSAs were performed to characterize DnrF binding to the napD promoter. A 75-bp DIG-labeled DNA fragment corresponding to the napD promoter sequences from position −135 to −60 with respect to the translational start of napD containing the potential DnrF-binding site 5′-TTGATN4ATCAA-3 was incubated without (lane 1) or with 4 nm purified DnrF protein for complex formation (lanes 2–9). (+) indicates the use of the 75-bp napDmu promoter fragment containing a mutated DnrF-binding site 5′-GCGATN4ATCGC-3′ (lane 3). The addition of the identical non-labeled DNA in concentrations of 10-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess reduced the binding of DnrF to the labeled DNA drastically (lanes 4–6). DnrF binding remained almost unchanged once the identical molar excess of the unlabeled 75-bp napDmu promoter fragment containing base exchanges in the DnrF-binding motif at position −103/−102 from TT to GC and at position −91/−90 from AA to GC was added (lanes 7–9). B, DNA sequence of the napD promoter cloned upstream of the lacZ reporter gene. The potential DnrF-binding site is underlined. Base exchanges for the napDmu sequence are given above the sequence. The ribosome-binding site (RBS) is indicated, and the start codon is given in bold letters. Numbers indicate the position relative to the translational start site. C, DnrF function was monitored in vivo by the expression of a napD-lacZ reporter gene fusion containing napD promoter sequences from −145 to +20 with respect to the translational start site. β-Galactosidase activities were determined under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions in the D. shibae wild-type (white bars) and the ΔdnrF mutant strain (gray bars). Corresponding β-galactosidase activities are given in Miller units. Results represent the average of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Error bars indicate the standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because several of the observed DnrF-regulated genes might also be regulated by the DnrD regulator, the corresponding mutant strain (DS002 (ΔdnrD)) was analyzed under NO-inducing conditions, and genes of overlapping regulons were defined. The NO-dependent DnrD regulon consists of 17 genes and is given in supplemental Table S1. In total, 22 genes belong to the overlapping regulon of DnrD and DnrF (supplemental Table S1). Thus, a specific DnrF regulon was determined, which is composed of a total of 80 genes. Because not all genes exhibit a potential DnrF-binding site, a significant portion of indirect regulatory scenarios can be deduced from the DnrF-dependent repression of various transcriptional regulator genes like zntR, an ATP-dependent transcriptional regulator (Dshi_1881) and an XRE family transcriptional regulator (Dshi_2488), which exhibited a potential DnrF-binding site in their promoter sequences. However, most potential DnrF-binding sites were mainly found in promoters of genes of unknown function (Dshi_0391, Dshi_0625, Dshi_2048, Dshi_2148, and Dshi_3542). Furthermore, a striking influence of DnrF on numerous genes encoding transport systems was observed. A direct activation of an S-adenosylmethionine uptake transporter (Dshi_2148), a sulfite exporter tauE/safE (Dshi_0205), sugar transporter systems (Dshi_0488/Dshi_1808), a periplasmic dicarboxylate transporter (dctQ/dctM), and cation/H+ antiporter (mnhC/mnhG) were found. However, significant repression by DnrF was found for the"

The molecular components of tTJs include tricellulin (TRIC) and lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) which recruits TRIC, are required for normal hearing. Although loss of TRIC causes hearing loss with degeneration of cochlear cells, the detailed mechanisms remains unclear. In the present study, by using temperature-sensitive mouse cochlear cells, US/VOT-E36 cell line, we investigated the changes of TRIC and LSR during cochlear cell differentiation and the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors against cell degeneration induced by loss of TRIC and LSR. During cell differentiation induced by the temperature change, expression of TRIC and LSR were clearly induced. Treatment with metformin enhanced expression TRIC and LSR via AMPK during cell differentiation. Loss of TRIC and LSR by the siRNAs induced cell death in differentiated cells. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A and HDAC6 inhibitor prevented the cell death induced by loss of TRIC and LSR. Collectively, these findings suggest that both tTJ proteins TRIC and LSR have crucial roles for the differentiated cochlear cell survival, and that HDAC inhibitors may be potential therapeutic agents to prevent hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W2741114681,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a potent gluco-incretin hormone, which plays a central role on pancreatic beta cell proliferation, survival and insulin secreting activity and whose analogs are used for treating hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Notably, abnormal insulin signaling affects all the above-mentioned aspects on pancreatic beta cells. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the protective effects of GLP1-1 on beta cells are affected by altered insulin receptor signaling. To this end, several effects of GLP-1 were studied in INS-1E rat beta cells transfected either with an inhibitor of insulin receptor function (i.e., the Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase Phosphodiesterase 1, ENPP1), or with insulin receptor small interfering RNA, as well as in control cells. Crucial experiments were carried out also in a second cell line, namely the βTC-1 mouse beta cells. Our data indicate that in insulin secreting beta cells in which either ENPP1 was up-regulated or insulin receptor was down-regulated, GLP-1 positive effects on several pancreatic beta cell activities, including glucose-induced insulin secretion, cell proliferation and cell survival, were strongly reduced. Further studies are needed to understand whether such a scenario occurs also in humans and, if so, if it plays a role of clinical relevance in diabetic patients with poor responsiveness to GLP-1 related treatments."

Determining the metabolic processes performed by microbial communities is crucial for understanding and managing ecosystem properties. Metagenomic approaches allow the elucidation of the main metabolic processes that determine the performance of microbial communities under different environmental conditions and perturbations. Here we present the first compartmentalized metabolic reconstruction at a metagenomics scale of a microbial ecosystem. This systematic approach conceives a meta-organism without boundaries between individual organisms and allows the in silico evaluation of the effect of agricultural intervention on soils at a metagenomics level. To characterize the microbial ecosystems, topological properties, taxonomic and metabolic profiles, as well as a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) were considered. Furthermore, topological and optimization algorithms were implemented to carry out the curation of the models, to ensure the continuity of the fluxes between the metabolic pathways, and to confirm the metabolite exchange between subcellular compartments. The proposed models provide specific information about ecosystems that are generally overlooked in non-compartmentalized or non-curated networks, like the influence of transport reactions in the metabolic processes, especially the important effect on mitochondrial processes, as well as provide more accurate results of the fluxes used to optimize the metabolic processes within the microbial community."

To document visual loss in a setting where laser treatment is not available. Methods Subjects from a cohort sampled from a hospital-based, primary-care diabetes clinic in 2007 were traced in 2012. Laser treatment was not available. Modified Wisconsin grading of retinopathy was performed using slit lamp biomicroscopy by a single ophthalmologist in 2007 and using four-field mydriatic fundus photographs at an accredited reading centre in 2012. Visual acuity was measured by Snellen chart in 2007 and by ‘Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study’ chart in 2012. HbA1c, blood pressure, HIV status, urine albumin–creatinine ratio, haemoglobin and lipids were measured. Results Of 281 subjects recruited in 2007, 135 (48%) were traced and assessed, 15 were confirmed dead. At follow-up (median 5.3 years) ≥2 step retinopathy progression was observed in 48 subjects (36.4%; 95% CI 28.2–44.6). Incidence of sight threatening diabetic retinopathy for those with level 10 (no retinopathy) and level 20 (background) retinopathy at baseline, was 19.4% (11.3–27.4) and 81.3% (62.1–100), respectively. In multivariate analysis 2 step progression was associated with HbA1c (OR 1.2495%CI 1.04–1.48), and haemoglobin level (0.77, 0.62–0.98). 25 subjects (18.8%) lost ≥5 letters, 7 (5.3%) lost ≥15 letters. Conclusions Progression to sight threatening diabetic retinopathy from no retinopathy and background retinopathy was approximately 5 and 3 times that reported in recent European studies, respectively. Incidence of visual loss was high in a location where treatment was not available."
https://openalex.org/W2741570072,"Background Esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) is one of the high mortality complications in cirrhotic patients. Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is currently the standard therapy for EVH. However, some patients have expired during hospitalization or survived shortly after management. Aim To evaluate hospital and 6-week mortality by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA) score compared to a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) class. Methods We retrospectively collected 714 cirrhotic patients with EVH post EVL between July 2010 and June 2016 at Taitung MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. CLIF-SOFA score, MELD score, and CTP class were calculated for all patients admitted. Results Among the 714 patients, the overall hospital and 6-week mortality rates were 6.9% (49/715) and 13.1% (94/715) respectively. For predicting hospital death, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of CLIF-SOFA score, MELD score, and CTP class were 0.964, 0.876, and 0.846. For predicting 6-week death, AUROC values of CLIF-SOFA score, MELD score, and CTP class were 0.943, 0.817, and 0.834. CLIF-SOFA score had higher AUROC value with statistical significance under pairwise comparison than did MELD score and CTP class in prediction of not only hospital but also 6-week mortality. The history of hepatocellular carcinoma was the risk factor for 6-week mortality. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma the cut-point of CLIF-SOFA score was 5.5 for 6-week mortality and 6.5 for hospital mortality on admission. For patients without hepatocellular carcinoma, the cut-point of CLIF-SOFA score was 6.5 for both 6-week and hospital mortality. Conclusion CLIF-SOFA score predicted post-EVL prognosis well. For patients without hepatocellular carcinoma, CLIF-SOFA score ≥6 suggests higher 6-week mortality and CLIF-SOFA score ≥7 suggests higher hospital mortality. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, CLIF-SOFA score ≥7 suggests higher 6-week and hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2740532010,"The Japanese flying squid, Todarodes pacificus, is thought to spawn neutrally buoyant egg masses that retain a specific location in the water column by floating at the interface between water layers of slightly different densities. It is important to understand the physical process that determines the vertical distribution of the egg masses to predict their horizontal drift in relation to embryo survival and subsequent recruitment. Here, mesocosm experiments were conducted in a 300 m3 tank by creating a thermally stratified (17-22°C) water column to obtain egg masses. A cage net methodology was developed to sustain egg masses for detailed observation. We measured the density of the egg masses of T. pacificus, and used this information to infer the vertical distribution patterns of the egg masses at the spawning grounds (Tsushima Strait, Japan). When measured separately, the density of the outer jelly of each egg mass was 2.7 σ units higher than that of the surrounding water. The outer jelly and the specific gravity of embedded individual eggs (~1.10) cause the egg masses to have very slight negative buoyancy relative to the water in which they are formed. Analysis of the vertical profile of the spawning ground showed that water density (σθ) increased sharply at ~30 m depth; thus, egg masses might settle above the pycnocline layer. In conclusion, we suggest that T. pacificus egg masses might retain their location in the water column by floating at the interface between water layers of slightly different densities, which happen to be above the pycnocline layer (actual depth varies seasonally/annually) in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2741073744,"Analyzing large-scale spatial-temporal k-anonymity datasets recorded in location-based service (LBS) application servers can benefit some LBS applications. However, such analyses can allow adversaries to make inference attacks that cannot be handled by spatial-temporal k-anonymity methods or other methods for protecting sensitive knowledge. In response to this challenge, first we defined a destination location prediction attack model based on privacy-sensitive sequence rules mined from large scale anonymity datasets. Then we proposed a novel on-line spatial-temporal k-anonymity method that can resist such inference attacks. Our anti-attack technique generates new anonymity datasets with awareness of privacy-sensitive sequence rules. The new datasets extend the original sequence database of anonymity datasets to hide the privacy-sensitive rules progressively. The process includes two phases: off-line analysis and on-line application. In the off-line phase, sequence rules are mined from an original sequence database of anonymity datasets, and privacy-sensitive sequence rules are developed by correlating privacy-sensitive spatial regions with spatial grid cells among the sequence rules. In the on-line phase, new anonymity datasets are generated upon LBS requests by adopting specific generalization and avoidance principles to hide the privacy-sensitive sequence rules progressively from the extended sequence anonymity datasets database. We conducted extensive experiments to test the performance of the proposed method, and to explore the influence of the parameter K value. The results demonstrated that our proposed approach is faster and more effective for hiding privacy-sensitive sequence rules in terms of hiding sensitive rules ratios to eliminate inference attacks. Our method also had fewer side effects in terms of generating new sensitive rules ratios than the traditional spatial-temporal k-anonymity method, and had basically the same side effects in terms of non-sensitive rules variation ratios with the traditional spatial-temporal k-anonymity method. Furthermore, we also found the performance variation tendency from the parameter K value, which can help achieve the goal of hiding the maximum number of original sensitive rules while generating a minimum of new sensitive rules and affecting a minimum number of non-sensitive rules."
https://openalex.org/W2741247405,"Whereas transformation events in hematopoietic malignancies may occur at different developmental stages, the initial mutation originates in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), creating a preleukemic stem cell (PLSC). Subsequent mutations at either stem cell or progenitor cell levels transform the PLSC into lymphoma/leukemia initiating cells (LIC). Thymic lymphomas have been thought to develop from developing thymocytes. T cell progenitors are generated from HSCs in the bone marrow (BM), but maturation and proliferation of T cells as well as T-lymphomagenesis depends on both regulatory mechanisms and microenvironment within the thymus. We studied PLSC linked to thymic lymphomas. In this study, we use MSH2-/- mice as a model to investigate the existence of PLSC and the evolution of PLSC to LIC. Following BM transplantation, we found that MSH2-/- BM cells from young mice are able to fully reconstitute multiple hematopoietic lineages of lethally irradiated wild-type recipients. However, all recipients developed thymic lymphomas within three and four months post transplantation. Transplantation of different fractions of BM cells or thymocytes from young health MSH2-/- mice showed that an HSC enriched fraction always reconstituted hematopoiesis followed by lymphoma development. In addition, lymphomas did not occur in thymectomized recipients of MSH2-/- BM. These results suggest that HSCs with DNA repair defects such as MSH2-/- are PLSCs because they retain hematopoietic function, but also carry an obligate lymphomagenic potential within their T-cell progeny that is dependent on the thymic microenvironment."
