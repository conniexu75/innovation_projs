https://openalex.org/W4292684442,"Crop leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. This protective dissipation continues after the leaf transitions to shade, reducing crop photosynthesis. A bioengineered acceleration of this adjustment increased photosynthetic efficiency and biomass in tobacco in the field. But could that also translate to increased yield in a food crop? Here we bioengineered the same change into soybean. In replicated field trials, photosynthetic efficiency in fluctuating light was higher and seed yield in five independent transformation events increased by up to 33%. Despite increased seed quantity, seed protein and oil content were unaltered. This validates increasing photosynthetic efficiency as a much needed strategy toward sustainably increasing crop yield in support of future global food security."
https://openalex.org/W4293068506,"Flexible thermoelectrics provide a different solution for developing portable and sustainable flexible power supplies. The discovery of silver sulfide–based ductile semiconductors has driven a shift in the potential for flexible thermoelectrics, but the lack of good p-type ductile thermoelectric materials has restricted the reality of fabricating conventional cross-plane π-shaped flexible devices. We report a series of high-performance p-type ductile thermoelectric materials based on the composition-performance phase diagram in AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, with high figure-of-merit values (0.45 at 300 kelvin and 0.68 at 340 kelvin) compared with other flexible thermoelectric materials. We further demonstrate thin and flexible π-shaped devices with a maximum normalized power density that reaches 30 μW cm −2 K −2 . This output is promising for the use of flexible thermoelectrics in wearable electronics."
https://openalex.org/W4292680108,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent, bioaccumulative pollutants found in water resources at concentrations harmful to human health. Whereas current PFAS destruction strategies use nonselective destruction mechanisms, we found that perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) could be mineralized through a sodium hydroxide-mediated defluorination pathway. PFCA decarboxylation in polar aprotic solvents produced reactive perfluoroalkyl ion intermediates that degraded to fluoride ions (78 to ~100%) within 24 hours. The carbon-containing intermediates and products were inconsistent with oft-proposed one-carbon-chain shortening mechanisms, and we instead computationally identified pathways consistent with many experiments. Degradation was also observed for branched perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids and might be extended to degrade other PFAS classes as methods to activate their polar headgroups are identified."
https://openalex.org/W4293068416,"Abstract To capture the full spectrum of genetic risk for autism, we performed a two-stage analysis of rare de novo and inherited coding variants in 42,607 autism cases, including 35,130 new cases recruited online by SPARK. We identified 60 genes with exome-wide significance ( P &lt; 2.5 × 10 −6 ), including five new risk genes ( NAV3 , ITSN1 , MARK2 , SCAF1 and HNRNPUL2 ). The association of NAV3 with autism risk is primarily driven by rare inherited loss-of-function (LoF) variants, with an estimated relative risk of 4, consistent with moderate effect. Autistic individuals with LoF variants in the four moderate-risk genes ( NAV3 , ITSN1 , SCAF1 and HNRNPUL2 ; n = 95) have less cognitive impairment than 129 autistic individuals with LoF variants in highly penetrant genes ( CHD8, SCN2A, ADNP, FOXP1 and SHANK3 ) (59% vs 88%, P = 1.9 × 10 −6 ). Power calculations suggest that much larger numbers of autism cases are needed to identify additional moderate-risk genes."
https://openalex.org/W4292230157,"Recent advances in flexible and stretchable electronics have led to a surge of electronic skin (e-skin)-based health monitoring platforms. Conventional wireless e-skins rely on rigid integrated circuit chips that compromise the overall flexibility and consume considerable power. Chip-less wireless e-skins based on inductor-capacitor resonators are limited to mechanical sensors with low sensitivities. We report a chip-less wireless e-skin based on surface acoustic wave sensors made of freestanding ultrathin single-crystalline piezoelectric gallium nitride membranes. Surface acoustic wave-based e-skin offers highly sensitive, low-power, and long-term sensing of strain, ultraviolet light, and ion concentrations in sweat. We demonstrate weeklong monitoring of pulse. These results present routes to inexpensive and versatile low-power, high-sensitivity platforms for wireless health monitoring devices."
https://openalex.org/W4292680960,"Many risk loci for Parkinson's disease (PD) have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but target genes and mechanisms remain largely unknown. We linked the GWAS-derived chromosome 7 locus (sentinel single-nucleotide polymorphism rs199347) to GPNMB through colocalization analyses of expression quantitative trait locus and PD risk signals, confirmed by allele-specific expression studies in the human brain. In cells, glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with α-synuclein (aSyn). In induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, loss of GPNMB resulted in loss of ability to internalize aSyn fibrils and develop aSyn pathology. In 731 PD and 59 control biosamples, GPNMB was elevated in PD plasma, associating with disease severity. Thus, GPNMB represents a PD risk gene with potential for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting."
https://openalex.org/W4292229922,"Drug resistance in cancer is often linked to changes in tumor cell state or lineage, but the molecular mechanisms driving this plasticity remain unclear. Using murine organoid and genetically engineered mouse models, we investigated the causes of lineage plasticity in prostate cancer and its relationship to antiandrogen resistance. We found that plasticity initiates in an epithelial population defined by mixed luminal-basal phenotype and that it depends on increased Janus kinase (JAK) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) activity. Organoid cultures from patients with castration-resistant disease harboring mixed-lineage cells reproduce the dependency observed in mice by up-regulating luminal gene expression upon JAK and FGFR inhibitor treatment. Single-cell analysis confirms the presence of mixed-lineage cells with increased JAK/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and FGFR signaling in a subset of patients with metastatic disease, with implications for stratifying patients for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4293068298,"During gene transcription, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) traverses nucleosomes in chromatin, but the mechanism has remained elusive. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we obtained structures of the RNAPII elongation complex (EC) passing through a nucleosome in the presence of the transcription elongation factors Spt6, Spn1, Elf1, Spt4/5, and Paf1C and the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription). The structures show snapshots of EC progression on DNA mediating downstream nucleosome disassembly, followed by its reassembly upstream of the EC, which is facilitated by FACT. FACT dynamically adapts to successively occurring subnucleosome intermediates, forming an interface with the EC. Spt6, Spt4/5, and Paf1C form a ""cradle"" at the EC DNA-exit site and support the upstream nucleosome reassembly. These structures explain the mechanism by which the EC traverses nucleosomes while maintaining the chromatin structure and epigenetic information."
https://openalex.org/W4293068012,"Predicting the function of noncoding variation is a major challenge in modern genetics. In this study, we used massively parallel reporter assays to screen 5706 variants identified from genome-wide association studies for both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), identifying 320 functional regulatory variants (frVars) across 27 loci, including the complex 17q21.31 region. We identified and validated multiple risk loci using CRISPR interference or excision, including complement 4 ( C4A ) and APOC1 in AD and PLEKHM1 and KANSL1 in PSP. Functional variants disrupt transcription factor binding sites converging on enhancers with cell type–specific activity in PSP and AD, implicating a neuronal SP1-driven regulatory network in PSP pathogenesis. These analyses suggest that noncoding genetic risk is driven by common genetic variants through their aggregate activity on specific transcriptional programs."
https://openalex.org/W4293068541,"Most genetic variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans are noncoding, indicating their role in gene regulation. Previous studies have shown considerable links of GWAS signals to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) but the links to other genetic regulatory mechanisms, such as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), are underexplored. Here, we introduce an sQTL mapping method, ﻿testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects (THISTLE), with improved power over competing methods. Applying THISTLE together with a complementary sQTL mapping strategy to brain transcriptomic (n = 2,865) and genotype data, we identified 12,794 genes with cis-sQTLs at P < 5 × 10-8, approximately 61% of which were distinct from eQTLs. Integrating the sQTL data into GWAS for 12 brain-related complex traits (including diseases), we identified 244 genes associated with the traits through cis-sQTLs, approximately 61% of which could not be discovered using the corresponding eQTL data. Our study demonstrates the distinct role of most sQTLs in the genetic regulation of transcription and complex trait variation."
https://openalex.org/W4292854552,"The B cell receptor (BCR) initiates immune responses through antigen recognition. We report a 3.3-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of human immunoglobulin M (IgM)–BCR in the resting state. IgM-BCR comprises two heavy chains, two light chains, and the Igα/Igβ heterodimer. The ectodomains of the heavy chains closely stack against those of Igα/Igβ, with one heavy chain locked between Igα and Igβ in the juxtamembrane region. Extracellular interactions may determine isotype specificity of the BCR. The transmembrane helices of IgM-BCR form a four-helix bundle that appears to be conserved among all BCR isotypes. This structure contains 14 glycosylation sites on the IgM-BCR ectodomains and reveals three potential surface binding sites. Our work reveals the organizational principles of the BCR and may facilitate the design of antibody-based therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4293068704,"The B cell receptor (BCR) complex plays a critical role in B cell development and immune responses. The assembly mechanisms underlying the BCR complex remain unknown. We determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human IgG-BCR and IgM-BCR, which consist of membrane-bound immunoglobulin molecules (mIg) and Igα/β subunits at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Assembly of both BCR complexes involves their extracellular domains, membrane-proximal connection peptides, and transmembrane (TM) helices. The TM helices of mIgG and mIgM share a conserved set of hydrophobic and polar interactions with Igα/β TM helices. By contrast, the IgG-Cγ3 and IgM-Cμ4 domains interact with extracellular Ig-like domains of Igα/β through head-to-tail and side-by-side modes, respectively. This work reveals the structural basis for BCR assembly and provides insights into BCR triggering."
https://openalex.org/W4292223689,"Influenza A virus’s (IAV’s) frequent genetic changes challenge vaccine strategies and engender resistance to current drugs. We sought to identify conserved and essential RNA secondary structures within IAV’s genome that are predicted to have greater constraints on mutation in response to therapeutic targeting. We identified and genetically validated an RNA structure (packaging stem–loop 2 (PSL2)) that mediates in vitro packaging and in vivo disease and is conserved across all known IAV isolates. A PSL2-targeting locked nucleic acid (LNA), administered 3 d after, or 14 d before, a lethal IAV inoculum provided 100% survival in mice, led to the development of strong immunity to rechallenge with a tenfold lethal inoculum, evaded attempts to select for resistance and retained full potency against neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant virus. Use of an analogous approach to target SARS-CoV-2, prophylactic administration of LNAs specific for highly conserved RNA structures in the viral genome, protected hamsters from efficient transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 USA_WA1/2020 variant. These findings highlight the potential applicability of this approach to any virus of interest via a process we term ‘programmable antivirals’, with implications for antiviral prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy. Targeting conserved secondary structure of RNA viruses offers the potential for a customizable therapeutic approach to viral variants."
https://openalex.org/W4292230066,"Whereas sensory perception relies on specialized sensory pathways, it is unclear whether these pathways originate as modality-specific circuits. We demonstrated that somatosensory and visual circuits are not by default segregated but require the earliest retinal activity to do so. In the embryo, somatosensory and visual circuits are intermingled in the superior colliculus, leading to cortical multimodal responses to whisker pad stimulation. At birth, these circuits segregate, and responses switch to unimodal. Blocking stage I retinal waves prolongs the multimodal configuration into postnatal life, with the superior colliculus retaining a mixed somato-visual molecular identity and defects arising in the spatial organization of the visual system. Hence, the superior colliculus mediates the timely segregation of sensory modalities in an input-dependent manner, channeling specific sensory cues to their appropriate sensory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4293068351,"The E3 ligase TRIM7 has emerged as a critical player in viral infection and pathogenesis. However, the mechanism governing the TRIM7-substrate association remains to be defined. Here we report the crystal structures of TRIM7 in complex with 2C peptides of human enterovirus. Structure-guided studies reveal the C-terminal glutamine residue of 2C as the primary determinant for TRIM7 binding. Leveraged by this finding, we identify norovirus and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and physiological proteins, as new TRIM7 substrates. Crystal structures of TRIM7 in complex with multiple peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 proteins display the same glutamine-end recognition mode. Furthermore, TRIM7 could trigger the ubiquitination and degradation of these substrates, possibly representing a new Gln/C-degron pathway. Together, these findings unveil a common recognition mode by TRIM7, providing the foundation for further mechanistic characterization of antiviral and cellular functions of TRIM7."

https://openalex.org/W4292680269,"The ambient metastability of the rock-salt phase in well-defined model systems comprising nanospheres or nanorods of cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide, or both was investigated as a function of composition, initial crystal phase, particle structure, shape, surface functionalization, and ordering level of their assemblies. Our experiments show that these nanocrystal systems exhibit ligand-tailorable reversibility in the rock salt-to-zinc blende solid-phase transformation. Interparticle sintering was used to engineer kinetic barriers in the phase transformation to produce ambient-pressure metastable rock-salt structures in a controllable manner. Interconnected nanocrystal networks were identified as an essential structure that hosted metastable high-energy phases at ambient conditions. These findings suggest general rules for transformation-barrier engineering that are useful in the rational design of next-generation materials."

https://openalex.org/W4292381101,"The purpose of the present study was to examine differences in game-related statistical parameters between National Basketball Association (NBA) regular and post-season competitive periods and to determine which variables have the greatest contribution in discriminating between winning and losing game outcomes. The data scraping technique was used to obtain publicly available NBA game-related statistics over a three-year span (2016–2019). The total number of games examined in the present investigation was 3933 (3690 regular season and 243 post-season games). Despite small to moderate effect sizes, the findings suggest that NBA teams’ style of play (i.e., tactical strategies) changes when transitioning from the regular to post-season competitive period. It becomes more conservative (i.e., fewer field goal attempts, assists, steals, turnovers, and points scored), most likely due to greater defensive pressure. Discriminant function analysis correctly classified winning and losing game outcomes during the regular and post-season competitive periods in 82.8% and 87.2% of cases, respectively. Two key game-related statistics capable of discriminating between winning and losing game outcomes were field goal percentage and defensive rebounding, accounting for 13.6% and 14.2% of the total percentage of explained variance during the regular season and 11.5% and 14.7% during post-season competitive periods. Also, overall shooting efficiency (i.e., free-throw, 2-point, and 3-point combined) accounted for 23–26% of the total percentage of explained variance."

https://openalex.org/W4292219791,"The tendency to continue or intensify gambling after losing (loss-chasing) is widely regarded as a defining feature of gambling disorder. However, loss-chasing in real gambling contexts is multifaceted, and some aspects are better understood than others. Gamblers may chase losses between multiple sessions or within a single session. Furthermore, within a session, loss-chasing can be expressed in the decision of (1) when to stop, (2) how much stake to bet, and (3) the speed of play after winning and losing. Using a large player-tracking data set (&gt;2500 players, &gt;10 million rounds) collected from the online commercial game Mystery Arena , we examined these three behavioral expressions of within-session loss-chasing. While the first two aspects (when to stop and how much stake to bet) have been examined previously, the current research is the first large-scale study to examine the effects of wins and losses on the speed of play in real gambling. The players were additionally assigned different involvement levels by the operator based on their gambling behavior on the operator’s own platform, which further allowed us to examine group differences in loss-chasing. We found that after winning, both the high- and low-involvement groups were less likely to stop, and increased the stake amount, thus showing win-chasing instead of loss-chasing in these two facets. After losing, both groups played more quickly though, which may reflect an urge to continue gambling (as an expression of loss-chasing). Wins and losses had a smaller influence on the speed of play for the high-involvement players, suggesting that they might have reduced sensitivity to wins and/or losses. Future work can further examine chasing in different gambling products and in people with gambling problems to assess the generalizability of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4292366904,"According to the Argumentative Theory , human reasoning has an argumentative function, which consists of devising and evaluating arguments for and against various claims. It is however unclear how humans handle conflicting claims they face in everyday life (i.e., “Bob is telling me that Alice is at the library” vs. “Charles is telling me that Alice is at home”). We here investigate human argumentative reasoning in the light of Formal Argumentation , a research field that develops formal methods to give a normative account of argumentation and reasoning about conflicting information. In Formal Argumentation, multiple argumentation semantics that allow selecting sets of jointly acceptable arguments have been proposed. Nonetheless, it is unclear which of these semantics predicts best how humans evaluate the acceptability of conflicting arguments. We conducted an empirical study in which 130 young adults judged natural language arguments. We instructed them to draw the attack relation between the given arguments and to evaluate the acceptability of each of these arguments. Our results show that human judgments on the existence and directionality of attacks between the arguments conform to theoretical predictions from Formal Argumentation. We further found out that some less well-known argumentation semantics predicted human evaluation better than the most well-known semantics. These findings support the cognitive plausibility of variants of Formal Argumentation and bring new insights into reasoning about conflicting information."
https://openalex.org/W4292378983,"At therapeutic concentrations, propofol (PPF), an anesthetic agent, significantly elevates intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2 +]i) and induces neural death during the developmental period. Preconditioning enables specialized tissues to tolerate major insults better compared with tissues that have already been exposed to sublethal insults. Here, we investigated whether the neurotoxicity induced by clinical concentrations of PPF could be alleviated by prior exposure to sublethal amounts of PPF. Cortical neurons from embryonic day (E) 17 Wistar rat fetuses were cultured in vitro, and on day in vitro (DIV) 2, the cells were preconditioned by exposure to PPF (PPF-PC) at either 100 nM or 1 μM for 24 h. For morphological observations, cells were exposed to clinical concentrations of PPF (10 μM or 100 μM) for 24 h and the survival ratio (SR) was calculated. Calcium imaging revealed significant PPF-induced [Ca2+]i elevation in cells on DIV 4 regardless of PPF-PC. Additionally, PPF-PC did not alleviate neural cell death induced by PPF under any condition. Our findings indicate that PPF-PC does not alleviate PPF-induced neurotoxicity during the developmental period."
https://openalex.org/W4292382351,"Tribolium castaneum is one of the major pests of stored grains which causes extensive damages. To control this insect pest many synthetic chemical pesticides are used. However, continuous usage of synthetic fumigants causes pest resurgence, toxic residues, genetic resistance in pests, environmental contamination and health hazards etc., To avert these problems, essential oils are used as bio-fumigants to control the stored pests. They could act as best alternatives to synthetic fumigant in closed environment. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the pesticidal activity of Callistemon citrinus oil against Tribolium castaneum . GC-MS analysis of C . citrinus essential oil (EO) showed 10 compounds; among them, the major constituent was eucalyptol (1, 8-cineole) at 40.44%. The lethal concentration (LC 50 ) values were 37.05 μL/L (adults) and 144.31 μL/L (larvae) at 24 and 48 hrs respectively. Exposure to C . citrinus EO significantly reduced the beetle fecundity, ovicidal activity, egg hatchability, larvae survival and emergence of adult. The effect of EO on enzymatic activity of T . castaneum adults was examined using Acetylcholinesterase, α-Carboxylesterase, β-Carboxylesterase, Glutathione-S-Transferase, Acid and Alkaline phosphatase assays. The results indicated that the activity of detoxification enzymes drastically varied when compared with control. This EO had toxicant effects on all stages of the life of T . castaneum ."
https://openalex.org/W4292383093,"Oracle bone inscriptions (OBIs) are ancient Chinese scripts originated in the Shang Dynasty of China, and now less than half of the existing OBIs are well deciphered. To date, interpreting OBIs mainly relies on professional historians using the rules of OBIs evolution, and the remaining part of the oracle’s deciphering work is stuck in a bottleneck period. Here, we systematically analyze the evolution process of oracle characters by using the Siamese network in Few-shot learning (FSL). We first establish a dataset containing Chinese characters which have finished a relatively complete evolution, including images in five periods: oracle bone inscriptions, bronze inscriptions, seal inscriptions, official script, and regular script. Then, we compare the performance of three typical algorithms, VGG16, ResNet, and AlexNet respectively, as the backbone feature extraction network of the Siamese network. The results show that the highest F1 value of 83.3% and the highest recognition accuracy of 82.67% are obtained by the combination of VGG16 and Siamese network. Based on the analysis, the typical structural performance of each period is evaluated and we identified that the optimized Siamese network is feasible to study the evolution of the OBIs. Our findings provide a new approach for oracle’s deciphering further."

We aimed to determine the proportion of patients initiating anti-retroviral therapy (ART) during hospitalization, barriers and mortality outcome.In this mixed methods cohort study, we enrolled hospitalized patients with a recent HIV diagnosis from three public hospitals in Uganda. We collected data on clinical characteristics, ART initiation and reasons for failure to initiate ART, as well as 30 day outcomes. Healthcare workers in-depth interviews were also conducted and data analyzed by sub-themes.We enrolled 234 patients; females 140/234 (59.8%), median age 34.5 years (IQR 29-42), 195/234 (83.7%) had WHO HIV stage 3 or 4, and 74/116 (63.8%) had CD4 ≤ 200 cell/μL. The proportion who initiated ART during hospitalization was 123/234 (52.6%) (95% CI 46.0-59.1), of these 35/123 (28.5%) initiated ART on the same day of hospitalization, while 99/123 (80.5%) within a week of hospitalization. By 30 days 34/234 (14.5%) (95% CI 10.3-19.7) died. Patients residing ≥ 35 kilometers from the hospital were more likely not to initiate ART during hospitalization, [aRR = 1.39, (95% CI 1.22-1.59). Inadequate patient preparation for ART initiation and advanced HIV disease were highlighted as barriers of ART initiation during hospitalization.In this high HIV prevalence setting, only half of newly diagnosed HIV patients are initiated on ART during hospitalization. Inadequate pre-ART patient preparation and advanced HIV are barriers to rapid ART initiation among hospitalized patients in public hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W4292385276,"The cognitive impairment, depression, a decrease in the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), and salivary gland dysfunction, as indicated by the reduction of alpha-amylase activity, have been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, the effects of depression on cognitive function, salivary alpha-amylase activity, and ADLs in T2DM patients have never been investigated. In this study, 115 participants were divided into three groups, including 30 healthy people, 50 T2DM patients without depression, and 35 T2DM patients with depression. Then, the cognitive function, the level of depression, salivary-alpha amylase activity, ADLs, and metabolic parameters were determined. Results showed that T2DM patients had hyperglycemia and cognitive impairment. A decrease in the salivary alpha-amylase activity was observed in T2DM patients. Interestingly, T2DM patients with depression had higher level of hyperglycemia and cognitive impairment than T2DM patients. Additionally, cognitive function was associated with the salivary-alpha amylase activity in T2DM without depression, while the severity of depression was associated with the salivary-alpha amylase activity in T2DM patients with depression. Therefore, we concluded that T2DM caused the impairment of metabolism, decreased salivary alpha-amylase activity, and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, T2DM patients with depression had higher level of hyperglycemia and cognitive decline than T2DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W4293830086,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD), characterized by an abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, is closely linked to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and changes in lipogenesis in the liver. The accumulation of hepatic lipids can lead to a range of pathologies from mild steatosis to severe cirrhosis. Endurance exercise is known to ameliorate the adverse health effects of NAFLD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of voluntary wheel running (VWR) on the metabolic changes in the livers of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and used LC-MS/MS (Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) to determine whether the tested intervention affected the protein expression profiles of the mouse livers. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: control (CON), high-fat diet sedentary group (HFD), high-fat diet VWR group (HFX). HFX group performed voluntary wheel running into individually cages, given a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Food consumption, body weight, and running distance were measured every week. Using 2D (2-dimensional)-gel electrophoresis, we detected and quantitatively analyzed the protein expression with >2.0-fold change in the livers of HFD-fed mice, HFD-fed exercise (HFX) mice, and chow-fed mice. Body weight was significantly increased in HFD compared to CON (P < 0.05). The 2D-gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that there was a difference between CON and HFD groups, showing 31 increased and 27 decreased spots in the total 302 paired spots in the HFD group compared to CON. The analysis showed 43 increased and 17 decreased spots in the total 258 spots in the HFX group compared to CON. Moreover, 12 weeks of VWR showed an increase of 35 and a decrease of 8 spots in a total of 264 paired spots between HFD and HFX. LC-MS/MS of HFD group revealed that proteins involved in ketogenesis, lipid metabolism, and the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics were upregulated, whereas detoxifying proteins, mitochondrial precursors, transport proteins, proteasomes, and proteins involved in amino acid metabolism were downregulated. On the other hand, VWR counteracted the protein expression profile of HFD-fed mice by upregulating molecular chaperones, gluconeogenesis-, detoxification-, proteasome-, and energy metabolism-related proteins. This study provided a molecular understanding of the HFD- and exercise-induced protein marker expression and presented the beneficial effects of exercise during pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4292220065,"Background In the context of the ageing of the French population, physical activity becomes a principal means for maintaining good health. International organisations are thus giving increasing importance to physical activity in programmes of disease-prevention. In parallel with these concerns, studies have shown the impact of sedentary activities (in particularly as a result of the seated position and screen time) on health. Objective To show the links between physical activity, sedentarism and health indicators and to identify the socio-demographic variables by which they are influenced (particularly gender). Study design This is a transversal epidemiological study conducted among the French population between 2014 and 2016 by Santé publique France, the national public health agency. Methods The RPAQ (Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire) was used to measure the physical activity and sedentary lifestyle of individuals. The analyses focus on the behaviours among the population of older adults (55–74 years old, n = 1155). Results A third of French older adults does not meet the WHO recommended physical activity levels, particularly so among women. The results of this survey point to significant links between health indicators (especially overweight and obesity) and the physical activity level and sedentarity of older adults. From the age of 60, energy expenditure linked to physical activity increases before decreasing from the age of 65. Older adults spend almost 6 hours per day in sedentary activities. The combinations between physical activity and sedentarism highlight four profiles of older adults. The most active profile is the one with the best health indicators. Conclusion The links between health, sedentarity and physical activity are unequivocal: people who achieve the WHO recommendations for physical activity and spend less than 7 hours each day in sedentary activities are those who also have the best health indicators. These results vary with sociographic characteristics and reveal significant links with health indicators."

https://openalex.org/W4292385016,"Background Endoscopic drainage is the primary treatment for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO). This study developed and validated a pre-endoscopic predictive score for clinical success after stent placement. Methods Patients with unresectable MBO undergoing ERCP-guided endobiliary stent placement between 2007 and 2017 were randomly divided into derivation (n = 383) and validation (n = 128) cohorts. To develop the risk score, clinical parameters were built by logistic regression to predict (1) ≥ 50% total bilirubin (TB) resolution within 2 weeks and (2) bilirubin normalization (TB level &lt;1.2 mg/dL) within 6 weeks following stenting. The scoring scheme was applied to the validation cohort to test its performance. Results A ≥ 50% TB resolution within 2 weeks was shown in 70.5% of cases. The risk scoring scheme had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.64–0.76) and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.57–0.77) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Thirty-one percent had TB normalization within 6 weeks after stenting. Significant predictors for TB normalization were extrahepatic biliary obstruction (odds ratio [OR] = 2.35), pre-endoscopic TB level (OR = 0.88), and stent type (OR = 0.42). The AUROC of a risk score for predicting TB normalization within 6 weeks was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72–0.83) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67–0.86) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. A score &gt; 1.30 yielded a specificity of 98% and a positive predictive value of 84% for predicting TB normalization. A score of &lt; -4.18 provided a sensitivity of 80%–90% and a negative predictive value of 90%–93% for predicting the absence of TB normalization. Conclusions The pre-endoscopic scoring system comprising biliary obstruction level, liver biochemistry, and type of stent provides prediction indices for TB normalization within 6 weeks after stenting. This scheme may help endoscopists identify patients with unresectable MBO suited for palliative stenting."
https://openalex.org/W4292385252,"In this article, a new path planning algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is developed on the basis of the algorithm for finding the best value using multi-objective evolutionary particle swarm optimization, known as the MOEPSO. The proposed algorithm is used for the path planning of autonomous mobile robots in both static and dynamic environments. The paths must follow the determined criteria, namely, the shortest path, the smoothest path, and the safest path. In addition, the algorithm considers the degree of mutation, crossover, and selection to improve the efficiency of each particle. Furthermore, a weight adjustment method is proposed for the movement of particles in each iteration to increase the chance of finding the best fit solution. In addition, a method to manage feasible waypoints within the radius of obstacles or blocked by obstacles is proposed using a simple random method. The main contribution of this article is the development of a new path planning algorithm for autonomous mobile robots. This algorithm can build the shortest, smoothest, and safest paths for robots. It also offers an evolutionary operator to prevent falling into a local optimum. The proposed algorithm uses path finding simulation in a static environment and dynamic environment in conjunction with comparing performance to path planning algorithms in previous studies. In the static environment (4 obstacles), the shortest path obtained from the proposed algorithm is 14.3222 m. In the static environment (5 obstacles), the shortest path obtained from the proposed algorithm is 14.5989 m. In the static environment (6 obstacles), the shortest path obtained from the proposed algorithm is 14.4743 m. In the dynamic environment the shortest path is 12.2381 m. The results show that the proposed algorithm can determine the paths from the starting point to the destination with the shortest distances that require the shortest processing time."
https://openalex.org/W4292385404,"Purpose To characterize quantitative differences among ophthalmologic emergency room (OER) encounters at Rambam Health Care Campus during a 6-week complete lockdown at the peak of the first COVID-19 wave as compared to a corresponding uneventful period a year earlier. Methods A retrospective chart analysis of all OER encounters during the lockdown and non-lockdown period was conducted. Patients were stratified into primary ophthalmological conditions (OER visits) and cases in which ophthalmologic consultations were requested by a non-ophthalmologist (OER consultations). The following parameters were compared: total number of cases, age, gender, chief complaint/diagnosis categorized into major entities, and discharge vs. hospitalization. For continuous variables a t-test was used and for categorical variables a chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test was used. A 2-sided p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The total number of patients in the lockdown and non-lockdown groups was 486 and 992, respectively, showing a 51% decrease in visits during lockdown. In the non-lockdown and lockdown groups 56% and 61% of patients were male (p = 0.07), with an average age of 42 (range 0–97, SD 23) and 43 (range 0–90, SD 22) years, respectively (p = 0.44). No statistically significant proportional increase was found for any diagnostic category between the OER visits (p = 0.07) and OER consultation groups (p = 0.77). Nevertheless, analysis revealed a non-significant increase in the proportion of eye trauma from 14.8% to 21.2%, and reduction in eyelid conditions from 10.7% to 5.8%. The total number of OER visits demanding urgent intervention on admission was 43 (non-lockdown) and 24 (lockdown), while hospitalization ratio (hospitalizations/visits) was 8.8% and 10.6%, respectively (p = 0.44). Conclusions During the COVID-19 lockdown the guideline for patients in Israel was to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. Since patients tended to avoid the OER rather uniformly regardless of their specific eye condition, determining the risk-benefit of such recommendations and identifying high-risk sub-populations are critical public health issues."
https://openalex.org/W4292385499,"Purpose This study aims to investigate new tissue conditioner (TC) formulations involving chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) and essential oils (EO) for their antifungal potential, release kinetics, and hardness. Materials and methods CSNPs were synthesized, and the separate solutions of CSNP were prepared with two types of EO, i.e., Oregano oil and Lemongrass. The EO was loaded separately in two concentrations (200 μL and 250 μL). The blank and EO-loaded CSNPs were screened against Candida albicans ( C . albicans ), and their minimum inhibitory concentration was established. GC Reline ™ (GC corporation, USA) TC was considered a control group, whereby the four experimental groups were prepared by mixing CSNPs/EO solutions with TC powder. The antifungal effectiveness ( C . albicans ) and release kinetics behavior (1–6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h) was investigated. The Shore A hardness of control and experimental groups was evaluated in dry and wet modes (deionized water and artificial saliva). For statistical analysis, SPSS version 22 was used to do a one-way ANOVA post-hoc Tukey’s test. Results Compared to the control group, TCs containing blank CSNPs and CSNPs loaded with EO showed 3 and 5 log reductions in C . albicans growth, respectively. A significantly high antifungal effect was observed with TC containing lemongrass essential oil (200 μL). The continuous release of EO was detected for the first 6 hours, whereas completely stopped after 48 hours. Mean hardness values were highest for dry samples and lowest for samples stored in artificial saliva. The statistically significant difference within and between the study groups was observed in mean and cumulative essential oils release and hardness values of TCs over observed time intervals irrespective of storage media. Conclusion TCs containing essential-oil-loaded CSNPs seem a promising alternative treatment of denture-induced stomatitis, however, a further biological analysis should be taken."
https://openalex.org/W4292385501,"We investigated the mechanisms by which chronic administration of a multideficient diet after weaning alters bodily Na + handling, and culminates in high systolic blood pressure (SBP) at a juvenile age. From 28 to 92 days of age, weaned male Wistar rats were given a diet with low content and poor-quality protein, and low lipid, without vitamin supplementation, which mimics the diets consumed in impoverished regions worldwide. We measured food, energy and Na + ingestion, together with urinary Na + excretion, Na + density (Na + intake/energy intake), plasma Na + concentration, SBP, and renal proximal tubule Na + -transporting ATPases. Undernourished rats aged 92 days had only one-third of the control body mass, lower plasma albumin, higher SBP, higher energy intake, and higher positive Na + balance accompanied by decreased plasma Na + concentration. Losartan or Ang-(3–4) normalized SBP, and the combination of the 2 substances induced an accentuated negative Na + balance as a result of strong inhibition of Na + ingestion. Na + density in undernourished rats was higher than in control, irrespective of the treatment, and they had downregulated (Na + +K + )ATPase and upregulated Na + -ATPase in proximal tubule cells, which returned to control levels after Losartan or Ang-(3–4). We conclude that Na + density, not only Na + ingestion, plays a central role in the pathophysiology of elevated SBP in chronically undernourished rats. The observations that Losartan and Ang-(3–4) normalized SBP together with negative Na + balance give support to the proposal that Ang II⇒AT 1 R and Ang II⇒AT 2 R axes have opposite roles within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system of undernourished juvenile rats."
https://openalex.org/W4292677918,"Molecular recognition by enzymes is a complicated process involving thermodynamic energies governing protein-ligand interactions. In order to aid the estimation of inhibitory activity of compounds targeting an enzyme, several computational methods can be employed to dissect this intermolecular contact. Herein, we report a structural dynamics investigation of an epigenetic enzyme HDAC2 in differentiating its binding to various inhibitors within the sub-sites of its active site. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to elucidate the intermolecular interactions as well as the dynamics behavior of ligand binding. MD trajectories of five distinct HDAC2-inhibitor complexes reveal that compounds lacking adequate contacts with the opening rim of the active site possess high fluctuation along the cap portion, thus weakening the overall affinity. Key intermolecular interactions determining the effective binding of inhibitors include hydrogen bonds with Gly154, Asp181, and Tyr308; hydrophobic interactions between Phe155/Phe210 and the linker region; and a pi-stacking with Arg39 at the foot pocket. Decomposition of the binding free energy calculated per-residue by MM/PBSA also indicates that the interactions within the internal foot pocket, especially with residues Met35, Leu144, Gly305, and Gly306, can contribute significantly to the ligand binding. Additionally, configurational entropy of the binding was estimated and compared to the scale of the binding free energy in order to assess its contribution to the binding and to differentiate various ligand partners. It was found that the levels of entropic contribution are comparable among a set of structurally similar carbamide ligands, while it is greatly different for the set of unrelated ligands, ranging from 2.75 to 16.38 kcal/mol for the five inhibitors examined. These findings exemplify the importance of assessing molecular dynamics as well as estimating the entropic contribution in evaluating the ligand binding mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W4292220059,"The immune profile of sepsis patients is incompletely understood and hyperinflammation and hypoinflammation may occur concurrently or sequentially. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) may counter hypoinflammation but effects are uncertain. We tested the reactivity of septic whole blood to bacteria, Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and to ICI.Whole blood assays of 61 patients' samples within 24h of meeting sepsis-3 criteria and 12 age and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Measurements included pattern/danger-associated molecular pattern (P/DAMP), cytokine concentrations at baseline and in response to TLR 2, 4, and 7/8 ligands, heat-inactivated Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, E.coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), concentration of soluble and cellular immune checkpoint molecules, and cytokine concentrations in response to ICI directed against programmed-death receptor 1 (PD1), PD1-ligand 1, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, both in the absence and presence of LPS.In sepsis, concentrations of P/DAMPs and inflammatory cytokines were increased and the latter increased further upon incubation ex vivo. However, cytokine responses to TLR 2, 4, and 7/8 ligands, heat-inactivated S. aureus or E. coli, and E. coli LPS were all depressed. Depression of the response to LPS was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Despite increased PD-1 expression on monocytes and T-cells, and monocyte CTLA-4 expression, however, addition of corresponding checkpoint inhibitors to assays failed to increase inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the absence and presence of LPS.Patients first meeting Sepsis-3 criteria reveal 1) depressed responses to multiple TLR-ligands, bacteria, and bacterial LPS, despite concomitant inflammation, but 2) no response to immune checkpoint inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W4292220062,"The ribosomal protein uL11 is located at the basis of the ribosome P-stalk and plays a paramount role in translational efficiency. In addition, no mutant for uL11 is available suggesting that this gene is haplo-insufficient as many other Ribosomal Protein Genes ( RPGs ). We have previously shown that overexpression of Drosophila melanogaster uL11 enhances the transcription of many RPGs and Ribosomal Biogenesis genes ( RiBis ) suggesting that uL11 might globally regulate the level of translation through its transcriptional activity. Moreover, uL11 trimethylated on lysine 3 (uL11K3me3) interacts with the chromodomain of the Enhancer of Polycomb and Trithorax Corto, and both proteins co-localize with RNA Polymerase II at many sites on polytene chromosomes. These data have led to the hypothesis that the N-terminal end of uL11, and more particularly the trimethylation of lysine 3, supports the extra-ribosomal activity of uL11 in transcription. To address this question, we mutated the lysine 3 codon using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and obtained several lysine 3 mutants. We describe here the first mutants of D . melanogaster uL11 . Unexpectedly, the uL11 K3A mutant, in which the lysine 3 codon is replaced by an alanine, displays a genuine Minute phenotype known to be characteristic of RPG deletions (longer development, low fertility, high lethality, thin and short bristles) whereas the uL11 K3Y mutant, in which the lysine 3 codon is replaced by a tyrosine, is unaffected. In agreement, the rate of translation decreases in uL11 K3A but not in uL11 K3Y . Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that the interaction between uL11 and the Corto chromodomain is impaired by both mutations. However, Histone Association Assays indicate that the mutant proteins still bind chromatin. RNA-seq analyses from wing imaginal discs show that Corto represses RPG expression whereas very few genes are deregulated in uL11 mutants. We propose that Corto, by repressing RPG expression, ensures that all ribosomal proteins are present at the correct stoichiometry, and that uL11 fine-tunes its transcriptional regulation of RPGs ."
https://openalex.org/W4292220064,"Objective The primary aim of the study was to determine levels of literacy in both oral health and orthodontics in an adult population. The secondary study aim was to investigate differences in literacy between males and females. Methods Participants included individuals 18 years or older seeking dental treatment at the East Carolina University (ECU) School of Dental Medicine. To determine levels of oral health literacy (OHL) and orthodontic literacy (OrthoL), validated instruments were administered, including the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine and Dentistry, the Oral Health Literacy Instrument and its separate scales, and a questionnaire on orthodontic literacy. Summary statistics were computed, and statistical significance was set at 0.05. Results One hundred seventy-two individuals participated in the study and had a mean age of 55.03 (range:18–88). Greater than 70% of the sampled population exhibited inadequate or marginal oral health knowledge. Additionally, greater than 70% of the sample possessed no more than an 8th grade reading level, with regard to basic medical and dental terms. Higher education was weakly associated with higher OrthoL and OHL. Higher age was also weakly associated with lower OrthoL and OHL. Males on average exhibited significantly higher OHL (p &lt; .05) but there were no OrthoL differences between males and females. Dental visit frequency was not associated with OrthoL or OHL. Conclusion Low levels of OrthoL and OHL were observed in the study. While males demonstrated a higher level of OHL than females, neither age nor the occurrence of dental appointments significantly influenced levels of literacy."
https://openalex.org/W4292220070,"Objective To test the effectiveness of the web-based intervention “Koji-family.net 3-day program” (KF3 PGM) for life-change adaptation in family caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). Design A cluster-randomized trial. Settings All 82 institutions for families of individuals with ABI in Japan. Participants Participants were 240 families at 16 different institutions for families of individuals with ABI. Inclusion criteria for participants were (1) families caring for an individual with ABI, (2) family members aged 20 years and over, and (3) the individual with ABI developed ABI when aged more than 16 years and less than 65 years. Methods Clusters were randomly assigned to the intervention (8 clusters, n = 120) or the control (8 clusters, n = 120) group. For the intervention group, the KF3 PGM was assigned, in addition to routine family group activities to enhance the life-change adaptation. The control group followed their daily routine and received usual services. The primary outcome was the life-change adaptation scale (LCAS); secondary outcomes were the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) and the positive appraisal of care (PAC) scale at the baseline, after 3 days (short-term follow-up), and after 1 month (long-term follow-up). A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) was applied. Results A total of 91 participants were enrolled. The mean age (SE) of the participants was 64.0 (9.2) years; 87.8% of them were female. The intervention group showed better improvement in the LCAS than the control group in the whole study period ( F = 6.5, p = 0.002). The mean observed change in LCAS from baseline was +8.0 (SE = 2.0) at 3 days and +11.6 (SE = 2.0) at 1 month in the intervention group ( F = 18.7, p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences in MSPSS and PAC were observed among the intervention and control groups in the whole study. Conclusions The KF3 PGM can be an effective method of enhancing the adaptation to daily life in family caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with ABI. The results show that a potential web-based intervention in institutions for families of individuals with ABI plays a substantial, longer-term role in their support in Japan. Future studies could address the same research questions in different settings and cultures for family caregivers for even longer time periods."
https://openalex.org/W4292366169,"In vivo dosimetry is a quality assurance tool that provides post-treatment measurement of the absorbed dose as delivered to the patient. This dosimetry compares the prescribed and measured dose delivered to the target volume. In this study, a tissue-equivalent water phantom provided the simulation of the human environment. The skin and entrance doses were measured using GafChromic EBT2 film for a Theratron® Equinox Cobalt-60 teletherapy machine.We examined the behaviors of unencapsulated films and custom-made film encapsulation. Films were cut to 1 cm × 1 cm, calibrated, and used to assess skin dose depositions and entrance dose. We examined the response of the film for variations in field size, source to skin distance (SSD), gantry angle and wedge angle.The estimated uncertainty in EBT2 film for absorbed dose measurement in phantom was ±1.72%. Comparison of the measurements of the two film configurations for the various irradiation parameters were field size (p = 0.0193, α = 0.05, n = 11), gantry angle (p = 0.0018, α = 0.05, n = 24), SSD (p = 0.1802, α = 0.05, n = 11) and wedge angle (p = 0.6834, α = 0.05, n = 4). For a prescribed dose of 200 cGy and at reference conditions (open field 10 cm x 10 cm, SSD = 100 cm, and gantry angle = 0º), the measured skin dose using the encapsulation material was 70% while that measured with the unencapsulated film was 24%. At reference irradiation conditions, the measured skin dose using the unencapsulated film was higher for open field configurations (24%) than wedged field configurations (19%). Estimation of the entrance dose using the unencapsulated film was within 3% of the prescribed dose.GafChromic EBT2 film measurements were significantly affected at larger field sizes and gantry angles. Furthermore, we determined a high accuracy in entrance dose estimations using the film."
https://openalex.org/W4292366185,"understanding women's attitudes towards female genital mutilation is an important step towards eliminating this practice. We used the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data set to examine the relationship between wealth index, and previous history of circumcision on women's opinions whether female genital mutilation (FGM) should be continued or stopped in Ethiopia.Data from 6984 women aged 15-49 years were extracted from the 2016 Ethiopia EDHS data set. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to analyse the data.In this study, women with a higher level of education and wealth index were more likely to support the cessation of FGM. However, circumcised women (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.15-0.32), women from the Afar region (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.22-0.50), Somali region (AOR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.27-0.65), and Dire Dawa region (AOR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.32-0.83) were less likely to support discontinuation of FGM.The present study revealed that wealth index, education level, history of circumcision, and regional variation are associated with women's attitude towards discontinuation of the practice of FGM in Ethiopia. Empowering women in terms of socioeconomic status and education can change attitudes and might help prevent female genital mutilation in the future. Furthermore, interventions targeting FGM practices should focus on regional variance in order to have a meaningful impact on reducing this harmful cultural practice in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4292366319,"Exposure to adversity during the first years of life might already be biologically embedded well before adult life. Thus, the impact of different stressful experiences needs to be explored. This study aims to examine if the association between being victimized (adverse childhood experiences—ACEs and bullying) and (hs-) C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is explained by the influence of adversity on the body mass index (BMI) of the child. We included children from the Portuguese birth cohort Generation XXI (n = 3712) that at 10 years of age completed a questionnaire on the exposure to ACEs and bullying victimization, assessed by an adaptation from the original ACEs study and an adaptation of The Bully Scale Survey, respectively. Following an overnight fast, a venous blood sample was collected by trained nurses and hs-CRP was assayed in fresh blood samples. Weight and height were measured with the child in underwear and bare feet. Weight was measured to the nearest one-tenth of a kilogram with the use of a digital scale (Tanita), and height was measured to the nearest one-tenth of a centimetre with the use of a wall stadiometer (seca®). BMI was calculated as the value of weight (kg) over squared height (m), and computed as an age- and sex-specific BMI standard deviation (SD) score (z-score), according to the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards (5–19 years). Regression coefficients and respective 95% Confidence Interval [β(95%CI)] were computed using path analysis. We observed that ACEs had a positive total effect on hs-CRP at the age of 10 years (β = 0.06; 95%CI: -0.02; 0.15). A direct effect (β = 0.02; 95%CI: -0.01; 0.06) accounted for 66.1% of the association between ACEs and hs-CRP. A positive total effect of bullying victimization on hs-CRP (β = 0.20; 95%CI: 0.06; 0.34) was observed. A direct effect (β = 0.08; 95%CI: -0.05; 0.21) accounted for 40.0% of the association, while an indirect effect through BMI (β = 0.12; 95%CI: 0.06; 0.18) explained 60.0% of the pathway between bullying victimization and hs-CRP. Results suggest that there might be different mechanisms involved in the biological embedding of childhood experiences. BMI seems to explain a great part of the association between exposure to bullying victimization and hs-CRP at 10 years of age. Further research is still needed to better understand the mechanisms explaining the emergence and persistence of health poorer outcomes later in life for victims of abuse."
https://openalex.org/W4292381919,"Objective Many university students have difficulties in adapting to autonomous learning due to executive functioning deficits. In the Spanish university context, there is a lack of reliable validated instruments for the evaluation of executive functioning. In this sense, the aim of this research is to present the process of adaptation and validation of the Amsterdam Executive Function Inventory (AEFI) for the evaluation of executive functioning in the Spanish context. Methods This study integrates two sequential processes: questionnaire translation and back-translation, and evaluation of the psychometric properties (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted), reliability, validity and multigroup analysis to identify factorial invariance. An online questionnaire was used for data collection and R package lavaan software was administered to a sample of 519 first-year university students (270 females and 249 males). Results The exploratory factor analysis evidenced an interna structure of three factors with adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha higher than 0.70), endorsed in the confirmatory factor analysis that indicated an adequate goodness-of-fit-indexes for the model. The composite reliability showed values between 0.74 and 0.82, and the convergent (average variance extracted values ranged from 0.50 to 0.61) and discriminant validity were adequate. A multigroup-analysis showed the invariance factorial through the difference in the RMSEA, CFI and TLI index, performed both in the model comparison according to gender and academic disciplines. Conclusion The AEFI adapted for Spanish has practical implications for the management of university students, as it can facilitate the improvement of university policies designed to foster the development of executive functions, specifically in first-year students."
https://openalex.org/W4292385092,"Standard regression modeling may cause biased effect estimates in the presence of time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between declining in modified creatinine index (MCI), as a surrogate marker of lean body mass, and mortality among end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients using G-estimation accounting appropriately for time-varying confounders.A retrospective cohort of all registered ESRD patients (n = 553) was constructed over 8 years from 2011 to 2019, from 3 hemodialysis centers at Kerman, southeast of Iran. According to changes in MCI, patients were dichotomized to either the decline group or no-decline group. Subsequently the effect of interest was estimated using G-estimation and compared with accelerated failure time (AFT) Weibull models using two modelling strategies.Standard models demonstrated survival time ratios of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.64 to 1.28) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.58 to 1.23) in patients in the decline MCI group compared to those in no-decline MCI group. This effect was demonstrated to be 0.57 (-95% CI: 0.21 to 0.81) using G-estimation.Declining in MCI increases mortality in patients with ESRD using G-estimation, while the AFT standard models yield biased effect estimate toward the null."
https://openalex.org/W4292681232,"A large range of prognostic models for determining the risk of COVID-19 patient mortality exist, but these typically restrict the set of biomarkers considered to measurements available at patient admission. Additionally, many of these models are trained and tested on patient cohorts from a single hospital, raising questions about the generalisability of results. We used a Bayesian Markov model to analyse time series data of biomarker measurements taken throughout the duration of a COVID-19 patient's hospitalisation for n = 1540 patients from two hospitals in New York: State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Health Sciences University and Maimonides Medical Center. Our main focus was to quantify the mortality risk associated with both static (e.g. demographic and patient history variables) and dynamic factors (e.g. changes in biomarkers) throughout hospitalisation, by so doing, to explain the observed patterns of mortality. By using our model to make predictions across the hospitals, we assessed how predictive factors generalised between the two cohorts. The individual dynamics of the measurements and their associated mortality risk were remarkably consistent across the hospitals. The model accuracy in predicting patient outcome (death or discharge) was 72.3% (predicting SUNY; posterior median accuracy) and 71.3% (predicting Maimonides) respectively. Model sensitivity was higher for detecting patients who would go on to be discharged (78.7%) versus those who died (61.8%). Our results indicate the utility of including dynamic clinical measurements when assessing patient mortality risk but also highlight the difficulty of identifying high risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W4292684099,"Controlling upright posture entails acute adjustments by the neuromuscular system to keep the center of mass (COM) within the limits of a relatively small base of support. Sudden displacement of the COM triggers several strategies and balance recovery mechanisms to prevent excessive COM displacement.We have examined and quantified a new approach to induce an internal neuromuscular perturbation in standing posture on 15 healthy individuals to provide an insight into the mechanism of loss of balance (LOB). The method comprises eliciting an H-reflex protocol while subjects are standing which produces a contraction in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. We have also defined analytical techniques to provide biomarkers of balance control during perturbation. We used M-Max unilaterally or bilaterally and induced a forward or sideway perturbation. The vector analysis and the Equilibrium Point calculations defined here can quantify the amplitude, direction, and evolution of the perturbation.Clear patterns of loss of balance due to stimulation was observed. Compared to quiet standing, the density of the EPs substantially increased in the perturbation phase. Leftward stimulation produced significantly higher number of EPs compared to the bilateral stimulation condition which could be due to the fact that the left leg was the nondominant side in all our subjects.In this study we provide a proof-of-concept technique for examining recovery from perturbation. The advantage of this technique is that it provides a safe perturbation, is internally induced at the spinal cord level, and is free from other factors that might complicate the recovery analysis (e.g., locomotion and the integration of the spinal pattern generator and cutaneous pathways in mediating changes). We have shown that the perturbation induced by this method can be quantified as vectors. We have also shown that the density of instantaneous equilibrium points (EPs) could be a good biomarker for defining and examining the perturbation phase. Thus, this protocol and analysis provides a unique individual assessment of recovery which can be used to assess interventions. Finally, given that the maximal motor response is used as the perturbation (e.g., M-max) it is highly reliable and reproducible within an individual patient."
