https://openalex.org/W3202775836,"Due to the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is evolving in diverse human populations. Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it. We analyzed 1,036,030 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 30,806 NGS datasets from GISAID and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 2.5% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.6% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 5,472 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only 21 and 14 recurrent variants were found in at least 1% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 2.6% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition. These findings demonstrate the continuous importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies."

https://openalex.org/W3204262467,"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays play a central role in evaluating biomarker expression in tissue sections for diagnostic and research applications. Manual scoring of IHC images, which is the current standard of practice, is known to have several shortcomings in terms of reproducibility and scalability to large scale studies. Here, by using a digital image analysis-based approach, we introduce a new metric called the pixelwise H-score (pix H-score) that quantifies biomarker expression from whole-slide scanned IHC images. The pix H-score is an unsupervised algorithm that only requires the specification of intensity thresholds for the biomarker and the nuclear-counterstain channels. We present the detailed implementation of the pix H-score in two different whole-slide image analysis software packages Visiopharm and HALO. We consider three biomarkers P-cadherin, PD-L1, and 5T4, and show how the pix H-score exhibits tight concordance to multiple orthogonal measurements of biomarker abundance such as the biomarker mRNA transcript and the pathologist H-score. We also compare the pix H-score to existing automated image analysis algorithms and demonstrate that the pix H-score provides either comparable or significantly better performance over these methodologies. We also present results of an empirical resampling approach to assess the performance of the pix H-score in estimating biomarker abundance from select regions within the tumor tissue relative to the whole tumor resection. We anticipate that the new metric will be broadly applicable to quantify biomarker expression from a wide variety of IHC images. Moreover, these results underscore the benefit of digital image analysis-based approaches which offer an objective, reproducible, and highly scalable strategy to quantitatively analyze IHC images."
https://openalex.org/W3202704388,"In humans, insulin resistance has been linked to an impaired metabolic transition from fasting to feeding (metabolic flexibility; MetFlex). Previous studies suggest that mitochondrial dynamics response is a putative determinant of MetFlex; however, this has not been studied in humans. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the mitochondrial dynamics response in the metabolic transition from fasting to feeding in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Six male subjects fasted for 16 h (fasting), immediately after which they consumed a 75-g oral glucose load (glucose). In both fasting and glucose conditions, blood samples were taken to obtain PBMCs. Mitochondrial dynamics were assessed by electron microscopy images. We exposed in vitro acetoacetate-treated PBMCs to the specific IP3R inhibitor Xestospongin B (XeB) to reduce IP3R-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. This allowed us to evaluate the role of ER-mitochondria Ca2+ exchange in the mitochondrial dynamic response to substrate availability. To determine whether PBMCs could be used in obesity context (low MetFlex), we measured mitochondrial dynamics in mouse spleen-derived lymphocytes from WT and ob/ob mice. We demonstrated that the transition from fasting to feeding reduces mitochondria-ER interactions, induces mitochondrial fission and reduces mitochondrial cristae density in human PBMCs. In addition, we demonstrated that IP3R activity is key in the mitochondrial dynamics response when PBMCs are treated with a fasting-substrate in vitro. In murine mononuclear-cells, we confirmed that mitochondria-ER interactions are regulated in the fasted-fed transition and we further highlight mitochondria-ER miscommunication in PBMCs of diabetic mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the fasting/feeding transition reduces mitochondria-ER interactions, induces mitochondrial fission and reduces mitochondrial cristae density in human PBMCs, and that IP3R activity may potentially play a central role."
https://openalex.org/W3193793219,"The present study aimed to assess the influence of adding straw bales, step platforms, and laser projectors as environmental enrichment resources on the behaviour and welfare indicators of broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). A sample of 4,000 day-old male CobbÂ® 500 birds was used. The experimental treatments consisted of No Environmental Enrichment (NEE)-similar to a conventional environment; and Environmental Enrichment (EE)-environment enriched with straw bales, step platforms, and laser projectors, with four replicates per treatment of 500 animals. Behavioural characteristics (ethological observation through cameras, grab test, and modified touch test) and animal welfare indicators (pododermatitis and dorsal cranial myopathy) were assessed. The birds submitted to the EE treatment exhibited greater exploratory activity and expression of behaviours associated with comfort and welfare, whereas those in the NEE group were less active. Locomotion and play fighting behaviour decreased and behaviours associated with comfort increased as age advanced. The frequencies of interaction with laser spots and birds lying around straw bales were the highest in the 1st week (P<0.01). The behaviours of pecking at straw bales (P<0.0004), using the step platforms (P = 0.0001) and being on top of straw bales (P<0.0002) gradually increased. The chickens accessed the feeding troughs the most in the period of 0800 hours (P<0.0001) and expressed the highest frequencies of behaviours associated with comfort in the 1400 hours and 1700 hours periods. The birds in the EE group were calmer in face of human presence and touch and scored higher in animal welfare indicators. Adding straw bales, step platforms, and laser projectors increased locomotion, reduced expression of fear, and improved animal welfare indicators of broiler chickens."
https://openalex.org/W3202083968,"Bacterial communities colonized on submerged substrata are recognized as a key factor in the formation of complex biofouling phenomenon in the marine environment. Despite massive maritime activities and a large industrial sector in the nearshore of the Laccadive Sea, studies describing pioneer bacterial colonizers and community succession during the early-stage biofilm are scarce. We investigated the biofilm-forming bacterial community succession on three substrata viz. stainless steel, high-density polyethylene, and titanium over 15 days of immersion in the seawater intake area of a power plant, located in the southern coastal region of India. The bacterial community composition of biofilms and peripheral seawater were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq sequenced 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The obtained metataxonomic results indicated a profound influence of temporal succession over substrate type on the early-stage biofilm-forming microbiota. Bacterial communities showed vivid temporal dynamics that involved variations in abundant bacterial groups. The proportion of dominant phyla viz. Proteobacteria decreased over biofilm succession days, while Bacteroidetes increased, suggesting their role as initial and late colonizers, respectively. A rapid fluctuation in the proportion of two bacterial orders viz. Alteromonadales and Vibrionales were observed throughout the successional stages. LEfSe analysis identified specific bacterial groups at all stages of biofilm development, whereas no substrata type-specific groups were observed. Furthermore, the results of PCoA and UPGMA hierarchical clustering demonstrated that the biofilm-forming community varied considerably from the planktonic community. Phylum Proteobacteria preponderated the biofilm-forming community, while the Bacteroidetes , Cyanobacteria , and Actinobacteria dominated the planktonic community. Overall, our results refute the common assumption that substrate material has a decisive impact on biofilm formation; rather, it portrayed that the temporal succession overshadowed the influence of the substrate material. Our findings provide a scientific understanding of the factors shaping initial biofilm development in the marine environment and will help in designing efficient site-specific anti-biofouling strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3202313814,"To increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake in resistant populations, such as Republicans, focus groups suggest that it is best to de-politicize the issue by sharing five facts from a public health expert. Yet polls suggest that Trump voters trust former President Donald Trump for medical advice more than they trust experts. We conducted an online, randomized, national experiment among 387 non-vaccinated Trump voters, using two brief audiovisual artifacts from Spring 2021, either facts delivered by an expert versus political claims delivered by President Trump. Relative to the control group, Trump voters who viewed the video of Trump endorsing the vaccine were 85% more likely to answer âyesâ as opposed to ânoâ in their intention to get fully vaccinated (RRR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.40; P = .048). There were no significant differences between those hearing the public health expert excerpt and the control group (for âyesâ relative to ânoâ RRR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.12; P = .68). These findings suggest that a political speakerâs endorsement of the COVID-19 vaccine may increase uptake among those who identify with that speaker. Contrary to highly-publicized focus group findings, our randomized experiment found that an expertâs factually accurate message may not be effectual to increase vaccination intentions."
https://openalex.org/W3202340524,"An important approach in tumor therapy is combining substances with different action mechanisms aiming to enhance the antineoplastic effect, decrease the therapeutic dosage, and avoid resistance mechanisms. Moreover, evaluating compounds already approved for the treatment of non-neoplastic diseases is promising for new antineoplastic therapies. Sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) reactivates oxidative phosphorylation in the cancer cell mitochondria, reducing apoptosis resistance in cancer cells. Furthermore, metformin inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells and CD133+ cancer -stem-like cells. In the present study, we evaluated the independent and synergistic effect of metformin and DCA on the metabolic activity, cell proliferation, and apoptosis of a canine prostate adenocarcinoma (Adcarc1258) and a transitional cell carcinoma cell line (TCC1506) in comparison to a primary canine fibroblast culture. Determining metformin uptake in tumor cells was performed by quantitative HPLC. Depending on the dosage, metformin as a single agent inhibited the metabolic activity and cell proliferation of the tumor cells, showing only minor effects on the fibroblasts. Furthermore, 1 mM metformin increased apoptosis over 96 h in the tumor cell lines but not in fibroblasts. Additionally, metformin uptake into the tumor cells in vitro was measurable by quantitative HPLC. Synergistic effects for the combination therapy were observed in both neoplastic cell lines as well as in the fibroblasts. Based on these results, metformin might be a promising therapeutic agent for canine urogenital tumors. Further studies on kinetics, toxicology, bioavailability, and application of metformin in dogs are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3202861124,"Women's decision-making autonomy is very crucial for the improvement of women empowerment, and maternal, neonatal, and child healthcare utilization. As time immemorial, Ethiopian culture is largely gender stratified, and the position of women is subordinate to men in various household and health-seeking decision-making matters. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on women's decision-making autonomy, especially in the household and on maternal and newborn healthcare utilization. Therefore, this study assessed married women's decision-making autonomy in the household and on maternal and neonatal healthcare utilization and associated factors in Debretabor, Northwest Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 1st to 30th, 2019. A two-stage sampling technique was used to select 730 married women. Data were collected using a structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were entered into EPI INFO 7 and analyzed by SPSS version 23. Multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with women's decision-making autonomy in the household and maternal and neonatal healthcare utilization. The adjusted odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance at a p-value of â¤ 0.05.A total of 730 married women were included in the analysis. Thus, three-fourths (75.1%) of women had higher decision-making autonomy on their health, neonatal health, and other socio-economic aspects. Besides, the proportion of four and above antenatal visits, delivery at a health facility, postnatal checkup, knowledge of neonatal danger signs, and appropriate health-seeking practices for sick newborns among autonomous women were 52.1%, 56.1%, 71.4%, 32%, and 80% respectively. Age greater than 35 years old (AOR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.62), monthly income of > 5000 ETB (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.36, 7.07), husband involvement (AOR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.55, 3.43), and adequate knowledge of neonatal danger signs (AOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.4, 3.2) were factors independently associated with women's decision-making autonomy on maternal and neonatal healthcare utilization and other socio-economic affairs.Our findings show that women's decision-making autonomy in the household and maternal and neonatal healthcare utilization was optimal. Increasing household income level, promotion of husband's involvement starting from the prenatal period, and increasing women's knowledge of maternal and neonatal danger signs will have a great role in the improvement of women's decision-making autonomy."
https://openalex.org/W3203612488,"Human settlement environment is space places closely related to human production and life, and also surface spaces inseparable from human activities. As a coastal city in the east of China, Qingdao has a relatively high level of urbanization. However, it also along with many urban problems at the same time, among which the problem of human settlement environment has attracted more and more general attention from people. According to the characteristics of human settlement environment in Qingdao, the research constructs an index system with 10 index factors from natural factors and humanity factors, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation model. Evaluate and grade suitability of human settlement environment in Qingdao, explore the spatial aggregation and differentiation of the quality of human settlement environment, and reveal the internal connection of spatial evolution. The results indicate that the overall livability of Qingdao is relatively good, showing a multi-center and radial driving development. The distribution of livability is uneven, showing a decreasing spatial distribution law from the coast to the inland, and the quality of human settlement environment in Jiaozhou Bay and the coastal areas is relatively high. Qingdao is mainly based on natural livability, supplemented by humanity livability, compared with natural suitability, the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of humanity livability have experienced three stages: rising-contradictory rising-harmonious rising. The quality of human settlement environment has obvious spatial correlation and is positively correlated with the degree of agglomeration, and the agglomeration of blocks with a higher quality of human settlement environment is higher than that of blocks with a lower level. The rule of human settlement environment changing over time is that areas with high quality of human settlement environment begin to shift from the city center to the north and the south, transforming into multi-point development, and overall environmental suitability has been improved. According to the results of the comprehensive evaluation, combined with its local development status and policies, the research puts forward developmental suggestions for the construction of human settlement environment in Qingdao, and provides decision-making basis for relevant departments to solve the problem of deterioration of human settlement environment."
https://openalex.org/W3204664147,"The role of LOXL1 in fibrosis via mediating ECM crosslinking and stabilization is well established; however, the role of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)-specific LOXL1 in the development of fibrosis remains unknown. We generated HSCs-specific Loxl1-depleted mice (Loxl1Gfap-cre mice) to investigate the HSCs-specific contribution of LOXL1 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Loxl1fl/fl mice were used as the control. Furthermore, we used RNA sequencing to explore the underlying changes in the transcriptome. Results of the sirius red staining, type I collagen immunolabeling, and hydroxyproline content analysis, coupled with the reduced expression of profibrogenic genes revealed that Loxl1Gfap-cre mice with CCl4 -induced fibrosis exhibited decreased hepatic fibrosis. In addition, Loxl1Gfap-cre mice exhibited reduced macrophage tissue infiltration by CD68-positive cells and decreased expression of inflammatory genes compared with the controls. RNA sequencing identified integrin Î±8 (ITGA8) as a key modulator of LOXL1-mediated liver fibrosis. Functional analyses showed that siRNA silencing of Itga8 in cultured fibroblasts led to a decline in the LOXL1 expression and inhibition of fibroblast activation. Mechanistic analyses indicated that LOXL1 activated the FAK/PI3K/AKT/HIF1a signaling pathway, and the addition of inhibitors of FAK or PI3K reversed these results via downregulation of LOXL1. Furthermore, HIF1a directly interacted with LOXL1 and upregulated its expression, indicating that LOXL1 can positively self-regulate by forming a positive feedback loop with the FAK/PI3K/AKT/HIF1a pathway. We demonstrated that HSCs-specific Loxl1 deficiency prevented fibrosis, inflammation and that ITGA8/FAK/PI3K/AKT/HIF1a was essential for the function and expression of LOXL1. Knowledge of this approach can provide novel mechanisms and targets to treat fibrosis in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3203995108,"Blastocyst formation gives rise to the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) and is followed by the differentiation of the epiblast (Epi) and primitive endoderm (PrE) within the ICM. Although these two-round cell lineage differentiations underpin proper embryogenesis in every mammal, their spatiotemporal dynamics are quite diverse among species. Here, molecular details of the blastocyst stage in cattle were dissected using an optimized in vitro culture method. Blastocyst embryos were placed on agarose gel filled with nutrient-rich media to expose embryos to both gaseous and liquid phases. Embryos derived from this âon-gelâ culture were transferred to surrogate mothers on day (D) 10 after fertilization and successfully implanted. Immunofluorescent studies using on-gel-cultured embryos revealed that the proportion of TE cells expressing the pluripotent ICM marker, OCT4, which was beyond 80% on D8, was rapidly reduced after D9 and reached 0% on D9.5. This first lineage segregation process was temporally parallel with the second one, identified by the spatial separation of Epi cells expressing SOX2 and PrE cells expressing SOX17. RNA-seq comparison of TE cells from D8 in vitro fertilized embryos and D14 in vivo embryos revealed that besides drastic reduction of pluripotency-related genes, TE cells highly expressed Wnt, FGF, and VEGF signaling pathways-related genes to facilitate the functional maturation required for feto-maternal interaction. Quantitative PCR analysis of TE cells derived from on-gel culture further confirmed time-dependent increments in the expression of key TE markers. Altogether, the present study provides platforms to understand species-specific strategies for mammalian preimplantation development."
https://openalex.org/W3204464002,"Landfills provide seasonally reliable food resources to many bird species, including those perceived to be pest or invasive species. However, landfills often contain multiple habitat types that could attract diverse species, including those of conservation concern. To date, little is known about the characteristics and composition of bird communities at landfills relative to local and regional pools. Here we used the community science database eBird to extract avian species occurrence data at landfills across the US. We compared species richness and community similarity across space in comparison to similarly-sampled reference sites, and further quantified taxonomic and dietary traits of bird communities at landfills. While landfills harbored marginally lower species richness than reference sites (respective medians of 144 vs 160), landfill community composition, and its turnover across space, were similar to reference sites. Consistent with active waste disposal areas attracting birds, species feeding at higher trophic levels, especially gulls, were more frequently observed at landfills than reference sites. However, habitat specialists including two declining grassland species, Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), as well as migratory waterfowl, were more frequently encountered at landfills than reference sites. Together, these results suggest that landfills harbor comparable avian diversity to neighboring sites, and that habitats contained within landfill sites can support species of conservation concern. As covered landfills are rarely developed or forested, management of wetlands and grasslands at these sites represents an opportunity for conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3204420189,"Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is prevalent in symptomatic women with ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA). Urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) is a measure of renal microvascular endothelial dysfunction. Both are predictors of adverse cardiovascular events. It is unknown if CMD could be a manifestation of a systemic process. We evaluated the relationship between renal microvascular dysfunction and CMD as measured by invasive coronary function testing (CFT).We measured urine albumin and creatinine to provide UACR in 152 women enrolled in the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation-Coronary Vascular Dysfunction (WISE-CVD) study (2008-2015) with suspected INOCA who underwent CFT. Invasive CFT measures of endothelial and non-endothelial dependent coronary microvascular function were obtained. Subjects were divided into those with detectable (â¥20 mg/g) and undetectable urine albumin (<20 mg/g). The group mean age was 54 Â± 11 years, with a moderate cardiac risk factor burden including low diabetes prevalence, and a mean UACR of 12 Â± 55 mg/g (range 9.5-322.7 mg/g). Overall, coronary endothelial-dependent variables (change in coronary blood flow and coronary diameter in response to cold pressor testing) had significant inverse correlations with log UACR (r = -0.17, p = 0.05; r = -0.18, p = 0.03, respectively).Among women with INOCA and relatively low risk factor including diabetes burden, renal microvascular dysfunction, measured by UACR, is related to coronary endothelial-dependent CMD. These results suggest that coronary endothelial-dependent function may be a manifestation of a systemic process. Enhancing efferent arteriolar vasodilatation in both coronary endothelial-dependent function and renal microvascular dysfunction pose potential targets for investigation and treatment.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00832702."
https://openalex.org/W3201894094,"Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is one of the main causes of heart failure and sudden death in Latin America. To date, there is no available medication to prevent or reverse the onset of cardiac symptoms. CCC occurs in a scenario of disrupted calcium dynamics and enhanced oxidative stress, which combined, may favor the hyper activation of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII) pathway, which is fundamental for heart physiology and it is implicated in other cardiac diseases. Here, we evaluated the association between Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII in the electro-mechanical (dys)function of the heart in the early stage of chronic experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infection. We observed that in vitro and ex vivo inhibition of Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII reversed the arrhythmic profile of isolated hearts and isolated left-ventricles cardiomyocytes. The benefits of the limited Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII activation to cardiomyocytes' electrical properties are partially related to the restoration of Ca2+ dynamics in a damaged cellular environment created after T. cruzi infection. Moreover, Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII inhibition prevented the onset of arrhythmic contractions on isolated heart preparations of chagasic mice and restored the responsiveness to the increase in the left-ventricle pre-load. Taken together, our data provide the first experimental evidence for the potential of targeting Ca2+/CaM-CaMKII pathway as a novel therapeutic target to treat CCC."
https://openalex.org/W3203403349,"The epithelial tissues of the distal lung are continuously exposed to inhaled air, and are of research interest in studying respiratory exposure to both hazardous and therapeutic materials. Pharmaco-toxicological research depends on the development of sophisticated models of the alveolar epithelium, which better represent the different cell types present in the native lung and interactions between them. We developed an air-liquid interface (ALI) model of the alveolar epithelium which incorporates cell lines which bear features of type I (hAELVi) and type II (NCI-H441) epithelial cells. We compared morphology of single cells and the structure of cell layers of the two lines using light and electron microscopy. Working both in monotypic cultures and cocultures, we measured barrier function by trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and demonstrated that barrier properties can be maintained for 30 days. We created a mathematical model of TEER development over time based on these data in order to make inferences about the interactions occurring in these culture systems. We assessed expression of a panel of relevant genes that play important roles in barrier function and differentiation. The coculture model was observed to form a stable barrier akin to that seen in hAELVi, while expressing surfactant protein C, and having a profile of expression of claudins and aquaporins appropriate for the distal lung. We described cavities which arise within stratified cell layers in NCI-H441 and cocultured cells, and present evidence that these cavities represent an aberrant apical surface. In summary, our results support the coculture of these two cell lines to produce a model which better represents the breadth of functions seen in native alveolar epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W3203812817,"Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in circulation playing a key role in acute inflammation during microbial infections. Phagocytosis, one of the crucial defence mechanisms of neutrophils against pathogens, is amplified by chemotactic leukotriene (LT)B4 , which is biosynthesized via 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). However, extensive liberation of LTB4 can be destructive by over-intensifying the inflammatory process. While enzymatic biosynthesis of LTB4 is well characterized, less is known about molecular mechanisms that activate 5-LOX and lead to LTB4 formation during host-pathogen interactions. Here, we investigated the ability of the common opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans to induce LTB4 formation in neutrophils, and elucidated pathogen-mediated drivers and cellular processes that activate this pathway. We revealed that C. albicans-induced LTB4 biosynthesis requires both the morphological transition from yeast cells to hyphae and the expression of hyphae-associated genes, as exclusively viable hyphae or yeast-locked mutant cells expressing hyphae-associated genes stimulated 5-LOX by [Ca2+ ]i mobilization and p38 MAPK activation. LTB4 biosynthesis was orchestrated by synergistic activation of dectin-1 and Toll-like receptor 2, and corresponding signaling via SYK and MYD88, respectively. Conclusively, we report hyphae-specific induction of LTB4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils. This highlights an expanding role of neutrophils during inflammatory processes in the response to C. albicans infections."

To that end, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of food insecurity and associated factors among Urban Productive Safety Net Program (UPSNP) beneficiary households in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital city.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 624 UPSNP beneficiary households in nine districts of Addis Ababa from June to July 2019. A multi-stage sampling method was used; study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique after establishing the proportionally allocated sample size for 9 districts. Data were collected by trained personnel using a pretested, structured questionnaire. The outcome variable was food insecurity as measured by Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), a tool developed by the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Scale (FANTA) and validated for developing countries, including Ethiopia. A binary (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) logistic regression analysis were employed at 95% CI (confidence interval). From the bivariate analysis, factors having a p-value<0.25 were included in the multivariable analysis. From the multivariable analysis, any variable at p-value < 0.05 at 95% CI was declared significantly associated with household food insecurity. Model fitness was also checked using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test with p-value>0.05.The prevalence of household food insecurity was 77.1% [95%CI:73.8-80.7] during the month prior to the survey. Illiteracy of household head [AOR: 2.56; 95%CI:1.08-6.07], family size of 4 or more [AOR: 1.87, 95%CI:1.08-3.23], high dependency ratio [AOR: 3.95; 95%CI:1.31-11.90], household lack of access to credit [AOR:2.85; 95%CI:1.25-6.49], low household income [AOR: 4.72; 95%CI:2.32-9.60] and medium household income [AOR: 9.78; 95%CI:4.29-22.35] were significantly associated with household food insecurity.We found that three in four of Addis Ababa's UPSNP beneficiary households were food-insecure. Implementation of measures to improve household income, minimize the dependency ratio of households, and arrange access to credit services are paramount ways to tackle food insecurity problems in Addis Ababa."
https://openalex.org/W3204126442,"After a tissue is wounded, cells surrounding the wound adopt distinct wound-healing behaviors to repair the tissue. Considerable effort has been spent on understanding the signaling pathways that regulate immune and tissue-resident cells as they respond to wounds, but these signals must ultimately originate from the physical damage inflicted by the wound. Tissue wounds comprise several types of cellular damage, and recent work indicates that different types of cellular damage initiate different types of signaling. Hence to understand wound signaling, it is important to identify and localize the types of wound-induced cellular damage. Laser ablation is widely used by researchers to create reproducible, aseptic wounds in a tissue that can be live-imaged. Because laser wounding involves a combination of photochemical, photothermal and photomechanical mechanisms, each with distinct spatial dependencies, cells around a pulsed-laser wound will experience a gradient of damage. Here we exploit this gradient to create a map of wound-induced cellular damage. Using genetically-encoded fluorescent proteins, we monitor damaged cellular and sub-cellular components of epithelial cells in living Drosophila pupae in the seconds to minutes following wounding. We hypothesized that the regions of damage would be predictably arrayed around wounds of varying sizes, and subsequent analysis found that all damage radii are linearly related over a 3-fold range of wound size. Thus, around laser wounds, the distinct regions of damage can be estimated after measuring any one. This report identifies several different types of cellular damage within a wounded epithelial tissue in a living animal. By quantitatively mapping the size and placement of these different types of damage, we set the foundation for tracing wound-induced signaling back to the damage that initiates it."
https://openalex.org/W3204626560,"Introduction This study examined emergency department (ED) presentations of patients with end of life (EOL) conditions and patients having met and unmet palliative care needs were compared. Methods Presentations for EOL conditions were prospectively identified and screened for palliative care needs. Descriptive data were reported as proportions, means or medians. Bi-variable analysis for dichotomous and continuous variables were performed by chi-squared and T-tests (pâ¤0.01), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression model identified factors associated with having unmet palliative needs and reported adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Overall, 663 presentations for EOL conditions were identified; 518 (78%) involved patients with unmet palliative care needs. Presentations by patients with unmet palliative needs were more likely to involve consultations (80% vs. 67%, p = 0.001) and result in hospitalization (69% vs. 51%, p&lt;0.001) compared to patients whose palliative needs were met. Patients with unmet palliative care needs were more likely to have previous ED visits (73% unmet vs. 48% met; p&lt;0.001). While medication, procedures, investigations and imaging ordering were high across all patients with EOL conditions, there were no significant differences between the groups. Consultations with palliative specialists in the ED (6% unmet vs. 1% met) and following discharge (29% unmet vs. 18% met) were similarly uncommon. Patients having two or more EOL conditions (aOR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.16, 5.00), requiring hospitalization (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.87), and dying during the ED visit (aOR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.02, 4.53) were strongly associated with having unmet palliative care needs. Conclusions Most ED presentations for EOL conditions were made by patients with unmet palliative care needs, who were significantly more likely to require consultation, hospitalization, and to die. Referrals to palliative care services during and after the ED visit were infrequent, indicating important opportunities to promote these services."
https://openalex.org/W3204678932,"Many species of pathogenic bacteria secrete toxins that form pores in mammalian cell membranes. These membrane pores enable the delivery of virulence factors into cells, result in the leakage of molecules that bacteria can use as nutrients, and facilitate pathogen invasion. Inflammatory responses to bacteria are regulated by the side-chain-hydroxycholesterols 27-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol, but their effect on the intrinsic protection of cells against pore-forming toxins is unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that 27-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol help protect cells against pore-forming toxins. We treated bovine endometrial epithelial and stromal cells with 27-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol, and then challenged the cells with pyolysin, which is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin from Trueperella pyogenes that targets these endometrial cells. We found that treatment with 27-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol protected both epithelial and stomal cells against pore formation and the damage caused by pyolysin. The oxysterols limited pyolysin-induced leakage of potassium and lactate dehydrogenase from cells, and reduced cytoskeletal changes and cytolysis. This oxysterol cytoprotection against pyolysin was partially dependent on reducing cytolysin-accessible cholesterol in the cell membrane and on activating liver X receptors. Treatment with 27-hydroxycholesterol also protected the endometrial cells against Staphylococcus aureus Î±-hemolysin. Using mass spectrometry, we found 27-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol in uterine and follicular fluid. Furthermore, epithelial cells released additional 25-hydroxycholesterol in response to pyolysin. In conclusion, both 27-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol increased the intrinsic protection of bovine endometrial cells against pore-forming toxins. Our findings imply that side-chain-hydroxycholesterols may help defend the endometrium against pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3202565215,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the vasculature regulated by cytokines. We have previously shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) plays an important role in serine 727 phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) transactivation domain, which is required for maximal interferon-Î³ signaling, and the regulation of modified LDL uptake by macrophages in vitro. Unfortunately, the roles of ERK1/2 and STAT1 serine 727 phosphorylation in atherosclerosis are poorly understood and were investigated using ERK1 deficient mice (ERK2 knockout mice die in utero) and STAT1 knock-in mice (serine 727 replaced by alanine; STAT1 S727A). Mouse Atherosclerosis RTÂ² Profiler PCR Array analysis showed that ERK1 deficiency and STAT1 S727A modification produced significant changes in the expression of 18 and 49 genes, respectively, in bone marrow-derived macrophages, with 17 common regulated genes that included those that play key roles in inflammation and cell migration. Indeed, ERK1 deficiency and STAT1 S727A modification attenuated chemokine-driven migration of macrophages with the former also impacting proliferation and the latter phagocytosis. In LDL receptor deficient mice fed a high fat diet, both ERK1 deficiency and STAT1 S727A modification produced significant reduction in plaque lipid content, albeit at different time points. The STAT1 S727A modification additionally caused a significant reduction in plaque content of macrophages and CD3 T cells and diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy index. In addition, there was a significant increase in plasma IL-2 levels and a trend toward increase in plasma IL-5 levels. These studies demonstrate important roles of STAT1 S727 phosphorylation in particular in the regulation of atherosclerosis-associated macrophage processes in vitro together with plaque lipid content and inflammation in vivo, and support further assessment of its therapeutical potential."
https://openalex.org/W3202839015,"The study was aimed at investigating the mechanisms and structures which determine mechanical properties of skeletal muscles under gravitational unloading and plantar mechanical stimulation (PMS). We hypothesized that PMS would increase NO production and prevent an unloading-induced reduction in skeletal muscle passive stiffness. Wistar rats were hindlimb suspended and subjected to a daily PMS and one group of stimulated animals was also treated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME). Animals received mechanical stimulation of the feet for 4 h a day throughout 7-day hindlimb suspension (HS) according to a scheme that mimics the normal walking of the animal. Seven-day HS led to a significant reduction in soleus muscle weight by 25%. However, PMS did not prevent the atrophic effect induced by HS. Gravitational unloading led to a significant decrease in maximum isometric force and passive stiffness by 38% and 31%, respectively. The use of PMS prevented a decrease in the maximum isometric strength of the soleus muscle. At the same time, the passive stiffness of the soleus in the PMS group significantly exceeded the control values by 40%. L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) administration attenuated the effect of PMS on passive stiffness and maximum force of the soleus muscle. The content of the studied cytoskeletal proteins (Î±-actinin-2, Î±-actinin-3, desmin, titin, nebulin) decreased after 7-day HS, but this decrease was successfully prevented by PMS in a NOS-dependent manner. We also observed significant decreases in mRNA expression levels of Î±-actinin-2, desmin, and titin after HS, which was prevented by PMS. The study also revealed a significant NOS-dependent effect of PMS on the content of collagen-1a, but not collagen-3a. Thus, PMS during mechanical unloading is able to maintain soleus muscle passive tension and force as well as mRNA transcription and protein contents of cytoskeletal proteins in a NOS-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3204172456,"Organism scale mechanical forces elicit cellular scale changes through coordinated regulation of multiple signaling pathways. The mechanisms by which cells integrate signaling to generate a unified biological response remains a major question in mechanobiology. For example, the mechanosensitive response of bone and other tissues requires coordinated signaling by the transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) and Wnt pathways through mechanisms that are not well-defined. Here we report a new microRNA-dependent mechanism that mediates mechanosensitive crosstalk between TGFÎ² and Wnt signaling in osteocytes exposed to fluid shear stress (FSS). From 60 mechanosensitive microRNA (miRs) identified by small-RNAseq, miR100 expression is suppressed by in vivo hindlimb loading in the murine tibia and by cellular scale FSS in OCY454 cells. Though FSS activates both TGFÎ² and Wnt signaling in osteocytes, only TGFÎ² represses miR-100 expression. miR-100, in turn, antagonizes Wnt signaling by targeting and inhibiting expression of Frizzled receptors (FZD5/FZD8). Accordingly, miR-100 inhibition blunts FSS- and TGFÎ²-inducible Wnt signaling. Therefore, our results identify FSS-responsive miRNAs in osteocytes, including one that integrates the mechanosensitive function of two essential signaling pathways in the osteoanabolic response of bone to mechanical load."
https://openalex.org/W3204825146,"The cornea of the eye differs from other mucosal surfaces in that it lacks a viable bacterial microbiome and by its unusually high density of sensory nerve endings. Here, we explored the role of corneal nerves in preventing bacterial adhesion. Pharmacological and genetic methods were used to inhibit the function of corneal sensory nerves or their associated transient receptor potential cation channels TRPA1 and TRPV1. Impacts on bacterial adhesion, resident immune cells, and epithelial integrity were examined using fluorescent labeling and quantitative confocal imaging. TRPA1/TRPV1 double gene-knockout mice were more susceptible to adhesion of environmental bacteria and to that of deliberately-inoculated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Supporting the involvement of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing corneal nerves, P. aeruginosa adhesion was also promoted by treatment with bupivacaine, or ablation of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing nerves using RTX. Moreover, TRPA1/TRPV1-dependent defense was abolished by enucleation which severs corneal nerves. High-resolution imaging showed normal corneal ultrastructure and surface-labeling by wheat-germ agglutinin for TRPA1/TRPV1 knockout murine corneas, and intact barrier function by absence of fluorescein staining. P. aeruginosa adhering to corneas after perturbation of nerve or TRPA1/TRPV1 function failed to penetrate the surface. Single gene-knockout mice showed roles for both TRPA1 and TRPV1, with TRPA1-/- more susceptible to P. aeruginosa adhesion while TRPV1-/- corneas instead accumulated environmental bacteria. Corneal CD45+/CD11c+ cell responses to P. aeruginosa challenge, previously shown to counter bacterial adhesion, also depended on TRPA1/TRPV1 and sensory nerves. Together, these results demonstrate roles for corneal nerves and TRPA1/TRPV1 in corneal resistance to bacterial adhesion in vivo and suggest that the mechanisms involve resident immune cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W3202364969,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in American men. Several therapies have been developed to treat advanced prostate cancer, but these therapies often have severe side effects. To improve the outcome with fewer side effects we focused on the furanocoumarin bergamottin, a natural product found in grapefruit juice and a potent CYP3A inhibitor. Our recent studies have shown that CYP3A5 inhibition can block androgen receptor (AR) signaling, critical for prostate cancer growth. We observed that bergamottin reduces prostate cancer (PC) cell growth by decreasing both total and nuclear AR (AR activation) reducing downstream AR signaling. Bergamottinâs role in reducing AR activation was confirmed by confocal microscopy studies and reduction in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, which is a marker for prostate cancer. Further studies revealed that bergamottin promotes cell cycle block and accumulates G0/G1 cells. The cell cycle block was accompanied with reduction in cyclin D, cyclin B, CDK4, P-cdc2 (Y15) and P-wee1 (S642). We also observed that bergamottin triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines as evident by TUNEL staining and PARP cleavage. Our data suggests that bergamottin may suppress prostate cancer growth, especially in African American (AA) patients carrying wild type CYP3A5 often presenting aggressive disease."
https://openalex.org/W3203000654,"Studies investigating the neural mechanisms of time perception often measure brain activity while participants perform a temporal task. However, several of these studies are based exclusively on tasks in which time is relevant, making it hard to dissociate activity related to decisions about time from other task-related patterns. In the present study, human participants performed a temporal or color discrimination task of visual stimuli. Participants were informed which magnitude they would have to judge before or after presenting the two stimuli (S1 and S2) in different blocks. Our behavioral results showed, as expected, that performance was better when participants knew beforehand which magnitude they would judge. Electrophysiological data (EEG) was analysed using Linear Discriminant Contrasts (LDC) and a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) approach to investigate whether and when information about time and color was encoded. During the presentation of S1, we did not find consistent differences in EEG activity as a function of the task. On the other hand, during S2, we found that temporal and color information was encoded in a task-relevant manner. Taken together, our results suggest that task goals strongly modulate decision-related information in EEG activity."
https://openalex.org/W3204109296,"This paper aims to investigate the association between perceived production risk of horticultural farms and access to finance from different finance providers. The collection of data was conducted among 434 farmers in Indonesia particularly farmers produced mango, mangosteen, chili and red onion. Production risk was measured by the coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis and the 25th percentile. Depending on the risk measure, a lower production risk was found for commercial credit from banks and flexible payments of inputs to kiosks. Conversely, we did not find any lower production risk associated with finance provided by farmers' associations and other sources such as family and friends. Results of this study are useful for policy makers, finance providers and supply chain actors in agriculture. For policy makers, the results of this study can help in designing policy to enhance farmers' access to finance, whereas finance providers and supply chain actors, such as traders, obtain insight into whether their financial provisions effectively reduce production risk."
https://openalex.org/W3204480324,"The equity of transport accessibility is a prerequisite for sustainable development targets, especially in the ecologically fragile area of the Tibetan Plateau (also known as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau). The relationship between transportation supply and social demand has become a key element of socioeconomic development and environmental protection in agricultural and pastoral areas. Based on data from transportation networks, permanent populations and the economy, this study uses a network analysis model, the coefficient of variation and the Gini coefficient to construct an index of social demand in townships and analyse the equity of transport accessibility on the Tibetan Plateau between 1980 and 2017; the principle of geographic distribution and the spatial relationship between transport accessibility and social demand at the township scale are also discussed. This study finds the following: the development of transportation has improved accessibility on the Tibetan Plateau, creating a highly accessible region with important cities as the nodes and major traffic arteries as the axes; both the coefficient of variation of transport accessibility and the Gini coefficient have increased slightly; and the equity of transport accessibility among townships on the Tibetan Plateau has exhibited a downward trend. Further, the social demand index is doubling every ten years, the spatial distribution has regional characteristics, and a decrease in permanent populations is the main reason for declining social demand index scores among townships. Townships with the lowest and highest social demand index scores for transportation development enjoy greater transportation benefits; there is a significant spatial relationship between social demand and location conditions (potential accessibility); the aggregation of social demand and accessibility types follows specific geographical distribution principles; and the Mangya-Gongshan Line delineates the distribution characteristics of township clusters with low social demand and low accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W3201675369,"Advances in bio-logging technology for wildlife monitoring have expanded our ability to study space use and behavior of many animal species at increasingly detailed scales. However, such data can be challenging to analyze due to autocorrelation of GPS positions. As a case study, we investigated spatiotemporal movements and habitat selection in the little owl (Athene noctua), a bird species that is declining in central Europe and verges on extinction in Denmark. We equipped 6 Danish food-supplemented little owls and 6 non-supplemented owls in the Czech Republic with high-resolution GPS loggers that recorded one position per minute. Nightly space use, measured as 95% kernel density estimates, of Danish male owls were on average 62 ha (Â± 64 SD, larger than any found in previous studies) compared to 2 ha (Â± 1) in females, and to 3 Â± 1 ha (males) versus 3 Â± 5 ha (females) in the Czech Republic. Foraging Danish male owls moved on average 4-fold further from their nest and at almost double the distance per hour than Czech males. To create availability data for the habitat selection analysis, we accounted for high spatiotemporal autocorrelation of the GPS data by simulating correlated random walks with the same autocorrelation structure as the actual little owl movement trajectories. We found that habitat selection was similar between Danish and Czech owls, with individuals selecting for short vegetation and areas with high structural diversity. Our limited sample size did not allow us to infer patterns on a population level, but nevertheless demonstrates how high-resolution GPS data can help to identify critical habitat requirements to better formulate conservation actions on a local scale."
https://openalex.org/W3202370382,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic illuminated the benefits of telemedicine. Self-collected specimens are a promising alternative to clinician-collected specimens when in-person testing is not feasible. In this study, we assessed the adequacy of self-collected pharyngeal and rectal specimens for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae among individuals undergoing chlamydia and gonorrhea screening. Methods We used data from a large cohort study that included male and female adolescents between the ages of 12â24 years. We considered self-collected specimens adequate for clinical use if the human synthase gene (a control target of the assay) was detected in the specimen. Results In total, 2,458 specimens were included in the analysis. The human synthase gene was detected in 99.2% (2,439/2,458) of all self-collected specimens, 99.5% (1,108/1,114) of the pharyngeal specimens, and 99.0% (1,331/1,344) of the rectal specimens. Conclusion Self-collected pharyngeal and rectal specimens demonstrated a very high proportion of human gene presence, suggesting that self-collection was accurate. A limitation of this study is that the sample adequacy control detects the presence or absence of the human hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene, but it does not indicate the specific anatomic origin of the human hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene. Self-collected specimens may be an appropriate alternative to clinician-collected specimens."
https://openalex.org/W3202473621,"Background Compassion fatigue is associated with negative consequences that undermine workplace performance. However, literature is scarce on compassion fatigue among nurses in the context of Uganda who are at higher risk of compassion fatigue owed to the nature of their occupation and the unfavorable work environment. We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of compassion fatigue among nurses in Northern Uganda. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 395 randomly selected nurses from two referral and four general hospitals in Northern Uganda. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and logistic regression at a 95% level of significance in SPSS version 25. Results Of 395 nurses who took part in the study, 58.2% were female, 39.8% had a diploma, 47.1% were single, and 32.4% had worked for between 11â15 years. Close to 50% of the nurses experienced compassion fatigue. The predictors of compassion fatigue among the participants were; workplace bullying (AOR: 3.83; 95% CI: 1.99â7.36; p = &lt;0.001) career enhancement opportunities (AOR: 9.16; 95% CI: 2.32â36.22; p = 0.002; and remuneration (AOR: 7.30; 95% CI: 2.73â19.49; p = &lt;0.001). Conclusion More than 3 in 4 nurses in Northern Uganda experience compassion fatigue. The Ministry of Health together with other stakeholders should strive to increase career enhancement opportunities for nurses, improve nursesâ remuneration and improve the overall workplace environment to prevent compassion fatigue among nurses in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3203381696,"Information represented by principal neurons in anterior piriform cortex (APC) is regulated by local, recurrent excitation and inhibition, but the circuit mechanisms remain elusive. Two types of layer 2 (L2) principal neurons, semilunar (SL), and superficial pyramidal (SP) cells, are parallel output channels, and the control of their activity gates the output of APC. Here, we examined the hypothesis that recurrent inhibition differentially regulates SL and SP cells. Patterned optogenetic stimulation revealed that the strength of recurrent inhibition is target- and layer-specific: L1 > L3 for SL cells, but L3 > L1 for SP cells. This target- and layer-specific inhibition was largely attributable to the parvalbumin (PV), but not somatostatin, interneurons. Intriguingly, olfactory experience selectively modulated the PV to SP microcircuit while maintaining the overall target and laminar specificity of inhibition. Together, these results indicate the importance of target-specific inhibitory wiring for odor processing, implicating these mechanisms in gating the output of piriform cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3203407271,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are house-keeping enzymes that are essential for protein synthesis. However, it has become increasingly evident that some aaRSs also have non-translational functions. Here we report the identification of a non-translational function of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) in myogenic differentiation. We find that ThrRS negatively regulates myoblast differentiation in vitro and injury-induced skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo. This function is independent of amino acid binding or aminoacylation activity of ThrRS, and knockdown of ThrRS leads to enhanced differentiation without affecting the global protein synthesis rate. Furthermore, we show that the non-catalytic new domains (UNE-T and TGS) of ThrRS are both necessary and sufficient for the myogenic function. In searching for a molecular mechanism of this new function, we find the kinase JNK to be a downstream target of ThrRS. Our data further reveal MEKK4 and MKK4 as upstream regulators of JNK in myogenesis and the MEKK4-MKK4-JNK pathway to be a mediator of the myogenic function of ThrRS. Finally, we show that ThrRS physically interacts with Axin1, disrupts Axin1-MEKK4 interaction and consequently inhibits JNK signaling. In conclusion, we uncover a non-translational function for ThrRS in the maintenance of homeostasis of skeletal myogenesis and identify the Axin1-MEKK4-MKK4-JNK signaling axis to be an immediate target of ThrRS action."

However, there are few studies on the risk level of MetS and affecting factors among adults living in rural Mongolia. This study aims to explore the relationship between socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, emotional state, and social support on the risk level of MetS prevalence among adults living in rural Mongolia.In this cross-sectional study, 143 adults living in the soum area of Dondgovi aimag in Mongolia were recruited. Data collection was conducted from July 2 to 3, 2019. The self-reported questionnaires including socio-demographic, clinical characteristics and emotional status, anthropometric tests using the InBody, and blood sampling tests were conducted. The number of individual diagnostic criteria met was scored as a MetS risk score and classified into 6 groups, from the lowest score of 0 to the highest score of 5. The ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting the risk of MetS.The prevalence of MetS among adults living in rural Mongolia was 58.0%, and the mean MetS risk score was 2.70Â±1.34 points. In the ordinal logistic regression analysis, age, regular exercise of moderate intensity or higher, InBody score reflecting obesity or sarcopenia, and depression level were statistically significantly associated with the risk score for MetS.Our study demonstrated that MetS risk levels among adults living in rural Mongolia with limited medical resources were strongly associated with demographic characteristics, body composition and emotional health condition, particularly depression."
https://openalex.org/W3203771644,"Children with hypoplastic lung disease associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) continue to suffer significant morbidity and mortality secondary to progressive pulmonary disease. Recently published work from our lab demonstrated the potential of Roxadustat (FG-4592), a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, as a treatment for CDH-associated pulmonary hypoplasia. Treatment with Roxadustat led to significantly accelerated compensatory lung growth (CLG) through downregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), an anti-angiogenic factor, rather than upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PEDF and its role in pulmonary development is a largely unexplored field. In this study, we sought to further evaluate the role of PEDF in accelerating CLG. PEDF-deficient mice demonstrated significantly increased lung volume, total lung capacity, and alveolarization compared to wild type controls following left pneumonectomy without increased VEGF expression. Furthermore, Roxadustat administration in PEDF-deficient mice did not further accelerate CLG. Human microvascular endothelial lung cells (HMVEC-L) and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEC) similarly demonstrated decreased PEDF expression with Roxadustat administration. Additionally, downregulation of PEDF in Roxadustat-treated HMVEC-L and HPAEC, a previously unreported finding, speaks to the potential translatability of Roxadustat from small animal studies. Taken together, these findings further suggest that PEDF downregulation is the primary mechanism by which Roxadustat accelerates CLG. More importantly, these data highlight the critical role PEDF may have in pulmonary growth and development, a previously unexplored field."

The purpose of this study was therefore to explore the experience of motherhood and taking care of children in women with ESKD. Methods A qualitative exploratory study was conducted based on an interpretive framework. Participants were recruited using non-probabilistic purposeful sampling. In total, 14 women with ESKD were included, who were treated at the dialysis unit of a Spanish hospital. In-depth interviews (unstructured and semi-structured interviews) and researchersâ field notes were used to collect the data. A systematic text condensation analysis was performed. The techniques performed and application procedures used to control trustworthiness were credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Results Three themes emerged from the data. âCoping with being a motherâ described how women are faced with the decision to become mothers and assess the risks of pregnancy. The second theme, called âChildren and the experience of illnessâ, highlighted the womenâs struggle to prevent the disease from affecting their children emotionally or disrupting their lives. The third theme, âFear of genetic transmissionâ, was based on the womenâs fear of passing the disease on to their children. Conclusions Deciding to become a mother and taking care of children represents a challenge for women with ESKD, coupled with the losses in their lives caused by the disease. These findings are only relevant to women on dialysis."

Sectors in infrastructure, trade, capital, and people's mindset intimacy also contribute to construct a symbiosis mechanism for capacity cooperation between the two nations."
https://openalex.org/W3204562400,"In mammalian testes, extensive remodeling of the microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons takes place in Sertoli cells across the seminiferous epithelium to support spermatogenesis. However, the mechanism(s) involving regulatory and signaling proteins remains poorly understood. Herein, A-kinase anchoring protein 9 (AKAP9, a member of the AKAP multivalent scaffold protein family) was shown to be one of these crucial regulatory proteins in the rat testis. Earlier studies have shown that AKAP9 serves as a signaling platform by recruiting multiple signaling and regulatory proteins to create a large protein complex that binds to the Golgi and centrosome to facilitate the assembly of the MT-nucleating Î³-tubulin ring complex to initiate MT polymerization. We further expanded our earlier studies based on a Sertoli cell-specific AKAP9 knockout mouse model to probe the function of AKAP9 by using the techniques of immunofluorescence analysis, RNA interference (RNAi), and biochemical assays on an in vitro primary Sertoli cell culture model, and an adjudin-based animal model. AKAP9 robustly expressed across the seminiferous epithelium in adult rat testes, colocalizing with MT-based tracks, and laid perpendicular across the seminiferous epithelium, and prominently expressed at the Sertoli-spermatid cell-cell anchoring junction (called apical ectoplasmic specialization [ES]) and at the Sertoli cell-cell interface (called basal ES, which together with tight junction [TJ] created the blood-testis barrier [BTB]) stage specifically. AKAP9 knockdown in Sertoli cells by RNAi was found to perturb the TJ-permeability barrier through disruptive changes in the distribution of BTB-associated proteins at the Sertoli cell cortical zone, mediated by a considerable loss of ability to induce both MT polymerization and actin filament bundling. A considerable decline in AKAP9 expression and a disruptive distribution of AKAP9 across the seminiferous tubules was also noted during adjudin-induced germ cell (GC) exfoliation in this animal model, illustrating AKAP9 is essential to maintain the homeostasis of cytoskeletons to maintain Sertoli and GC adhesion in the testis."
https://openalex.org/W3201905094,"Objectives Research is a core competency of a modern-day doctor and evidence-based practice underpins a career in medicine. Early exposure encourages graduates to embed research in their medical career and improves graduate attributes and student experience. However, there is wide variability of research and scholarly experiences offered in medicals schools, many developed with a significant degree of pragmatism based on resources and financial and time constraints. We examined undergraduate medical studentsâ awareness and experience of research throughout their degree to provide recommendations for implementation and improvement of research and scholarly experiences. Method Focus groups were conducted with medical students at all five stages of the medical degree programme. Data was coded to facilitate qualitative analysis for identification of important themes from each stage. Results Students reported positive impacts of research on undergraduate experience, future career and society in general. Two important themes emerged from the data, the opportunity for research and timing of research experiences. Early-stage students were concerned by their lack of experience and opportunity, whereas later-stage students identified the importance of research to employability, personal development and good medical practice, but ironically suggested it should be integrated in early stages of the course due to limitations of time. Conclusions Students provided feedback for improving research and scholarly experiences, ideally involving early exposure, a clear programme overview, with equality of access and a longitudinal approach. An emerging framework is proposed summarising the important issues identified by students and the positive impacts research experiences provide for them. These recommendations can be applied to both existing and new research programmes to provide a student-centred approach designed to augment the studentsâ critical analysis, inspire life-long learning, enhance the student experience and inevitably train better physicians."

After the operation, normal saline, various concentrations of BMI1008, lidocaine with a fixed concentration of BMI-L, and BMI-L with a fixed concentration of lidocaine were injected at the incision site. The preventive analgesic effect was evaluated using BMI1008 administered 30 min before and immediately after the operation. In addition, BMI1008 was compared with positive controls using intraperitoneal ketorolac 30 mg/kg and fentanyl 0.5 Î¼g/kg. The mechanical withdrawal threshold was measured with a von Frey filament.The analgesic effect according to the concentration of BMI1008, lidocaine with a fixed concentration of BMI-L, and BMI-L with a fixed concentration of lidocaine showed a concentration-dependent response and statistically significant difference among the groups (P <0.001, P <0.001, and P <0.001, respectively). The analgesic effect according to the time point of administration (before and after the operation) showed no evidence of a statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.170). Compared with the positive control groups, the results showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.024).BMI1008 showed its analgesic effect in a rat model of incisional pain in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, BMI-L showed an additive effect on the analgesic effect of lidocaine."

The Vibration Actuating Search Task (VAST) is a novel open-field task in which gradient floor vibration provides motivation for the rodent to navigate in the direction of diminishing vibration to an unmarked target destination. Using floor vibration as a motivational stimulus may overcome several of the potential confounds associated with stimuli used in other tasks. In a series of three experiments, we determined whether (1) rats exhibit place preference for floor vibration over other aversive stimuli (i.e., water, foot shock, and bright light), (2) exposure to floor vibration is associated with a lower corticosterone response than exposure to these other stimuli, (3) rats successfully acquire the VAST, and (4) VAST performance is sensitive to 6 h of sleep deprivation (SD). Our results showed that rats exhibited place preference for vibration over water, foot shock, and bright light environments, and that corticosterone levels were lower in rats exposed to vibration than those exposed to water. VAST performance also significantly improved over two days of testing for some metrics, and SD impaired VAST performance. Overall, we conclude that (1) rats exhibit place preference for vibration over other stimuli commonly used to motivate task performance, (2) the vibrations employed by the VAST produce lower concentrations of circulating corticosterone than forced swimming, (3) rats can learn to use gradient floor vibration as a mode of performance feedback within two days of testing, and (4) VAST performance is substantially impaired by SD. Thus, the VAST is an effective and practical testbed for studying the mechanisms by which SD causes deficits in feedback-dependent decision making."

However, both techniques require skill and training to make the operator capable to do it. The learning curve allows the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the number of attempts and minimum time for the surgical procedure. The objective included establish the learning curve for laparoscopy-guided kidney biopsy procedures in dog and pig corpses. Six dogs and six pigs corpses weighing less than 10 kg were used for this study. All corpses underwent kidney biopsy performed through laparoscopy. Twenty-four operators, two per animal, performed 20 renal biopsies each (10 for each kidney), with 480 collection-procedures in total. Duration and difficulty of the procedure and the biopsy sample quality were evaluated and statistical analysis was performed using a mixed regression model with a random effect of individuals and multivariate analysis of data. There were 91.5% of the samples that were adequate for evaluation. There was no significant difference in the number of glomeruli or cortex percentage considering the attempts in either species, demonstrating the operatorâs ability since first collection. Swine samples showed higher amounts of renal cortex than canine samples. The procedure duration was shorter as more attempts were performed in dogs and pigs. From the fourth repetition, the professional reached a plateau for the variable related to âcollectionâ, and from the second, the professional presented uniform duration for âsample storageâ. Operators of the swine model acquired more agility than the dog ones. The variable âdifficultyâ decreased as more repetitions were performed, reaching a plateau in the sixth attempt. Seven renal biopsies laparoscopy-guided are required for an operator to be considered âcapableâ to perform the procedure in the referred species included. The learning curve for image-guided kidney biopsy procedures improves the implementation of this technique and benefits patients that undergo this procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3201795316,"Identification of medical conditions using claims data is generally conducted with algorithms based on subject-matter knowledge. However, these claims-based algorithms (CBAs) are highly dependent on the knowledge level and not necessarily optimized for target conditions. We investigated whether machine learning methods can supplement researchers' knowledge of target conditions in building CBAs. Retrospective cohort study using a claims database combined with annual health check-up results of employees' health insurance programs for fiscal year 2016-17 in Japan (study population for hypertension, N = 631,289; diabetes, N = 152,368; dyslipidemia, N = 614,434). We constructed CBAs with logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, penalized logistic regression, tree-based model, and neural network for identifying patients with three common chronic conditions: hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. We then compared their association measures using a completely hold-out test set (25% of the study population). Among the test cohorts of 157,822, 38,092, and 153,608 enrollees for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, 25.4%, 8.4%, and 38.7% of them had a diagnosis of the corresponding condition. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of the logistic regression with/without subject-matter knowledge about the target condition were .923/.921 for hypertension, .957/.938 for diabetes, and .739/.747 for dyslipidemia. The logistic lasso, logistic elastic-net, and tree-based methods yielded AUCs comparable to those of the logistic regression with subject-matter knowledge: .923-.931 for hypertension; .958-.966 for diabetes; .747-.773 for dyslipidemia. We found that machine learning methods can attain AUCs comparable to the conventional knowledge-based method in building CBAs."
https://openalex.org/W3201798857,"Background Social anxiety disorder (SAD) develops in the early teens and is a common disorder among university students. Understanding the predictive factors of SAD comorbid with major depressive episode (MDE) is important for student mental health care. The aim of this study was to identify the personality traits that predict SAD with MDE by analyzing longitudinal data of Japanese university students. Methods In this retrospective study, Japanese university students who visited the health care center of Hokkaido University for the first time were divided into the following four groups: âControlâ (n = 43), âMDEâ (n = 16), âSADâ (n = 28), and âSAD with MDEâ (n = 61) based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and core anxiety symptoms for SAD in the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview during screening. Predictors for SAD with MDE were identified by a four-group comparison of the Temperament and Character Inventory and PHQ-9 data previously obtained at the enrollment using analysis of variance and post-hoc tests. Results Upon comparing the four groups using analysis of variance, there were significant differences in the baseline PHQ-9 summary score, Harm-Avoidance (HA), and Self-Directedness (SD). According to results of the post-hoc test, all three showed a significant difference between the âControlâ and âSAD with MDE.â Furthermore, there was a significant difference in HA scores between âSADâ and âControl.â In all the groups, the mean time from enrollment to the first visit to the center was &gt;2 years. Conclusion A higher HA score at baseline is a predictor of SAD with or without MDE. Higher PHQ-9 summary and lower SD scores at baseline are predictive factors of SAD with MDE."
https://openalex.org/W3202282796,"Introduction Mildly symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in previously-well individuals form the majority of infections and also serve as potent vectors of transmission. The factors affecting the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral shedding (DVS) in these patients remain largely unknown. Objectives To perform a systematic analysis of the clinical, radiologic, laboratory investigations in patients with few comorbidities infected with mild Covid-19 to identify factors associated with the DVS. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, patients with mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 were included. Baseline characteristics including age, nationality, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and type of isolation arrangement in the facility (single or in pairs) were collected. Clinical features and radiologic/haematologic findings were also collected. Taking day 28 as the cut-off, 187 patients who had a negative swab result up to day 28 (no prolonged DVS) were compared to 126 patients with a persistently positive result on or after day 28 (prolonged DVS). Results Of 964 consecutive patients included, 851 (88.3%) patients were symptomatic. 266 patients had a documented negative RT-PCR assay with a median DVS of 25 days (range: 13 to 96 days; interquartile range (IQR): 22 to 33 days). Patients isolated in pairs were associated with prolonged DVS (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.7 to 4.5; p&lt;0.0001) compared to those isolated individually. Among vital signs, only tachycardia was associated with prolonged DVS (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.0 to 7.1; p = 0.03). Amongst investigations, only a raised CRP was associated with prolonged DVS (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 6.8; p = 0.02). Conclusions In young, mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients, prolonged DVS was associated with being isolated in pairs compared to individually. In situations where a negative RT-PCR test result is required, retesting in patients who were not isolated individually, or who had baseline tachycardia or a raised CRP, may be delayed to increase the yield of a negative result."
https://openalex.org/W3203704613,"The internal flow and macroscopic spray behaviors of a fuel injection process were studied with schlieren spray techniques and simulations. The injection pressures(Pin)and ambient pressures(Pout)were applied in a wide range. The results showed that increasing the Pin is likely to decrease the flow performance of the nozzle. Furthermore, increasing the Pin can increase the spray tip penetration. However, the effect of Pin on the spray cone angle was not evident. The spray cone angle at an injection pressure of 160MPa was 21.7% greater than at a pressure of 100MPa during the initial spraying stage. Additionally, the discharge coefficient increased under high Pout, and the decrease in Pout can promote the formation of cavitation. Finally, increasing the Pout can decrease the penetration, while the spray angle becomes wider, especially at the initial spray stage, and high Pout will enhance the interaction of the spray and the air, which can enhance the spray quality."
https://openalex.org/W3203891618,"Previous reports indicate that Cdc42-interacting protein-4 (CIP4) has previously been reported to plays an important role in the progression of various cancers. However, its correlation with laryngeal cancer (LC) remains unreported. Data from TCGA and GEO databases were used to evaluate the role of CIP4 in LC. Based on GEO and TCGA datasets, we analyzed the differences in CIP4 expression between normal and tumor samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the relationship between clinical features and CIP4. Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to identify the clinical characteristics associated with the overall survival. Also, the GEPIA database was used to confirm the relationship between CIP4 and overall survival. Lastly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed based on the TCGA dataset. CIP4 expression in LC was significantly associated with gender and tumor stage (p-values<0.05). Similar to GEPIA validation, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that LC with CIP4-low exhibited a worse prognosis than that with CIP4-high. Univariate analysis revealed that CIP4-high significantly correlated with better overall survival (HR: 0.522, 95% CI: 0.293-0.830, P = 0.026). Besides, multivariate analysis revealed that CIP4 remained independently associated with the overall survival (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.326-0.912, P = 0.012). GSEA showed that the p53, WNT signaling, TGF-Î² signaling pathways, etc. were enriched in a phenotype high CIP4 expression. In summary, the CIP4 gene is a potential prognostic molecular marker for patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. Moreover, the p53, WNT signaling, and TGF-Î² signaling pathways are potentially associated with CIP4 in LC."
