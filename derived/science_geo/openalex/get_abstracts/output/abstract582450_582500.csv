https://openalex.org/W2596424078,"Conventional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies for major depression are associated with limited adherence to care and relatively low remission rates. Yoga may offer an alternative treatment option, but rigorous studies are few. This randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessors examined an 8-week hatha yoga intervention as mono-therapy for mild-to-moderate major depression.Investigators recruited 38 adults in San Francisco meeting criteria for major depression of mild-to-moderate severity, per structured psychiatric interview and scores of 14-28 on Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). At screening, individuals engaged in psychotherapy, antidepressant pharmacotherapy, herbal or nutraceutical mood therapies, or mind-body practices were excluded. Participants were 68% female, with mean age 43.4 years (SD = 14.8, range = 22-72), and mean BDI score 22.4 (SD = 4.5). Twenty participants were randomized to 90-minute hatha yoga practice groups twice weekly for 8 weeks. Eighteen participants were randomized to 90-minute attention control education groups twice weekly for 8 weeks. Certified yoga instructors delivered both interventions at a university clinic. Primary outcome was depression severity, measured by BDI scores every 2 weeks from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy and self-esteem, measured by scores on the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) at baseline and at 8 weeks.In intent-to-treat analysis, yoga participants exhibited significantly greater 8-week decline in BDI scores than controls (p-value = 0.034). In sub-analyses of participants completing final 8-week measures, yoga participants were more likely to achieve remission, defined per final BDI score ≤ 9 (p-value = 0.018). Effect size of yoga in reducing BDI scores was large, per Cohen's d = -0.96 [95%CI, -1.81 to -0.12]. Intervention groups did not differ significantly in 8-week change scores for either the GSES or RSES.In adults with mild-to-moderate major depression, an 8-week hatha yoga intervention resulted in statistically and clinically significant reductions in depression severity.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01210651."
https://openalex.org/W2595291736,"Public concerns regarding the quality of life of farm animals are often focused on specific practices such as separating the cow and calf immediately after birth. The available scientific literature provides some evidence in support of this practice (including reduced acute responses to separation when it does occur), as well as evidence of disadvantages (such as increased risk of uterine disease in cows). The aim of this study is to systematically examine public views around this practice. Specifically, this study analyzes the views of American and German citizens to separation of cow and calf at birth using a quantitative segmentation approach. Although the majority of participants opposed early separation, a small proportion of our sample supported the practice. According to participants' preference for early and later separation and their evaluation of different arguments for both practices, three clusters were identified. US participants were more likely to support early separation compared to German participants. The arguments presented for and against both practices caused different reactions in the three clusters, but did not appear to sway the opinions of most participants. The results show considerable opposition to the practice of early separation in large parts of the sample and suggest that the dairy industry should consider approaches to address this concern."

To broaden the arsenal of such tools, it is desirable to have light-activatable enzymes that can decrease cyclic nucleotide concentrations in cells. Here, we report on an unusual microbial rhodopsin that may be able to meet the demand. It is found in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta and contains a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain. We examined the enzymatic activity of the protein (named Rh-PDE) both in HEK293 membranes and whole cells. Although Rh-PDE was constitutively active in the dark, illumination increased its hydrolytic activity 1.4-fold toward cGMP and 1.6-fold toward cAMP, as measured in isolated crude membranes. Purified full-length Rh-PDE displayed maximal light absorption at 492 nm and formed the M intermediate with the deprotonated Schiff base upon illumination. The M state decayed to the parent spectral state in 7 s, producing long-lasting activation of the enzyme domain with increased activity. We discuss a possible mechanism of the Rh-PDE activation by light. Furthermore, Rh-PDE decreased cAMP concentration in HEK293 cells in a light-dependent manner and could do so repeatedly without losing activity. Thus, Rh-PDE may hold promise as a potential optogenetic tool for light control of intracellular cyclic nucleotides (e.g. to study cyclic nucleotide-associated signal transduction cascades).

These proteins are composed of a membrane-embedded rhodopsin domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic enzyme domain, activated by light absorption by the all-trans-retinal chromophore. The molecular mechanisms of enzyme rhodopsin activation are understood much less than those of other microbial rhodopsins, mainly because of the difficulty of preparing functional full-length proteins. In fact, the light-dependent enzymatic activity has never been demonstrated for Rh-HK, and detailed spectroscopic study of Rh-GC photochemistry has been performed only for the transmembrane domain without the soluble enzyme domain (12Scheib U.

Since the early stages of rhodopsin-based optogenetics, light-gated channels and light-driven ion pumps have been used to excite and silence neurons (19Boyden E.S. Zhang F. Bamberg E. Nagel G.

This is highly advantageous for applications in neuroscience when fast temporal resolution is required to change transmembrane potential. In contrast, for optogenetic control of a wider spectrum of biological functions, light-induced enzyme activation is more attractive, because intracellular signaling processes can be manipulated by light. In particular, optogenetic control of second messengers, such as Ca2+ and cyclic nucleotides, is in high demand. Photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (PAC) with flavin adenine nucleotide (FAD) chromophore was discovered in Euglena gracilis in 2002 (21Iseki M. Matsunaga S. Murakami A. Ohno K. Shiga K. Yoshida K.

It could be used as an optogenetic tool, which increases intracellular cAMP concentration under blue light (22Schröder-Lang S. Schwärzel M. Seifert R. Strünker T. Kateriya S. Looser J. Watanabe M.

In contrast to these light-activated proteins able to increase cAMP and cGMP concentrations, an efficient native light-dependent enzyme capable of lowering cyclic nucleotide concentration has not been known until now. It should be noted that engineered light-activated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) (26Gasser C. Taiber S. Yeh C.-M. Wittig C.H. Hegemann P. Ryu S. Wunder F. Möglich A. Engineering of a red-light-activated human cAMP/cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 8803-8808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and Gi-coupled animal opsin (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) are able to lower cyclic nucleotide concentration upon illumination. The former combines a GAF (cGMP-binding PDEs, adenylyl cyclase, and FhlA) domain and PDE domain, which allows control of the PDE activity by light (26Gasser C. Taiber S. Yeh C.-M. Wittig C.H. Hegemann P. Ryu S. Wunder F. Möglich A. Engineering of a red-light-activated human cAMP/cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 8803-8808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, because of the photochromic nature of the GAF domain, its light-induced enzymatic activity has to be stopped by light of a different color. Gi-coupled animal opsin from mosquitos (Opn3) decreases cAMP concentration under illumination, because Gi inhibits the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC) (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Homologs of vertebrate Opn3 potentially serve as a light sensor in nonphotoreceptive tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, enzymatic activity of mosquito Opn3 persists for several tens of minutes (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Homologs of vertebrate Opn3 potentially serve as a light sensor in nonphotoreceptive tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), being much longer than that of Rh-GC (12Scheib U. Stehfest K. Gee C.E. Körschen H.G. Fudim R. Oertner T.G. Hegemann P.

Optogenetic manipulation of cGMP in cells and animals by the tightly light-regulated guanylyl-cyclase opsin CyclOp.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), presumably because of the AC-related signaling network. In addition, GPCRs regulate other signaling cascades through Gβ,γ and arrestin, triggering complex intracellular events. Therefore, proteins composed of a light-sensor domain and a PDE domain, with fast enzymatic turnover induced by single light excitation, are highly desirable. In this paper, we report on a novel type of microbial rhodopsin with a C-terminal PDE domain, found in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, a unicellular and colonial single flagellate eukaryote, considered to be one of the closest living relatives of metazoans. We successfully expressed and purified the full-length Rh-PDE from mammalian cells, and its enzymatic functions were studied in cells, in membranes, and in detergent, both biochemically and spectroscopically. We discuss a putative molecular mechanism of Rh-PDE activation based on the presented studies of the full-length protein and its applicability to optogenetics. The genome of the choanoflagellate S. rosetta (sequenced by the Broad Institute, NCBI accession number PRJNA37927) contains an unusual gene (NCBI Gene ID 16078606) encoding a rhodopsin fused to a C-terminal PDE domain (Rh-PDE). Fig. 1A shows a schematic drawing of the Rh-PDE architecture, which is composed of an N-terminal seven-transmembrane helical rhodopsin domain and a cytoplasmic PDE domain (see supplemental Fig. S1 for the complete amino acid sequence). It is possible that Rh-PDE exists as a dimer, as is typical for known PDEs (28Bender A.T. Beavo J.A. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases: molecular regulation to clinical use.Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 488-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 29Francis S.H. Blount M.A. Corbin J.D.

Forman M.D. Fennell K.F. Dillman K.S. Menniti F.S. Mechanism for the allosteric regulation of phosphodiesterase 2A deduced from the X-ray structure of a near full-length construct.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18225-18230Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). From the sequence analysis, we propose that Rh-PDE is a microbial rhodopsin that binds all-trans-retinal as a chromophore, where light absorption triggers protein structural changes to induce (or modulate) the enzymatic activity. Fig. 1B shows a phylogenetic tree of selected microbial rhodopsins, based on the amino acid sequences of their transmembrane domains. Rh-PDE clusters with other enzyme rhodopsins of lower eukaryotes (e.g. histidine kinases and guanylate cyclases). Many common residues of microbial rhodopsins are conserved in Rh-PDE (Fig. 1C; see supplemental Fig. S2 for the complete alignment). Specifically, Asp-85, the primary counterion of the protonated Schiff base in light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR), is conserved as Glu-164 in Rh-PDE. The residues constituting the all-trans-retinal binding pocket of BR (Trp-86, Thr-89, Trp-182, and Tyr-185) (1Ernst O.P. Lodowski D.T. Elstner M. Hegemann P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. Microbial and animal rhodopsins: structures, functions, and molecular mechanisms.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114: 126-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) are also conserved as Trp-165, Thr-168, Trp-264, and Phe-267, respectively, in Rh-PDE. The PDE domain contains many conserved residues typical for the active centers of soluble PDEs (Fig. 1D), but it is not possible to predict the substrate specificity of Rh-PDE (cAMP, cGMP, or both) from the sequence. To investigate enzyme rhodopsins of lower eukaryotes, it is important to find a suitable expression system. Previous studies on Rh-GC used yeast expression, where the full-length protein could not be obtained (12Scheib U. Stehfest K. Gee C.E. Körschen H.G. Fudim R. Oertner T.G. Hegemann P. The rhodopsin-guanylyl cyclase of the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii enables fast optical control of cGMP signaling.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8: rs8Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this study, we first measured enzymatic activity of Rh-PDE using HEK293 cells, from which the full-length protein was subsequently purified and characterized in vitro. To measure the in-cell enzymatic activity of Rh-PDE, we used the GloSensor assay, which is based on a cyclic nucleotide-dependent luciferase. In this assay, the Rh-PDE-expressing cells were first incubated in the serum-containing culture medium after the addition of all-trans-retinal in the dark at room temperature (∼27 °C), and the luminescence intensity was increased by sodium nitroprusside or forskolin, which activate GC or AC, resulting in elevation of the cytoplasmic cGMP or cAMP level, respectively. Fig. 2A shows the activity of Rh-PDE toward cGMP. In the control experiments, the luminescence intensity gradually increased after the addition of sodium nitroprusside and reached a plateau after 40 min for HEK293 cells expressing GloSensor only (empty vector). As expected, there was no effect of light on the level of cGMP in this system (Fig. 2A, top). In contrast, such a gradual increase of luminescence after addition of sodium nitroprusside has not been observed upon expression of Rh-PDE (Fig. 2A, middle), which suggests constitutive activity of Rh-PDE toward cGMP, both in the dark and upon illumination. Consistent with this idea, light-independent gradual increase of luminescence occurred for the D605A mutant (Fig. 2A, bottom), with inactivating replacement in the active center of the PDE domain. Fig. 2, B and C, shows the activity of Rh-PDE toward cAMP. The luminescence intensity gradually increased after the addition of forskolin and reached a plateau after 40 min, similar to the cGMP assay (Fig. 2B). At that time point, illumination at 510 nm with 2.28 μW mm−2 intensity caused a decrease of the luminescence in cells expressing Rh-PDE (red line) but not in those with the empty vector (blue line) (Fig. 2, B and C). 28 ± 2.3% (S.D.) reduction in the luminescence intensity was reproducibly observed under these experimental conditions (n = 6). Thus, it can be concluded that the decrease of cAMP concentration must originate from the light-induced Rh-PDE activity, which is further supported by the lack of signal for the catalytically inactive D605A mutant (Fig. 2 (B and C), yellow line). It should be noted that after the light was switched off, the light-induced luminescence decrease persisted for a significant amount of time (∼10 s) and then decayed with τ1/e of 195 s (Fig. 2C, red line). This kinetics involves at least two components, deactivation of Rh-PDE and production of cAMP by endogenous adenylyl cyclases. Based on the exponential fitting, we estimate the lifetime of the light-activated state of Rh-PDE as about 71 s (supplemental Fig. S3). Another notable feature is that the stationary luminescence intensity in the dark was smaller for Rh-PDE (Fig. 2B, middle) than for the empty vector and the D605A mutant (Fig. 2B, top and bottom), suggesting constitutive dark activity toward cAMP, although smaller than toward cGMP. Fig. 2D shows that the light-induced reduction of luminescence increased with the applied light intensity, and saturated with an EC50 of 0.244 μW/mm2 (Fig. 2E). One could expect that the intensity increase was a sigmoidal function if any two-photon processes were involved (e.g. both protein molecules in a dimer need to be activated). Nearly linear increase at lower light intensities in Fig. 2E suggests that Rh-PDE activation is a single-photon event, and activation of one molecule is sufficient even if Rh-PDE is likely to form a dimer. In summary, the in-cell assays demonstrated that Rh-PDE shows strong constitutive activity toward cGMP, whereas the activity toward cAMP is light-dependent. The observed light-dependent decrease of intracellular cAMP concentration suggests that Rh-PDE may be useful as an optogenetic tool. Together with PAC and Gs-coupled opsins capable of increasing intracellular cAMP concentration, Rh-PDE increases the diversity of the optogenetics toolkit. Unlike the engineered light-activated PDE (26Gasser C. Taiber S. Yeh C.-M. Wittig C.H. Hegemann P. Ryu S. Wunder F. Möglich A. Engineering of a red-light-activated human cAMP/cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 8803-8808Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Rh-PDE is switched off by its photocycle, without the need for an additional illumination. On the other hand, Gi-opsin, which can decrease intracellular cAMP concentration (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Homologs of vertebrate Opn3 potentially serve as a light sensor in nonphotoreceptive tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), also switches off in the dark, warranting a comparison of the properties of Rh-PDE and Gi-opsin. Thus, we expressed mosquito Opn3 in HEK cells with the addition of all-trans-retinal, using the same protocol as for Rh-PDE. Although the native chromophore of mosquito Opn3 is 11-cis-retinal, it is known that this opsin binds 13-cis-retinal, which can be easily formed from all-trans-retinal, and that the regenerated pigment shows an absorption maximum at 500 nm (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Homologs of vertebrate Opn3 potentially serve as a light sensor in nonphotoreceptive tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Upon application of the 510-nm light, the cells expressing mosquito Opn3 show a strong decrease in the intracellular cAMP concentration, which continues to decrease after the light is switched off, reaching a minimum in ∼5 min, and then recovers with τ1/e of 16 min (Fig. 3A, green line). These data reproduce the data reported previously (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Homologs of vertebrate Opn3 potentially serve as a light sensor in nonphotoreceptive tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and it is obvious that the luminescence signal is smaller and faster (both in the rise and the decay) in the case of Rh-PDE under the same illumination conditions (Fig. 3A, red line). In the case of mosquito Opn3, intermolecular protein-protein interactions between opsin and Gi and between Gi and AC should amplify the signal. Thus, as an optogenetic tool, Rh-PDE exhibits a less sensitive, but about 5 times faster, response than mosquito Opn3. In addition, Rh-PDE only acts on cyclic nucleotides, whereas additional intracellular effects of mosquito Opn3 are unclear. Another important parameter for optogenetic applications is chromophore availability. We compared the activity of Rh-PDE toward cAMP with and without the addition of all-trans-retinal in the cell culture medium after transfection (Fig. 3B). Although the luminescence decrease is smaller without the addition of all-trans-retinal, it still retains robust activity at 70% of the amplitude upon its addition, which is explained by the fact that all-trans-retinal is commonly present in cells. Although mosquito Opn3 11-cis-retinal chromophore is not abundant in cells, Koyanagi et al. (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Homologs of vertebrate Opn3 potentially serve as a light sensor in nonphotoreceptive tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) found that mosquito Opn3 can bind 13-cis-retinal, a ubiquitously present retinal isomer. Because 13-cis- and all-trans-retinals exist in photoequilibrium, mosquito Opn3 is usable in general tissues, although its activity without the addition of 11-cis-retinal was reduced ≫ 2-fold (27Koyanagi M. Takada E. Nagata T. Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Homologs of vertebrate Opn3 potentially serve as a light sensor in nonphotoreceptive tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rh-PDE binds naturally abundant all-trans-retinal, and the active state is rapidly reverted to the resting state as a result of the photocycle. This comes along with the high repeatability, another important property for optogenetics. Fig. 3C shows that activation of Rh-PDE can be repeated for longer than 2 h, showing the suitability of Rh-PDE as an optogenetic tool. To define the usable spectral range of Rh-PDE, we systematically changed the irradiation wavelength at the same light intensity (Fig. 3D) and found that the luminescence is maximally decreased by the blue-green light (480–510 nm). We further characterized the enzymatic activity of Rh-PDE by HPLC analysis using crude membranes of HEK293 cells. In these experiments, cGMP or cAMP was mixed with the crude cell membranes expressing Rh-PDE, and time- and light-dependent hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides into 5′-GMP or 5′-AMP was monitored by HPLC. Fig. 4A shows the HPLC profile for cGMP, where Rh-PDE decreases the amount of cGMP and concomitantly increases that of 5′-GMP. Importantly, a 10-min incubation under illumination results in an 85% decrease of cGMP concentration, compared with only 60% in the dark (Fig. 4B). This indicates that Rh-PDE has light-dependent enzymatic activity toward cGMP, although its dark constitutive activity is significant. The hydrolysis rates were calculated from the slopes of the curves (0–10 min) in Fig. 4B as 353 nmol/mg total protein/min in the dark and 511 nmol/mg total protein/min under illumination, giving 142% activation by light. Fig. 4D shows the HPLC profiles for cAMP in the dark (top) and under illumination (bottom). Rh-PDE decreases cAMP concentration in both cases, but the activity is smaller compared with that for cGMP. It should be noted that a 10-fold higher amount of the membranes was used for the cAMP hydrolysis assay (see “Experimental procedures”). A clear light-dependent activation can be seen for the cAMP hydrolysis, as was observed in the cGMP assay above. The hydrolysis rates were calculated as 32.6 nmol/mg total protein/min in the dark and 53.6 nmol/mg total protein/min under illumination, giving ∼164% stimulation by light (Fig. 4, E and F). The activity toward cGMP is ∼10-fold higher than toward cAMP (Fig. 4), consistent with the in-cell results. Hydrolysis of cGMP and cAMP was entirely abolished in the D605A mut"

However, the mechanism of autophagy and metabolism in chemotherapeutic drug resistance is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of autophagy and glucose metabolism in chemotherapeutic drug resistance by using cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells with primary cisplatin resistance and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. We found that QBC939 cells with cisplatin resistance had a higher capacity for glucose uptake, consumption, and lactic acid generation, and higher activity of the pentose phosphate pathway compared with HepG2 cells, and the activity of PPP was further increased after cisplatin treatment in QBC939 cells. It is suggested that there are some differences in the metabolism of glucose in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma cells, and the activation of PPP pathway may be related to the drug resistance. Through the detection of autophagy substrates p62 and LC3, found that QBC939 cells have a higher flow of autophagy, autophagy inhibitor chloroquine can significantly increase the sensitivity of cisplatin in cholangiocarcinoma cells compared with hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of QBC939 cells with higher activity of the PPP, the key enzyme G6PDH, which reduces the antioxidant capacity of cells and increases intracellular ROS, especially mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, we hypothesized that autophagy and the oxidative stress resistance mediated by glucose metabolism may be one of the causes of cisplatin resistance in cholangiocarcinoma cells. It is suggested that according to the metabolism characteristics of tumor cells, inhibition of autophagy lysosome pathway with chloroquine may be a new route for therapeutic agents against cholangiocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2596929921,"Background In 2010, South Africa’s National Department of Health launched a national primary health care (PHC) initiative to strengthen health promotion, disease prevention, and early disease detection. The strategy, called Re-engineering Primary Health Care (rPHC), aims to provide a preventive and health-promoting community-based PHC model. A key component of rPHC is the use of community-based outreach teams staffed by generalist community health workers (CHWs). Methods We conducted focus group discussions and surveys on the knowledge and attitudes of 91 CHWs working on community-based rPHC teams in the King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) sub-district of Eastern Cape Province. Results The CHWs we studied enjoyed their work and found it meaningful, as they saw themselves as agents of change. They also perceived weaknesses in the implementation of outreach team oversight, and desired field-based training and more supervision in the community. Conclusions There is a need to provide CHWs with basic resources like equipment, supplies and transport to improve their acceptability and credibility to the communities they serve."
https://openalex.org/W2596447085,"Several studies have projected increases in drought severity, extent and duration in many parts of the world under climate change. We examine sources of uncertainty arising from the methodological choices for the assessment of future drought risk in the continental US (CONUS). One such uncertainty is in the climate models’ expression of evaporative demand (E0), which is not a direct climate model output but has been traditionally estimated using several different formulations. Here we analyze daily output from two CMIP5 GCMs to evaluate how differences in E0 formulation, treatment of meteorological driving data, choice of GCM, and standardization of time series influence the estimation of E0. These methodological choices yield different assessments of spatio-temporal variability in E0 and different trends in 21st century drought risk. First, we estimate E0 using three widely used E0 formulations: Penman-Monteith; Hargreaves-Samani; and Priestley-Taylor. Our analysis, which primarily focuses on the May-September warm-season period, shows that E0 climatology and its spatial pattern differ substantially between these three formulations. Overall, we find higher magnitudes of E0 and its interannual variability using Penman-Monteith, in particular for regions like the Great Plains and southwestern US where E0 is strongly influenced by variations in wind and relative humidity. When examining projected changes in E0 during the 21st century, there are also large differences among the three formulations, particularly the Penman-Monteith relative to the other two formulations. The 21st century E0 trends, particularly in percent change and standardized anomalies of E0, are found to be sensitive to the long-term mean value and the amplitude of interannual variability, i.e. if the magnitude of E0 and its interannual variability are relatively low for a particular E0 formulation, then the normalized or standardized 21st century trend based on that formulation is amplified relative to other formulations. This is the case for the use of Hargreaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor, where future E0 trends are comparatively much larger than for Penman-Monteith. When comparing Penman-Monteith E0 responses between different choices of input variables related to wind speed, surface roughness, and net radiation, we found differences in E0 trends, although these choices had a much smaller influence on E0 trends than did the E0 formulation choices. These methodological choices and specific climate model selection, also have a large influence on the estimation of trends in standardized drought indices used for drought assessment operationally. We find that standardization tends to amplify divergences between the E0 trends calculated using different E0 formulations, because standardization is sensitive to both the climatology and amplitude of interannual variability of E0. For different methodological choices and GCM output considered in estimating E0, we examine potential sources of uncertainty in 21st century trends in the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) over selected regions of the CONUS to demonstrate the practical implications of these methodological choices for the quantification of drought risk under climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2595070070,"Hyperglycemic damage to the endothelial cells (ECs) leads to increased synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. We have previously shown miR-146a downregulation in ECs and in the tissues of diabetic mice. Here we investigated the role of miR-146a, in the production of specific inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in retina and kidneys in diabetes. We generated an endothelial specific miR-146a overexpressing transgenic mice (TG). We investigated these mice and wild type (WT) controls with or without streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes. Retinal and renal cortical tissues from the mice were examined for mRNAs for specific inflammatory markers, (ECM) proteins and inflammation inducible transcription factor by real time RT-PCR. Corresponding proteins, where possible, were examined using immunofluorescence or ELISA. In parallel, we examined ECs following incubation with various levels of glucose with or without miR-146a mimic transfection. In the retina and kidneys of WT mice with diabetes, increased expression of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNFα, IL1β) in association augmented expression of ECM proteins (collagen 1αIV, fibronectin) and NF κB-P65 were observed, compared to WT non-diabetic controls. These changes were prevented in diabetic miR-146a TG mice along with retinal and renal functional and structural changes. In vitro studies showed similar changes in the ECs exposed to high glucose. Such changes were corrected in the cells following miR-146a mimic transfection. Further analyses of renal cortical tissues showed diabetes induced significant upregulation of two regulators of NFκB, namely Interleukin-1 associated Kinase 1 and tumour necrosis factor receptor associated factor. Such changes were prevented in diabetic TG animals. These data indicate that augmented production of inflammatory cytokines and ECM proteins in the retina and kidneys in diabetes are regulated through endothelium derived miR-146a. Identification of such novel mechanisms may potentially lead to the development of novel therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2596311831,"Fish personality traits, such as swimming activity, or personality related emergent behavioural properties, such as the degree of space use shown by an individual fish, should affect encounter rates between individual fish and fishing gear. Increased encounters should in turn drive vulnerability to capture by passively operated gears. However, empirical evidence documenting a relationship between activity-based behaviours and vulnerability to capture by passive fishing gear in the wild is limited. Using whole-lake acoustic telemetry, we first documented significant repeatabilities over several months in a suite of encounter rate-associated behaviours (swimming distance, activity space size, time on baited feeding sites, switching frequency among baited feeding sites, distance to the lake bottom) in two recreationally important benthivorous cyprinid species, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tench (Tinca tinca). We then experimentally targeted both species using stationary angling on baited feeding sites. Individual fish regularly visited the angling sites, documenting that the fishes encountered the angling baits. When attempting to explain individual variation in vulnerability as a function of repeatable behavioural traits, we found no evidence of a significant relationship among various encounter-based behaviours and vulnerability to angling for both species. There was also no evidence for size selection or for energetically less conditioned fish to be more vulnerable. The data cumulatively suggest that fine-scale behaviours after encountering a bait (e.g., frequency of bait intake) may be ultimately decisive for determining vulnerability to angling in benthivorous fish. Based on our work, fishing-induced selection on encounter-based behaviours in recreational angling for benthivorous fish in the wild appears unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2594999789,"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic technique that can thermally ablate tumors. Boiling histotripsy (BH) is a HIFU approach that can emulsify tissue in a few milliseconds. Lesion volume and temperature effects for different BH sonication parameters are currently not well characterized. In this work, lesion volume, temperature distribution, and area of lethal thermal dose were characterized for varying BH sonication parameters in tissue-mimicking phantoms (TMP) and demonstrated in ex vivo tissues.The following BH sonication parameters were varied using a clinical MR-HIFU system (Sonalleve V2, Philips, Vantaa, Finland): acoustic power, number of cycles/pulse, total sonication time, and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). A 3×3×3 pattern was sonicated inside TMP's and ex vivo tissues. Post sonication, lesion volumes were quantified using 3D ultrasonography and temperature and thermal dose distributions were analyzed offline. Ex vivo tissues were sectioned and stained with H&E post sonication to assess tissue damage.Significant increase in lesion volume was observed while increasing the number of cycles/pulse and PRF. Other sonication parameters had no significant effect on lesion volume. Temperature full width at half maximum at the end of sonication increased significantly with all parameters except total sonication time. Positive correlation was also found between lethal thermal dose and lesion volume for all parameters except number of cycles/pulse. Gross pathology of ex vivo tissues post sonication displayed either completely or partially damaged tissue at the focal region. Surrounding tissues presented sharp boundaries, with little or no structural damage to adjacent critical structures such as bile duct and nerves.Our characterization of effects of HIFU sonication parameters on the resulting lesion demonstrates the ability to control lesion morphologic and thermal characteristics with a clinical MR-HIFU system in TMP's and ex vivo tissues. We demonstrate that this system can produce spatially precise lesions in both phantoms and ex vivo tissues. The results provide guidance on a preliminary set of BH sonication parameters for this system, with a potential to facilitate BH translation to the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2596751075,"Terrestrial vertebrate frugivores constitute one of the major guilds in tropical forests. Previous studies show that the meso-scale distribution of this group is only weakly explained by variables such as altitude and tree basal area in lowland Amazon forests. For the first time we test whether seasonally limiting resources (water and fallen fruit) affect the dry season distribution in 25 species of terrestrial vertebrates. To examine the effects of the spatial availability of fruit and water on terrestrial vertebrates we used a standardized, regularly spaced arrangement of camera-traps within 25km2 of lowland Amazon forest. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were then used to examine the influence of four variables (altitude, distance to large rivers, distance to nearest water, and presence vs absence of fruits) on the number of photos on five functional groups (all frugivores, small, medium, large and very large frugivores) and on seven of the most abundant frugivore species (Cuniculus paca, Dasyprocta leporina, Mazama americana, Mazama nemorivaga, Myoprocta acouchy, Pecari tajacu and Psophia crepitans). A total of 279 independent photos of 25 species were obtained from 900 camera-trap days. For most species and three functional groups, the variation in the number of photos per camera was significantly but weakly explained by the GLMs (deviance explained ranging from 6.2 to 48.8%). Generally, we found that the presence of water availability was more important than the presence of fallen fruit for the groups and species studied. Medium frugivores, large-bodied frugivores, and two of the more abundant species (C. paca and P. crepitans) were recorded more frequently closer to water bodies; while none of the functional groups nor the most abundant species showed any significant relationship with the presence of fallen fruit. Two functional groups and two of the seven most common frugivore species assessed in the GLMs showed significant results with species-specific responses to altitude. Our findings provide a more detailed understanding of how frugivorous vertebrates cope with periods of water and fruit scarcity in lowland Amazon forests."

https://openalex.org/W2595179843,"In clinic, cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody, improves treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC). KRAS-mutant CRC is generally resistant to cetuximab, although difference of the sensitivity among KRAS-mutants has not been studied in detail. We previously developed the cancer tissue-originated spheroid (CTOS) method, a primary culture method for cancer cells. We applied CTOS method to investigate whether ex vivo cetuximab sensitivity assays reflect the difference in sensitivity in the xenografts. Firstly, in vivo cetuximab treatment was performed with xenografts derived from 10 CTOS lines (3 KRAS-wildtype and 7 KRAS mutants). All two CTOS lines which exhibited tumor regression were KRAS-wildtype, meanwhile all KRAS-mutant CTOS lines grew more than the initial size: were resistant to cetuximab according to the clinical evaluation criteria, although the sensitivity was quite diverse. We divided KRAS-mutants into two groups; partially responsive group in which cetuximab had a substantial growth inhibitory effect, and resistant group which exhibited no effect. The ex vivo signaling assay with EGF stimulation revealed that the partially responsive group, but not the resistant group, exhibited suppressed ERK phosphorylation ex vivo. Furthermore, two lines from the partially responsive group, but none of the lines in the resistant group, exhibited a combinatory effect of cetuximab and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, ex vivo and in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that ex vivo signaling assay reflects the difference in sensitivity in vivo and stratifies KRAS mutant CTOS lines by sensitivity. Therefore, coupling the in vivo and ex vivo assays with CTOS can be a useful platform for understanding the mechanism of diversity in drug sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2596973760,"The two-pore domain potassium channel KCNK3 (TASK-1) is expressed in rat and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. There, it is associated with hypoxia-induced signalling, and its dysfunction is linked to pathogenesis of human pulmonary hypertension. We here aimed to determine its role in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in the mouse, and hence the suitability of this model for further mechanistic investigations, using appropriate inhibitors and TASK-1 knockout (KO) mice. RT-PCR revealed expression of TASK-1 mRNA in murine lungs and pre-acinar pulmonary arteries. Protein localization by immunohistochemistry and western blot was unreliable since all antibodies produced labelling also in TASK-1 KO organs/tissues. HPV was investigated by videomorphometric analysis of intra- (inner diameter: 25-40 μm) and pre-acinar pulmonary arteries (inner diameter: 41-60 μm). HPV persisted in TASK-1 KO intra-acinar arteries. Pre-acinar arteries developed initial HPV, but the response faded earlier (after 30 min) in KO vessels. This HPV pattern was grossly mimicked by the TASK-1 inhibitor anandamide in wild-type vessels. Hypoxia-provoked rise in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) in isolated ventilated lungs was affected neither by TASK-1 gene deficiency nor by the TASK-1 inhibitor A293. TASK-1 is dispensable for initiating HPV of murine intra-pulmonary arteries, but participates in sustained HPV specifically in pre-acinar arteries. This does not translate into abnormal rise in PAP. While there is compelling evidence that TASK-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension in humans, the mouse does not appear to serve as a suitable model to study the underlying molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2597139945,"Maternal overnutrition and obesity during pregnancy can have long-term effects on offspring physiology and behaviour. These developmental programming effects may be mediated by fetal exposure to glucocorticoids, which is regulated in part by placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) type 1 and 2. We tested whether a maternal high-fat, high-sucrose diet would alter expression of placental 11β-HSD1 and 2, thereby increasing fetal exposure to maternal glucocorticoids, with downstream effects on offspring physiology and behaviour. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet or a nutrient-matched low-fat, no-sucrose control diet prior to and during pregnancy and lactation. At day 17 of gestation, HFHS dams had ~20% lower circulating corticosterone levels than controls. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between maternal diet and fetal sex for circulating corticosterone levels in the fetuses, whereby HFHS males tended to have higher corticosterone than control males, with no effect in female fetuses. However, placental 11β-HSD1 or 11β-HSD2 expression did not differ between diets or show an interaction between diet and sex. To assess potential long-term consequences of this sex-specific effect on fetal corticosterone, we studied locomotor activity and metabolic traits in adult offspring. Despite a sex-specific effect of maternal diet on fetal glucocorticoids, there was little evidence of sex-specific effects on offspring physiology or behaviour, although HFHS offspring of both sexes had higher circulating corticosterone at 9 weeks of age. Our results suggest the existence of as yet unknown mechanisms that mitigate the effects of altered glucocorticoid exposure early in development, making offspring resilient to the potentially negative effects of a HFHS maternal diet."

Annual asthma, COPD, and concurrent asthma and COPD prevalence, incidence, and mortality, standardized for age and sex, were estimated, and compared from 2002 to 2012, using generalized linear models.Standardized prevalence of concurrent asthma and COPD increased by 10.5%, from 2.9% in 2002 to 3.2% in 2012 overall, but more prominently in women compared to men. Overall, standardized incidence decreased by16%, from 2.5 to 2.1 per 1000 individuals, but increased significantly in young adults. All-cause mortality among patients with concurrent asthma and COPD decreased by 11.2%, from 2.6% to 2.2%. Being diagnosed with both diseases was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality compared to asthma (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.50-1.58), but not compared to COPD (OR = 0.97, 0.96-0.98), except in young adults aged 35 to 49 years where people with asthma and COPD had higher mortality (OR = 1.21, 1.15-1.27).In a large North American population, the burden of concurrent physician-diagnosed asthma and COPD is increasing, particularly in women and young adults."

Collagen, which is one of the main building blocks of human skin, is regulated by collagen synthesis and collagen breakdown. Autophagy was found to block the epidermal hyperproliferative response to UVB and may play a crucial role in preventing skin photoaging. In the present study, we investigated whether far-infrared (FIR) therapy can inhibit skin photoaging via UVB irradiation in NIH 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts and SKH-1 hairless mice. We found that FIR treatment significantly increased procollagen type I through the induction of the TGF-β/Smad axis. Furthermore, UVB significantly enhanced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-9. FIR inhibited UVB-induced MMP-1 and MMP-9. Treatment with FIR reversed UVB-decreased type I collagen. In addition, FIR induced autophagy by inhibiting the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In UVB-induced skin photoaging in a hairless mouse model, FIR treatment resulted in decreased skin thickness in UVB irradiated mice and inhibited the degradation of collagen fibers. Moreover, FIR can increase procollagen type I via the inhibition of MMP-9 and induction of TGF-β in skin tissues. Therefore, our study provides evidence for the beneficial effects of FIR exposure in a model of skin photoaging."

Several Brazilian populations of Ae. aegypti have developed resistance to temephos, the most used organophosphate larvicide. New tools which are less harmful to the environment and safer for humans are becoming increasingly important to control this insect vector. Spinosad, an aerobic fermentation product of a soil actinobacteria, has a favorable environmental profile. It presents selective insecticide properties, a mechanism of action that differs from those of many synthetic chemical insecticides. The toxicity of spinosad and temephos to Aedes aegypti populations from Brazil, which were previously exposed to temephos, were investigated in this study. Larval susceptibility (LC50) to temephos varied from 3μg/L for Rockefeller up to 260 μg/L for Santana do Ipanema field derived population. Larval susceptibility (LC50) to spinosad varied from 23μg/L for Rockefeller up to 93μg/L for Marilia field derived population. In addition, a semi-field trial was performed to evaluate spinosad (NatularTM DT) initial efficacy and persistence toward four field-derived lineages and the Rockefeller lineage, used as an internal control. Spinosad was tested at 0.5mg active ingredient/L in 200L capacity water tanks. Mortality was recorded each 24 hours after exposition and tanks were further recolonized once per week with mortality being recorded daily for eight weeks. Spinosad provided a level equal or superior to 80% mortality during a seven to eight week evaluation period. The assessed populations did not present cross-resistance between spinosad and temephos in laboratory conditions. It demonstrates that spinosad may be a promising larvicide for the control of Ae. aegypti, especially for populations in which resistance to temephos has been detected."
https://openalex.org/W2597267580,"Cultural studies exploring differences in the manifestation of anorexia nervosa (AN) have primarily focus on Western and non-Western cultures. However, no study so far has considered the role that social attitudes (i.e. Collectivist vs. Individualist cultural values) have in the clinical manifestations of eating disorders, including AN patients. With this in mind, the aim of this study is to compare eating and general psychopathology in a large sample of individuals diagnosed with AN from China, Spain, and United Kingdom (UK), in order to study the differences according to belonging to Western or non-Western country, or the country's Individualist Index (IDV). The total sample comprised on 544 adults with a diagnosis of AN recruited from People´s Republic of China (n = 72), UK (n = 117), and Spain (n = 355). Assessment measures included the Eating Disorders Inventory and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Our results show significant differences in most of the eating and psychopathological indices between the three countries. Patients from Western societies (Spain and UK) share more similarities regarding psychopathological expression of AN than the non-Western country (China). While Western countries show higher levels of body dissatisfaction, somatization and overall psychopathology, Chinese patients tend to deny or minimize depression, anxiety and other psychopathological symptoms. Besides, the IDV shows cultural differences in the interpersonal sensitivity scale, being AN patients from UK (the more individualistic society) who presented with higher levels of interpersonal sensitivity (i.e. discomfort during interpersonal interactions and more negative expectations concerning interpersonal behavior). In conclusion, our findings suggest that psychopathological expression of AN is better explained by Western/Eastern influence than by individualist/collectivist values. Although the diagnosis for the eating disorder may be the same, differences in the psychopathology comorbid to the eating disorders may suggest the need for treatments to be modified according to the culture."
https://openalex.org/W2595381971,"Quebec Platelet disorder (QPD) is a unique bleeding disorder that markedly increases urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in megakaryocytes and platelets but not in plasma or urine. The cause is tandem duplication of a 78 kb region of chromosome 10 containing PLAU (the uPA gene) and C10orf55, a gene of unknown function. QPD increases uPA in platelets and megakaryocytes >100 fold, far more than expected for a gene duplication. To investigate the tissue-specific effect that PLAU duplication has on gene expression and transcript structure in QPD, we tested if QPD leads to: 1) overexpression of normal or unique PLAU transcripts; 2) increased uPA in leukocytes; 3) altered levels of C10orf55 mRNA and/or protein in megakaryocytes and leukocytes; and 4) global changes in megakaryocyte gene expression. Primary cells and cultured megakaryocytes from donors were prepared for quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction analyses, RNA-seq and protein expression analyses. Rapidly isolated blood leukocytes from QPD subjects showed only a 3.9 fold increase in PLAU transcript levels, in keeping with the normal to minimally increased uPA in affinity purified, QPD leukocytes. All subjects had more uPA in granulocytes than monocytes and minimal uPA in lymphocytes. QPD leukocytes expressed PLAU alleles in proportions consistent with an extra copy of PLAU on the disease chromosome, unlike QPD megakaryocytes. QPD PLAU transcripts were consistent with reference gene models, with a much higher proportion of reads originating from the disease chromosome in megakaryocytes than granulocytes. QPD and control megakaryocytes contained minimal reads for C10orf55, and C10orf55 protein was not increased in QPD megakaryocytes or platelets. Finally, our QPD megakaryocyte transcriptome analysis revealed a global down regulation of the interferon type 1 pathway. We suggest that the low endogenous levels of uPA in blood are actively regulated, and that the regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in QPD in a megakaryocyte-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2595647460,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment has been improved by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib mesylate (IM) but various factors can cause TKI resistance in patients with CML. One factor which contributes to TKI resistance is a germline intronic deletion polymorphism in the BCL2-like 11 (BIM) gene which impairs the expression of pro-apoptotic splice isoforms of BIM. SB939 (pracinostat) is a hydroxamic acid based HDAC inhibitor with favorable pharmacokinetic, physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties, and we investigated if this drug could overcome BIM deletion polymorphism-induced TKI resistance. We found that SB939 corrects BIM pre-mRNA splicing in CML cells with the BIM deletion polymorphism, and induces apoptotic cell death in CML cell lines and primary cells with the BIM deletion polymorphism. More importantly, SB939 both decreases the viability of CML cell lines and primary CML progenitors with the BIM deletion and restores TKI-sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that SB939 overcomes BIM deletion polymorphism-induced TKI resistance, and suggest that SB939 may be useful in treating CML patients with BIM deletion-associated TKI resistance."

By applying a combination of comprehensive analyses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome, we herein depict the molecular landscape of liver regeneration. We demonstrated that histone H3 Lys-4 was trimethylated at the promoter regions of many loci, among which only a fraction, including cell-cycle-related genes, were transcriptionally up-regulated. A cistrome analysis guided by the histone methylation patterns and the transcriptome identified FOXM1 as the key transcription factor promoting liver regeneration, which was confirmed in vitro using a hepatocarcinoma cell line. The promoter regions of cell-cycle-related genes and Foxm1 acquired higher levels of trimethylated histone H3 Lys-4, suggesting that epigenetic regulations of these key regulatory genes define quiescence and regeneration of the liver cells. A quantitative proteome analysis of the regenerating liver revealed that conditional protein degradation also mediated regeneration-specific protein expression. These sets of informational resources should be useful for further investigations of liver regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2595138006,"Cyclin A1 (Ccna1), a member of the mammalian A type cyclins, is most abundantly expressed in spermatocytes and is essential for spermatogenesis in the mouse. Ccna1- deficient spermatocytes arrest at late meiotic prophase and undergo apoptosis. To further delineate the mechanisms and key factors involved in this process, we have examined changes in expression of genes involved in both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways that trigger apoptosis in the mutant spermatocytes. Our results show that both pathways are involved, and that the factors involved in the intrinsic pathway were expressed earlier than those involved in the extrinsic pathway. We have also begun to identify in vivo Ccna1-interacting proteins, using an unbiased biochemical approach, and identified 14-3-3, a key regulator of apoptosis, as a Ccna1-interacting protein. Expression levels of 14-3-3 proteins remain unchanged between wild type and mutant testes but there were differences in the subcellular distribution. In wild type control, 14-3-3 is detected in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions whereas it is restricted to the cytoplasm in mutant testes. This differential distribution of 14-3-3 may contribute to the induction of apoptosis in Ccna1-deficient spermatocytes. These results provide insight into the apoptotic mechanisms and pathways that are triggered when progression through the meiotic cell cycle is defective in male gametogenesis."

The full spectrum of neurological complications and their impact on clinical outcomes has not been extensively studied.We investigated the neurological incidence of complications, categorized according to whether they affected the central, peripheral or autonomic nervous systems, in a series of 109 patients undergoing lung transplantation at our center between January 1 2013 and December 31 2014.Fifty-one patients (46.8%) presented at least one neurological complication. Critical illness polyneuropathy-myopathy (31 cases) and phrenic nerve injury (26 cases) were the two most prevalent complications. These two neuromuscular complications lengthened hospital stays by a median period of 35.5 and 32.5 days respectively. However, neurological complications did not affect patients' survival.The real incidence of neurological complications among lung transplant recipients is probably underestimated. They usually appear in the first two months after surgery. Despite not affecting mortality, they do affect the mean length of hospital stay, and especially the time spent in the Intensive Care Unit. We found no risk factor for neurological complications except for long operating times, ischemic time and need for transfusion. It is necessary to develop programs for the prevention and early recognition of these complications, and the prevention of their precipitant and risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2596544882,"The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) plays an important role in breast cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. We have previously shown that knockdown of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase-2 (S6K2), which acts downstream of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), enhanced breast cancer cell death by apoptotic stimuli. The increase in cell death by S6K2 depletion was partly due to inactivation of Akt. In the present study, we investigated if S6K2 regulates Mcl-1, which acts downstream of Akt. Silencing of S6K2 but not S6K1 in T47D cells decreased Mcl-1 level, and potentiated apoptosis induced by TRAIL and doxorubicin. Knockdown of S6K2 also decreased the level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl. Depletion of the tumor suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4), which regulates translation of several anti-apoptotic proteins, reversed downregulation of Bcl-xl but not Mcl-1 and failed to reverse the effect of S6K2 knockdown on potentiation of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by S6K2 knockdown was partly restored by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Overexpression of catalytically-active Akt or knockdown of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)-β, a substrate for Akt, had little effect on Mcl-1 downregulation caused by S6K2 deficiency. Silencing of S6K2 increased the level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and knockdown of JNK1 increased basal Mcl-1 level and partly reversed the effect of S6K2 knockdown on Mcl-1 downregulation. JNK1 knockdown also had a modest effect in attenuating the increase in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis caused by S6K2 deficiency. These results suggest that S6K2 regulates apoptosis via multiple mechanisms, and involves both Akt and JNK."

Salvia miltiorrhiza and Panax ginseng are widely used in China because of their antitumor properties. In the previous study, the optimizing component formula (OCF), prepared with salvianolic acids, ginsenosides, and ginseng polysaccharides (5, 10, and 5 mg·L-1, respectively) extracted from S. miltiorrhiza and P. ginseng on the basis of IC50 in lung cancer A549 cells and damage minimization on human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Currently, we also have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of OCF on A549 cell migration and invasion in vitro. According to Lewis lung cancer cells (LLC) allograft in C57BL/6 mice and A549 xenograft in nude mice experiment, we found that the anti-tumor and anti-metastasis effects of OCF treatment were related to the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further studies showed that the inhibitory effect of OCF on EMT was associated with the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, all studies revealed that OCF could prevent cancer progression and tumor metastasis by inhibiting EMT involved PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in lung cancer cells."

However, nutritional status of people living with HIV (PLHIV) can be affected by various psychosocial factors which have not been well explored in Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine psychosocial correlates of nutritional status among people living with HIV (PLHIV) on ART in Central zone of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia.A matched case-control study design was conducted to assess psychosocial correlates of nutritional status among PLHIV on ART. Data were collected by an interviewer-administered technique using structured pre-tested questionnaire, record review using a checklist and anthropometric measurements. Cases were selected by simple random sampling and controls purposively to match the selected cases. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute relevant associations by STATA version 12.The psychosocial factors independently associated with malnutrition were ever consuming alcohol after starting ART [AOR = 4.7, 95% CI: 1.8-12.3], ever smoking cigarette after starting ART [AOR = 7.6, 95% CI: 2.3-25.5], depression [AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 6.1], not adhering to ART [AOR = 6.8,95% CI: 2.0-23.0] and being in the second lowest wealth quintile [AOR = 4.3,95% CI: 1.1-17.7].Ever consuming alcohol and ever smoking cigarette after starting ART, depression, not adhering to ART and being in the second lowest wealth quintile were significantly associated with malnutrition. Therefore; policies, strategies, and programs targeting people living with HIV should consider psychosocial factors that can impact nutritional status of people living with HIV enrolled on ART."
https://openalex.org/W2597159142,"Previous in vitro studies on human tendon cells (tenocytes) have demonstrated that the exogenous administration of substance P (SP) and acetylcholine (ACh) independently result in tenocyte proliferation, which is a prominent feature of tendinosis. Interestingly, the possible link between SP and ACh has not yet been explored in human tenocytes. Recent studies in other cell types demonstrate that both SP and ACh independently upregulate TGF-β1 expression via their respective receptors, the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R) and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). Furthermore, TGF-β1 has been shown to downregulate NK-1R expression in human keratocytes. The aim of this study was to examine if TGF-β1 is the intermediary player involved in mediating the proliferative pathway shared by SP and ACh in human tenocytes. The results showed that exogenous administration of SP and ACh both caused significant upregulation of TGF-β1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Exposing cells to TGF-β1 resulted in increased cell viability of tenocytes, which was blocked in the presence of the TGFβRI/II kinase inhibitor. In addition, the proliferative effects of SP and ACh on tenocytes were reduced by the TGFβRI/II kinase inhibitor; this supports the hypothesis that the proliferative effects of these signal substances are mediated via the TGF-β axis. Furthermore, exogenous TGF-β1 downregulated NK-1R and mAChRs expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, and these effects were negated by simultaneous exposure to the TGFβRI/II kinase inhibitor, suggesting a negative feedback loop. In conclusion, the results indicate that TGF-β1 is the intermediary player through which the proliferative actions of both SP and ACh converge mechanistically."

Few studies investigated the role of c-KIT expression in thyroid tumors, suggesting a role for this receptor and its ligand in differentiation and growth control of thyroid epithelium and a receptor loss following malignant transformation. We investigated and correlated c-KIT expression levels and two known markers of thyrocytes differentiation, PAX8 and TTF-1, in malignant and benign cytological thyroid samples. Moreover, we performed functional studies on human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line to associated c-KIT expression to thyrocytes differentiation and tumor proliferation. c-KIT and PAX8 expression resulted higher in benign samples compared to the malignant ones, and the expression levels of these two genes were significantly correlated to each other. We also observed that c-KIT overexpression led to an increase of PAX8 expression level together with a decrease of proliferation. Furthermore, c-KIT overexpressing cells showed a regression of typical morphological features of malignancy. Taken together these results suggest that c-KIT could be involved in the differentiation of thyroid cells and in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2595271054,"There is a scarcity of laboratory and field-based results showing the movement of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) across a spatial scale. We studied the population growth of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) under six constant temperatures, to understand and predict population changes along altitudinal gradients and under climate change scenarios. Non-linear functions were fitted to continuously model DBM development, mortality, longevity and oviposition. We compiled the best-fitted functions for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which we stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. Three temperature-dependent indices (establishment, generation and activity) were derived from a logistic population growth model and then coupled to collected current (2013) and downscaled temperature data from AFRICLIM (2055) for geospatial mapping. To measure and predict the impacts of temperature change on the pest’s biology, we mapped the indices along the altitudinal gradients of Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) and Taita Hills (Kenya) and assessed the differences between 2013 and 2055 climate scenarios. The optimal temperatures for development of DBM were 32.5, 33.5 and 33°C for eggs, larvae and pupae, respectively. Mortality rates increased due to extreme temperatures to 53.3, 70.0 and 52.4% for egg, larvae and pupae, respectively. The net reproduction rate reached a peak of 87.4 female offspring/female/generation at 20°C. Spatial simulations indicated that survival and establishment of DBM increased with a decrease in temperature, from low to high altitude. However, we observed a higher number of DBM generations at low altitude. The model predicted DBM population growth reduction in the low and medium altitudes by 2055. At higher altitude, it predicted an increase in the level of suitability for establishment with a decrease in the number of generations per year. If climate change occurs as per the selected scenario, DBM infestation may reduce in the selected region. The study highlights the need to validate these predictions with other interacting factors such as cropping practices, host plants and natural enemies."

We used a case-control design to investigate the association between suicide risk factors assessed systematically at admission to a locked-door psychiatric acute ward in Norway and subsequent death by suicide.From 2008 to 2013, patients were routinely assessed for suicide risk upon admission to the acute ward with a 17-item check list based on recommendations from the Norwegian Directorate of Health and Social Affairs. Among 1976 patients admitted to the ward, 40 patients, 22 men and 18 women, completed suicide within December 2014.Compared to a matched control group (n = 120), after correction for multiple tests, suicide completers scored significantly higher on two items on the check list: presence of suicidal thoughts and wishing to be dead. An additional four items were significant in non-corrected tests: previous suicide attempts, continuity of suicidal thoughts, having a suicide plan, and feelings of hopelessness, indifference, and/or aggression. A brief scale based on these six items was the only variable associated with suicide in multivariate regression analysis, but its predictive value was poor.Suicide specific ideations may be the most central risk markers for suicide in the general patient population admitted to psychiatric acute wards. However, a low predictive value may question the utility of assessing suicide risk."

GTL001 is a bivalent therapeutic vaccine for eradicating HPV-infected cells that contains HPV16 E7 and HPV18 E7 both fused to detoxified adenylate cyclase from Bordetella pertussis, which binds specifically to CD11b+ antigen-presenting cells. This study examined the ability of therapeutic vaccination with GTL001 adjuvanted with topical imiquimod cream to induce functional HPV16 E7- and HPV18 E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Methods Binding of GTL001 to human CD11b was assessed by a cell-based competition binding assay. Cellular immunogenicity of intradermal vaccination with GTL001 was assessed in C57BL/6 mice by enzyme-linked immunospot assay and in vivo killing assays. In vivo efficacy of GTL001 vaccination was investigated in the TC-1 murine HPV16 E7-expressing tumor model. Results GTL001 bound specifically to the human CD11b/CD18 receptor. GTL001 adjuvanted with topical 5% imiquimod cream induced HPV16 E7 and HPV18 E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses. This CD8+ T-cell response mediated in vivo killing of HPV E7-expressing cells. In the HPV16 E7-expressing tumor model, GTL001 adjuvanted with imiquimod but not imiquimod alone or a combination of unconjugated HPV16 E7 and HPV18 E7 caused complete tumor regression. Conclusions GTL001 adjuvanted with topical 5% imiquimod is immunogenic and induces HPV16 E7 and HPV18 E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses that can kill HPV E7-expressing cells and eliminate HPV E7-expressing tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2595414649,"In 2013, Zimbabwe's voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) program adopted performance-based financing (PBF) to speed progress towards ambitious VMMC targets. The $25 USD PBF intended to encourage low-paid healthcare workers to remain in the public sector and to strengthen the public healthcare system. The majority of the incentive supports healthcare workers (HCWs) who perform VMMC alongside other routine services; a small portion supports province, district, and facility levels.This qualitative study assessed the effect of the PBF on HCW motivation, satisfaction, and professional relationships. The study objectives were to: 1) Gain understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of PBF at the HCW level; 2) Gain understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of PBF at the site level; and 3) Inform scale up, modification, or discontinuation of PBF for the national VMMC program. Sixteen focus groups were conducted: eight with HCWs who received PBF for VMMC and eight with HCWs in the same clinics who did not work in VMMC and, therefore, did not receive PBF. Fourteen key informant interviews ascertained administrator opinion.Findings suggest that PBF appreciably increased motivation among VMMC teams and helped improve facilities where VMMC services are provided. However, PBF appears to contribute to antagonism at the workplace, creating divisiveness that may reach beyond VMMC. PBF may also cause distortion in the healthcare system: HCWs prioritized incentivized VMMC services over other routine duties. To reduce workplace tension and improve the VMMC program, participants suggested increasing HCW training in VMMC to expand PBF beneficiaries and strengthening integration of VMMC services into routine care.In the low-resource, short-staffed context of Zimbabwe, PBF enabled rapid VMMC scale up and achievement of ambitious targets; however, side effects make PBF less advantageous and sustainable than envisioned. Careful consideration is warranted in choosing whether, and how, to implement PBF to prioritize a public health program."

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Cdc45 lacks nuclease activity and participates in the CMG complex formation as described above. The archaeal RecJ and eukaryotic Cdc45 are considered to be counterparts in their respective replicative helicases (21Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Kelman Z. The CMG (CDC45/RecJ, MCM, GINS) complex is a conserved component of the DNA replication system in all archaea and eukaryotes.Biol. Direct. 2012; 7: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the “archaeal CMG-like complex, containing RecJ, MCM, and GINS, has not been isolated yet. Different models for the function of RecJ homologs in Archaea have been proposed in several organisms. The RecJ-like protein from S. solfataricus (RecJdbh, RecJ DNA-binding domain homolog) lacks a nuclease domain, and it may function in the detection and signaling of the stalled replication fork (9Marinsek N. Barry E.R. Makarova K.S. Dionne I. Koonin E.V. Bell S.D. GINS, a central nexus in the archaeal DNA replication fork.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thermococcus kodakarensis RecJ (GAN, GINS-associated nuclease) has the DNA-specific 5′-3′ exonuclease activity, which is stimulated by the interaction with GINS, and GAN may be involved in Okazaki fragment processing (22Li Z. Pan M. Santangelo T.J. Chemnitz W. Yuan W. Edwards J.L. Hurwitz J. Reeve J.N. Kelman Z. A novel DNA nuclease is stimulated by association with the GINS complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Pyrococcus furiosus RecJ (PfRecJ) reportedly cleaved DNA in the 5′-3′ direction and degraded RNA in the 3′-5′ direction (23Yuan H. Liu X.P. Han Z. Allers T. Hou J.L. Liu J.H. RecJ-like protein from Pyrococcus furiosus has 3′-5′ exonuclease activity on RNA: implications for proofreading of 3′-mismatched RNA primers in DNA replication.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PfRecJ was proposed to be involved in the proofreading of mismatched RNA primers in DNA replication. In this study we focused on the function of the two RecJ homologs, designated as TaRecJ1 and TaRecJ2, from the thermoacidophilic archaeon, Thermoplasma acidophilum. Both proteins are expected to have nuclease activity and to participate in the CMG-like complex. We previously reported that T. acidophilum GINS (TaGINS) is composed of a single homolog (TaGins51), directly interacts with TaMCM, and accelerates the TaMCM ATPase and helicase activities (11Ogino H. Ishino S. Mayanagi K. Haugland G.T. Birkeland N.K. Yamagishi A. Ishino Y. The GINS complex from the thermoacidophilic archaeon, Thermoplasma acidophilum may function as a homotetramer in DNA replication.Extremophiles. 2011; 15: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Ogino H. Ishino S. Haugland G.T. Birkeland N.K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Activation of the MCM helicase from the thermophilic archaeon, Thermoplasma acidophilum, by interactions with GINS and Cdc6–2.Extremophiles. 2014; 18: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the B-domain of TaGins51 was not required for either the TaGINS tetramer formation or the activation of TaMCM in vitro (24Ogino H. Ishino S. Oyama T. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Disordered interdomain region of Gins is important for functional tetramer formation to stimulate MCM helicase in Thermoplasma acidophilum.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2015; 79: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Our analyses revealed that TaRecJ1 and TaRecJ2 exhibit different nuclease activities. TaRecJ2, but not TaRecJ1, participates in the CMG-like complex formation through the interaction with TaGINS. However, TaRecJ2 did not interact with TaMCM directly, and thus the activation of TaMCM occurs in a TaRecJ2-independent manner. The T. acidophilum genome possesses two genes (TA_RS02725 and TA_RS05865) encoding sequences with distinct similarities to the bacterial RecJ and eukaryotic Cdc45 proteins. We cloned these two genes to investigate the functions of the archaeal RecJ-like proteins. However, the nucleotide sequence of TA_RS05865 in the database was different from that of our cloned gene despite several independent PCR and cloning trials. The 1-nt deletion at 556C and the duplication at 622A in the cloned gene caused a difference in 22 amino acid residues (186–207) (supplemental Fig. S1A). The cloned gene product shared high sequence identity with the RecJ homologs from other archaea belonging to Thermoplasmatales (supplemental Fig. S1B), and thus we concluded that the amino acid sequence of our cloned gene product is the original sequence encoded in the T. acidophilum genome. We then aligned the amino acid sequences of these RecJ-like proteins with those of T. kodakarensis (GAN), and Thermus thermophilus (supplemental Fig. S2). All RecJ proteins have seven conserved motifs, which are required for the nuclease activity, and the archaeal RecJs have a long insertion between motifs IV and V as compared with T. thermophilus RecJ. This insertion is present in both the archaeal and eukaryotic RecJ/Cdc45 proteins (25Krastanova I. Sannino V. Amenitsch H. Gileadi O. Pisani F.M. Onesti S. Structural and functional insights into the DNA replication factor Cdc45 reveal an evolutionary relationship to the DHH family of phosphoesterases.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4121-4128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human Cdc45 revealed that the insertion plays crucial roles in the CMG formation, and thus the insertion is referred to as CID (CMG-Interaction Domain) (26Simon A.C. Sannino V. Costanzo V. Pellegrini L. Structure of human Cdc45 and implications for CMG helicase function.Nat. Commun. 2016; 711638Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the structural similarity to the eukaryotic Cdc45, the TA_RS02725 and TA_RS05865 proteins were both expected to participate in the archaeal CMG-like complex formation. TA_RS02725 also has a short insertion in motif III. In this study the TA_RS02725 and TA_RS05865 proteins were designated as TaRecJ1 and TaRecJ2, respectively, and the recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli were purified to homogeneity (supplemental Fig. S3). The aspartic acid residues, Asp-41 and Asp-43 in TaRecJ1 and Asp-34 and Asp-36 in TaRecJ2, were predicted to coordinate a divalent metal ion and to be crucial for the nuclease activity, according to bacterial RecJ (27Sutera Jr., V.A. Han E.S. Rajman L.A. Lovett S.T. Mutational analysis of the RecJ exonuclease of Escherichia coli: identification of phosphoesterase motifs.J.

The crystal structure of exonuclease RecJ bound to Mn2+ ion suggests how its characteristic motifs are involved in exonuclease activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5908-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also prepared the TaRecJ1-D41A/D43A and TaRecJ2-D34A/D36A mutants as predicted negative controls for the nuclease activity (supplemental Fig. S3). Bacterial RecJ and GAN exhibit 5′-3′ exonuclease activity for single-stranded (ss) DNA. We examined the nuclease activities of TaRecJ1 and TaRecJ2 for ssDNA and RNA. When TaRecJ1 was incubated with a 30-nt ssDNA with an FITC-labeled 3′-terminus (Fig. 1A), short 1–3-nt DNA fragments were observed, suggesting that TaRecJ1 exhibited the exonuclease activity in the 5′-3′ direction. TaRecJ1-D41A/D43A had no detectable activity, as expected. RNA was never degraded by TaRecJ1. To rule out the possibility that TaRecJ1 is an endonuclease that cleaves ssDNA randomly, we introduced four successive phosphorothioate modifications, which generally cause the substrate to be very slowly hydrolyzed by nucleases, into the 10th to 13th bonds in the same oligonucleotide (Table 1, 4S-DNA). TaRecJ1 clearly generated the larger 20- and 21-nt fragments, and thus we concluded that TaRecJ1 exhibits the DNA-specific exonuclease activity in the 5′-3′ direction, similar to bacterial RecJ and GAN. In contrast, when TaRecJ2 was incubated with the 5′-FITC-labeled ssDNA or RNA (Fig. 1B), DNA/RNA ladders were observed, indicating that TaRecJ2 exhibits the exonuclease activity in the 3′-5′ direction for both DNA and RNA. TaRecJ2-D34A/D36A did not generate any detectable product. Although TaRecJ2 did not completely degrade the DNA in 20-min and 60-min reactions, most of the RNA was degraded within 5 min (Figs. 1B and 3A), indicating that TaRecJ2 preferentially degrades RNA over DNA. It should be noted that TaRecJ2 did not generate fragments shorter than 5 nt, although the degradation by TaRecJ1 generated mononucleotides. In addition, neither TaRecJ1 nor TaRecJ2 degraded M13 ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig. 1C), supporting the conclusion that these proteins are exonucleases and not endonucleases.Table 1Primers and oligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequence (5′-3′)TA_RS05395-B-FdGCCGCGCGGCAGCCATATGAAAGAGGATGGTAGATACGTTCTGGTA_RS05395-RdCAAGCTTGTCGACGGAGCTCTCATTGATCCAGAACCAGCGCCACTA_RS02725-FdATTTTCAGGGCCATATGACCAGCATTCTTGATACATACCTA_RS02725-RdCAAGCTTGTCGACGGAGCTCTTATTTTATCTCAGTAATGGATGTA_RS05865-FdAAGGAGATATACATATGATCGAAGATCTCATACCAAAGGTA_RS05865-RdCAAGCTTGTCGACGGAGCTCCTACCTTGCTTTCGCTTGCACCTTGTaRecJ1-F D41A/S43AdGCCGCCGCTGGCTTATCCTCATCAGCGATAGCTaRecJ1-R D41A/D43AdTATATGTGAAACTATTATTATCTTCCTCTaRecJ2-F D34A/D36AdATAATGCACTATTACCCTTAAAAAATCTGATCCTaRecJ2-R D34A/D36AdATAATGCACTATTACCCTAAAAAATCTGATCCA30dCGAACTGCCTGGAATCCTGACGAACTGTAG4S-DNAdCGAACTGCCT*G*G*A*ATCCTGACGAACTGTAGrA30cgaacugccuggaauccugacgaacuguagA30–11–30dGGAATCCTGACGAACTGTAGA30RCdCTACAGTTCGTCAGGATTCCAGGCAGTTCGA30RC-11–30dTCAGGATTCCAGGCAGTTCGA30temp5dTGTCGTGTTCGTTCGCTACAGTTCGTCAGGATTCCAGGCAGTTCGA30temp3dCTACAGTTCGTCAGGATTCCAGGCAGTTCGGCTTGCTTGTGCTGTHJ3–54merdTCACTCCGCATCTGCCGATTCTGGCTGTGGCGTGTTTCTGGTGGTTCCTAGGTCHJ3–54merRCdGACCTAGGAACCACCAGAAACACGCCACAGCCAGAATCGGCAGATGCGGAGTGAHJ3RC34dCACGCCACAGCCAGAATCGGCAGATGCGGAGTGAHJ-4dGACCTAGGAACCACCAGAAACACGCCACAGCCAGGAAGCCGATTGCGAGGCCGTCCTACCATCCTGCAGGTrap DNAdGACCTAGGAACCACCAGAAACACGCCACAGCCAG Open table in a new tab Figure 3Biochemical properties of TaRecJ2. A–C, TaRecJ2 (WT) and its mutant TaRecJ2 D34A/D36A (mt) were incubated at 50 °C with 50 nm 5′-FITC-labeled 30-nt ssDNA (A30), 30 bp of dsDNA (A30 + A30RC), 30 bp of dsDNA with a 15-nt 5′-overhang (A30temp5 + A30), 20 bp of dsDNA with a 25-nt 3′-overhang (A30temp3 + A30–11-30), or 20 bp of dsDNA/RNA and 10-nt 3′-RNA overhang (rA30 + A30RC-11–30).

TaRecJ1 exhibited the strongest exonuclease activity for ssDNA with Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 in the presence of 0–50 mm NaCl. The degraded products were observed in the presence of MnCl2, MgCl2, or NiCl2 but not ZnCl2 or CaCl2 (supplemental Fig. S4C), and the strongest nuclease activity was observed in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2. The optimal temperature was 45–55 °C. On the other hand, TaRecJ2 exhibited the strongest nuclease activity with Bis-Tris buffer at pH 6.0–7.0. NaCl strictly inhibited the nuclease activity of TaRecJ2. The degraded product was observed in the presence of MnCl2, with an optimum concentration <0.5 mm. This 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was strictly dependent on manganese, and no cleavage was observed with other metals tested here (supplemental Fig. S4D). The optimal temperature was 55–65 °C. We then examined the substrate specificity using ssDNA, dsDNA, and 5′- and 3′-overhanged DNAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, TaRecJ1 degraded ssDNA and 5′-overhanged DNA, but dsDNA and 3′-overhanged DNA were hardly degraded. The degradation of the 5′-overhanged DNA generated mononucleotides resulting from the resection of dsDNA and longer products, corresponding to the 30-bp dsDNA (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the substrate specificity of TaRecJ1 is highly similar to that of T. kodakarensis GAN (22Li Z. Pan M. Santangelo T.J. Chemnitz W. Yuan W. Edwards J.L. Hurwitz J. Reeve J.N. Kelman Z. A novel DNA nuclease is stimulated by association with the GINS complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This 5′-3′ exonuclease activity was reproducibly observed and was quantified (Fig. 2C). In contrast to TaRecJ1, TaRecJ2 degraded ssDNA and 3′-overhanged DNAs but did not resect dsDNA (Fig. 3, A and B). This 3′-5′ exonuclease activity was also reproducibly observed and was quantified (Fig. 3D). TaRecJ2 was further incubated with a DNA/RNA hybrid with the 3′-extension of RNA. As shown in Fig. 3C, only the 3′-extension was degraded to generate the 20-bp DNA/RNA hybrid, indicating that TaRecJ2 only cleaves ssDNA or RNA. A key question is whether the GAN homolog indeed participates in the archaeal replicative helicase complex. To address this issue, we first investigated the physical interaction of TaRecJs with TaGINS by gel filtration analyses using the recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, both TaRecJ1 (Mr 54014.6) and TaRecJ2 (Mr 49647.7) eluted as a single peak corresponding to a monomer, although the molecular weights calculated from the elution positions (TaRecJ1, 48 × 103; TaRecJ2, 45 × 103) were slightly lower than the molecular masses of the proteins because of some structural features. TaGins51-WT was reproducibly eluted as the tetramer, as reported previously (Fig. 4B) (11Ogino H. Ishino S. Mayanagi K. Haugland G.T. Birkeland N.K. Yamagishi A. Ishino Y. The GINS complex from the thermoacidophilic archaeon, Thermoplasma acidophilum may function as a homotetramer in DNA replication.Extremophiles. 2011; 15: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the mixture of TaGins51-WT and TaRecJ1, both proteins eluted separately, indicating that TaRecJ1 does not form a stable complex with TaGINS (Fig. 4A). In contrast, TaRecJ2 eluted with TaGins51-WT in the same fraction, and the estimated molecular weight suggested that this complex is very large (273 × 103) (Fig. 4B). When TaRecJ2 and the TaGins51-WT tetramer were mixed at a 2:1 ratio, the elution profile showed a single peak, suggesting that the TaRecJ2 monomer and the TaGins51 tetramer form a stable complex in a 2:1 ratio. The TaGins51 protein is composed of conserved A- and B-domains, and thus we prepared the B-domain-deleted mutant (TaGins51ΔB), which forms a stable tetramer (24Ogino H. Ishino S. Oyama T. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Disordered interdomain region of Gins is important for functional tetramer formation to stimulate MCM helicase in Thermoplasma acidophilum.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2015; 79: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), to examine the interface between TaRecJ2 and TaGINS. As shown in Fig. 4C, TaRecJ2 did not elute with TaGins51ΔB. Although we attempted to prepare the TaGins51-B-domain as a recombinant protein, it was never obtained in the soluble form by itself. Therefore, the TaRecJ2 and TaGins51-B-domain proteins were co-produced in E. coli. The gel filtration analysis demonstrated that the TaRecJ2· TaGins51-B-domain complex was successfully obtained (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the B-domain of TaGins51 is essential for the interaction with TaRecJ2. We also performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses to confirm these interactions. Purified TaRecJ2 was immobilized on Biacore CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling. As shown in Fig. 5A, TaGins51-WT strongly associated with TaRecJ2, and TaGins51ΔB did not show the detectable interaction, consistent with the gel filtration chromatography results. We could not evaluate the apparent dissociation constant (KD) value of the TaRecJ2·TaGins51-WT interaction because the interaction was very strong, and the dissociation was hardly detected.Figure 5Physical interactions of TaRecJ2 with TaGINS and TaMCM. A–D, SPR analyses were performed. Purified TaRecJ2 (A) and TaMCM (B–D) were each immobilized on CM5 Sensor Chips. The loaded proteins are shown at the top of the sensorgrams.

The immunocomplexes were captured with anti-TaMcm, anti-TaGins51, anti-TaRecJ1, and anti-TaRecJ2 antibodies, respectively, from the whole cell extract (as shown on the top) and were subjected to 10–20% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses using these antibodies (shown on the right side).

https://openalex.org/W2595073194,"The South African Department of Health (DOH) publishes annual guidelines identifying priority groups, including immunosuppressed individuals and healthcare workers (HCW), for influenza vaccination and treatment. How these guidelines have impacted HCW and their patients, particularly those infected with HIV, remains unknown.We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding influenza and the vaccine among South African HCW. Surveys were distributed by two local non-governmental organizations in public health clinics and hospitals in 21 districts/municipalities (5 of 9 provinces).There were 1164 respondents; median age 41 years; 978/1126 (87%) female; 801/1122 (71%) nurses. One-third (34%) of HCW reported getting influenza vaccine 2013/2014 and most (94%) recommended influenza vaccine to patients infected with HIV. Ability to get vaccine free of charge (aOR 1.69; 95% CI 1.21-2.37) and having received influenza government training (aOR 1.50; 95% CI 1.04-2.15) were significantly associated with self-reported vaccination in 2013/2014. Self-reported 2013/2014 vaccination (aOR 3.76; 95% CI 1.28-11.03) and availability of influenza vaccine during the healthcare visit (aOR 2.56; 95% CI 1.18-5.57) were significantly associated with recommending influenza vaccine to patients infected with HIV/AIDS.Only one-third of participants were vaccinated in 2013-2014 but those who were vaccinated were more likely to recommend vaccination to their patients. Free and close access to influenza vaccine were associated with a higher likelihood of getting vaccinated in 2013/2014. HCW who reported getting the influenza vaccine themselves, had vaccine to offer during the patient consult and were familiar with DOH guidelines/trainings were more likely to recommend vaccine to HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2596300707,"Predicting species distributions has long been a valuable tool to plan and focus efforts for biodiversity conservation, particularly because such an approach allows researchers and managers to evaluate species distribution changes in response to various threats. Utilizing data from a long-term monitoring program and land cover data sets, we modeled the probability of occupancy and colonization for 38 bird Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) in the robust design occupancy modeling framework, and used results from the best models to predict occupancy and colonization on the Iowa landscape. Bird surveys were conducted at 292 properties from April to October, 2006–2014. We calculated landscape habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales surrounding each of our surveyed properties to be used in our models and then used kriging in ArcGIS to create predictive maps of species distributions. We validated models with data from 2013 using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Probability of occupancy ranged from 0.001 (SE < 0.001) to 0.995 (SE = 0.004) for all species and probability of colonization ranged from 0.001 (SE < 0.001) to 0.999 (SE < 0.001) for all species. AUC values for predictive models ranged from 0.525–0.924 for all species, with 17 species having predictive models considered useful (AUC > 0.70). The most important predictor for occupancy of grassland birds was percentage of the landscape in grassland habitat, and the most important predictor for woodland birds was percentage of the landscape in woodland habitat. This emphasizes the need for managers to restore specific habitats on the landscape. In an era during which funding continues to decrease for conservation agencies, our approach aids in determining where to focus limited resources to best conserve bird species of conservation concern."
https://openalex.org/W2596936053,"Background As downstream mediators of PI3K /PTEN /AKT /mTORC1 pathway, the AKT isoforms play critical roles in tumorgenesis. Although the pleiotropic effects of AKT1 in breast cancer have been reported, the genetic and epigenetic characteristics of AKT1 promoter region in breast cancer remains to be identified. In this study we aimed to investigate the promoter mutation spectrum, methylation and gene expression pattern of AKT1 and their relationship with breast cancer. Methods By using PCR target sequence enrichment and next-generation sequencing technology, we sequenced AKT1 promoter region in pairs of breast tumor and normal tissues from 95 unselected Chinese breast cancer patients. The methylation of the promoter region and the expression profile of AKT1 in the same cohort were detected with bisulfite next-generation sequencing and qPCR, respectively. Results We identified 28 somatic mutations in 23 of the 95 (24.2%) breast cancer samples. And 19 of the 28 mutations were located in transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In the 23 patients with somatic mutations, no significant change of methylation or expression was found comparing with other patients. AKT1 promoter region was significantly hypo-methylated in tumor compared with matched normal tissue (P = 0.0014) in the 95 patients. The expression of AKT1 was significantly suppressed in tumor tissue (P = 0.0375). In clinicopathological factor analysis, AKT1 showed significant hypo-methylation (P = 0.0249) and suppressed expression (P = 0.0375) in HER2 negative subtype. And a trend of decrease in expression level (P = 0.0624) of AKT1 in the ER negative subtype was observed, which is significantly decreased in basal-like breast tumor (P = 0.0328). Conclusions Hypo-methylation and suppressed expression of AKT1 was observed to be associated with breast cancer in our cohort. The methylation and expression of AKT1 were both significantly associated with HER2 status. The promoter mutation of AKT1 did not show significant association with its methylation and expression status. These results suggested that the promoter mutation, methylation and gene expression of AKT1 may play distinct roles in tumorgenesis of breast cancer and the integrated analysis of methylation and expression of AKT1 might serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and classification of breast cancer."

However, their generation remains inefficient. Recently, DNA transposons allowed improved transgenesis efficiencies in mice and pigs. In this work, Tn5 and Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon systems were evaluated for transgenesis by simple cytoplasmic injection in livestock zygotes. In the case of Tn5, the transposome complex of transposon nucleic acid and Tn5 protein was injected. In the case of SB, the supercoiled plasmids encoding a transposon and the SB transposase were co-injected. In vitro produced bovine zygotes were used to establish the cytoplasmic injection conditions. The in vitro cultured blastocysts were evaluated for reporter gene expression and genotyped. Subsequently, both transposon systems were injected in seasonally available ovine zygotes, employing transposons carrying the recombinant human factor IX driven by the beta-lactoglobulin promoter. The Tn5 approach did not result in transgenic lambs. In contrast, the Sleeping Beauty injection resulted in 2 lambs (29%) carrying the transgene. Both animals exhibited cellular mosaicism of the transgene. The extraembryonic tissues (placenta or umbilical cord) of three additional animals were also transgenic. These results show that transpositional transgenesis by cytoplasmic injection of SB transposon components can be applied for the production of transgenic lambs of pharmaceutical interest."
https://openalex.org/W2596490556,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. Evidence suggests that colonic dysplasia and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) are often linked to repeated cycles of epithelial cell injury and repair in the context of chronic production of inflammatory cytokines. Several mouse models of CAC have been proposed, including chemical induction through exposure to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) with the genotoxic agents azoxymethane (AOM), 1,2-dymethylhydrazine (DHM) or targeted genetic mutations. However, such models are usually performed on healthy animals that usually lack the underlying genetic predisposition, immunological dysfunction and dysbiosis characteristic of IBD. We have previously shown that inbred SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice develop a progressive Crohn’s disease (CD)-like ileitis in the absence of spontaneous colitis. We hypothesize that SAMP mice may be more susceptible to colonic tumorigenesis due to their predisposition to IBD. To test this hypothesis, we administered AOM/DSS to IBD-prone SAMP and their non-inflamed parental control strain, AKR mice. Our results showed that AOM/DSS treatment enhanced the susceptibility of colitis in SAMP compared to AKR mice, as assessed by endoscopic and histologic inflammatory scores, daily weight loss and disease activity index (DAI), during and after DSS administration. SAMP mice also showed increased colonic tumorigenesis, resulting in the occurrence of intramucosal carcinoma and a higher incidence of high-grade dysplasia and tumor burden. These phenomena occurred even in the absence of AOM and only upon repeated cycles of DSS. Taken together, our data demonstrate a heightened susceptibility to colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS-treated SAMP mice with CD-like ileitis. This novel model represents a useful tool to investigate relevant mechanisms of CAC, as well as for pre-clinical testing of potential IBD and colon cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2595486341,"Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (NTPDase1) degrades the purines ATP and ADP that are key regulators of inflammation and clotting. We hypothesized that NTPDase1 polymorphisms exist and that they regulate this pathway. We sequenced the ENTPD1 gene (encoding NTPDase1) in 216 subjects then assessed genotypes in 2 cohorts comprising 2213 humans to identify ENTPD1 polymorphisms associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The G allele of the intron 1 polymorphism rs3176891 was more common in VTE vs. controls (odds ratio 1.26–1.9); it did not affect RNA splicing, but it was in strong linkage disequilibrium with the G allele of the promoter polymorphism rs3814159, which increased transcriptional activity by 8-fold. Oligonucleotides containing the G allele of this promoter region bound nuclear extracts more avidly. Carriers of rs3176891 G had endothelial cells with increased NTPDase1 activity and protein expression, and had platelets with enhanced aggregation. Thus, the G allele of rs3176891 marks a haplotype associated with increased clotting and platelet aggregation attributable to a promoter variant associated with increased transcription, expression, and activity of NTPDase1. We term this gain-of-function phenotype observed with rs3814159 G “CD39 Denver.”—Maloney, J. P., Branchford, B. R., Brodsky, G. L., Cosmic, M. S., Calabrese, D. W., Aquilante, C. L., Maloney, K.

https://openalex.org/W2596163426,"Recycling irrigation reservoirs (RIRs) are emerging aquatic environments of global significance to crop production, water conservation and environmental sustainability. This study characterized the diversity and population structure of cyanobacteria and other detected microbes in water samples from eight RIRs and one adjacent runoff-free stream at three ornamental crop nurseries in eastern (VA1 and VA3) and central (VA2) Virginia after cloning and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene targeting cyanobacteria and chloroplast of eukaryotic phytoplankton. VA1 and VA2 utilize a multi-reservoir recycling irrigation system with runoff channeled to a sedimentation reservoir which then overflows into transition and retention reservoirs where water was pumped for irrigation. VA3 has a single sedimentation reservoir which was also used for irrigation. A total of 208 operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified from clone libraries of the water samples. Among them, 53 OTUs (358 clones) were cyanobacteria comprising at least 12 genera dominated by Synechococcus species; 59 OTUs (387 clones) were eukaryotic phytoplankton including green algae and diatoms; and 96 were other bacteria (111 clones). Overall, cyanobacteria were dominant in sedimentation reservoirs, while eukaryotic phytoplankton and other bacteria were dominant in transition/retention reservoirs and the stream, respectively. These results are direct evidence demonstrating the negative impact of nutrient-rich horticultural runoff, if not contained, on natural water resources. They also help in understanding the dynamics of water quality in RIRs and have practical implications. Although both single- and multi-reservoir recycling irrigation systems reduce the environmental footprint of horticultural production, the former is expected to have more cyanobacterial blooming, and consequently water quality issues, than the latter. Thus, a multi-reservoir recycling irrigation system should be preferred where feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2596874562,"Daxx was originally isolated as a Fas-binding protein. However, the in vivo function of Daxx in Fas-induced apoptosis has remained enigmatic. Fas plays an important role in homeostasis in the immune system. Fas gene mutations lead to autoimmune-lymphoproliferation (lpr) diseases characterized by hyperplasia of secondary lymphoid organs. It is well established that the FADD adaptor binds to Fas, and recruits/activates caspase 8. However, additional proteins including Daxx have also been indicated to associate with Fas. It was proposed that Daxx mediates a parallel apoptotic pathway that is independent of FADD and caspase 8, but signals through ASK1-mediated apoptotic pathway. However, because the deletion of Daxx leads to embryonic lethality, the in vivo function of Daxx has not been properly analyzed. In the current study, analysis was performed using a conditional mutant mouse in which Daxx was deleted specifically in T cells. The data show that Daxx-/- T cells were able to undergo normal Fas-induced apoptosis. While containing normal thymocyte populations, the T cell-specific Daxx-/- mice have a reduced peripheral T cell pool. Importantly, Daxx-deficient T cells displayed increased death responses upon activation through TCR stimulation. These results unequivocally demonstrated that Daxx does not mediate Fas-induced apoptosis, but rather that it plays a critical role in survival responses in primary mature T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2595632972,"Expression quantitative trait (eQTL) studies are a powerful tool for identifying genetic variants that affect levels of messenger RNA. Since gene expression is controlled by a complex network of gene-regulating factors, one way to identify these factors is to search for interaction effects between genetic variants and mRNA levels of transcription factors (TFs) and their respective target genes. However, identification of interaction effects in gene expression data pose a variety of methodological challenges, and it has become clear that such analyses should be conducted and interpreted with caution. Investigating the validity and interpretability of several interaction tests when screening for eQTL SNPs whose effect on the target gene expression is modified by the expression level of a transcription factor, we characterized two important methodological issues. First, we stress the scale-dependency of interaction effects and highlight that commonly applied transformation of gene expression data can induce or remove interactions, making interpretation of results more challenging. We then demonstrate that, in the setting of moderate to strong interaction effects on the order of what may be reasonably expected for eQTL studies, standard interaction screening can be biased due to heteroscedasticity induced by true interactions. Using simulation and real data analysis, we outline a set of reasonable minimum conditions and sample size requirements for reliable detection of variant-by-environment and variant-by-TF interactions using the heteroscedasticity consistent covariance-based approach."
https://openalex.org/W2595326961,"Strong seasonality in abiotic harshness and pollinator availability shape the reproductive success of plants. Plant species can avoid or can tolerate harsh abiotic conditions and can attract different pollinators, but it remains unknown (i) which of these capacities is most important for flowering phenology, (ii) whether tolerance/avoidance of abiotic harshness reinforces or relaxes the phenological differentiation of species attracting different pollinators. We assembled possibly the first functional trait database for a North African steppe covering 104 species. We inferred avoidance of harshness (drought) from dormancy, i.e. annual life-span and seed size. We inferred tolerance or resistance to harshness from small specific leaf area, small stature, deep roots and high dry matter content. We inferred the type of pollinators attracted from floral colour, shape and depth. We found that avoidance traits did not affect flowering phenology, and among tolerance traits only deep roots had an effect by delaying flowering. Flower colour (red or purple), and occasionally flower depth, delayed flowering. Dish, gullet and flag shape accelerated flowering. Interactive effects however were at least as important, inversing the mentioned relationship between floral characters and flowering phenology. Specifically, among drought-tolerant deep-rooted species, flowering phenologies converged among floral types attracting different pollinators, without becoming less variable overall. Direct and interactive effects of root depth and floral traits explained at least 45% of the variance in flowering phenology. Also, conclusions on interactive effects were highly consistent with and without including information on family identity or outliers. Overall, roots and floral syndromes strongly control flowering phenology, while many other traits do not. Surprisingly, floral syndromes and the related pollinators appear to constrain phenology mainly in shallow-rooted, abiotically little tolerant species. Lack of abiotic tolerance might hence constrain accessible resources and thereby impose a stronger synchronization with biotic partners such as pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W2596014456,"RNA Polymerase II pauses and backtracks during transcription, with many consequences for gene expression and cellular physiology. Here, we show that the energy required to melt double-stranded nucleic acids in the transcription bubble predicts pausing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae far more accurately than nucleosome roadblocks do. In addition, the same energy difference also determines when the RNA polymerase backtracks instead of continuing to move forward. This data-driven model corroborates—in a genome wide and quantitative manner—previous evidence that sequence-dependent thermodynamic features of nucleic acids influence both transcriptional pausing and backtracking."
https://openalex.org/W2596460956,"Food entrainment is the internal mechanism whereby the phase and period of circadian clock genes comes under the control of daily scheduled food availability. Food entrainment allows the body to efficiently realign the internal timing of behavioral and physiological functions such that they anticipate food intake. Food entrainment can occur with or without caloric restriction, as seen with daily schedules of restricted feeding (RF) or restricted treat (RT) that restrict food or treat intake to a single feeding time. However, the extent of clock gene control is more pronounced with caloric restriction, highlighting the role of energy balance in regulating clock genes. Recent studies have implicated dopamine (DA) to be involved in food entrainment and caloric restriction is known to affect dopaminergic pathways to enhance locomotor activity. Since food entrainment results in the development of a distinct behavioral component, called food anticipatory activity (FAA), we examined the role of locomotor sensitization (LS) in food entrainment by 1) observing whether amphetamine (AMPH) sensitization results in enhanced locomotor output of FAA and 2) measuring LS of circadian and non-circadian feeding paradigms to an acute injection of AMPH (AMPH cross-sensitization). Unexpectedly, AMPH sensitization did not show enhancement of FAA. On the contrary, LS did develop with sufficient exposure to RF. LS was present after 2 weeks of RF, but not after 1, 3 or 7 days into RF. When food was returned and rats regain their original body weight at 10–15 days post-RF, LS remained present. LS did not develop to RT, nor to feedings of a non-circadian schedule, e.g. variable restricted feeding (VRF) or variable RT (VRT). Further, when RF was timed to the dark period, LS was observed only when tested at night; RF timed to the light period resulted in LS that was present during day and night. Taken together our results show that LS develops with food entrainment to RF, an effect that is dependent on the chronicity and circadian phase of RF but independent of body weight. Given that LS involves reorganization of DA-regulated motor circuitry, our work provides indirect support for the role of DA in the food entrainment pathway of RF. The findings also suggest differences in neuronal pathways involved in LS from AMPH sensitization and LS from RF."
https://openalex.org/W2597191931,"Successful optimization of plant-derived compounds into control of nuisance insects would benefit from scientifically validated targets. However, the close association between the genotypic responses and physiological toxicity effects mediated by these compounds remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the sublethal dose effects of proanthocyanidins (PAs) sourced from green tea (Camellia sinensis) on life history traits of Anopheles gambiae (sensu stricto) mosquitoes with an aim to unravel the probable molecular targets. Based on the induced phenotypic effects, genes selected for study targeted juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis, signal transduction, oxidative stress response and xenobiotic detoxification in addition to vitellogenesis in females. Our findings suggest that chronic exposure of larval stages (L3/L4) to sublethal dose of 5 ppm dramatically extended larval developmental period for up to 12 days, slowed down pupation rates, induced abnormal larval-pupal intermediates and caused 100% inhibition of adult emergence. Further, females exhibited significant interference of fecundity and egg hatchability relative to controls (p < 0.001). Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), our findings show that PA-treated larvae exhibited significant repression of AgamJHAMT (p < 0.001), AgamILP1 (p < 0.001) and AgamCYP6M2 (p < 0.001) with up-regulation of Hsp70 (p < 0.001). Females exposed as larvae demonstrated down-regulation of AgamVg (p = 0.03), AgamILP1 (p = 0.009), AgamCYP6M2 (p = 0.05) and AgamJHAMT (p = 0.02). Our findings support that C. sinensis proanthocyanidins affect important vectorial capacity components such as mosquito survival rates and reproductive fitness thus could be potentially used for controlling populations of malaria vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2597367890,"Without a glucocorticoid (GC) ligand, the transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is largely cytoplasmic, with its GC-binding domain held in high affinity conformation by a cluster of chaperones. Binding a GC causes serial dis- and re-associations with chaperones, translocation of the GR to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA sites and associates with coregulatory proteins and basic transcription complexes. Herein, we describe the effects of a potent protective osmolyte, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), on a conditions-dependent ""activation-labile"" mutant GR (GRact/l), which under GR-activating conditions cannot bind GCs in cells or in cell cytosols. In both cells and cytosols, TMAO restores binding to GRact/l by stabilizing it in complex with chaperones. Cells bathed in much lower concentrations of TMAO than those required in vitro show restoration of GC binding, presumably due to intracellular molecular crowding effects."
