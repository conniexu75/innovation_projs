However, 18 months into the pandemic and more than 6 months after vaccine approval, wealthy countries remain the major beneficiaries. Wagner et al . model the consequences of vaccine stockpiling in affluent countries on disease rates in lower- and middle-income countries and the consequences for the eruption of new variants that could jeopardize the early success of vaccines. For countries that can readily access vaccines, it would be better to share vaccines equitably to lower disease burdens in countries with less access, reduce the cost of having to be constantly vigilant for case imports, and minimize virus evolution. —CA"

https://openalex.org/W3195814479,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer with a high mortality rate. Colonoscopy is the preferred procedure for CRC screening and has proven to be effective in reducing CRC mortality. Thus, a reliable computer-aided polyp detection and classification system can significantly increase the effectiveness of colonoscopy. In this paper, we create an endoscopic dataset collected from various sources and annotate the ground truth of polyp location and classification results with the help of experienced gastroenterologists. The dataset can serve as a benchmark platform to train and evaluate the machine learning models for polyp classification. We have also compared the performance of eight state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models. The results demonstrate that deep CNN models are promising in CRC screening. This work can serve as a baseline for future research in polyp detection and classification."

However, since eye movement properties contain biometric information, privacy concerns have to be handled properly. Privacy-preservation techniques such as differential privacy mechanisms have recently been applied to eye movement data obtained from such displays. Standard differential privacy mechanisms; however, are vulnerable due to temporal correlations between the eye movement observations. In this work, we propose a novel transform-coding based differential privacy mechanism to further adapt it to the statistics of eye movement feature data and compare various low-complexity methods. We extend the Fourier perturbation algorithm, which is a differential privacy mechanism, and correct a scaling mistake in its proof. Furthermore, we illustrate significant reductions in sample correlations in addition to query sensitivities, which provide the best utility-privacy trade-off in the eye tracking literature. Our results provide significantly high privacy without any essential loss in classification accuracies while hiding personal identifiers."

The pentavalent antimonial compounds that used for treatment are not safe or effective enough. The aim of the present study was preparation and evaluation of the efficacy of green synthesized silver nanoparticles against Leishmania major ( L . major ) in vitro. Methods To synthesis silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs), ginger extract was added to the 0.2mM AgNO 3 aqueous solution (1:20). Effects of different concentrations of Ag-NPs on the number of L . major promastigotes were investigated using counting assay. The MTT test was applied to determine the toxicity of Ag-NPs on promastigotes of L . major , as well as, macrophage cells. Then, to evaluate the anti-amastigotes effects of Ag-NPs, parasites within the macrophages were counted by light microscope. Furthermore, to determine the induced apoptosis and necrotic effects of Ag-NPs on promastigotes, flow cytometry method was employed using annexin staining. Results The effect of Ag-NPs on promastigotes and amastigotes of L . major was effective and has a reverse relationship with its concentration. According to the results of anti-amastigote assay, the IC50 value of this nanoparticle was estimated 2.35 ppm after 72h. Also, Ag-NPs caused Programmed Cell Death (PCD) in promastigotes of L . major and showed 60.18% of apoptosis. Discussion Based on the mentioned results, it can be concluded that Ag NPs has a beneficial effect on promastigote and amastigote forms of L . major in vitro. Hence, these nanoparticles could be applied as promising antileishmanial agents for treatment of Leishmania infections."

Although this type of examination is faster than other diagnostic methods, it can still be time-consuming to evaluate a complete sample; additionally, it possesses the disadvantage of inconsistent reliability as the accuracy of the reading may differ depending on the performer's skill. This study aims at detecting hyphae more quickly, conveniently, and consistently through deep learning using images obtained from microscopy used in real-world practice. An object detection convolutional neural network, YOLO v4, was trained on microscopy images with magnifications of 100×, 40×, and (100+40)×. The study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology at Veterans Health Service Medical Center, Seoul, Korea between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, using 3,707 images (1,255 images for training, 1,645 images for testing). The average precision was used to evaluate the accuracy of object detection. Precision recall curve analysis was performed for the hyphal location determination, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed on the image classification. The F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity values were used as measures of the overall performance. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 95.2% and 100% in the 100× data model, and 99% and 86.6% in the 40× data model; the sensitivity and specificity in the combined (100+40)× data model were 93.2% and 89%, respectively. The performance of our model had high sensitivity and specificity, indicating that hyphae can be detected with reliable accuracy. Thus, our deep learning-based autodetection model can detect hyphae in microscopic images obtained from real-world practice. We aim to develop an automatic hyphae detection system that can be utilized in real-world practice through continuous research."
https://openalex.org/W3195767152,"Background Chronic disease represents an ongoing public health challenge in Australia with women disproportionately affected and at younger ages compared to men. Accurate prevalence and ascertainment of chronic disease among women of reproductive age at the population level is essential for meeting the family planning and reproductive health challenges that chronic diseases pose. This study estimated the prevalence of chronic disease among younger Australian women of reproductive age, in order to ascertain key conditions that would benefit from targeted family planning support strategies. Methods and findings Population-level survey data from the 1973–78 and 1989–95 cohorts of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health were linked to health service use, pharmaceutical, cancer and cause of death data to ascertain the prevalence and chronic disease trends for ten chronic health conditions associated with poor maternal and foetal outcomes. Individual chronic disease algorithms were developed for each chronic disease of interest using the available linked datasets. Lifetime prevalence of chronic disease varied substantially based on each individual data source for each of the conditions of interest. When all data sources were considered, all conditions with the exception of mental health conditions were higher among women in the 1973–78 cohort. However, when focused on point prevalence at similar ages (approximately 25–30 years), the chronic disease trend for women in the 1989–95 cohort was substantially higher, particularly for mental health conditions (70.4% vs 23.6%), diabetes (4.5% vs 1.3%) and multimorbidity (17.9% vs 9.1%). Conclusions Given the low concordance between individual data sources, the use of multiple data sources are recommended for chronic disease research focused on women of reproductive age. In order to reduce the increasing chronic disease and multimorbidity trend among women, strategic chronic disease interventions are required to be implemented in childhood and adolescence to ensure the long-term health of not only current but also future generations."
https://openalex.org/W3195896170,"Mounting evidence demonstrates that paternal diet programs offspring metabolism. However, the contribution of a pre-conception paternal high protein (HP) diet to offspring metabolism, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes remains unclear. Here we show that paternal HP intake in Sprague Dawley rats programs protective metabolic outcomes in offspring. Compared to paternal high fat/sucrose (HF/S), HP diet improved body composition and insulin sensitivity and improved circulating satiety hormones and cecal short-chain fatty acids compared to HF/S and control diet (P < .05). Further, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess gut microbial composition, we observed increased alpha diversity, distinct bacterial clustering, and increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Bacteroides, and Marvinbryantia in HP fathers and/or male and female adult offspring. At the epigenetic level, DNMT1and 3b expression was altered intergenerationally. Our study identifies paternal HP diet as a modulator of gut microbial composition, epigenetic markers, and metabolic function intergenerationally."
https://openalex.org/W3195957882,"Intervertebral disc degeneration is an irreversible process associated with accumulation of senescent nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. This study investigates the hypothesis that Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)–treated senescent NP cells propagate senescence of neighboring healthy cells via a paracrine effect that involves p-Stat3 signaling and the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). NP cells isolated from bovine caudal intervertebral disc (IVD) were treated with TNF-α to induce senescence which was confirmed by demonstrating upregulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and p16. This was correlated with downregulation of NP-associated markers, Aggrecan, Col2A1, and Sox9. Direct contact and non-contact co-culture of healthy and senescent cells showed that TNF-α–treated cells increased the senescence in healthy cells via a paracrine effect. The senescent cells have a secretory phenotype as indicated by increased gene and protein levels of IL-6. Phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (pStat3) levels were also high in treated cells and appeared to upregulate IL-6 as inhibition of Stat3 phosphorylation by StatticV downregulated IL-6 mRNA expression in cells and protein levels in the culture media. All trans retinoic acid, an IL-6 inhibitor, also decreased the secretion of IL-6 and reduced the paracrine effect of senescent cells on healthy cells. Decreased pStat3 levels and inhibition of IL-6 secretion did not fully restore NP gene expression of Col2A1 but importantly, appeared to cause senescent cells to undergo apoptosis and cell death. This study demonstrated the paracrine effect of senescent NP cells which involves Stat3 and IL-6 and may explain why senescent NP cells accumulate in IVD with age. The role of pSTAT3 and IL-6 in mediating NP senescence requires further study as it may be a novel strategy for modulating the senescent-inducing effects of TNF-α."
https://openalex.org/W3193367626,"Adipokine leptin plays a crucial role in metabolic and reproductive functions. Leptin receptor has a soluble form that binds to leptin, thus modulating its level in the circulation. It has been indicated that the levels of leptin and leptin receptor and also LEP rs7799039 and LEPR rs1137101 polymorphisms are associated with metabolic disorders. In the present study, we assessed the levels of leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), and also the frequency of rs7799039 and rs1137101 polymorphisms in healthy fertile women and patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), inclusive of PCOS-infertile and PCOS-recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) subjects.A total of 324 PCOS patients- including 199 infertile cases and 125 patients with a history of RPL- and 144 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Biochemical parameters and plasma leptin and sOB-R levels were measured by ELISA and the genotypes of rs7799039 and rs1137101 polymorphisms were determined using PCR- RFLP.Plasma leptin and sOB-R levels were significantly higher and lower in PCOS, PCOS-infertile and PCOS RPL groups, respectively. The GG genotype frequencies of rs7799039 and rs1137101 polymorphisms were significantly different between PCOS-infertile women and non-PCOS subjects (P = 0.043, OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.22-0.97, and P = 0.01, OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.12-0.75, respectively). Increased LEP levels were associated with the risk of PCOS and RPL in women with PCOS (P = 0.039, OR = 1.203, 95%CI = [1.009-1.435] and P = 0.012, OR = 1.267, 95% CI = [1.054-1.522], respectively).Polymorphisms rs7799039 and rs1137101 and circulating leptin and sOB-R levels were associated with infertility in Iranian women with PCOS. Further studies are needed to reveal the role of leptin in PCOS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3193662995,"In the Indian state of Bihar, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health issue that has been aggravated by the rising incidence of new Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. In endemic areas, the risk of VL infections in patients living with HIV (PLHIV) is higher. It is important to investigate the disease-related knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of PLHIV in Bihar in order to monitor HIV/VL co-infection. Adequate knowledge, a positive attitude, and good practices for VL control are essential to stamp out the disease. This study investigated the KAP towards VL in HIV patients attending antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic at ICMR-RMRIMS, Patna.A questionnaire based cross-sectional study was performed among 120 HIV patients aged ≥18 years, to evaluate their KAP regarding visceral leishmaniasis. For the KAP indicators, each correct answer received a score of 1, while unsure and incorrect responses received a score of 0. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for the analysis. Data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27.The study population had a male (68.30%) preponderance with a mean age of 37.03 years ± 9.80 years of standard deviation. The majority (93.30%) of the study participants had previously heard about VL. Only 32.10% of those who had heard about VL knew that the disease was transmitted by the sandfly. Most (80.40%) of the study respondents were ignorant of the sandfly breeding grounds. The vast majority (75.90%) had no idea how to recognize sandflies and were unaware of their biting time, leishmaniasis transmission season, and preventive practices. Although PLHIV are vulnerable to VL, only 27.70% of them agreed that VL is a fatal disease if untreated, and 42.90% believed they wear not at risk of developing the disease. Regarding the control methods of sandflies, 28.60% of participants did not use any methods to avoid sandfly bites. The multivariable analysis revealed that occupation and family history were the two independent predictor variables of the knowledge index. Age and gender were significantly associated with attitude towards VL. Participants working as laborers had significantly lesser odds (AOR: 0.248, 95% CI: 0.073-0.844) to follow good preventive practices. There were significantly higher odds of having good practice among participants aged 18-40 years (AOR: 6.866, 95% CI: 1.694-27.834) and those residing in urban areas (AOR: 4.159, 95% CI: 1.317-13.139) than their peers. Overall, 27.7% of respondents were knowledgeable, 41.1% had a positive mindset, and 33.9% had strong VL preventive habits, according to the study.The study determined a remarkable gap in the knowledge attitude and practices towards VL among PLHIV. This underscores the need of augmented health education initiatives for PLHIV in endemic areas for good VL awareness and preventive practices."
https://openalex.org/W3108639958,"Palm oil is relatively inexpensive, versatile, and popular, generating great economic value for Southeast Asian countries. However, the growing demand for palm oil is leading to deforestation and biodiversity loss. The current study is the first to employ a capability-opportunity-motivation (COM-B) framework in green consumerism, to determine which capability, opportunity, and motivation factors strongly predict the intentional purchasing of sustainable palm oil products by Australian consumers (N = 781). Exploratory factor analysis revealed four main types of predictors of SPO purchasing– Pro-Green Consumption Attitudes , Demotivating Beliefs , Knowledge and Awareness , and Perceived Product Availability . Multiple regression revealed that these four factors explained 50% of the variability in SPO purchasing behaviour, out of which Knowledge and Awareness accounted for 18% of the unique variance. Perceived Product Availability and Pro-Green Consumption Attitudes were also significant predictors but accounted for only 2% and 1% of unique variance, respectively. These results provide a valuable foundation for designing behaviour change interventions to increase consumer demand for sustainable palm oil products."
https://openalex.org/W3195566057,"Fish bones are common foreign bodies in the upper aero-digestive tract, but their clinical features in relation to fish species have not been confirmed. We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of fish-bone foreign bodies and their location and removal methods depending on the fish species.Retrospective, observational, monocentric study.From October 2015 to May 2020, 368 patients visited the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Tohoku University Hospital complaining of dysphagia, sore throat, or pharyngeal discomfort after eating fish. We analyzed the patients' sex and age distribution, foreign-body location, type of the fish, and the techniques used for removing the foreign body.Fish bones were confirmed in the upper aero-digestive tract in 270 cases (73.4%), of which 236 (87.4%) involved fish-bone foreign bodies in the mesopharynx. The most frequently involved site was the palatine tonsil (n = 170). Eel was the most frequently observed fish species (n = 39), followed by mackerel (n = 33), salmon (n = 33), horse mackerel (n = 30), and flounder (n = 30). Among the 240 cases in which the bones did not spontaneously dislocate, 109 (45.4%) were treated by endoscopic removal (103 cases) or surgery (6 cases). In pediatric cases (<12 years old), almost all fish bones were found in the mesopharynx (138/139, 99.3%), and 31 cases (22.3%) required endoscopic removal. Flounder fish bones were often lodged in the hypopharynx and esophagus (9/30, 30%), hindering spontaneous dislocation and frequently necessitating endoscopic or surgical removal (19/29, 65.5%).The characteristics of fish-bone foreign bodies differed depending on the fish species. Flounder bones were often stuck in the hypopharynx and esophagus and were likely to require more invasive removal methods. Confirming the species of the fish could facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of fish-bone foreign bodies."
https://openalex.org/W3196166457,"TIN2 is a core component of the shelterin complex linking double-stranded telomeric DNA-binding proteins (TRF1 and TRF2) and single-strand overhang-binding proteins (TPP1-POT1). In vivo, the large majority of TRF1 and TRF2 exist in complexes containing TIN2 but lacking TPP1/POT1; however, the role of TRF1-TIN2 interactions in mediating interactions with telomeric DNA is unclear. Here, we investigated DNA molecular structures promoted by TRF1-TIN2 interaction using atomic force microscopy (AFM), total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and the DNA tightrope assay. We demonstrate that the short (TIN2S) and long (TIN2L) isoforms of TIN2 facilitate TRF1-mediated DNA compaction (cis-interactions) and DNA-DNA bridging (trans-interactions) in a telomeric sequence- and length-dependent manner. On the short telomeric DNA substrate (six TTAGGG repeats), the majority of TRF1-mediated telomeric DNA-DNA bridging events are transient with a lifetime of ~1.95 s. On longer DNA substrates (270 TTAGGG repeats), TIN2 forms multiprotein complexes with TRF1 and stabilizes TRF1-mediated DNA-DNA bridging events that last on the order of minutes. Preincubation of TRF1 with its regulator protein Tankyrase 1 and the cofactor NAD+ significantly reduced TRF1-TIN2 mediated DNA-DNA bridging, whereas TIN2 protected the disassembly of TRF1-TIN2 mediated DNA-DNA bridging upon Tankyrase 1 addition. Furthermore, we showed that TPP1 inhibits TRF1-TIN2L-mediated DNA-DNA bridging. Our study, together with previous findings, supports a molecular model in which protein assemblies at telomeres are heterogeneous with distinct subcomplexes and full shelterin complexes playing distinct roles in telomere protection and elongation."

https://openalex.org/W3195171875,"With more than 82 million cases worldwide and almost two million deaths, the Covid-19 global pandemic shows little sign of abating. However, its effect on quality of life (QoL) in skin cancer patients has not been systematically evaluated to date. Given that QoL impairments may be associated with increased psychological morbidity, and may interfere with engagement with cancer therapy and follow-up, we prospectively evaluated quality of life in skin cancer patients using the Covid-19 Emotional Impact Survey (C-19EIS) and the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires. 101 patients (48 females and 53 males) completed both questionnaires. The mean C-19EIS score was 3.8 on a scale from 0 (no impact) to 12 (severe impact). Patients undergoing systemic therapy showed significantly impaired physical (p = 0.006) and social functioning (p = 0.003). However, when compared to the published normative EORTC QLQ-C30 data, there was no evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic had significantly impacted upon overall quality of life. Subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were significantly inversely correlated with the C-19EIS, validating its use in skin cancer patients. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, skin cancer patients in our tertiary referral center were surprisingly resilient. However, given the geographical variations in the rates of Sars-CoV-2 infection it is possible that the low incidence in Northern Germany may have resulted in a lack of general QoL impairments. Multi-center studies are required to further determine the impact of Covid-19 on psychological wellbeing in skin cancer patients in order to develop supportive interventions and to ensure that engagement with cancer care services is maintained in order to enable early detection of cancer progression and/or recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3196043783,"Saliva is a matrix which may act as a vector for pathogen transmission and may serve as a possible proxy for SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness. Therefore, the possibility of detection of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 in saliva by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization is tested, utilizing probes targeting the antisense or sense genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2. This method was applied in a pilot study with saliva samples collected from healthy persons and those presenting with mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms. In all participants, saliva appeared a suitable matrix for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Among the healthy, mild COVID-19-symptomatic and moderate COVID-19-symptomatic persons, 0%, 90% and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Moreover, the procedure allows for simultaneous measurement of viral load (‘presence’, sense genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA) and viral replication (‘activity’, antisense genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA) and may yield qualitative results. In addition, the visualization of DNA in the cells in saliva provides an additional cytological context to the validity and interpretability of the test results. The method described in this pilot study may be a valuable diagnostic tool for detection of SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing between ‘presence’ (viral load) and ‘activity’ (viral replication) of the virus. Moreover, the method potentially gives more information about possible contagiousness."
https://openalex.org/W3193350789,"In this work, we propose a quantitative model for the 2019 Chilean protests. We utilize public data for the consumer price index, the gross domestic product, and the employee and per capita income distributions as inputs for a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation, the solutions to which provide an in-depth analysis of the population dynamics. Specifically, the per capita income distribution stands out as a solution to the extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. According to our results, the concavity of employee income distribution is a decisive input parameter and, in contrast to the distributions typically observed for Chile and other countries in Latin America, should ideally be non-negative. Based on the results of our model, we advocate for the implementation of social policies designed to stimulate social mobility by broadening the distribution of higher salaries."
https://openalex.org/W3193462900,"Height loss starting in middle age is reported to be associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality later in life. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Hypoxia and oxidative stress, which are known causes of cardiovascular disease, could be reduced by hemoglobin. Therefore, hemoglobin could be inversely associated with height loss. However, high body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for intervertebral disc disorder, a known cause of height loss in adults. High BMI might confound the association between hemoglobin and height loss. Therefore, we performed analyses stratified by BMI status. To clarify the association between hemoglobin and height loss, we conducted a retrospective study of Japanese workers (6,471 men and 3,180 women) aged 40-74 years. Height loss was defined as being in the highest quintile of height decrease per year. In men overall and men with BMI <25 kg/m2, hemoglobin was significantly inversely associated with height loss; but no association was observed for men with high BMI (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) and for women. For men, after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for height loss with each 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in hemoglobin (1.0 g/dL for men and 0.8g/dL for women) were 0.89 (0.83, 0.95) for men overall, 0.82 (0.75, 0.89) for men who do not have high BMI, and 1.01 (0.92, 1.12) for men with high BMI. For women, the corresponding values were 0.97 (0.89, 1.06), 0.98 (0.89, 1.09), and 0.93 (0.75, 1.15) respectively. Hemoglobin is significantly inversely associated with height loss in men who do not have high BMI, but not in men with high BMI or women. These results help clarify the mechanisms underlying height loss, which has been reported to be associated with a higher risk of mortality in adults."
https://openalex.org/W3193780134,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the world with over 100 million infections to date, and currently many countries are fighting the second wave of infections. With neither sufficient vaccination capacity nor effective medication, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remain the measure of choice. However, NPIs place a great burden on society, the mental health of individuals, and economics. Therefore the cost/benefit ratio must be carefully balanced and a target-oriented small-scale implementation of these NPIs could help achieve this balance. To this end, we introduce a modified SEIRD-class compartment model and parametrize it locally for all 412 districts of Germany. The NPIs are modeled at district level by time varying contact rates. This high spatial resolution makes it possible to apply geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial patterns of the pandemic in Germany and to compare the results of different spatial resolutions. We find that the modified SEIRD model can successfully be fitted to the COVID-19 cases in German districts, states, and also nationwide. We propose the correlation length as a further measure, besides the weekly incidence rates, to describe the current situation of the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3194368279,"Heat shock proteins of 110 kDa (Hsp110s), a unique class of molecular chaperones, are essential for maintaining protein homeostasis. Hsp110s exhibit a strong chaperone activity preventing protein aggregation (the “holdase” activity) and also function as the major nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) for Hsp70 chaperones. Hsp110s contain two functional domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and substrate-binding domain (SBD). ATP binding is essential for Hsp110 function and results in close contacts between the NBD and SBD. However, the molecular mechanism of this ATP-induced allosteric coupling remains poorly defined. In this study, we carried out biochemical analysis on Msi3, the sole Hsp110 in Candida albicans, to dissect the unique allosteric coupling of Hsp110s using three mutations affecting the domain–domain interface. All the mutations abolished both the in vivo and in vitro functions of Msi3. While the ATP-bound state was disrupted in all mutants, only mutation of the NBD-SBDβ interfaces showed significant ATPase activity, suggesting that the full-length Hsp110s have an ATPase that is mainly suppressed by NBD-SBDβ contacts. Moreover, the high-affinity ATP-binding unexpectedly appears to require these NBD-SBD contacts. Remarkably, the “holdase” activity was largely intact for all mutants tested while NEF activity was mostly compromised, although both activities strictly depended on the ATP-bound state, indicating different requirements for these two activities. Stable peptide substrate binding to Msi3 led to dissociation of the NBD-SBD contacts and compromised interactions with Hsp70. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the exceptionally strong NBD-SBD contacts in Hsp110s dictate the unique allosteric coupling and biochemical activities.

Ubiquitously present in the eukaryotic cytosol, they play an essential role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Through this role, they provide essential protections for eukaryotic organisms against various stress conditions, including many human diseases. Thus, it is paramount to characterize the precise mechanism(s) of their action in maintaining protein homeostasis to understand their protective role against various diseases. As distant homologs of Hsp70s, Hsp110s are both chaperones on their own and cochaperones for Hsp70s. Hsp70s, an essential and universal class of molecular chaperones, play key roles in virtually all known processes in maintaining protein homeostasis (10Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A.

However, the functional roles of Hsp110s beyond NEFs remain a mystery. The unique biochemical properties of Hsp110s dictate their special chaperone activities. As homologs, Hsp110s share the same domain organization as Hsp70s (1Easton D.P. Kaneko Y. Subjeck J.R.

Both Hsp110s and Hsp70s have two functional domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) at the N-terminus and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) at the C-terminus. The SBD is further divided into SBDβ and SBDα. Connecting these two functional domains is a short interdomain linker. Hsp110s are larger in size due to an insertion in the SBDβ and a C-terminal extension beyond the SBDα. A recent study suggested a novel substrate-binding site in the C-terminal extension region of metazoan Hsp110s but not yeast Hsp110s (41Yakubu U.M. Morano K.A.

The NBD binds ATP or ADP and hydrolyzes bound ATP to ADP, i.e., the NBD has an ATPase activity. The SBD binds hydrophobic segments of polypeptides in extended conformation, normally only found in unfolded proteins. As there is little contact between the two domains in the ADP-bound and nucleotide-free (apo) states, the isolated SBD structures represent these states (45Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schroder H.

https://openalex.org/W3194906825,"Knowing the influence of intrinsic and environmental traits on animals’ movement is a central interest of ecology and can aid to enhance management decisions. The giant anteater ( Myrmecophaga tridactyla ) is a vulnerable mammal that presents low capacity for physiological thermoregulation and uses forests as thermal shelters. Here, we aim to provide reliable estimates of giant anteaters’ movement patterns and home range size, as well as untangle the role of intrinsic and environmental drivers on their movement. We GPS-tracked 19 giant anteaters in Brazilian savannah. We used a continuous-time movement model to estimate their movement patterns (described by home range crossing time, daily distance moved and directionality), and provide an autocorrelated kernel density estimate of home range size. Then, we used mixed structural equations to integratively model the effects of sex, body mass and proportion of forest cover on movement patterns and home range size, considering the complex net of interactions between these variables. Male giant anteaters presented more intensive space use and larger home range than females with similar body mass, as it is expected in polygynous social mating systems. Males and females increased home range size with increasing body mass, but the allometric scaling of intensity of space use was negative for males and positive for females, indicating different strategies in search for resources. With decreasing proportion of forest cover inside their home ranges, and, consequently, decreasing thermal quality of their habitat, giant anteaters increased home range size, possibly to maximize the chances of accessing thermal shelters. As frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and deforestation are increasing, effective management efforts need to consider the role of forests as an important thermal resource driving spatial requirements of this species. We highlight that both intrinsic and environmental drivers of animal movement should be integrated to better guide management strategies."

In this study, the efficiency of Polish county hospitals is assessed by considering characteristics of hospitals that may determine their performance, such as the form of ownership, size, and staff structure. The main goal was to analyze the effect of three possible determinants on efficiency: ownership, the presence of an Emergency Department, and the presence of an Intensive Care Unit. The study covered different subgroups of hospitals and different approaches of inputs and outputs. An input-oriented radial super-efficiency DEA model under variable returns to scale was used for the efficiency analysis, and then differences between distributions of efficient and inefficient units were evaluated using a Chi-square test. A Kruskal-Wallis test was also used to analyze differences in mean efficiency. Inefficiency scores were regressed with hospital characteristics to test for other determinants. These results did not confirm differences in efficiency concerning ownership. However, in some subgroups of hospitals, running an Emergency Department or an Intensive Care Unit had a significant effect. Tobit regression results provided additional insight into how an Emergency Department or Intensive Care Unit can affect efficiency. Both cases had an effect of increasing inefficiency, and the data suggested that the department/unit size plays an important role."
https://openalex.org/W3195898023,"Background Knowing the true infected and symptomatic case fatality ratios (IFR and CFR) for COVID-19 is of high importance for epidemiological model projections. Early in the pandemic many locations had limited testing and reporting, so that standard methods for determining IFR and CFR required large adjustments for missed cases. We present an alternate approach, based on results from the countries at the time that had a high test to positive case ratio to estimate symptomatic CFR. Methods We calculated age specific (0–69, 70–79, 80+ years old) time corrected crude symptomatic CFR values from 7 countries using two independent time to fatality correction methods. Data was obtained through May 7, 2020. We applied linear regression to determine whether the mean of these coefficients had converged to the true symptomatic CFR values. We then tested these coefficients against values derived in later studies as well as a large random serological study in NYC at that time. Results The age dependent symptomatic CFR values accurately predicted the percentage of the population infected as reported by two random testing studies in NYC. They also were in good agreement with later studies that estimated age specific IFR and CFR values from serological studies and more extensive data sets available later in the pandemic. Conclusions We found that for regions with extensive testing it is possible to get early accurate symptomatic CFR coefficients. These values, in combination with an estimate of the age dependence of infection, allows symptomatic CFR values and percentage of the population that is infected to be determined in similar regions with limited testing."
https://openalex.org/W3196078369,"Melatonin is a pleiotropic molecule with a variety of biological functions, which include its immunoregulatory action in mammals. Brucellosis is a worldwide endemic zoonotic disease caused by the Brucella, which not only causes huge economic losses for the livestock industry but also impacts human health. To target this problem, in current study, two marker-free transgenic sheep overexpressing melatonin synthetic enzyme ASMT (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase) gene were generated and these melatonin enrich transgenic sheep were challenged by Brucella infection. The results showed that the serum melatonin concentration was significantly higher in transgenic sheep than that of wild type (726.92 ± 70.6074 vs 263.10 ± 34.60 pg/mL, P < .05). Brucella challenge test showed that two thirds (4/6) of the wild-type sheep had brucellosis, while none of the transgenic sheep were infected. Whole-blood RNA-seq results showed that differential expression genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, phagosome, antigen processing, and presentation signaling pathways in overexpression sheep. The DEGs of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) families were verified by qPCR and it showed that TLR1, TLR2, TLR7, CD14, NAIP, and CXCL8 expression levels in overexpression sheep were significantly higher and NLRP1, NLRP3, and TNF expression levels were significantly lower than those of wild type. The rectal feces were subjected to 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and the microbial functional analysis showed that the transgenic sheep had significantly lower abundance of microbial genes related to infectious diseases compared to the wild type, indicating overexpression animals are likely more resistant to infectious diseases than wild type. Furthermore, exogenous melatonin treatment relieved brucellosis inflammation by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and downregulating pro-inflammatory IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-γ. Our preliminary results provide an informative reference for the study of the relationship between melatonin and brucellosis."
https://openalex.org/W3193744629,"Objective The present study seeks to assess the impact of gestational hypertensive disorders on premature newborns below 34 weeks and to establish the main morbidities and mortality in the neonatal period and at 18 months. Materials and methods A retrospective observational study was carried out with 695 premature newborns of gestational age (GA) between 24 and 33 weeks and 6 days, born alive in the Neonatal ICU of Brasília’s Mother and Child Hospital (HMIB), in the period from January 1, 2014, to July 31, 2019. In total, 308 infants were born to hypertensive mothers (G1) and 387 to normotensive mothers (G2). Twin pregnancies and diabetic patients with severe malformations were excluded. Outcomes during hospitalization and outcomes of interest were evaluated: respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), brain ultrasonography, diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, breastfeeding rate at discharge, survival at discharge and at 18 months of chronological age and relationship between weight and gestational age. Results Newborns with hypertensive mothers had significantly lower measurements of birth weight and head circumference. The G1 group had a higher risk small for gestational age (OR 2.4; CI 95% 1.6–3.6; p &lt;0.00), as well as a greater risk of being born with a weight less than 850 g (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2–3.5; p &lt;0.00). Newborns of mothers with hypertension presented more necrotizing enterocolitis (OR 2.0; CI 95% 1.1–3.7); however, resuscitation in the delivery room and the need to use surfactant did not differ between groups, nor did the length of stay on mechanical ventilation, or dependence on oxygen at 36 weeks of gestational age. Survival was better in newborns of normotensive mothers, and this was a protective factor against death (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5–0.9; p &lt;0.01). In the follow-up clinic, survival at 18 months of chronological age was similar between groups, with rates of 95.3% and 92.1% among hypertensive and normotensive mothers, respectively. Exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was 73.4% in the group of hypertensive women and 77.3% in the group of normotensive mothers. There were no significant differences between groups. Conclusion Among the analyzed outcomes, arterial hypertension during pregnancy can increase the risk of low weight, small babies for gestational age (SGA), deaths in the neonatal period and enterocolitis, with no differences in weight and survival at 18 months of chronological age. Arterial hypertension presents a high risk of prematurity in the neonatal period, with no difference at 18 months of age."
https://openalex.org/W3195173656,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has emerged as a global health threat after the 2015 outbreak in the Americas, where devastating congenital defects were documented. There are currently no vaccines to prevent ZIKV infections nor commercially available clinical diagnostic tests demonstrated to identify ZIKV without cross-reactive interference of related flaviviruses. Early diagnosis is critical when treating symptomatic patients and in preventing ZIKV transmission. In this context, the development of sensitive and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed for the detection of ZIKV acute infection. The aim of this study consisted of obtaining monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against denatured monomeric ZIKV Nonstructural protein 1 (ZNS1), a useful diagnostic marker for flavivirus early detection, in order to develop a highly specific and sensitive ZNS1 indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA). The production of hybridomas secreting ZNS1 mAbs was carried out through immunizations with denatured monomeric ZNS1. We selected 1F5 and 6E2 hybridoma clones, which recognized the heat-denatured ZNS1 hexameric form by indirect ELISA. Cross-reaction studies indicated that these mAbs specifically bind to a ZNS1 linear epitope, and that they do not cross-react with the NS1 protein from other related flaviviruses. The 1F5 mAb enabled the development of a sensitive and reproducible icELISA to detect and quantify small amounts of ZNS1 disease marker in heat-denatured human sera. Here, we establish a reliable 1F5 based-icELISA that constitutes a promising diagnostic tool for control strategies and the prevention of ZIKV propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3195449158,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are central regulators of the inflammatory response and play an important role in inflammatory diseases. PINT has been reported to be involved in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. However, the potential functions of PINT in the innate immune system are largely unknown. Here, we revealed the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory genes by PINT, whose expression is primarily dependent on the NF-κB signaling pathway in human and mouse macrophage and intestinal epithelial cell lines. Functionally, PINT selectively regulates the expression of TNF-α in basal and LPS-stimulated cells. Mechanistically, PINT acts as a modular scaffold of p65 and EZH2 to coordinate their localization and specify their binding to the target genes. Further, a high expression level of PINT was detected in intestinal mucosal tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Together, these findings demonstrate that PINT acts as an activator of inflammatory responses, highlighting the importance of this lncRNA as a potential therapeutic target in infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3195628526,"Regarding the high prevalence of vitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency in the population and its possible association with ear diseases, we aimed to investigate the 25(OH)Dserum level in patients with subjective, nonpulsating tinnitus and its effect on tinnitus severity. The study included 201 tinnitus patients and 99 controls. Patient clinical information, including tinnitus characteristics and severity according to Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), loudness assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), audiometry, and the blood level of vitamin D, was recorded. The level of 25(OH)D in tinnitus patients was significantly decreased compared with the controls (19.86 ± 7.53 and 27.43 ± 8.85 ng/ml, respectively; P value &lt; 0.0001). More patients in the tinnitus group were deficient in vitamin D, compared with the controls (50.7% vs. 22.2% respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). Tinnitus patients with a lower serum level of 25(OH)D (≤15 ng/dl) were significantly younger, had a higher degree of tinnitus severity measured with THI and VAS scales, had higher triglyceride and TSH levels, and a lower HDL level compared with individuals who had higher 25(OH)D level (&gt;15 ng/dl). There was a strong correlation between the 25(OH)D level and THI. Our findings suggest that a large proportion of tinnitus patients suffers from vitamin D deficiency and that the vitamin D level correlates with tinnitus impact. We recommend a vitamin D assessment for all tinnitus patients."

The objective of this study was to determine if breakdown of the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) occurs during malaria infection in children. Measures of eGC integrity, endothelial activation, and microvascular reactivity were prospectively evaluated in 146 children: 44 with moderately severe malaria (MSM), 42 with severe malaria (SM), and 60 healthy controls (HC). Biochemical measures of eGC integrity included plasma syndecan-1 and total urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Side-stream dark field imaging was used to quantitatively assess integrity of eGC. Plasma angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) was measured as a marker of endothelial activation and also as a possible mediator of eGC breakdown. Our results show that urinary GAG, syndecan-1, and Ang-2 were elevated in patients with MSM and SM compared with HC. Syndecan-1 and GAG levels correlated significantly with each other and with plasma Ang-2. The eGC breakdown products also inversely correlated significantly with hemoglobin and platelet count. In the MSM group, imaging results provided further evidence for eGC degradation. Although not correlated with markers of eGC degradation, vascular function (assessed by non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) demonstrated reduced microvascular reactivity, particularly affecting the SM group. Our findings provide further evidence for breakdown of eGC in falciparum malaria that may contribute to endothelial activation and adhesion of parasitized red blood cells, with reduced nitric oxide formation, and vascular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3194056266,"Healthcare workers (HWs) have at least twice the risk of tuberculosis (TB) compared to the general population. There is growing emphasis on latent TB infection (LTBI) in high-risk populations. Yet we know little about HWs' perspectives of LTBI testing and treatment to inform implementation in high-incidence settings. We developed a qualitative networked approach to analyze HWs' perspectives on LTBI testing and treatment.We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with nurse and physician stakeholders, who had been recruited as part of a larger study evaluating TB transmission risk in HWs at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. We performed open coding to identify emergent themes and selective coding to identify relevant text citations. We used thematic analysis to inductively derive the CARD (Constraints, Actions, Risks, Desires) framework.All HWs desired to avoid developing TB but few felt this was actionable. Despite LTBI knowledge gaps, safety and cost concerns, most HWs reported hypothetical willingness to take LTBI treatment. The CARD framework showed that desire and action related to LTBI testing and treatment was clearly framed by the interactions between constraints, administrative action, and risk. The surprise HWs described on receiving a negative LTBI (Quantiferon-Plus) result suggests LTBI testing may recalibrate HWs' perceptions regarding the futility of actions to reduce their TB risk.LTBI testing and treatment are acceptable to HWs and could counteract the perceived inevitability of occupational TB infection that currently may limit risk reduction action. This should be coupled with administrative leadership and infrastructural support. The CARD analytic framework is a helpful tool for implementation scientists to understand current practices within complex health systems. Application of CARD could facilitate the development of contextually-relevant interventions to address important public health problems such as occupational TB."

The Thai Short Version of Revised Experience of Close Relationships Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were administered to all participants. We assessed BDI-II scores, classified by attachment patterns, using one-way analyses of variance. The associated factors and predictors of depression severity were analysed by chi-square and logistic regression analyses, respectively.A total of 180 participants (75% female; mean age = 45.2 ± 14.3 years) were recruited. Dismissing attachment was the most common pattern in Thai depressed patients (36.1%). Depressed patients with preoccupied attachment demonstrated the highest BDI-II scores. The best predictor of moderate to severe depression severity was preoccupied/fearful attachment (odds ratio = 3.68; 95% confidence interval = 2.05-7.30).Anxious attachment was found to be associated with higher depression severity. Preoccupied/fearful attachment was the predictor of moderate to severe depression severity."

Determining the sex of a footprint can be useful in screening such impressions and attempts have been made to do so using single or multi landmark distances, shape analyses and via the density of friction ridges. Here we explore the relative importance of different components in sexing two-dimensional foot impressions namely, size, shape and texture. We use a machine learning approach and compare this to more traditional methods of discrimination. Two datasets are used, a pilot data set collected from students at Bournemouth University (N = 196) and a larger data set collected by podiatrists at Sheffield NHS Teaching Hospital (N = 2677). Our convolutional neural network can sex a footprint with accuracy of around 90% on a test set of N = 267 footprint images using all image components, which is better than an expert can achieve. However, the quality of the impressions impacts on this success rate, but the results are promising and in time it may be possible to create an automated screening algorithm in which practitioners of whatever sort (medical or forensic) can obtain a first order sexing of a two-dimensional footprint."

However, there is a discrepancy between APOBEC3A mRNA levels after interferon stimulation in myeloid cells and A3A detection at the protein level. To understand this difference, we investigated the expression of two novel alternative ""A3Alt"" proteins encoded in the +1-shifted reading frame of the APOBEC3A gene. A3Alt-L and its shorter isoform A3Alt-S appear to be transmembrane proteins targeted to the mitochondrial compartment that induce membrane depolarization and apoptosis. Thus, the APOBEC3A gene represents a new example wherein a single gene encodes two proapoptotic proteins, A3A cytidine deaminases that target the genome and A3Alt proteins that target mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W3195887471,"Highly methylated Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements 1 (LINE-1) constitute approximately 20% of the human genome, thus serving as a surrogate marker of global genomic DNA methylation. To date, there is still lacking a consensus about the precise location in LINE-1 promoter and its methylation threshold value, making challenging the use of LINE-1 methylation as a diagnostic, prognostic markers in cancer. This study reports on a technical standardization of bisulfite-based DNA methylation analysis, which ensures the complete bisulfite conversion of repeated LINE-1 sequences, thus allowing accurate LINE-1 methylation value. In addition, the study also indicated the precise location in LINE-1 promoter of which significant variance in methylation level makes LINE-1 methylation as a potential diagnostic biomarker for lung cancer. A serial concentration of 5-50-500 ng of DNA from 275 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissues were converted by bisulfite; methylation level of two local regions (at nucleotide position 300-368 as LINE-1.1 and 368-460 as LINE-1.2) in LINE-1 promoter was measured by real time PCR. The use of 5 ng of genomic DNA but no more allowed to detect LINE-1 hypomethylation in lung cancer tissue (14.34% versus 16.69% in non-cancerous lung diseases for LINE-1.1, p < 0.0001, and 30.28% versus 32.35% for LINE-1.2, p < 0.05). Our study thus highlighted the optimal and primordial concentration less than 5 ng of genomic DNA guarantees the complete LINE-1 bisulfite conversion, and significant variance in methylation level of the LINE-1 sequence position from 300 to 368 allowed to discriminate lung cancer from non-cancer samples."
https://openalex.org/W3193813071,"Different factors were shown to alter the vibration characteristics of soft-tissue compartments during running. Changing pre-heel strike muscle activation or changing footwear conditions represents two possibilities to influence the vibration response via frequency shift or altered damping. Associated with the study of muscle pre-tuning is the difficulty in quantifying clean experimental data for the acceleration of soft-tissue compartments and muscle activities in heterogeneous populations. The purpose of this study was to determine the vibration and pre-tuning response to footwear across a wide range of participants during running and establish and describe groups formed according to the damping coefficient. 32 subjects were used for further analysis. The subjects ran at a self-selected speed (5 min) on a treadmill in two different shoes (soft & hard), while soft-tissue accelerations and muscle activation at the gastrocnemius medialis were quantified. Damping coefficients, total muscle intensity and dominant vibration frequencies were determined. Anthropometrics and skinfold measurements of the lower limbs were obtained. According to the damping coefficient response to the footwear intervention, three groups were formed, with most runners (n = 20) showing less damping in the hard shoe. Total muscle intensity, anthropometrics, and dominant vibration frequency across footwear were not different for these three groups. Most runners (84.4%) used the strategy of adjusting the damping coefficients significantly when switching footwear. Despite damping being the preferred adjustment to changes in footwear, muscle pre-tuning might not be the only mechanism to influence damping as previously suggested. Future studies should focus on the subject-specific composition of soft-tissue compartments to elucidate their contribution to vibrations."

Nevertheless, little is understood about the mechanism for the sudden initiation of cell growth under static conditions. We focused on cellular junctions as one region where breaking out of contact inhibition occurs. In well-differentiated endometrial cancer cells, Sawano, the ligand administration for tricellular tight junction protein LSR, which transiently decreased the robust junction property, caused an abrupt increase in cell motility and consequent excessive multilayered cell growth despite being under contact inhibition conditions. We observed that macropinocytosis essentially and temporarily occurred as an antecedent event for the above process at intercellular junctions without disruption of the junction apparatus but not at the apical plasma membrane. Collectively, we concluded that the formation of macropinocytosis, which is derived from tight junction-mediated signaling, was triggered for the initiation of cell growth in static precancerous epithelium."

Therefore, mice were treated with koumiss and fresh mare milk for 14 days before M bovis infection and continue for 5 weeks after infection. The results showed a clear change in the intestinal flora of mice treated with koumiss, and the lungs of mice treated with koumiss showed severe edema, inflammatory infiltration, and pulmonary nodules in M bovis-infected mice. Notably, we found that the content of short-chain fatty acids was significantly lower in the koumiss-treated group compared with the control group. However, the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis-related proteins in the lungs of koumiss-treated mice were significantly decreased. Collectively, these findings suggest that koumiss treatment disturb the intestinal flora of, which is associated with disease severity and the possible mechanism that induces lungs pathology. Our current findings can be exploited further to establish the “gut-lung” axis which might be a novel strategy for the control of tuberculosis."

Little is known about the association between multiple neurodevelopmental markers and premature mortality at a population level. The ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations) approach considers multiple neurodevelopmental parameters, assessing several markers in parallel that cluster, rather than considering individual diagnostic categories in isolation.To determine whether childhood neurodevelopmental markers, including reduced intellectual functioning, are associated with all-cause premature mortality.In a general population cohort study (n = 12,150) with longitudinal follow up from childhood to middle age, Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the associations between childhood neurodevelopmental markers (Rutter B scale and IQ) and premature all-cause mortality.The cognitive measures and 21 of the 26 Rutter B items were significantly associated with premature mortality in bivariate analyses with hazard ratios from 1.24 (95% CI 1.05-1.47) to 2.25 (95% CI 1.78-2.90). In the final adjusted model, neurodevelopmental markers suggestive of several domains including hyperactivity, conduct problems and intellectual impairment were positively associated with premature mortality and improved prediction of premature mortality.A wide range of neurodevelopmental markers, including childhood IQ, were found to predict premature mortality in a large general population cohort with longitudinal follow up to 60-65 years of age.These findings highlight the importance of a holistic assessment of children with neurodevelopmental markers that addresses a range of neurodevelopmental conditions. Our findings could open the door to a shift in child public mental health focus, where multiple and/or cumulative markers of neurodevelopmental conditions alert clinicians to the need for early intervention. This could lead to a reduction in the risk of broad health outcomes at a population level."
https://openalex.org/W3196083297,"Skeletal muscle contains multiple cell types that work together to maintain tissue homeostasis. Among these, satellite cells (SC) and fibroadipogenic progenitors cells (FAPs) are the two main stem cell pools. Studies of these cells using animal models have shown the importance of interactions between these cells in repair of healthy muscle, and degeneration of dystrophic muscle. Due to the unavailability of fresh patient muscle biopsies, similar analysis of interactions between human FAPs and SCs is limited especially among the muscular dystrophy patients. To address this issue here we describe a method that allows the use of frozen human skeletal muscle biopsies to simultaneously isolate and grow SCs and FAPs from healthy or dystrophic patients. We show that while the purified SCs differentiate into mature myotubes, purified FAPs can differentiate into adipocytes or fibroblasts demonstrating their multipotency. We find that these FAPs can be immortalized and the immortalized FAPs (iFAPs) retain their multipotency. These approaches open the door for carrying out personalized analysis of patient FAPs and interactions with the SCs that lead to muscle loss."

We examined the association between circulating amino acids and the risk of depressive symptoms in a Japanese working population.Participants were 841 workers who were free from depressive symptoms and provided blood at baseline and completed 3-yr follow-up survey. 30 varieties of amino acid concentrations in serum were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Depressive symptoms were defined using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios of depressive symptoms according to serum amino acids with adjustment for lifestyle factors.A total of 151 (18.0%) workers were newly identified as having depressive symptoms at the follow-up. Baseline tryptophan and glutamate concentrations in serum were not appreciably associated with the risk of depressive symptoms. Risk of depressive symptoms tended to increase with increasing arginine concentrations; the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus lowest tertile of serum arginine was 1.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.96-2.83; P for trend = 0.07). No clear association was found for other amino acids.Results of the present study do not support a significant role of circulating amino acids in the development of depressive symptoms among Japanese."
https://openalex.org/W3193688553,"Studies of female genital structures have generally lagged behind comparable studies of male genitalia, in part because of an assumption of a lower level of variability, but also because internal genitalia are much more difficult to study. Using multiple microscopy techniques, including video stereomicroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LT-SEM), and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) we examined whether the complex sperm transfer structures in males of Megalolaelaps colossus (Acari: Mesostigmata) are matched by similarly complex internal structures in the female. While both LT-SEM and CLSM are well suited for obtaining high-quality surface images, CLSM also proved to be a valuable technique for observing internal anatomical structures. The long and coiled sperm transfer organ on the chelicera of the males (spermatodactyl) largely matches an equally complex, but internal, spiral structure in the females in shape, size, and direction. This result strongly suggests some form of genital coevolution. A hypothesis of sexual conflict appears to provide the best fit for all available data (morphology and life history)."
https://openalex.org/W3194247636,"The unprecedented population aging brings profound influences to the social values of longevity. The individual attitudes toward the expended life time deserves scrutiny, as it reflects the impacts of social networks and social welfare on people’s life and wellbeing. This study aims to examine whether and how gender disparity is affecting the individual anticipation to longevity among Japanese citizen. We used the dataset of National Survey on Social Security and Peoples Life implemented in 2017 to calculate the odds ratios (OR) of the individual anticipation to longevity. Besides gender, other demographic characteristics, physical and mental health, the experience of nursing care for the elderly, financial conditions and social networks are examined by performing the multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis. The results indicate the robust effects of gender disparity on the individual aspiration for longevity. The proportion of those who inclined the positive statement on longevity was estimated to be 69.7% (95% CI: 68.6% - 70.9%) in the whole population, and 70.9% (95% CI: 69.4% - 72.5%) and 68.7% (95% CI: 67.1% - 70.2%) in male and female, respectively. Besides gender, independent factors significantly affecting the individual valuation of longevity include age, annual household income, the experience of nursing care, household saving, having a conversation with others and the availability of reliable partner(s) for relevant supports; while the common factors affecting the outcome variable were self-perceived health status and mental distress measured by K6. The interaction of gender and these significant factors were determined as well. In conclusion, with relevant representativeness and quality of data source, this analysis adds knowledge on gender disparity in the individual anticipation on longevity. The findings are suggestive to reform the social security system in the super aged society."
https://openalex.org/W3194616284,"Two distinct genetic mutational pathways characterized by either chromosomal instability or high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) are recognized in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, it has been shown that patients with primary CRC that displays MSI-H have a significant, stage-independent, multivariate survival advantage. Biological properties of CMS1 (MSI-H type) can affect therapeutic efficiencies of agents used in the treatment of CRC, and therefore become a new predictive factor of the treatment. But, the predictive impact of MSI-H status for adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial. This study will assess whether there is any unnecessary or inappropriate use of treatment agents recommended for adjuvant therapy of stage 2 and 3 of disease and for palliative or curative treatment of liver metastatic disease in microsatellite instability high group, a molecular subtype of colon cancer. Within this scope, the efficiencies of fluorouracil- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapeutic agents will be shown on stage 3 microsatellite instability high colon tumor cell lines first, and then a microfluidic model will be created, imitating the metastasis of colon cancer to the liver. In the microfluidic chip model, we will create in liver tissue, where the metastasis of microsatellite instability high colon cancer will be simulated; the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy agents, and targeted agents on tumor cells as well as drug response will be assessed according to cell viability through released biomarkers from the cells. The proposed hypothesis study includes the modeling and treatment of patient-derived post-metastatic liver cancer in microfluidics which has priority at the global and our region and consequently develop personal medication."
https://openalex.org/W3195591194,"Influenza viruses are known to be infected through epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. The oral cavity is in close anatomical proximity to the upper respiratory tract, and it is conceivable that the viruses could pass through the oral cavity and infect to the upper respiratory tract. Several researchers have suggested that colonization of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae might affect the risk of influenza viral disease, indicating that oral hygiene and/or condition might play an important role in respiratory viral infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether an oral hygiene/condition might impact influenza infection. We conducted a retrospective observational study of Japanese citizens’ regional cohort (N = 2,904) consisting of National Health Insurance beneficiaries who underwent annual health/dental examination with data entries in the Kokuho database (KDB). Trained dentists checked the oral hygiene/condition, and saliva specimens were examined using the LION dental saliva multi-test (SMT) kit. Influenza infection was identified from the diagnosis recorded in the KDB. The correlations between influenza infection and oral hygiene, dryness of the mouth, or various salivary test results were examined by a multivariate analysis adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, age, recent smoking, alcohol drinking, BMI, HbA1c, RBC for influenza infection. The logistic regression model showed that age significantly correlated with influenza infection. In addition, oral hygiene status had a nearly significant impact on influenza infection (p = 0.061), whereby, the subjects with poor oral hygiene had a higher risk of influenza infection than those with good oral hygiene (odds ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.89–2.95). Further, the prevalence of influenza infection was lower in the subjects with saliva weakly acidic and/or containing higher protein level. The results of this study suggested that the maintenance of oral health conditions might be one of the pivotal factors for preventing and reducing influenza infection."

This study investigated the spatial distribution pattern of field insect communities to detect the spatial relationships between insect communities in farmland. The study site was located at the Dehui Agro-ecological Experimental Station of Black Soil, Jilin, China. Insect communities and environmental factors were sampled at 121 uniformly distributed points in a 400 × 400 m plot in August, September, and October 2015. The analysis revealed that insect communities from June to October demonstrated significant spatial correlation, and 6085 samples of 47 species and 47 families in 11 orders were collected from the insect community in the farmland. The farmland insect community structure changes and dynamic changes of nutritional function groups occur with time. According to the 400 x 400 m plot, the diversity of farmland insect communities and functional groups is maintained at a relatively high and stable level. In this study, a total of 6085 samples of corn farmland insects were obtained using the fluke method and direct observation method, including 11 orders, 26 families and 47 species, 4 absolute dominant populations, 6 main dominant populations, and 37 other populations. These studies can provide help for pest control in the spring corn area of Northeast China."
https://openalex.org/W3194536220,"For staged multi-cluster fracturing, methods for controlling perforation friction to adjust the flow distribution of each cluster can effectively promote the uniform extension of multiple fractures but lacks a fast and quantitative optimization method for different perforation parameters of each cluster. By establishing a numerical model of single-stage three-cluster flow-limited fracturing under stress-seepage coupling, and based on the response surface optimization method, fully considering the impact of perforation parameters interaction among three perforation clusters, according to the regression equation fitted under the global response, the rapid optimization of perforation parameters of segmented multi-cluster fracturing model is realized. The results show that: in determining the three factors of the study, it is found that there is an obvious interaction between the number of intermediate cluster perforations and the number of cluster perforations on both sides, the number of cluster perforations on both sides and the diameter of intermediate cluster perforations, the response surface optimization method gives the optimal perforation parameter combination of three clusters of fractures under global response; When the perforation parameters were combined before optimization, the fracture length difference was 32.550m, and the intermediate perforation cluster evolved into invalid perforation cluster, when the perforation parameters were combined after optimization, the fracture length difference was 0.528m, the three perforation clusters spread uniformly, and there are no invalid clusters. At the same time, the regression equation under the response is optimized before and after the comparison between the predicted value of the equation and the actual simulation value. It is found that the estimated deviation rate of the equation before optimization is 1.2%, and the estimated deviation rate after optimization is 0.4%. The estimated deviation rates are all less, and the response regression equation based on the response surface optimization method can quickly optimize the perforation parameters. The response surface optimization method is suitable for the multi parameter optimization research of formation fracturing which is often affected by many geological and engineering factors. Combining with the engineering practice and integrating more factors to optimize the hydraulic fracturing parameters, it is of great significance to improve the success rate of hydraulic fracturing application."
https://openalex.org/W3195026778,"Background Lateralization of the glenoid implant improves functional outcomes in Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty. Lateralization does not appear to impact the Deltoid’s Moment Arm. Therefore, the stabilizing effect described in the literature would not be the result of an increase this moment arm. A static biomechanical model, derived from Magnetic Resonance Imaging, can be used to assess the coaptation effect of the Middle Deltoid. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of increasing amounts of glenoid lateralization on the moment arm but also on its coaptation effect. Methods Eight patients (72.6 ± 6.5 years) operated for Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty were included in the study. Three-dimensional models of each shoulder were created based on imaging taken at 6 months postoperative. A least square sphere representing the prosthetic implant was added to each 3D models. A static biomechanical model was then applied to different planar portions of the Middle Deltoid (from 3D models), first without lateralization and then with simulated lateralization of 6, 9 and 12mm. This static model enables to compute a Coaptation/Elevation Ratio and to measure the Deltoid’s Moment Arm. The inter- and intra-rater agreement of the 3D models was evaluated. Results One patient was excluded due to motion during imaging. The inter- and intra-rater agreement was over 0.99. The ratio increased starting at 6 mm of lateralization ( p&lt;0 . 05 ), compared to the initial position. The moment arm was not affected by lateralization ( p&lt;0 . 05 ), except in two slices starting at 9 mm (S1 p&lt;0 . 05 and S2 p&lt;0 . 05 ). Conclusion Our hypothesis that the Middle Deltoid’s coaptation role would be greater with glenosphere lateralization was confirmed. This trend was not found in the moment arm, which showed little sensitivity to lateralization. The stabilizing effect therefore appears to stem from the coaptation role of the Middle Deltoid."
https://openalex.org/W3195406391,"The pace-of-life hypothesis is a socio-psychological theory postulating that citizens of different cities transact the business of life at varying paces, and this pace is associated with a number of population level variables. Here we apply the pace-of-life hypothesis to a hospital context to empirically test the association between pace and patient and staff outcomes. As pressure on hospitals grow and pace increases to keep up with demand, is there empirical evidence of a trade-off between a rapid pace and poorer outcomes? We collected data from four large Australian hospitals, inviting all staff (clinical and non-clinical) to complete a survey, and conducted a series of observations of hospital staff’s walking pace and transactional pace. From these data we constructed three measures of pace: staff perception of pace, transactional pace, and walking pace. Outcome measures included: hospital culture, perceived patient safety, and staff well-being outcomes of job satisfaction and burnout. Overall, participants reported experiencing a “fast-paced” “hurried” and “rapid” pace-of-life working in the Australian hospital sector. We found a significant difference in perceived pace across four hospital sites, similar to trends observed for transactional pace. This provides support that the pace-of-life hypothesis may apply to the hospital context. We tested associations between faster perceived pace, hospital culture, staff well-being and patient safety. Results revealed perceived faster pace significantly predicted negative perceptions of organizational culture, greater burnout and lower job satisfaction. However, perceived pace did not predict perceptions of patient safety. Different perceptions of hospital pace-of-life were found between different clinical settings and the type of care delivered; staff working in emergency departments reported significantly “faster-paced” work environments than staff working in palliative, aged care, or rehabilitation wards."
