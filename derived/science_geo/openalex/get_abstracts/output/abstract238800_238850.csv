https://openalex.org/W2081037209,"Gluconobacter oxydans is unsurpassed by other organisms in its ability to incompletely oxidize a great variety of carbohydrates, alcohols and related compounds. Furthermore, the organism is used for several biotechnological processes, such as vitamin C production. To further our understanding of its overall metabolism, we sequenced the complete genome of G. oxydans 621H. The chromosome consists of 2,702,173 base pairs and contains 2,432 open reading frames. In addition, five plasmids were identified that comprised 232 open reading frames. The sequence data can be used for metabolic reconstruction of the pathways leading to industrially important products derived from sugars and alcohols. Although the respiratory chain of G. oxydans was found to be rather simple, the organism contains many membrane-bound dehydrogenases that are critical for the incomplete oxidation of biotechnologically important substrates. Moreover, the genome project revealed the unique biochemistry of G. oxydans with respect to the process of incomplete oxidation."

https://openalex.org/W2031733455,"We investigated the effect of sildenafil in protection against necrosis or apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Adult mouse ventricular myocytes were treated with sildenafil (1 or 10 μm) for 1 h before 40 min of simulated ischemia (SI). Necrosis was determined by trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase release following SI alone or plus 1 or 18 h of reoxygenation (RO). Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay and mitochondrial membrane potential measured using a fluorescent probe 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1). Sildenafil reduced necrosis as indicated by decrease in trypan blue-positive myocytes and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase compared with untreated cells after either SI or SI-RO. The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling-positive myocytes or loss of JC-1 fluorescence following SI and 18 h of RO was attenuated in the sildenafil-treated group with concomitant inhibition of caspase 3 activity. An early increase in Bcl-2 to Bax ratio with sildenafil treatment was also observed in myocytes after SI-RO. The increase of Bcl-2 expression by sildenafil was inhibited by nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, l-nitro-amino-methyl-ester. The drug also enhanced mRNA and protein content of inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) in the myocytes. Sildenafil-induced protection against necrosis and apoptosis was absent in the myocytes derived from iNOS knock-out mice and was attenuated in eNOS knock-out myocytes. The up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression by sildenafil was also absent in iNOS-deficient myocytes. Reverse transcription-PCR, Western blots, and immunohistochemical assay confirmed the expression of phosphodiesterase-5 in mouse cardiomyocytes. These data provide strong evidence for a direct protective effect of sildenafil against necrosis and apoptosis through NO signaling pathway. The results may have possible therapeutic potential in preventing myocyte cell death following ischemia/reperfusion.

By means of its potent action of enhancing NO-driven cGMP accumulation and ensuing vasodilatation in corpus cavernosum, sildenafil has become the most widely used drug for treating erectile dysfunction in men since its market debut under the trade name Viagra® in 1998 (1.Boolell M.

In recent years, there are several studies on sildenafil for its therapeutic applications in diseases other than erectile dysfunction (4.Katz S.D. Balidemaj K. Homma S. Wu H. Wang J. Maybaum S. J.

For example, sildenafil has been shown to enhance flow-mediated vasodilatation in chronic heart failure patients (4.Katz S.D. Balidemaj K. Homma S. Wu H. Wang J. Maybaum S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 36: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because of its potent vasodilatory action, sildenafil has also been extensively studied for treating primary or hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in adults and children (5.Abrams D. Schulze-Neick I. Magee A.G. Heart. 2000; 84: e4Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 6.Prasad S. Wilkinson J. Gatzoulis M.A. N. Engl. J.

Circulation. 2003; 107: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). An epidemiological study (12.Shakir S.A.W. Wilton L.V. Boshier A. Layton D. Heeley E. Br. Med. J. 2001; 322: 651-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) suggested that patients receiving sildenafil therapy for erectile dysfunction had reduced incidence of myocardial infarction than the general population matched with age, gender, and other risk factors. More interestingly, our laboratory recently discovered a powerful preconditioning-like effect of sildenafil in rabbit hearts (13.Ockaili R. Salloum F. Hawkins J. Kukreja R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1263-H1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Either intravenous or oral administration of sildenafil caused significant reduction of infarct size following ischemia/reperfusion in the myocardium. This protection was blocked by 5-hydroxydecanoate, a selective blocker of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Sildenafil-induced cardioprotection has also been demonstrated in a model of global ischemia and reperfusion in mouse (14.Salloum F. Yin C. Xi L. Kukrej R.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as well as rat (15.Das S. Maulik N. Das D.K. Kadowitz P.J. Bivalacqua T.J. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 2002; 28: 213-219PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study in rabbits has shown that early translocation of protein kinase C, especially the α, θ, and δ isoforms to the membranous fractions, may play an essential role in sildenafil-induced cardioprotection (16.Das A. Ockaili R. Salloum F. Kukreja R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1455-H1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on these studies (13.Ockaili R. Salloum F. Hawkins J. Kukreja R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1263-H1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14.Salloum F. Yin C. Xi L. Kukrej R.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15.Das S.

Physiol. 2004; 286: H1455-H1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we postulated that sildenafil triggers signaling cascade that involves the activation of protein kinase C, the generation of NO, and the accumulation of cGMP in the myocardium through inducible and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS and eNOS), thereby leading to cardioprotection via opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels (17.Kukreja R.C.

Cardiol. 2000; 95: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Despite these novel and exciting observations, several fundamental issues concerning the mechanisms of sildenafil-induced cardioprotection still need to be addressed. First, it is possible that the profound vasodilatation caused by sildenafil may potentially trigger a preconditioning response in the heart. However, it remains unknown whether the drug also exerts a direct protective effect in the cardiomyocytes independent of its vascular/hypotensive effect. Second, although studies in intact hearts have demonstrated a significant protective effect of sildenafil against necrosis (infarction), there is absolutely no information in the literature suggesting that the drug also inhibits apoptosis or whether the mitochondria are the targets of protection in the cardiomyocytes. Third, despite the fact that NO signaling plays an important role in sildenafil-induced delayed preconditioning in the intact mouse heart, it is not known whether this pathway also regulates necrosis or apoptosis in the cardiomyocytes following simulated ischemia (SI) and reoxygenation (RO). Fourth, there is controversy over the presence of PDE5 in the mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes (20.Ito M. Nishikawa M. Fujioka M. Miyahara M. Isaka N. Shiku H. Nakano T. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21.Wallis R.M. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Ellis P. Am. J.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1718-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which may serve as the primary target for the action of sildenafil. To address these critical issues, we designed the current investigation to demonstrate the direct protective effect of sildenafil in a cardiomyocytes model of SI-RO injury. This model was particularly useful in studying the protective effect of sildenafil independent of any vascular effects or other cell types. We determined the effect of eNOS/iNOS in necrosis and apoptosis using cardiomyocytes derived from gene knock-out mice. Moreover, this study allowed us to directly examine the PDE5 expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Ventricular Cardiomyocytes—Adult male outbred ICR mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The adult male iNOS and eNOS knock-out mice (stock numbers 002596 and 002684) and their corresponding wild-type controls (B6,129 and C57BL/6J) were supplied by The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The animal experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Commonwealth University. The ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated using an enzymatic technique modified from the previously reported method (24.Xiao R.-P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y.-Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 25.Zhou Y.-Y. Wang S.-Q. Zhu W. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the mouse was anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and the heart was quickly removed from the chest. Within 3 min, the aortic opening was cannulated onto a Langendorff perfusion system (26.Xi L. Hess M.L. Kukreja R.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 186: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the heart was retrogradely perfused (37 °C) at a constant pressure of 55 mm Hg for ∼5 min with a Ca2+-free bicarbonate-based buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 20 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime, and 5 mm taurine that was continuously gassed with 95% O2 + 5% CO2. The enzymatic digestion was commenced by adding collagenase type II (Worthington; 0.5 mg/ml each) and protease type XIV (0.02 mg/ml) to the perfusion buffer and continued for ∼15 min. 50 μm Ca2+ was then added in to the enzyme solution for perfusing the heart for another 10–15 min. The digested ventricular tissue was cut into chunks and gently aspirated with a transfer pipette for facilitating the cell dissociation. The cell pellet was resuspended for a three-step Ca2+ restoration procedure (i.e. 125, 250, and 500 μm Ca2+). The freshly isolated cardiomyocytes were then suspended in minimal essential medium (catalogue number M1018, pH 7.35–7.45; Sigma) containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were then plated onto 35-mm cell culture dishes that were precoated with 20 μg/ml mouse laminin in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 1 h. The cardiomyocytes were cultured in the presence of 5% CO2 for 1 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, which allowed cardiomyocytes to attach to the dish surface prior to the experimental protocol.Experiment Protocol—The cultured cardiomyocytes were incubated under 37 °C and 5% CO2, for 1 h with or without 1 or 10 μm sildenafil citrate, which was prepared by grinding Viagra tablets (Pfizer Inc.) into powder and dissolved in distilled water. The drug solution was filtered (0.45-μm pore size) before adding into cell medium. Cardiomyocytes were subjected to SI for 40 min by replacing the cell medium with an “ischemia buffer” that contained 118 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2-2H2O, 1.2 mm MgCl2,20mm sodium lactate, 16 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (pH adjusted to 6.2) similar to those previously published (27.Rakhit R.D. Edwards R.J. Mockridge J.W. Baydoun A.R. Wyatt A.W. Mann G.E. Marber M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1211-H1217PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the cells were incubated under hypoxic conditions at 37 °C during the entire SI period by adjusting the tri-gas incubator to 1–2% O2 and 5% CO2. RO was accomplished by replacing the ischemic buffer with normal medium under normoxic conditions. Assessment of cell necrosis and apoptosis was performed at two time points of RO, i.e. 1 and 18 h.Evaluation of Cell Viability—Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and LDH release in the medium. At the end of protocol, 20 μl of 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the culture dish. After ∼5 min of equilibration, the cells were counted under microscope. For LDH measurements, the cellular medium was collected, and the enzyme activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using an assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich).TUNEL Staining and Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining, using a kit purchased from BD Biosciences that detects nuclear DNA fragmentation via a fluorescence assay as previously reported (28.Das A. Chendil D. Dey S. Mohiuddin M. Mohiuddin M. Milbrandt J. Rangnekar V.M. Ahmed M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3279-3286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In brief, after SI and 18 h of RO, the cells in two chamber slides were fixed by 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 25 min and subjected to TUNEL assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. The slides were then counterstained with Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (a DNA intercalating dye for visualizing nuclei in fixed cells; catalogue number H-1200, Vector Laboratories). Additionally, cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected with a mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) detection kit provided by Biocarta. The cells were stained with a dye, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1), at 37 °C for 15 minina5%CO2 incubator and rinsed with assay buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol. The stained cells were examined under an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope.Activated Caspase 3 Detection—Active caspase was detected using the CaspaTag™ Caspase 3,7 in situ assay kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, the cell-permeable noncytotoxic fluorochrome inhibitors of caspases binds covalently to a reactive cysteine residue on the large subunit of the active caspase heterodimer, thereby inhibiting further enzymatic activity. This kit uses a carboxyfluorescein labeled fluoromethyl ketone peptide inhibitor of caspases-3 and -7 (SR-DEVD-FMK), which emits a red fluorescence. The red fluorescent signal is a direct measure of the amount of active caspase 3 in the cell at the time the reagent was added. The stained cells were immediately examined under a Nikon epifluorescent microscope using a band pass filter (excitation, 550 nm; emission, >580 nm) to view the red fluorescence of active caspase-positive cells. Hoechst stain was detected using a UV filter with excitation at 365 and emission at 480 nm.RT-PCR of iNOS, eNOS, and PDE5—The total RNA was isolated from untreated and sildenafil-treated cardiomyocytes using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) as described previously (14.Salloum F. Yin C. Xi L. Kukrej R.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription and PCR amplification were performed using a OneStep RT-PCR kit from Qiagen. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by integrated DNA technology, according to the published sequences for mouse iNOS (29.Wang Y. Guo Y. Zhang S.X. Wu W.-J. Wang J. Bao W. Bolli R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 5-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), eNOS (30.Fagan K.A. Morrissey B. Fouty B.W. Sato K. Harral J.W. Morris Jr., K.G. Hoedt-Miller M. Vidmar S.

The transcript levels of iNOS and eNOS were quantified by real time PCR performed in the ABI prism 7900HT sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the TaqMan One Step PCR Master Mix reagent kit (Product 4309169). All of the samples were processed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions. The cycling conditions were: 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The cycle threshold was determined to provide the optimal standard curve values (0.98–1.0). The probes and primers (Table I) were designed by the Nucleic Acid Research Facilities of Virginia Commonwealth University, using Primer Express 2.0. The probes were labeled in the 5′ end with 6-carboxyfluoresceine and in the 3′ end with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Eukaryotic 18 S rRNA TaqMan endogenous control (Product 4310893E; Applied Biosystems) was used to normalize the transcript levels. The following amounts of RNA was used for real time PCR: 20 ng for iNOS, 4 ng for eNOS, and 1 ng for 18 S rRNA.Table IPrimer/probe sequences used for determination of iNOS, eNOS, and PDE5A expressionPrimer/probe sequencesiNOSForward: CAGGAGGAGAGAGATCCGATTTAGReverse: TGACCCGTGAAGCCATGACTagMan Probe: TGGAAGCAAAGAACACCACTTTCACCAAGAeNOSForward: CACCAGGAAGAAGACCTTTAAGGAReverse: CACACGCTTCGCCATCACTaqMan Probe: TAGCCAATGCAGTGAAGGTCTCTGCCTCPDE5AForward: AATACCACCCCTGGAGCACCReverse: TTCAAGGGCTCGCCAAAAGC Open table in a new tab PDE5 was amplified by using the primers based on the mouse PDE5A cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_153422; also see Table I). The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% Tris-acetate-EDTA-agarose gel.Western blots for Bax, Bcl-2, iNOS, eNOS, and PDE5—Total soluble protein was extracted from the cells with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min under 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered. 25 μg of protein from each sample was separated by 12% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitro-cellulose membrane and then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 for each of the respective proteins, i.e. Bax, Bcl-2, iNOS, eNOS (Santa Cruz), or PDE5 (Calbiochem) for 2 h before being washed and incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent system. The optical density for each band was scanned and quantified using the identical densitometric system described above.Immunohistochemistry of PDE5—Localization of PDE5A protein in cardiomyocytes was performed according to the method of Senzaki et al. (23.Senzaki H. Smith C.J. Juang G.J. Isoda T. Mayer S.P. Ohler A. Paolocci N. Tomaselli G.F. Hare J.M. Kass D.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1718-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The cardiomyocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then treated with 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then preincubated with normal donkey antiserum for 30 min and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit PDE5A antibody (Calbiochem) at 1:10,000 dilution. Incubation with secondary antibody was performed at room temperature for 1 h with anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope.Data Analysis and Statistics—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. The difference between control and sildenafil-treated groups or among the multiple treatment groups was analyzed respectively with unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSEffect of Sildenafil on Cardiomyocyte Necrosis—Our method for cell preparations yielded at least 70% of the cardiomyocytes with rod shape morphology, which was similar to previously reported studies (24.Xiao R.-P.

Fig. 1A shows a typical preparation of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes used in the present studies. After 40 min of SI, the percentage of trypan blue positive cardiomyocytes increased with respect to control cardiomyocytes, i.e. from 3 ± 0.2% of total counted cells in the control group to 35 ± 1% in the SI group, p < 0.05. Pretreatment with sildenafil for 1 h resulted in the decrease in trypan blue positive cardiomyocytes, i.e. from 35 ± 1% of the total counted cells in the untreated SI group to 17 ± 0.5 and 18 ± 1% 1 and 10 μm sildenafil-treated groups, respectively (n = 3; p < 0.05; Fig. 1D). After 40 min of SI and 1 h or 18 h of RO, the trypan blue positive cardiomyocytes further increased to 40 ± 2 and 54 + 1%, respectively. Again, prior treatment with sildenafil reduced the trypan blue-positive cells as compared with the untreated SI-RO group (p < 0.001, n = 3; Fig. 1, B–D). Similar results were obtained by measurement of LDH release in the medium. As shown in Fig. 1E, LDH increased in the medium following SI and SI-RO (1 or 18 h), which is attenuated by prior treatment with sildenafil. Also, the attenuation in LDH release was independent of the dose of sildenafil used in these experiments.Effect of Sildenafil on Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis—Despite significant necrosis following 40 min of SI and 1 h of RO (Fig. 1, D and E), apoptosis was not detectable under these conditions (data not shown). However, apoptotic cell death became clearly evident following 40 min of SI and 18 h of RO, i.e. 24.7 ± 1.2% of TUNEL-positive cells (p < 0.001 versus nonischemic control, n = 4). The number of TUNEL-positive cells were reduced to 3.5 ± 0.6% in cardiomyocytes treated with 10 μm sildenafil (p < 0.001 versus SI-RO and p < 0.05 versus untreated nonischemic control cardiomyocytes, n = 4; Fig. 2, A–I). The intense red fluorescence of active caspase was clearly observed in myocytes following 40 min of SI and 18 h of RO (Fig. 3B). But the red fluorescence decreased significantly in myocytes treated with 1 or 10 μm sildenafil before 40 min of SI and 18 h of RO (Fig. 3, C and D).Fig. 2Effect of sildenafil on inhibition of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

It is apparent that a significant number of cardiomyocytes displayed red fluorescence staining after SI-RO (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W1967035072,"Infusion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), but not of mature endothelial cells, promotes neovascularization after ischemia. We performed gene expression profiling of EPC and endothelial cells to identify genes that might be important for the neovascularization capacity of EPC. Notably, the protease cathepsin L (CathL) was highly expressed in EPC as opposed to endothelial cells and was essential for matrix degradation and invasion by EPC in vitro. CathL-deficient mice showed impaired functional recovery following hind limb ischemia, supporting the concept of a crucial role for CathL in postnatal neovascularization. Infused CathL-deficient progenitor cells neither homed to sites of ischemia nor augmented neovascularization. Forced expression of CathL in mature endothelial cells considerably enhanced their invasive activity and sufficed to confer their capacity for neovascularization in vivo. We concluded that CathL has a critical role in the integration of circulating EPC into ischemic tissue and is required for EPC-mediated neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2113047034,"The nonclassical HLA class I antigen HLA-G is an inhibitory molecule involved in immune tolerance and immune escape. HLA-G exerts its inhibitory functions via interaction with inhibitory receptors ILT2, ILT4, and KIR2DL4, differentially expressed by NK, T, and antigen-presenting cells. Cells expressing HLA-G and cells expressing its receptors are often found in the vicinity of each other, but the mechanisms responsible for this colocalization are still unknown. We report that ILT2, ILT3, ILT4, and KIR2DL4 expression is up-regulated by HLA-G in antigen-presenting cells, NK cells, and T cells. Because this up-regulation seems not to require antigenic costimulation, it might precede an immune response. Functionally, up-regulation of inhibitory receptors in immune cells before stimulation might increase their activation thresholds and participate in immune escape mechanisms."

Taste is a primal sense that enables diverse organisms to identify and ingest sweet-tasting nutritious foods and to reject bitter-tasting environmental poisons (1Lindemann B. Nature. 2001; 413: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Taste perception can be categorized into five distinct qualities: salty, sour, bitter, umami (amino acid taste), and sweet (1Lindemann B. Nature. 2001; 413: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Salty and sour depend on the actions of ion channels.

All of these receptors are class-C GPCRs, with the large clam shell-shaped extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD) characteristic of this family. Following the ATD is a cysteine-rich region that connects the ATD to the heptahelical transmembrane domain (TMD); following the TMD is a short intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail. The solved crystal structure of the ATD of mGluR1 identifies a “Venus flytrap module” (VFTM) involved in ligand binding (11Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The canonical agonist glutamate binds within the VFTM in a cleft formed by the two lobes of this module to stabilize a closed active conformation of the mGluR1 ATD. In contrast, several positive and negative allosteric modulators of class-C GPCRs have been identified and shown to act via binding not within the VFTM but instead within the TMD (12Binet V.

Over the past few decades, multiple models of the sweet receptor's hypothetical ligand binding site have been generated based on the structures of existing sweeteners but without direct knowledge of the nature of the sweet receptor itself. A consensus feature of these models is the presence of A-H-B groups, in which the AH group is a hydrogen donor and the B group is an electronegative center. These models have explanatory and predictive value for some, but not all sweeteners, suggesting that not all sweet ligands bind in the same manner to the receptor. Based on homology to mGluR1, the canonical ligand binding site of the sweet receptor is likely to reside in the cleft between lobes 1 and 2 of the ATD of T1R2. However, additional binding sites may exist elsewhere in T1R2 or in the T1R3 component of the heterodimeric sweet taste receptor. The cysteine-rich region of human T1R3 (hT1R3), which has been shown to be critical for determining responses to intensely sweet proteins, brazzein and monellin (17Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45068-45075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), is one such potential binding site. Xu et al. (18Xu H. Staszewski L. Tang H. Adler E. Zoller M. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14258-14263Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and we (19Jiang P. Cui M. Ji Q. Snyder L. Lui Z. Benard L. Margolskee R. Osman R. Max M. Chem. Senses. 2005; 30: 117-118Google Scholar) have recently shown that mutations in VFTM of human T1R2 (hT1R2) affect the sweet receptor's responses to aspartame, whereas mutations in the TMD affect receptor responses to cyclamate. Lactisole, an arakyl carboxylic acid composed of a carboxyl group and a hydrophobic phenoxyl group, inhibits sweet and umami taste perception by humans but not by rats (20Sclafani A. Perez C. Physiol. Behav. 1997; 61: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here, we report that lactisole inhibits the hT1R2+hT1R3 human sweet taste receptor by binding to the TMD of hT1R3. The carboxyl group and aromatic ring of lactisole are necessary for the suppression of sweet taste. In addition, we have identified 7 critical residues within the TMD of T1R3 that form a potential binding pocket for lactisole and are responsible for the sweet receptor's sensitivity to lactisole. We present a model in which lactisole is docked to a potential binding site within the TMD of T1R3. Materials—Acesulfame-K, cyclamate, d-tryptophan, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC), saccharin, sucrose, thaumatin, and lactisole were obtained from Sigma. Sucralose was obtained from McNeil Specialty (New Brunswick, NJ). Brazzein was a gift from Dr. Göran Hellekant (see Supplemental Fig. 1 for structures of sweet ligands). Unless noted otherwise, acesulfame-K, cyclamate, and d-tryptophan were used at 10 mm final concentration, NHDC at 0.25 mm, saccharin at 1 mm, sucralose at 1 mm, sucrose at 100 mm, brazzein at 0.25%, thaumatin at 0.1%, and lactisole at 1.25 mm. Residue Numbering—The general numbering of residues in the TMD of T1R3 follows T1R3's primary sequence. Superscripted residue numbers follow the generic numbering system of Ballesteros and Weinstein (21Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Preparation of Chimeras and Point Mutations—Human and mouse T1R2 and T1R3 clones were as described (17Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45068-45075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The Gα16-gust44 construct was as described (22Ueda T. Ugawa S. Yamamura H. Imaizumi Y. Shimada S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7376-7380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, the Gα16-gust44 construct gave larger and/or more reliable responses than did Gα16-i3; therefore, Gα16-gust44 was used in all experiments. Human/mouse chimeras of T1R3 were constructed using an overlapping PCR strategy as described (17Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45068-45075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The integrity of all DNA constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Point mutations in T1R clones were made by the same overlapping PCR strategy or by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Combinations of hT1R2 with the following chimeras were not functional (data not shown): mT1R3.h.712–852, mT1R3.h.729–852, mT1R3.h.751–852, and mT1R3.h.797–852. Heterologous Expression—HEK293 EBNA (HEK293E) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected as described (17Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45068-45075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Cells for calcium imaging were seeded onto 6-well plates (Corning); cells in each well were co-transfected using Mirus TransIT-293 (Panvera, Madison, WI) with plasmid DNAs encoding T1Rs (0.6 μg of each) and Gα16-gust44 (0.5 μg). After 24 h, the transfected cells were trypsinized and seeded onto 96-well assay plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at about 40,000 cells/well in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1× GlutaMax-1 (Invitrogen). After an additional 24 h, the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), loaded with 75 μl of 3 μm Fluo-4 (Molecular Probe) in DPBS, incubated for 2 h, and then washed twice with DPBS and maintained at 37 °C in 50 μl of DPBS. The dye-loaded transfected cells in plates were placed into a FlexStation II system (Molecular Devices) to monitor fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 525 nm; cutoff, 515 nm) change after the addition of 50 μl of DPBS supplemented with 2× tastants. For each trace, tastant or tastant + lactisole was added 30 s after the start of the scan, scanning continued for an additional 150 s, and data were collected every 2 s. Data Analysis—After obtaining a calcium mobilization trace for each sample, calcium mobilization in response to tastants or tastant + lactisole was quantified as the percentage of change (peak fluorescence - baseline fluorescence level, denoted as ΔF) from its own baseline fluorescence level (denoted as F). Peak fluorescence intensity occurred about 20–30 s after the addition of tastants. As controls, buffer alone or compounds that do not taste sweet evoked no change of fluorescence (ΔF/F ≈ 0, S.E. is about 1%). The data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the ΔF/F value of three independent samples, similarly presented in Jiang et al. (17Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45068-45075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The analysis was done automatically by an in-house written SAS program. The bar graph and curving-fitting routines were carried out using Graph-Pad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Homology Modeling—The multiple sequence alignment among T1Rs, hT1R2, hT1R3, mT1R2, mT1R3, mGluR1, and bovine rhodopsin was generated by the ClustalW program (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) with some manual adjustments to the non-homologous regions (see Supplemental Fig. 2, multiple sequence alignment). The sequence identities (similarities) for TM helices 1–7 between hT1R3 and bovine rhodopsin are 22.6% (61.3%), 13.3% (40%), 22.6% (48.4), 25.0% (33.3%), 11.1% (40.7%), 11.8% (61.8%), and 16% (60%), respectively. Based on the sequence alignment, the hT1R3 TM homology model was constructed by residue replacement using the InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) biopolymer module. The non-conserved proline kink within TM helix 6 of the model was built by manually shifting 3 residues according to the template. Extracellular loop 3 between TM helix 6 and TM helix 7 was generated by ab initio loop prediction (24Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 25Fiser A. Sali A. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2500-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The other intracellular and extracellular loop regions were generated by the modeler program (26Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar, 27Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar) based on the bovine rhodopsin template. The side chains of the residues in the 7 TM region of hT1R3 and all the loops were refined by the following procedure: 500 steps of steepest descent followed by 2 ps of heating from 0 to 300 K, and 20 ps equilibration and 100 ps of production run at 300 K to relax possible bad contacts of the model followed by energy minimization 1000 steps of steepest descent and 10,000 steps of adopted basis Newton-Raphson or until the root mean square energy gradient of 0.05 kcal/mol/Å was achieved. During the simulation, the α-carbon atoms of the helixes were fixed to avoid possible distortion, and the distance-dependent dielectric constant (ϵ = 4Rij) was used to mimic solvation effects and the membrane environment. All model refinements were carried out by the CHARMM program (28Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13967) Google Scholar) using the CHARMM27 all-hydrogen force field. Molecular Docking—The geometry of lactisole (S(-)2-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-propanoic acid) was fully optimized by the ab initio quantum chemistry method at the HF/6–31G* level and followed by a single point calculation with the polarized continuum model solvation method to obtain the electrostatic potentials using the Gaussian98 package (29Frisch M.J.

Then, the CHELPG charge-fitting scheme (30Breneman C.M. Wiberg K.B. J. Comp. Chem. 1990; 11: 361-373Crossref Scopus (4027) Google Scholar) was used to calculate partial charges for lactisole. The missing force field parameters for lactisole were obtained from similar parameters taken from CHARMM27 or Quanta (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Lactisole was docked into the pocket of the TM region of hT1R3 using the automatic docking program autodock V3.0.5 (31Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9209) Google Scholar), which uses a powerful Lamarckian genetic algorithm for conformational sampling and docking. The docked conformations of lactisole were analyzed by the cluster analysis of the autodock. The final docked conformation was selected by comparing the available mutagenesis results followed by some manual adjustments of the positions of lactisole and the side chains of hT1R3 before employing model refinement by MD simulations. A similar MD protocol was used for the docked lactisole-hT1R3 complex structure refinement that except the α-carbon atoms of the helixes were restricted by 1.0 kcal/mol/Å2 harmonic restraint force instead of fixing the α-carbon atoms during the simulations. Inhibition of Sweet Taste by Lactisole Requires hT1R3—In human psychophysical studies, lactisole inhibits the sweet taste of sucrose, saccharin, and several other compounds (20Sclafani A. Perez C.

A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). We examined lactisole's effect on in vitro responses of hT1R2+hT1R3 to a group of chemically diverse sweeteners (Fig. 1A). Lactisole inhibited the [Ca2+]i responses of hT1R2+hT1R3-expressing HEK293E cells to sucrose (disaccharide), d-tryptophan (d-amino acid), cyclamate (sulfamate), saccharin, acesulfame-K (N-sulfonylamides), NHDC (a dihydrochalcone), sucralose (chlorinated disaccharide), and brazzein and thaumatin (proteins). Lactisole suppresses sweetness in humans but not in mice. To determine whether one or both components of the heterodimeric human sweet receptor is required for sensitivity to lactisole, we tested the responses of human, mouse and human + mouse mismatched heterodimers to d-tryptophan with and without lactisole (Fig. 1B). As expected, the fully human pair (hT1R2+hT1R3) was sensitive to lactisole, whereas the fully mouse pair (mT1R2+mT1R3) was not. One mismatched pair (hT1R2+mT1R3) behaved like the fully mouse heterodimer, showing no sensitivity to lactisole. As reported previously (17Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45068-45075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), the other mismatched pair (mT1R2+hT1R3) does not produce a functional receptor, precluding us from analyzing its sensitivity to lactisole. These results demonstrate that hT1R3 is required for lactisole sensitivity. Below, by using human/mouse chimeras of T1R3, we show that hT1R2 is not required for sensitivity to lactisole (Fig. 2). Lactisole Acts on the TMD of hT1R3—To identify the portion of hT1R3 required for the sweet receptor's sensitivity to lactisole, we examined the responses of heterodimeric receptors comprised of hT1R2 plus human/mouse chimeras in which we combined varying portions of hT1R3 with the complementary portion of mT1R3 (Fig. 2A). Heterodimers of hT1R2 plus T1R3 chimeras containing most or all of the extracellular region of hT1R3 coupled to the TMD and carboxyl-terminal tail of mT1R3 (i.e. h.1–547.mT1R3 and h.1–567.mT1R3) responded to d-tryptophan but were not inhibited by lactisole (Fig. 2B). In contrast, heterodimers of hT1R2 plus T1R3 chimeras containing most or all of the extracellular region of mT1R3 coupled to the TMD and carboxyl-terminal tail of hT1R3 (i.e. mT1R3.h.548–852 and mT1R3.h.568–852) responded to d-tryptophan and were inhibited by lactisole. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of lactisole on sweet receptor responses to d-tryptophan requires the TMD and/or carboxyl-terminal tail of hT1R3 but not the ATD of hT1R3. To determine whether hT1R2 is required for sensitivity to lactisole, we examined the responses to d-tryptophan and d-tryptophan + lactisole of the mT1R3.h.568–852 chimera paired with hT1R2 (Fig. 2B) or with mT1R2 (Fig. 2C). Unlike the non-functional pairing of mT1R2+hT1R3 (Fig. 1B), mT1R2 can function in combination with the mT1R3.h.568–852 chimera. Both mT1R2+mT1R3.h.568–852 and hT1R2+mT1R3.h.568–852 respond to d-tryptophan, and these responses are fully suppressed by the addition of lactisole. Thus, hT1R2 is not required for sensitivity to lactisole, indicating that the hT1R3 component of the heterodimeric receptor is necessary and sufficient for sensitivity to lactisole. To identify the portion(s) of the TMD and/or carboxyl-terminal tail of hT1R3 required for sensitivity to lactisole, we constructed several additional human/mouse chimeras of T1R3 containing the ATD of hT1R3 along with varying portions of the TMD of hT1R3 coupled to the complementary portion of mT1R3 (Fig. 3A) and then tested them in combination with hT1R2. All heterodimers of hT1R2 plus these T1R3 chimeras responded to d-tryptophan (Fig. 3B). The heterodimer of hT1R2 plus the T1R3 chimera containing the extracellular domain and entire TMD from hT1R3 (i.e. hT1R2+h.1–812.mT1R3) showed inhibition by lactisole comparable with that obtained with hT1R2+hT1R3. Heterodimers of hT1R2 with T1R3 chimeras containing the hT1R3 ATD and hT1R3 TM helices 1–6 (i.e. hT1R2+h.1–787.mT1R3) or TM helices 1–5 (i.e. hT1R2+h.1–751.mT1R3) showed moderate inhibition by lactisole. Heterodimers of hT1R2 with T1R3 chimeras containing the hT1R3 ATD and hT1R3 TM helices 1–2 (i.e. hT1R2+h.1–638.mT1R3), TM helices 1–3 (i.e. hT1R2+h.1–669.mT1R3), or TM helices 1–4 (i.e. hT1R2+h.1–711.mT1R3 or hT1R2+h.1–729.mT1R3) showed no inhibition by lactisole. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of lactisole on sweet receptor responses to d-tryptophan requires human-specific residues within or adjacent to human TM helices 5, 6, and 7. The difference in lactisole sensitivity displayed by chimeras h.1–787.mT1R3 and h.1–812.mT1R3 indicates that residues within or adjacent to human TM helix 7 in particular are required for sensitivity to lactisole. Thus, there are multiple human-specific residues required for lactisole sensitivity within the region containing TM helices 5–7. T1R3 chimeras in which we replaced TM helices 5 and 6 or TM helix 5 alone of hT1R3 with the corresponding TM helices of mT1R3 (i.e. hT1R3(m734–792) and hT1R3(m734–756), respectively) functioned in combination with hT1R2 to respond to d-tryptophan but displayed no sensitivity to lactisole (Fig. 3C). Conversely, T1R3 chimeras in which we replaced TM helices 5 and 6 or TM5 alone of mT1R3 with the corresponding TM helices of hT1R3 (i.e. mT1R3(h729–787) and mT1R3(h729–751), respectively) functioned in combination with hT1R2 to respond to d-tryptophan and were sensitive to lactisole (Fig. 3C). Thus, at least some residues required for the human-specific sensitivity to lactisole lie within or adjacent to TM helix 5 of hT1R3. Alanine 7335.46 in hT1R3 TM Helix 5 Is Required for Sensitivity to Lactisole—In the TM helix 5 region of hT1R3 (amino acids 729–751), only 4 residues (Phe-7305.43, Ala-7335.46, Ala-7355.48, and Thr-7395.52) differ between the human and mouse forms of T1R3. To identify which residue(s) within this region are required for sensitivity to lactisole, we individually substituted each of these 4 residues with the corresponding mouse T1R3 residues (hT1R3(F7305.43L), hT1R3(A7335.46V), hT1R3(A7355.48I), and hT1R3(T7395.52M)). We then examined the responses of heterodimers of hT1R2 with these substituted forms of hT1R3. All mutants responded to d-tryptophan; however, only the A7335.46V mutant showed diminished sensitivity to lactisole (Fig. 4A). In comparison with wild type hT1R3, the A7335.46V mutant showed a right shift in its dose-response curve to lactisole (A7335.46V mutant IC50 of 1.9 × 10-3mversus wild type IC50 of 4.1 × 10-5m) (Fig. 4D) but was unchanged in its dose-response curve to d-tryptophan (A7335.46V mutant EC50 of 3.5 mmversus wild type EC50 of 4.3 mm) (Fig. 4C). Thus, valine substitution at position 7335.46 selectively affects the receptor's sensitivity to lactisole. As noted above, the results with chimeras h.1–787.mT1R3 and h.1–812.mT1R3 (Fig. 3B) indicate that residues within or adjacent to human TM helix 7 are required for maximal sensitivity to lactisole. In the extracellular loop 3 and TM helix 7 region of hT1R3 (amino acids 787–812), 8 residues (Val-788ex3, Leu-789ex3, Arg-790ex3, Leu-7987.36, Leu-8007.38, Val-8027.40, Ala-8077.45, and Ala-8087.46) differ between the human and mouse forms of T1R3. To identify which residue(s) within this region are required for sensitivity to lactisole, we individually substituted each of these 8 residues with the corresponding mouse T1R3 residues (hT1R3(V788ex3A), hT1R3(L789ex3Y), hT1R3(R790ex3Q), hT1R3(L7987.36I), hT1R3(L8007.38V), hT1R3(V8027.40A), hT1R3(A8077.45V), and hT1R3(A8087.46T)) and then examined the responses of these substituted forms of hT1R3 heterodimerized with hT1R2. All of these mutants responded to d-tryptophan; only the R790ex3Q and L7987.36I mutants showed diminished sensitivity to lactisole (Fig. 4B). Both of these mutants were unchanged in their dose-response curves to d-tryptophan (Fig. 4C) and right-shifted in their dose-response curves to lactisole (Fig. 4C). The effect on lactisole sensitivity of mutating either of these residues was much less pronounced than that seen with A7335.46V (R790ex3Q mutant IC50 of 1.7 × 10-4 m, L7987.36I mutant IC50 of 2.2 × 10-4 m). Thus, substitutions at positions 733 (TM helix 5), in particular, 790 (third extracellular domain) and 798 (TM helix 7), all affect the receptor's sensitivity to lactisole. Ala-7335.46 Substitutions Affect hT1R3 Responses to Lactisole—To investigate the physicochemical effects of residue Ala-7335.46 within TM helix 5 of hT1R3 on receptor activity toward lactisole, we made various substitutions at this position (Fig. 4D). Substitution of Ala-7335.46 by glutamate or phenylalanine abolished the receptor's sensitivity to lactisole. Substitution of Ala-7335.46 by glycine or serine did not affect the receptor's sensitivity toward lactisole. The threonine substitution (A7335.46 T) led to slightly reduced receptor sensitivity to lactisole. Furthermore, we substituted mT1R3 Val-7385.46, Gln-795EX3, and Ile-8037.36 with human corresponding residues Ala, Arg, and Leu either individually or in combination to test whether this would make the mutants mT1R3 sensitive to lactisole. Indeed, mT1R3(V7385.46A) showed sensitivity to lactisole (Supplemental Fig. 3). hT1R3 Sensitivity to Lactisole Also Involves Residues in TM Helices 3 and 6 —The solved structure of rhodopsin has been used as a template, after sequence alignment, to model the structures of the TMDs of certain family C receptors (mGluR1, mGluR5, and CaSR (13Malherbe P.

Shared patterns of expression, conservation of DNA binding, and transcriptional activation domains indicate that they may serve complementary functions in the regulation of gene expression during lung morphogenesis. Whereas branching morphogenesis of the fetal lung occurs normally in the Foxa2Delta/Delta and Foxa1-/- mice, deletion of both Foxa1 and Foxa2 (in Foxa2Delta/Delta, Foxa1-/- mice) inhibited cell proliferation, epithelial cell differentiation, and branching. Dilation of terminal lung tubules and decreased branching were observed as early as embryonic day 12.5. Foxa1 and Foxa2 regulated Shh (sonic hedgehog) and Shh-dependent genes in the respiratory epithelial cells that influenced the expression of genes in the pulmonary mesenchyme that are required for branching morphogenesis. Epithelial cell differentiation, as indicated by lack of expression of surfactant protein B, surfactant protein C, the Clara cell secretory protein, and Foxj1, was inhibited. Foxa family members regulate signaling and transcriptional programs required for morphogenesis and cell differentiation during formation of the lung."

https://openalex.org/W2146340209,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key regulator of blood pressure. It is known to cleave small peptides, such as angiotensin I and bradykinin and changes their biological activities, leading to upregulation of blood pressure. Here we describe a new activity for ACE: a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein releasing activity (GPIase activity). Unlike its peptidase activity, GPIase activity is weakly inhibited by the tightly binding ACE inhibitor and not inactivated by substitutions of core amino acid residues for the peptidase activity, suggesting that the active site elements for GPIase differ from those for peptidase activity. ACE shed various GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, and the process was accelerated by the lipid raft disruptor filipin. The released products carried portions of the GPI anchor, indicating cleavage within the GPI moiety. Further analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry predicted the cleavage site at the mannose-mannose linkage. GPI-anchored proteins such as TESP5 and PH-20 were released from the sperm membrane of wild-type mice but not in Ace knockout sperm in vivo. Moreover, peptidase-inactivated E414D mutant ACE and also PI-PLC rescued the egg-binding deficiency of Ace knockout sperms, implying that ACE plays a crucial role in fertilization through this activity."
https://openalex.org/W2085468399,"A variety of lipid-binding proteins contain a recently described motif, designated FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract), which binds to vesicle-associated-membrane protein-associated protein (VAP). VAP is a conserved integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that contains at its amino terminus a domain related to the major sperm protein of nematode worms. Here we have studied the FFAT-VAP interaction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the VAP homologue Scs2 regulates phospholipid metabolism via an interaction with the FFAT motif of Opi1. By introducing mutations at random into Scs2, we found that mutations that abrogated binding to FFAT were clustered in the most highly conserved region. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified several critical residues, including two lysines widely separated in the primary sequence. By examining all other conserved basic residues, we identified a third residue that was moderately important for binding FFAT. Modeling VAP on the known structure of major sperm protein showed that the critical residues form a patch on a positively charged face of the protein. In vivo functional studies of SCS22, a second SCS2-like gene in S. cerevisiae, showed that SCS2 was the dominant gene in the regulation of Opi1, with a minor contribution from SCS22. We then established that reduction in the affinity of Scs2 mutants for FFAT correlated well with loss of function, indicating the importance of these residues for binding FFAT motifs. Finally, we found that human VAP-A could substitute for Scs2 but that it functioned poorly, suggesting that other factors modulate the binding of Scs2 to proteins with FFAT motifs.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FFAT, two phenylalanines (FF) in an acidic tract; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MSP, major sperm protein; OSBP, oxysterol-binding protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; VAP, VAMP-associated protein. is the major site of lipid metabolism in cells, containing many biosynthetic enzymes as well as lipid sensors that enact homeostatic mechanisms. Cytoplasmic proteins with roles in lipid metabolism must access the ER to perform their specific functions. One mechanism by which a large and diverse group of lipid-binding proteins access the ER is via of a short motif called FFAT (two phenylalanines (FF) in an acidic tract) that binds directly to the integral ER protein VAP (vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein) (1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Sixteen eukaryotic proteins contain perfect FFAT motifs (EFFDAXE with surrounding acidic residues), and divergent FFAT-like motifs have been identified in at least 13 homologues of these proteins. Of the nine human proteins with FFAT motifs, eight are from three different families of lipid transfer proteins, i.e. they contain domains that stabilize hydrophobic lipids in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm and thus can carry lipid traffic across the cytoplasm (2.Wirtz K.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 73-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Most of these have now been shown to bind VAP (3.Wyles J.P. Ridgway N.D. Exp.

Therefore, a large number of lipid traffic steps into/out of the ER are potentially mediated by FFAT-VAP interactions. VAPs are highly conserved proteins, homologues of which are found in all eukaryotic cells (5.Skehel P.A. Martin K.C. Kandel E.R. Bartsch D.

Multiple genes have arisen in many species: in human there are three, VAP-A and -B coded on two separate genes, with the latter having a splice variant, VAP-C; in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are two VAP homologues. The first proposed function for VAP arose from its initial identification as an interactor with the membrane fusion protein synaptobrevin/VAMP in Aplysia (5.Skehel P.A. Martin K.C. Kandel E.R. Bartsch D. Science. 1995; 269: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A role in membrane traffic was further hinted at by other studies in which VAP was found to bind a variety of other membrane fusion proteins (7.Weir M.L. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12.Weir M.L. Xie H. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Like many of the fusion proteins, VAP is a type II tail-anchored protein with a globular amino-terminal domain followed by a stalk region containing a coiled-coil (Fig. 1). Other functions proposed for VAP include its acting as a linker between membranes and microtubules. In Drosophila neurons, VAP is enriched in neuromuscular junctions, which require VAP for normal architecture and normal microtubule organization (11.Pennetta G. Hiesinger P. Fabian-Fine R. Meinertzhagen I. Bellen H. Neuron. 2002; 35: 291-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, a link has been uncovered between VAP and function of mammalian neurons, where VAP is enriched on microtubules (10.Skehel P.A. Fabian-Fine R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), because a mutation in human VAP-B causes familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) type 8 (13.Nishimura A.L. Mitne-Neto M. Silva H.C. Richieri-Costa A. Middleton S. Cascio D. Kok F. Oliveira J.R. Gillingwater T. Webb J. Skehel P. Zatz M. Am. J. Hum.

In contrast, in yeast one of the VAP homologues was originally identified as a multicopy suppressor of a mutation inducing choline sensitivity (hence named SCS2) (6.Nikawa J. Murakami A. Esumi E. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Scs2 was shown to suppress two different mutations causing inositol auxotrophy (6.Nikawa J. Murakami A. Esumi E. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14.Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional function of Scs2 is the maintenance of telomeric silencing (15.Craven R.J. Petes T.D. Genetics. 2001; 158: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Cuperus G. Shore D. Genetics. 2002; 162: 633-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, these disparate results have not suggested a unified vision of a function for VAPs. However, there are two hallmarks of VAPs. First, they localize to the ER (10.Skehel P.A. Fabian-Fine R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14.Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J.

This plays an important part in the regulation of inositol auxotrophy in yeast, the mechanism of which has now been described at the molecular level (Fig. 2A) (18.Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Second, the amino-terminal domain is homologous to the filament-forming major sperm protein 1 (MSP1) of nematode worms, with one particularly conserved 16-amino acid segment (the VAP consensus sequence; Ref. 14.Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). MSPs are only found in nematodes, whereas VAP is ubiquitous (10.Skehel P.A.

Here, we generated Scs2 mutants in which the interaction with FFAT was specifically inactivated, allowing us to identify conserved residues that form the binding site on VAPs for FFAT motifs.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Other strains carrying gene deletions were: Δscs2 (BY4741 YER120W::kanMX4), obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany); and Δscs22-TLY521 (RS453B YBL091C-A::S. pombe HIS5), made by the PCR method with a heterologously selectable marker, as described previously (20.Levine T.P. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Double mutant Δscs2Δscs22 strains were made by mating Δscs2 and Δscs22 strains, sporulating this diploid, and selecting HIS+ KAN+ haploids, one of which was used for this study (TLY522). Plasmids—Plasmids for bacterial expression were either based on pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions (1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) or pTrcHis-A (Invitrogen) for green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to FFAT Opi1 (ENLDDEEFFDASE) scrambled FFAT (FEELDDEDNFASE), and residues 331-415 of rabbit oxysterol-binding protein (FFAT OSBP) (1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). All yeast plasmids were based on the pRS series (21.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and included the constitutive portion of the PHO5 promoter. Scs2 plasmids used for inositol auxotrophy assays were based on pRS416 (CEN URA3) and included a Myc tag (MEQKLISEEDL) before the Scs2 open reading frame (“empty” refers to this plasmid with Myc only). Opi1 plasmids for inositol auxotrophy assays were pRS416 vectors expressing GFP followed by nothing, or Opi1, or Opi1 D203A. Plasmids for the mutagenic screen were: a plasmid based on pRS414 (CEN TRP1) that contained the coding region of Scs2 immediately following a tandem dimer of dimeric dsRed (RFP) (22.Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar); and a GFP-FFAT motif reporter based on the integrating plasmid pRS406 (URA3) that expressed GFP-Myc and residues 314-400 of human NIR2 (from IMAGE clone 5926119). Plasmids for localization in yeast were similarly based on pRS406, with GFP-Myc followed by the coding regions of Scs2 (1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) or human VAP-A (242 residues from IMAGE clone 4706502). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the QuikChange method (Stratagene). All constructs were checked by sequencing. In Vitro FFAT Binding Assay—GFP-FFAT Opi1/scrambled FFAT/FFAT OSBP and GST-Scs2/VAP-A fusion proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria as described (1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Binding was carried out with GST-Scs2/VAP-A bound to glutathione beads in a 100-μl reaction for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. GST-Scs2/VAP beads and bound GFP-tagged fusion proteins were removed by centrifugation, and unbound GFP was detected by fluorimetry of the supernatant using an LS50 spectrophotometer (excitation 485 nm, emission 515 nm, slit widths 10 nm). Approximate dissociation constants (KD) were estimated by curve fitting and Lineweaver-Burke analysis. Microscopy-based Mutagenic Screen—Cells with the SCS2 promoter replaced with that of GAL1/10 (TLY251) were transformed with an integrating plasmid that uniformly expressed GFP-FFAT (see above) and checked for localization of this construct to the ER on induction of Scs2 expression (growth in galactose). These cells were then transformed with a mixture of (a) the RFP-Myc-Scs2 plasmid digested to remove residues 1-130 of Scs2 and (b) a 596-base pair DNA molecule spanning this region synthesized by 60 cycles of amplification with Mutazyme (Stratagene), with a mutation frequency of ∼2/100 base pairs and overlapping the plasmid (67 nucleotides across the Myc tag and140 nucleotides across residues 130-176). Cell transformation indicated that the PCR product had been used to repair the digested plasmid, as no colonies grew when it was omitted. Cells were picked directly from small colonies grown in glucose, to repress endogenous Scs2, and scored for localization of red and green fluorescence. For sequencing gap-repaired Scs2, the plasmid coding region was amplified by PCR. Live Cell Imaging—Yeast cells growing in log phase at 30 °C were visualized as described previously (1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Inositol Auxotrophy Growth Assays—Cells growing in synthetic defined medium lacking inositol (Bio101), or the same medium supplemented with 100 μm inositol for 48 h at 37 °C unless otherwise stated, were assayed as described (14.Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A minimum of three colonies was used for each sample, and expression levels were checked by Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibodies (data not shown). Serial dilutions of cells were calculated to achieve patches of 5-15 cells at the highest dilution. The Scs2 Homologue Scs22 Plays a Minor Role in Regulation of Phospholipid Metabolism—Prior to testing mutant Scs2 alleles in vivo, we investigated whether these assays would be affected by the second VAP homologue in S. cerevisiae at locus YBL091C-A. Because of an amino-terminal intron (23.Spingola M. Grate L. Haussler D. Ares Jr., M. RNA. 1999; 5: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24.Blandin G. Durrens P. Tekaia F. Aigle M.

Toffano-Nioche C. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Marck C. Dujon B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), automated curation of the yeast genome omitted the VAP consensus sequence and wrongly predicted an open reading frame of just the carboxyl-terminal 99 residues (Fig. 1, arrow). This gene, a second form of SCS2, hence named SCS22, was first identified in 1995 (6.Nikawa J. Murakami A. Esumi E. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and subsequently its deletion was found not to induce one phenotype of Δscs2 (15.Craven R.J. Petes T.D. Genetics. 2001; 158: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its obscurity, SCS22 is likely to be more primitive than SCS2, because related budding yeast (Ashbya gossypii and Kluyveromyces waltii) contain single VAP homologues with introns similar to SCS22 (25.Kellis M. Birren B.W. Lander E.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 26.Dietrich F.S. Voegeli S. Brachat S. Lerch A. Gates K. Steiner S. Mohr C. Pohlmann R. Luedi P. Choi S. Wing R.A. Flavier A. Gaffney T.D. Philippsen P. Science. 2004; 304: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To analyze the function of Scs22, we examined a Δscs22 strain for inositol auxotrophy at an elevated temperature, this being a phenotype of Δscs2, where lack of Scs2 activates the transcription factor Opil (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, and as shown previously (18.Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), Opi1 was activated by a point mutation in its FFAT motif that inhibited binding to Scs2 (Fig. 2B). In contrast to Δscs2, Δscs22 cells showed no inositol auxotrophy (Fig. 2C). However, Δscs2Δscs22 double mutant cells displayed a more severe phenotype than Δscs2 alone (Fig. 2C). This indicates that Scs22 functions in parallel to Scs2 (although the latter dominates the former) and that Δscs2Δscs22 cells provide the most sensitive background to test the function of Scs2 variants. The Binding Site for FFAT Motifs Is in the MSP-VAP Domain—We have previously shown that both Scs2 and human VAP-A bind FFAT motifs (1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), implying that elements conserved between these proteins are responsible for the binding. By far the largest conserved element is the MSP-VAP domain (elsewhere called the MSP domain, for example in Ref. 27.Pall G.S. Wallis J. Axton R. Brownstein D.G. Gautier P. Buerger K. Mulford C. Mullins J.J. Forrester L.M. Genomics. 2004; 84: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is therefore a good candidate to contain the binding site. To test this proposition formally, fusion proteins of GST and the MSP-VAP domain alone, terminating at two different carboxyl-terminal prolines (P142 or P154; see Fig. 1), were expressed. Both bound specifically to a FFAT motif coupled to GFP (GFP-FFAT) but not to the same peptide in scrambled order (GFP-SCRAM) (Fig. 3, and data not shown). The affinity of binding by GST-VAP 1-142 was similar to that of full-length VAP just missing the transmembrane domain (13 and 11 μm, respectively). These results indicate that the MSP-VAP domain is solely responsible for binding FFAT motifs, in agreement with a recent study (3.Wyles J.P. Ridgway N.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A Mutagenic Screen Identifies Residues Critical for MSP-VAP Domain-FFAT Motif Interaction—The VAP consensus sequence has been implicated in binding to FFAT motifs (14.Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Wyles J.P. McMaster C.R. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29908-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), but in these studies half or all of this sequence was deleted, so it is not clear whether it binds FFAT motifs or it is critical for the overall fold of the domain. To identify residues that bind the FFAT motif, we devised a microscopy-based screen based on the ability of RFP-Scs2 to target soluble GFP-FFAT to the ER (Fig. 4A). Yeast cells with repressible endogenous Scs2 were transformed with a plasmid encoding uniform levels of GFP-FFAT reporter, which did not localize when Scs2 levels were low (data not shown and Ref. 1.Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These cells were then transformed with a centromeric plasmid expressing variable levels of RFP-Scs2 within a single colony, the MSP-VAP domain of which had been produced by error-prone PCR. Colonies with red fluorescence at the ER, indicating that the PCR product had no frameshift or nonsense mutations, were examined for the distribution of green fluorescence: GFP-FFAT on the ER was scored as “binding”; diffuse GFP-FFAT was scored as “nonbinding.” From 192 colonies with ER-localized RFP-Scs2, 13 nonbinders detected. These plasmid-borne copies of Scs2 were sequenced, as well as 30 from binding controls. In the 13 non-binding clones, there were 46 mutations in 30 different residues (Table I). When plotted in histogram format, the mutations clearly clustered around the first half of the VAP consensus sequence, indicating that this portion of the protein is the most critical (Fig. 4B). Thus, scanning the whole MSP-VAP domain in an unbiased manner strongly implicated the first half of the VAP consensus sequence as a major component of the FFAT binding site.Table IMutations in 13 nonbinding and 30 binding Scs2 sequences Mutations found in 43 Scs2 variants were scored for binding to a FFAT motif consisting of 13 nonbinding and 30 binding sequences. Underlining indicates that the same residue is mutated in both the nonbinding and binding clones: double underlining, precisely the same mutation was found in both sections; single underlining, differing mutations in each section. Mutations occurring carboxyl-terminally to the MSP-VAP domain are shown in parentheses.

Eight mutations were reproduced exactly in a nonbinding clone and a binding clone (Table I, double underlines). Since these mutations appear not to compromise FFAT binding, only the remaining 22 residues were candidates for the binding site for FFAT motifs (Table I). We therefore examined their position in an alignment of multiple VAP sequences across eukaryotic evolution (Fig. 5), which showed that only four of the 22 candidates residues (Lys-40, Thr-41, Thr-42, Lys-120) are highly conserved in all VAPs, with mutations in these four residues alone accounting for 10 of the 13 nonbinders (Table I). This indicates that Lys-40, Thr-41, Thr-42, and Lys-120 may be critical for the interaction with FFAT motifs. The error-prone PCR screen generated clones with multiple mutations, so we next decided to test the effect of introducing point mutations at the critical residues identified in the VAP consensus sequence. For Lys-40, a neutral substitution (K40A) had no discernible effect (Fig. 4C). In contrast, a less conservative mutation such as that identified in the screen (K40N) severely diminished targeting of GFP-FFAT to the ER (Fig. 4C). Therefore, Lys-40 is important but not essential for binding. Mutation of both Thr-41 and Thr-42 to alanines (T41A/T42A) completely abolished the ability of Scs2 to localize GFP-FFAT (Fig. 4C), implying that one or both of these threonines are critical for the FFAT-VAP interaction as well (see Fig. 6). The Residues in Scs2 Required for FFAT Binding in Vitro Are Also Required for the Regulation of Opi1 in Vivo—In addition to Lys-40, Thr-41, and Thr-42, the only other highly conserved residue identified by the screen was Lys-120. The finding that two lysines are important for binding FFAT motifs, which are highly acidic, led us to look at all eight highly conserved bases in the MSP-VAP domain of Scs2 (Lys-38, Lys-45, Arg-50, Arg-82, Lys-84, and Lys-122, as well as Lys-40 and Lys-120) (Fig. 5, asterisks). Interestingly, all of these are predicted to lie on the same face of the protein, except for Arg-50, which is in an adjacent strand (28.Bullock T.L. Roberts T.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nonconservative mutations in three of these (K38N, K45N, and R50I) occurred in FFAT-binding mutants of Scs2 (Table I), so these are unlikely to play a critical role in the binding site. To test the role of the other five, we mutated them singly to asparagine (Fig. 6). K40N had the strongest effect on in vitro binding, followed by K120N and then K84N, whereas R82N and K122N had only a slight effect (Fig. 6). To determine the functional significance in vivo of these basic residues, we examined the ability of the Scs2 mutants to rescue the inositol auxotrophy of Δscs2Δscs22 cells (Fig. 6). Cells expressing the K40N mutant (low affinity for FFAT) failed to grow in the absence of inositol. The K120N mutant (intermediate affinity) produced a minor growth defect. K84N (small reduction in affinity) had a marginal growth defect. By comparison, both R82N and K122N (hardly altered affinity) grew as wild type. Extending this analysis to Thr-41 and Thr-42, we found that Thr-42 was critical for FFAT binding, with T42A producing similar loss of binding and inositol auxotrophy as K40N, whereas T41A produced a barely noticeable effect, less than K84N (Fig. 6). Overall, these results indicate that inositol auxotrophy resulting from scs2 mutations is caused by a specific disruption of a binding site that includes the conserved residues Lys-40, Thr-42, and Lys-120, with a marginal contribution from Lys-84. Human VAP-A Has Different Properties than Scs2 in Yeast and Only Partially Rescues the Inositol Auxotrophic Phenotype—We next examined whether regulation of proteins containing FFAT motifs was entirely a product of the FFAT-VAP interaction or whether additional layers of regulation are important. To accomplish this, we determined whether human VAP-A could carry out the function of yeast VAPs, because although the FFAT-VAP interaction is well conserved, other interactions are less likely to be conserved. We transformed Δscs2Δscs22 yeast with plasmids expressing human VAP-A. Human VAP-A rescued the inositol auxotrophy to some extent, this being best detected under less stringent conditions than those used to test Scs2 (at 35 °C rather than 37 °C). Rescue was not seen with human VAP-A (T46A/T47A) (Fig. 7A), which is presumably defective in FFAT binding. However, direct comparison of human VAP-A with Scs2 showed that the human protein was only partially active (Fig. 7B), even though it has essentially th"

Exposure of cells to prion-infected material and subsequent endocytosis can sometimes result in the establishment of an infected culture. However, the relevant cell surface receptors have remained unknown. We have previously shown that cellular heparan sulfates (HS) are involved in the ongoing formation of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) in chronically infected cells. Here we studied the initial steps in the internalization of prions and in the infection of cells. Purified prion “rods” are arguably the purest prion preparation available. The only proteinaceous component of rods is PrPSc. Mouse neuroblastoma N2a, hypothalamus GT1–1, and Chinese hamster ovary cells efficiently bound both hamster and mouse prion rods (at 4 °C) and internalized them (at 37 °C). Treating cells with bacterial heparinase III or chlorate (a general inhibitor of sulfation) strongly reduced both binding and uptake of rods, whereas chondroitinase ABC was inactive. These results suggested that the cell surface receptor of prion rods involves sulfated HS chains. Sulfated glycans inhibited both binding and uptake of rods, probably by competing with the binding of rods to cellular HS. Treatments that prevented endocytosis of rods also prevented the de novo infection of GT1–1 cells when applied during their initial exposure to prions. These results indicate that HS are an essential part of the cellular receptor used both for prion uptake and for cell infection. Cellular HS thus play a dual role in prion propagation, both as a cofactor for PrPSc synthesis and as a receptor for productive prion uptake.

Infection is usually started by exposing cells to prion-infected material, such as brain homogenate. Many cell types (including cell lines (18Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and primary dendritic cells (19Luhr K.M. Wallin R.P. Ljunggren H.G. Low P. Taraboulos A. Kristensson K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12259-12264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) can internalize prion-infected material, but the cellular receptors for prions have not been identified. One factor that is likely to complicate the study of how prions enter cells is their notorious association with heterogeneous cellular membranes and aggregates (which contain, in addition, other cellular components). Thus, prions in crude tissue homogenates are likely to “hitch-hike” their way into the cell using aggregates and microsomes as vehicles via a variety of cell surface receptors. However, prions can be extracted from membranes to yield purer preparations. Prion “rods” are arguably the purest form of prions known (20Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C.

Dis. 1986; 154: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These infectious, unbranched amyloidic structures are prepared from prion-infected tissues by the combined action of detergents and proteases (22McKinley M.P. Meyer R.K. Kenaga L. Rahbar F. Cotter R. Serban A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (often supplemented by nucleases), and their only proteinaceous component is PrP27–30 (23Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5898-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the protease-resistant core of PrPSc. The size of rods is very heterogeneous, and they may contain up to several thousands PrP molecules (20Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G. Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Although purified prion rods are efficiently taken up by a variety of cells and often lead to productive infections (18Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), even in this highly simplified situation the relevant cellular receptors have not yet been identified. Here we set out to characterize receptors for rods in two infectible mouse cell lines, the neuroblastoma N2a (24Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the hypothalamic cell line GT1–1 (25Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L.

Virol. 1997; 71: 8821-8831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which seem to be refractive to prion infection. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate (HS) are long, unbranched side chains of proteoglycans that are found in several cellular compartments, including the cell surface and endosomes (reviewed in Ref. 28Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Three arguments put forward GAGs as candidates for cellular receptors for prion rods. First, PrP has several heparin-binding sites both in the N-terminal unstructured region and in the PrP27–30 core (13Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Warner R.G. Hundt C. Weiss S. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18421-18430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Caughey B. Brown K. Raymond G.J. Katzenstein G.E. Thresher W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2135-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, cellular HS are required for PrPSc formation in persistently infected mouse neuroblastoma ScN2a cells (15Ben-Zaken O. Tzaban S. Tal Y. Horonchik L. Esko J.D. Vlodavsky I. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because these HS prion cofactors probably perform their task by binding the endogenous PrP isoforms, it is plausible that they can also bind PrP27–30 molecules found in exogenous rods. Another indication that GAGs may serve as prion receptors is the finding that certain soluble dextran-based heparan mimetics (HMs) (31Ledoux D. Papy-Garcia D. Escartin Q. Sagot M.A. Cao Y. Barritault D. Courtois J. Hornebeck W. Caruelle J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29383-29390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reduce the internalization of prion rods in both N2a and CHO cells (32Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Gabizon R. Papy-Garcia D. Barritault D. Taraboulos A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conceivably, this inhibition could result from the competition of soluble HM molecules with putative HS receptors of rods. To evaluate the role of cellular HS in the binding and endocytosis of prion rods, we used GAG-degrading enzymes, the sulfation inhibitor chlorate, and soluble glycans, including several HM species. Our results indicate that heparinase III-sensitive HS on the cell surface are involved in both the binding and the uptake of rods in N2a, CHO, and GT1–1 cells. Treatments that prevented the binding and internalization of rods also prevented the de novo infection of GT1–1 cells. Cellular HS are thus an essential component of cellular receptors for the uptake of prions and the infection of cells. Materials—Cell culture reagents were purchased from Biological Industries (Beit Haemek, Israel). OptiMem was from Invitrogen. Dextran sulfate 500 (150821) was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Heparinase I (heparinase EC 4.2.2.7) and heparinase III (heparitinase I, EC 4.2.2.8) were from IBEX Technologies (Montreal, Canada). Chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) was from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). The dextran-based HMs (32Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Gabizon R. Papy-Garcia D. Barritault D. Taraboulos A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were obtained from OTR3 Sarl (Creteil, France). Micrococcal nuclease (N-5386) was from Sigma. Recombinant mouse PrP23–231 and recombinant R1 and D13 PrP antibodies were from InPro (South San Francisco, CA). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Porcine mucosa HS was kindly provided by Dr. K. M. Shwann (Kabi-Pharmacia, Stockholm, Sweden). Preparation of Prion Rods—Prion rods were purified from the brains of Syrian hamsters and of C57/bl mice infected with experimental Sc237 and RML scrapie, respectively, using a procedure modified from Prusiner et al. (33Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Bolton D.C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E. Cell. 1984; 38: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and Diringer et al. (34Diringer H. Hilmert H. Simon D. Werner E. Ehlers B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. One hamster brain or three mouse brains (a total of ∼1 g) were homogenized in 20 ml of 10% sucrose in PBS (buffer A). A 3220 × g, 10-min pellet was rehomogenized in 10 ml of buffer A and then repelleted, and the supernatants were united and cleared by a 3220 × g, 30-min spin. The supernatant was made 1 mm with each EDTA and dithiothreitol, and Triton X-100 and Na-deoxycholate were added to 4 and 2% final concentrations, respectively. The supernatant was then stirred for 30 min, and the following reagents were added dropwise while stirring: Tris acetate (pH 8.3) to 30 mm, KCl to 100 mm, glycerol to 20%, and polyethylene glycol 10000 to 8% w/v. After an additional 30 min of stirring, the homogenate was pelleted at 4500 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 0.02% TX-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2 and then digested with micrococcal nuclease (12.5 units/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C. The nuclease reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mm EDTA and 0.2% Sarkosyl. The homogenate was subjected to proteolysis with proteinase K (100 μg/ml, 8 h, 4 °C), and the reaction was stopped by incubating for 30 min with 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Sarkosyl was added to 1%, and after 30 min of incubation on ice the homogenate was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet, which contains the prion rods, was resuspended in 500 μl of TNS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Sarkosyl) using a probe sonicator (Sonopuls; Dandelin Electronics, Germany) full power (4 × 1 s), and then repelleted (3×). Sarkosyl was removed by rinsing the pellet twice with 70% EtOH (100,000 × g, 30 min) and then resuspended by sonication in 600 μl of 30% sucrose in TN. A 5-μl sample of this rod preparation was analyzed by electrophoresis and silver staining (Fig. 1A, right lane) and compared with 10 ng of recombinant mouse PrP (Fig. 1A, left lane). Hamster rods contained a single 27–30-kDa band (Fig. 1A) that is characteristic of Syrian hamster Sc237 PrPSc, whereas mouse rods had three characteristic glycoforms. The PrP concentration in rod preparations was determined by comparing with dilution of recombinant mouse PrP in Western blots developed with the recombinant Fab, R1 (Fig. 1B). Rod preparation usually contained about 5 ng/ml PrP27–30. Cells—Mouse neuroblastoma ScN2a-M are ScN2a cells (24Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that stably express the MHM2-PrP chimera that reacts with the mAb 3F4 (35Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Carp R.I. Robakis N.K. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 676-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An uninfected version (N2a-M) was obtained by curing ScN2a-M cells with pentosan polysulfate (5 μg/ml, 5 days) (36Ehlers B. Diringer H. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65 (Pt. 8): 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and subsequently maintaining them without inhibitors for at least 1 month prior to use. GT1–1 are mouse hypothalamus cells (27Schätzl H.M. Laszlo L. Holtzman D.M. Tatzelt J. DeArmond S.J. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8821-8831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GT1–1-M stably express MHM2-PrP and react with 3F4. Cells were grown at 37 °C in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-16 (N2a and GT1–1) or F12 (CHO-K1, (37Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar)) containing 10% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of either of the above media and OptiMem (Invitrogen). To assess the susceptibility of GT1–1-MHM2 cells to infection, cells growing on 12-well trays were treated with the relevant inhibitors for 24 h. Thereafter, the cells were inoculated either with purified mouse rods for 24 h or with cell supernatant of ScGT1–1 (the medium was frozen and thawed at least 3 times before addition to the cells) for 48 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-OptiMem (1:1) in the presence of the inhibitors. The cells were rinsed and further grown in fresh medium (without inoculum or treatments) for either 5 or 10 days as indicated in Fig. 5. Because the mouse inocula are not recognized by the mAb 3F4, successful infection was identified by the appearance in the cells of 3F4-reactive PrPSc (as depicted in Fig. 5B). PrP Isoforms and Analysis—PrPSc was defined as the PrP fraction resistant to proteinase K (20 μg/ml, 37 °C, 30 min). Western blots (WB) were carried out as described (38Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The protein content of parallel samples was normalized using a Bradford kit (500–006) from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) prior to electrophoresis. Cell lysates (in ice-cold lysis buffer: 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA) were immediately centrifuged for 40 s at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge, and biochemical analyses were performed on the post-nuclear supernatant. Rod Internalization and Binding—Assays were carried out on confluent monolayers grown in 24-well trays. Cells were treated with enzymes or inhibitors for 24 h at 37 °C prior to the assays unless otherwise indicated. Rods (1 μl/well, ∼5 ng of PrP, Fig. 1B) were then added either for 20 h at 37 °C (internalization) or for 3 h at 4 °C (binding assay) performed in PBS or in F12/OptiMem, 1:1, with identical results. The cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed, and the protein content was normalized using the Bradford method. The samples were incubated with 2 μg/ml proteinase K (1 h, 37 °C, stopped by 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the level of cell-associated PrPSc (from the exogenous rods) was assayed by WB developed with 3F4 mAb (for Syrian hamster rods) or D13 Fab (for mouse rods). Fluorescence Microscopy—For internalization experiments, cells growing on 8-well slides (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were pretreated with the relevant inhibitors for 24 h and then exposed for 20 h to purified Syrian hamster prion rods with or without inhibitors. At the end of the incubation the cells were rinsed and further incubated in normal medium for 4 h to reduce the signal of the rods on the cell surface. The cells were fixed (8% formalin in PBS, 30 min, room temperature), denatured in situ (3 m GdnSCN, 0.1% TX-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5 min, room temperature) (18Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) to visualize rods, immunostained with 3F4, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Inhibition of Rod Uptake by Soluble Glycans Correlates with Their Anti-prion Activity—It is well established that certain glycans reduce the ongoing formation of PrPSc in chronically infected cells. To see whether cellular GAGs might be part of a cellular receptor for prions, we thus first studied the extent to which several glycans reduce the uptake of prion rods, as compared with their anti-prion efficacy. To this end we chose the “classical” anti-prion dextran sulfate (DS500) (36Ehlers B. Diringer H. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65 (Pt. 8): 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and three members of the HM library of substituted dextrans with vastly different anti-prion potencies (32Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Gabizon R. Papy-Garcia D. Barritault D. Taraboulos A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar): B103, HM2102, and HM2602 (Fig. 2). Chronically infected ScN2a-M cells were treated for 5 days with these compounds, and protease-resistant PrPSc was then analyzed by WB developed with 3F4 (panel A). As expected, the more sulfated and/or benzylaminated compounds (DS500, HM2602, and B103) reduced PrPSc more efficiently than the non-sulfated HM2102 (32Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Gabizon R. Papy-Garcia D. Barritault D. Taraboulos A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Next, we turned to determination of the extent to which these glycans decrease rod uptake in uninfected N2a-M cells. The cells were preincubated for 24 h with the polyanions, as in panel A. Purified Syrian hamster rods were added to the cell medium for an additional 20 h in the presence of the inhibitors. The cells were rinsed thoroughly, and their protease-resistant PrPSc was monitored in WBs with 3F4 (panel B). The ability of these compounds to reduce the internalization of rods correlated well with their anti-PrPSc potency (compare panels A and B, and see Fig. 6). (We have previously reported that HMs are not general endocytosis inhibitors (32Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Gabizon R. Papy-Garcia D. Barritault D. Taraboulos A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).) Interestingly, higher concentrations of inhibitors were required to reduce rod uptake than to reduce endogenous PrPSc (see “Discussion”).Fig. 6Cellular heparan sulfates serve both as rod receptors and as prion cofactors: a model.A, left, rods, which comprise large aggregates of PrP27–30, can bind cell surface HS and use them for internalization. Because of their large dimension, rods are likely to bind cooperatively to a very large number of HS molecules. These HS receptors are similar to or identical with the cellular HS cofactors (right panel). However, whereas rod binding takes place on the cell surface, PrPSc synthesis (right panel) may also occur in intracellular compartments. B, digesting with heparinase or preventing sulfation with chlorate prevents both rod binding and internalization (left) and PrPSc formation (right). C, identical polyanions prevent the binding of rods and the formation of PrPSc, but a larger concentration is required to compete out the presumably more numerous binding sites of rods (left).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anti-prion Heparinase III and Chlorate Inhibit Rod Uptake—This correlation suggested that there may be a mechanistic relationship between the two anti-prion activities of these polyanions, namely that the cellular HS that are needed for the ongoing synthesis of PrPSc (15Ben-Zaken O.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) also form parts of internalization receptors for rods. To verify that HS are involved in rod uptake, we explored other treatments that inhibit or digest cellular HS (Fig. 3). N2a-M (panel A) and CHO-K1 (panels B and C) cells were pretreated for 24 h with either heparinase I or heparinase III to digest away HS, or they were incubated with the metabolic sulfation inhibitor Na chlorate (30 mm) (39Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) or with soluble glycans as indicated in panel B. Rods were added to the cell medium and were allowed to enter the cells for 20 h. The cells were then harvested and proteinase K-resistant PrP was detected using either WB (Fig. 3, A and B) or immunofluorescence (Fig. 3C). Heparinase III, Na-chlorate, dextran sulfate DS500, and HM2602 almost completely abolished rod uptake, whereas heparinase I was only slightly inhibitory and the inactive HM compound HM2102 failed to reduce the uptake of rods altogether. These results correlate perfectly with the anti-prion potency of these treatments (Fig. 2 and Ref. 15Ben-Zaken O. Tzaban S. Tal Y. Horonchik L. Esko J.D. Vlodavsky I. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar inhibitory results were obtained when mouse rods were applied to GT1–1 cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast to heparinase III, chondroitinase ABC failed to reduce rod uptake (Fig. 3B), correlating with its inability to reduce PrPSc in chronically infected ScN2a (15Ben-Zaken O. Tzaban S. Tal Y. Horonchik L. Esko J.D. Vlodavsky I. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whether this is caused by the paucity of chondroitin sulfate in these cells or by other mechanisms remains to be determined. Heparinase III-sensitive HS Mediate Both Binding and Internalization of Rods—These results strongly suggested that heparinase III-sensitive cellular HS are part of endocytosis receptors for purified prion rods in N2a, CHO-K1, and GT1–1 cells. Prions also bound to cell surface HS at 4 °C. N2a-M (not shown) or CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 4) were pretreated for 24 h with heparinase I, heparinase III, Na-chlorate (panel A), or dextran-based polyanions (panel B). The plates were cooled on ice (to prevent endocytosis) and further incubated with purified rods in the presence of the inhibitors (3 h on ice). At the end of the incubation, the cells were rinsed thoroughly and cell surface-bound rods were monitored by WB. All the efficient anti-PrPSc treatments also effectively reduced the binding of purified rods to the surface of these cells. Thus, only heparinase I and HM2102 left this binding intact (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition to removing HS GAGs from the cell surface, heparinase III is also likely to release HS fragments to the cell medium. By analogy with other sulfated glycans, these degradation products could also inhibit rod binding by competing with surface receptors. It was therefore necessary to verify directly that the presence of HS chains on the cell surface perform as a binding receptor for prion rods. For this purpose, we incubated CHO-K1 cells with heparinase III (0.1, 1, or 2 units/ml) for 24 h (37 °C). The cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS to remove any soluble heparinase products and supplemented with fresh medium without heparinase, and rods were added to all cells (3 h on ice). At the end of the incubation the cells were rinsed thoroughly and the cell surface-bound rods were monitored in WB (Fig. 4C). Treatment of the cells with heparinase III inhibited rod binding to the cells (lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, the results described above indicate that (i) heparinase III-sensitive HS play a crucial role both in the binding and in the internalization of prion rods in N2a and in CHO-K1 cells, and (ii) these HS molecules are similar or identical to those that serve as cofactors for the ongoing formation of PrPSc in ScN2a cells. We next asked whether endogenous HS are required for rod binding or whether exogenous HS can mediate binding of rods to another cellular receptor. For this purpose CHO-K1 cells were treated with chlorate for 24 h to stop the sulfation of cellular HS. Exogenous HS (50 μg/ml) were then added to the cell medium along with prion rods, the cells were further incubated for 3 h on ice, and cell-b"

Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar), and evidence is emerging supporting copper, iron, and redox silent zinc in the pathogenesis of AD (reviewed in Refs. 5.Bush A.I.

Two of the defining hallmarks of AD are peptide aggregation and the generation of reactive oxygen species, both of which are consequences of Aβ coordinating metal ions (5.Bush A.I. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar).The importance of Zn2+ in plaque formation has been emphasized by the finding that age- and female sex-related plaque formation in Tg2576 transgenic mice was greatly reduced upon the genetic ablation of the zinc transporter 3 protein, which is required for zinc transport into synaptic vesicles (7.Lee J.Y.

The plaques represent “metallic sinks” because high concentrations of Cu (400 μm), Zn (1 mm), and Fe (1 mm) have been found in amyloid deposits in AD-affected brains (8.Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D.

In Tg2576 mice, clioquinol treatment markedly decreased Aβ deposition and improved the general health and body weight (10.Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A.

A variety of spectroscopic studies have confirmed that the imidazole side chains of the histidine residues constitute the principal site(s) of metal coordination (12.Miura T. Suzuki K. Kohata N.

EPR spectra recorded in PBS at Cu2+/peptide molar ratios of >0.3 have consistently demonstrated broadening. This can be explained by dipolar or exchange effects due to two Cu ions being within ∼6 Å of each other, and the peptide was coordinating a second Cu2+ atom in a highly cooperative manner at a site close to the initial binding site. We have hypothesized that this second site would result in a histidine residue bridging between the metal ions (distance between metals, ∼6 Å); the resulting coordination sphere would be reminiscent of that observed in superoxide dismutase 1 (13.Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol.

The N-methylation of the His side chain does not affect the aromaticity of the imidazole ring; however, it does eliminate the tautomeric equilibrium, locking the structure into one of two forms. Methylation at these sites would not inhibit the initial metal binding site, but it does prevent the subsequent formation of a histidine bridge, inhibiting the formation of superoxide dismutase-like structures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsThe uncommonly Nim protected amino acids, Fmoc-l-His(N-1-Me)-OH (HisτMe) and Fmoc-l-His(N-3-Me)-OH (HisπMe), were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland); all were used without further purification. 5-(4-Aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxyphenoxy)valeryl-polyethyleneglycol-polystyrene was purchased from Applied Biosystems. 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was purchased from Aldrich. All organic solvents were of HPLC grade, and all other reagents were of the highest quality available.The acidic phospholipid spin label 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphotidylserine (16NPS) was synthesized according to the method of Hubbell and McConnell (16.Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) and checked for purity and to ensure that the number of spins/mol was >90% of the theoretical value (17.Gordon L.M. Curtain C.C. Electron Spin Resonance Analysis of Model and Biological Membranes. Alan R. Liss, New York1988Google Scholar). Synthetic palmitoyloleoyl phosphotidylcholine (POPC) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and palmitoyloleoyl phosphotidylserine (POPS) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.Peptide SynthesisAll peptides were synthesized according to methods outlined previously (18.Tickler A.K. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Sci. 2001; 7: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Due to the large degree of similarity between the peptides, large batches of resins were prepared and split at appropriate points in the synthetic pathway such that each peptide was prepared on a scale of 0.03 mmol.Peptide CharacterizationPeptide purification by RP-HPLC was performed on a Waters instrument controlled by Millenium software and equipped with photodiode array detection. The solvent system used throughout was buffer A (10 mm aqueous ammonium bicarbonate), buffer B (CH3CN). Semi-preparative RP-HPLC was performed using a Vydac 259VHP810 semi-preparative column (10 × 250 mm, 8 μm) (Hesperia) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min using a linear gradient of 10–60% CH3CN over 30 min. Analytical RP-HPLC was performed using a Waters Symmetry 300™ C4 analytical column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 10–60% CH3CN over 30 min and heated to 60 °C. For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis, samples were mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix and examined using a Bruker BIFLEX instrument (Bremen, Germany) in linear mode at 19.5 kV or reflector mode at 19.5 kV, 20 kV gradient reflector.Electrospray ionization mass spectra were obtained on a Quattro II triple quadrupole instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Samples were introduced to the source via an HP1100 LC system (Hewlett Packard) equipped with solvent degasser, binary pumps, and autosampler. Samples were dissolved in 50:50 water:acetontrile with 1% formic acid to give a final concentration of ∼10 μg/ml. A carrier solvent of 50:50 (v/v) water:acetontrile was fed at 20 μl/min to the mass spectroscopy probe. Data were acquired in continuum mode from 400–2000 m/z in 6–8-s scans, with an ion source at 100 °C and sampling cone at 40 V. The acquired data were deconvoluted using the transform algorithm supplied with the Masslynx v3.2 software. Amino acid analysis of Fmoc-derivatized hydrolysates showed good correlation with expected values for all peptides.Large Unilamellar Vesicle PreparationLUVs of POPS and POPC (50:50) were prepared according to the method of Hope et al. (19.Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 50 mg/ml in 10 mm PBS (pH 6.8). Lipid solutions were passed through a 100-nm polycarbonate filter using Avanti Polar Lipids mini extruder apparatus at 37 °C.Circular Dichroism SpectroscopyCD spectra were obtained using a JASCO model J-710 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) controlled using the Jasco software provided. Spectra were background subtracted, adjusted for concentration, and smoothed using the algorithm provided with the system.Aqueous TFE Gradients—Stock solutions of Aβ40, Aβ40(HisπMe), and Aβ40(HisτMe) were prepared in HFIP, each at a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. Aliquots of the stock solutions were added to phosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 or 5.5) containing 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, or 100% TFE (v/v), achieving a peptide concentration of between 10 and 12 μmol, and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min. Samples were run in a 0.2-cm-path length cell at room temperature.Peptides in SDS Micelle-containing Buffer—Stock solutions of Aβ40, Aβ40(HisπMe), or Aβ40(HisτMe) were prepared in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/80% acetonitrile. To 300 μl of sodium phosphate buffer at the required pH was added 20 μl of 10% (w/v) aqueous SDS. Aliquots of the stock solutions were added to each solution to a concentration between 10 and 12 μm and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min. Samples were run in 0.2-cm-path length cell at room temperature.Peptides in LUV Solution—Samples of Aβ40, Aβ40(HisπMe), or Aβ40(HisτMe) in LUVs prepared during EPR experiments were diluted 1:4 in PBS (pH 6.5) and run in a 0.2-cm-path length cell at room temperature.Cu2+ Binding Experiments—Stock solutions of Aβ40, Aβ40(HisπMe), or Aβ40(HisτMe) were prepared in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/80% acetonitrile. Aliquots of the stock solutions were diluted in PBS (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4). Cu(II)-glycine (0.1 mm stock) was added to give the desired ratio with the peptide and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min. Samples were run in a 0.2-cm-path length cell at room temperature.Electron MicroscopyAβ40, Aβ40(HisτMe), and Aβ40(HisπMe) samples were prepared in 5 mm aqueous HCl (typically 10 μg/ml) and aged by standing at 37 °C for 5 days; samples were diluted 1:100 or 1:1000 prior to analysis. An aliquot of each sample was spotted onto carbon-coated single hole copper grids (ProSciTech, Kirwan, Australia), and the loaded grids were dried over agar gel. Precipitates were negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate for 2 min and then washed several times with water. The samples were visualized on a Siemens ELMI-SKOP 102 electron microscope at 60 V.Electron Paramagnetic ResonanceContinuous wave X-band EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller and flow-through liquid nitrogen cryostat. 65Cu2+ spectra were collected at 110 K from samples contained in 4-mm-inner diameter “Suprasil” quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad). In order to eliminate the possibility that any line broadening observed in the spectra might be due to freezing-induced localized concentrations of sample, 10% glycerol was added to aqueous peptide buffer solutions. Peptides as a freeze-dried powder were added to the desired concentration to a suspension of spin-labeled (16NPS; concentration, 1:100) LUVs in buffer, and the mixture was vortexed under N2 for 10 min at 305 K in polypropylene tubes. 100 mm stock solutions of analytical reagent grade CuCl2 were prepared, and the desired amount was added to the LUVs after addition of the peptide. Lipid samples (25 μl) were contained in 0.8-mm-inner diameter quartz capillaries (Wilmad) and handled as described by Gordon and Curtain (17.Gordon L.M. Curtain C.C. Electron Spin Resonance Analysis of Model and Biological Membranes. Alan R. Liss, New York1988Google Scholar) to ensure reproducibility. Spectra were recorded at 305 K. Instrument parameters are as described previously (13.Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol.

All solutions were introduced to the column via the solvent delivery system at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min or as an injected solution. The column was swelled in buffer C (10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.4) treated with EDTA (50 mm) for 2 min and then washed with water (2 min). A solution of Cu(II)-glycine, Ni(II)-glycine, or Zn(II)-glycine (0.1 m, 2 ml) was then introduced as an injected solution. Excess metal solution was washed off with ultrafiltered deionized water (2 min), and the column was allowed to equilibrate with buffer C (5 min). Peptides were prepared as 1.0 mm solutions in 10% TFE, and single peptides (5 μl) were introduced to the metal-charged column by injection. The peptide was eluted by a pH gradient of 0–100% buffer D (10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 2.5) over 20 min at 1.5 ml/min. To determine the elution pH of the peptides, a curve of pH versus retention time was produced by measuring the pH of 1.0-ml fractions collected during metal- and sample-free runs. Significance between groups was tested at 95% using Bonferroni t test (SigmaStat, Version 2.03).Hydrogen Peroxide AssayDichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (5 mm; argon purged for 1 h at 20 °C), deacetylated with 50% (v/v) 0.05 m NaOH for 30 min, and then neutralized (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 1 mm. The reactions were carried out in Dulbecco's PBS, pH 7.5, in a 96-well plate (250 μl/well) containing freshly prepared synthetic peptide (200 nm) copper-glycine (150 nm CuCl2 and 900 nm glycine), and ascorbate (0, 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8, and 17.6 μm) in the presence of deacylated dichlorofluorescein diacetate (100 μm) and horseradish peroxidase (0.1 μm) incubated at 37 °C. There was a 4:3 molar excess of peptide to copper to ensure that there would be no free copper ions in the solution. Studies were performed on the day of reagent preparation. The fluorescence signal specific for H2O2 was decreased in parallel samples co-incubated with catalase (40 units/ml; 100 nm). Fluorescence readings were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 plate reader (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm) against a standard curve of reagent-grade H2O2 in PBS. All experiments were performed in triplicate.Toxicity AssaysPrimary Neuronal Cultures—Mouse embryonic cortices (E14) were isolated from BL6J/129sv mice, dissected free of meninges, and dissociated in 0.025% trypsin according published methods (20.Ciccotosto G.D. Tew D. Curtain C.C. Smith D. Carrington D. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Cherny R.A. Cappai R. Barnham K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42528-42534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Dissociated cells were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated sterile culture plates in plating medium (minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 5% horse serum) at 125,000 cells/cm2 and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 2 h, the plating medium was replaced with Neurobasal growth medium (Invitrogen) containing B27 supplements (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 mm glutamine. This method resulted in cultures highly enriched for neurons (>95% purity) with minimal astrocyte and microglial contamination as determined by immunostaining of culture preparations using specific marker antibodies (data not shown). Both toxicity and peptide uptake experiments were done in fresh Neurobasal medium using B27 supplements lacking antioxidants.Peptide Stock Solutions—Aβ40, Aβ40(HisπMe), and Aβ40(HisτMe) were dissolved in 20 mm NaOH and diluted in PBS (5 mm sodium phosphate, 15 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to give 200 μm stock solutions of each peptide. Peptide stock solutions were sonicated in a water bath for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at high speed, and the supernatant was removed and aged by standing at 37 °C for 5 days before being added to neurons at a concentration of 20 μm in culture medium.Cell Viability Assay—Cortical neurons were plated into 48-well plates and treated with aged peptide solutions for 4 days. The neurotoxicity of the peptides was challenged using catalase, a specific H2O2 scavenger (2000 units of activity/ml medium; Sigma). Cell survival was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy, and cell viability was quantitated using the MTS assay as described previously (20.Ciccotosto G.D. Tew D. Curtain C.C. Smith D. Carrington D.

The data were normalized and calculated as a percentage of untreated vehicle control values. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between groups were done using Student's t test.Peptide Binding and Cell UptakeCortical neurons were plated into 12-well plates and treated with 7.5 μm aged peptide solutions for 5 h. An aliquot of the conditioned media for each peptide was kept to represent the concentration of added peptide. The cortical neurons in the wells were briefly washed in cold PBS or ice-cold 0.1 m sodium carbonate (carbonate wash), and the cells were scraped up from the wells, and proteins were extracted in 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05 m MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100). The untreated conditioned media and cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot techniques as described previously (20.Ciccotosto G.D. Tew D. Curtain C.C. Smith D. Carrington D. Masters C.L.

The nitrocellulose immunoblots were probed with WO2, an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, detected using a peroxidase sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences), and developed with ECL reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescent signals from immunoblots were quantitated using a charged-coupled device camera imaging system and GeneTool analysis software (GeneGnome; Syngene, Cambrige, UK).RESULTSPeptide Synthesis—The synthesis of all peptides was carried out using the optimized method reported previously (18.Tickler A.K. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Sci. 2001; 7: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), where standard continuous flow SPPS was carried out using 2% 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene/N,N-dimethylformamide as the deprotection reagent until residue Ser8, after which point the reagent was changed to 20% piperidine/N,N′-dimethylformamide. The production of Aβ40(HisτMe) and Aβ40(HisπMe) required only a minor modification to the synthesis with the substitution of Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH for the Hisτ/πMe equivalent. The modified histidine residue replaced the wild-type residue at each of the three positions His6, His13, and His14 to generate two peptides, one in which all the histidine residues were methylated at the τ-nitrogen of imidazole side chain (Aβ40(HisτMe)), and the other in which all the histidine residues were methylated at the π-nitrogen (Aβ40(HisπMe)). When Aβ40 was co-injected into RP-HPLC with either of the modified histidine peptides (Aβ40(HisτMe) or Aβ40(HisπMe)), the peptides co-eluted, indicating that the contribution of the modified histidines to the overall hydrophobicity of the peptides was negligible.CD spectroscopy was performed to determine whether the modifications significantly altered the structural properties of the peptides. All the peptides displayed a small amount of β-sheet structure after dilution from HFIP stock solutions into PBS buffer (Fig. 2). Increasing the TFE content of the buffer to 10% induced α-helical structures in all peptides. Similar helical structures were generated by all peptides in aqueous SDS micelle solutions (data not shown). These data indicate that methylation of the histidine imidazole side chains did not significantly affect the structural tendencies of the peptide.Fig. 2Modification of the histidine residues has no effect on the secondary structure propensities of the Aβ peptides. TFE gradient CD spectra of (a) Aβ40 wild-type, (b) Aβ40(HisπMe), and (c) Aβ40(HisτMe) at pH 7.4. All peptides display a small amount of β-sheet structure after dilution from HFIP stock solutions into aqueous buffer. Increasing TFE content of the buffer to 10% induced α-helical conformation in all peptides. α-Helical content increased with increasing TFE concentration for all peptides, and maximal α-helical content was achieved at 40–60% TFE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Aggregation Properties of Modified His Peptides—To ascertain whether modification of the histidine residues affected the ability of the peptide to aggregate, fibril formation of the wild-type and modified histidine peptides was investigated using electron microscopy. Previous studies have indicated that fibril formation is more pronounced in low pH solutions (21.Stine Jr., W.B. Dahlgren K.N. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol.

The electron micrographs of Aβ40, Aβ40(HisτMe), and Aβ40(HisπMe) aged for 5 days in 5 mm aqueous HCl solution show negatively stained fibrils in all samples analyzed (Fig. 3). Qualitatively, the morphology of the Aβ40(Hisτ/πMe) peptides is similar to that of the wild-type Aβ. Therefore, the addition of a methyl group represented a conservative modification to Aβ that has not significantly altered the structural properties of the peptide.Fig. 3Electron microscopy images of fibrils of (a–c) Aβ40 (wild-type; magnification, ×40,000), (d–f) Aβ40(HisτMe) (magnification, ×20,000), and (g–i) Aβ40(HisπMe) (magnification, ×40,000).

https://openalex.org/W1983532638,"Chk2 is a critical mediator of diverse cellular responses to DNA damage. Activation of Chk2 by DNA damage requires phosphorylation at sites including Thr68. In earlier work, we found that an activity present in rabbit reticulocyte lysates phosphorylates and activates Chk2. We now find that hypophosphorylated Chk2 can be phosphorylated at Thr68 by various subcellular fractions of HEK293 cells. This activity is sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-like kinase inhibitor wortmannin, but not to caffeine. DNA enhances the Chk2 phosphorylation by cellular fractions in vitro. The wortmannin-sensitive Chk2 kinase activity is present in fractions from ATM-deficient cells. In contrast, Chk2 was not efficiently phosphorylated at Thr68 in vitro by fractions from cells with a defective DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) catalytic subunit. Chk2 is phosphorylated by purified DNA-PK in vitro. Endogenous Chk2 coimmunoprecipitates Ku70 and Ku80. In a series of matched cell lines having and lacking functional DNA-PK, Chk2 activation by exposure of cells to ionizing radiation, or to camptothecin was consistently diminished in the absence of DNA-PK. Down-regulation of DNA-PKcs by either siRNA or a chemical inhibitor attenuated radiation-induced Chk2 phosphorylation. Ionizing radiation-induced Chk2 phosphorylation was wortmannin-sensitive in ATM-defective cells with depleted ATR. These results suggest that DNA-PK augments ATM and ATR in activation of Chk2 by DNA damage. Chk2 is a critical mediator of diverse cellular responses to DNA damage.

DNA damage checkpoint pathways sense genomic lesions and induce cell cycle arrest, transcriptional induction of repair-related genes, and/or apoptosis. Two members of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) 1The abbreviations used are: PIKK, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-like kinase; DSB, DNA double-strand break; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; FHA domain, forkhead-associated domain; DNA-PKcs, catalytic subunit of DNA-PK; siRNA, short-interfering RNA; Gy, Gray; HU, hydroxyurea; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: PIKK, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-like kinase; DSB, DNA double-strand break; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; FHA domain, forkhead-associated domain; DNA-PKcs, catalytic subunit of DNA-PK; siRNA, short-interfering RNA; Gy, Gray; HU, hydroxyurea; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. family, ATM and ATR, play central roles in DNA damage checkpoint signal transduction. ATM is activated mainly by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a disease caused by ATM mutations, are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR), and have defects in IR-induced G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle arrest. ATR responds to a wider range of signals, including ultraviolet light (UV)-induced damage, DSBs, and stalled replication forks (1Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). ATM and ATR each phosphorylate several substrates. These include Chk1 and Chk2, which are important effector kinases with overlapping functions. Under basal conditions, ATM exists as an inactive form in dimers or oligomers. Irradiation induces the rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation of ATM, which leads to dissociation of ATM dimers and the activation of ATM kinase activity (2Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). The principal kinase relaying signals initiated by ATM appears to be Chk2. UV or replication blockade causes the phosphorylation of Chk2 independent of ATM, possibly through ATR (3Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 4Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Activated Chk2 mediates IR-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis through the phosphorylation of Cdc25A, which triggers the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cdc25A (5Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In addition, Chk2 contributes to G2/M arrest through inhibitory phosphorylation of the mitosis-promoting Cdc25C phosphatase (6Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). By phosphorylating p53, Chk2 also helps maintain sustained G1, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis (7Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Additional substrates of Chk2 include the tumor suppressor Brca1, PML (promyelocytic leukemia gene product), and the transcription factor E2F1 (8Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 9Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Stevens C. Smith L. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Chk2 function requires several evolutionarily conserved domains. They include an N-terminal SCD (SQ/TQ cluster domain), which contains multiple consensus SQ/TQ phosphorylation sites for PIKKs, a FHA (forkhead-associated) domain, which binds to phosphopeptides, and a C-terminal kinase domain (7Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylates Chk2 at Thr68 (3Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 4Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which is followed by oligomerization of Chk2 through FHA domain/phospho-SCD interactions, autophosphorylation and activation (11Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of Thr68, located in the SCD, and the integrity of the FHA domain are required for full activation of Chk2, probably because they promote oligomerization (3Matsuoka S. Rotman G.

Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This seems to be a multistep process, in which phosphorylation of the SCD by PIKKs or other Chk2 molecules permits cross-phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 at sites within the activation loop of the kinase domain (Thr383 and Thr387). A third PIKK family member DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a serine/threonine kinase composed of a large catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, of ∼460 kDa, and a regulatory component, the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer (14Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). DNA-PK is activated by association with DNA. Ku binds to DNA ends directly, and then recruits DNA-PKcs (14Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of DNA-PK is required for NHEJ (nonhomologous end joining) (15Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the predominant mechanism for DSB repair in mammalian cells. NHEJ is also crucial for V(D)J recombination in development of the immune system. Cells and animals defective in DNA-PK are deficient in DSB repair and V(D)J recombination, and, thus, are hypersensitive to IR and are immunodeficient (14Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The protein kinase activity of DNA-PK is up-regulated by DNA damage induced by IR, UV, and V(D)J recombination (16Yang J. Yu Y. Hamrick H.E. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the role of DNA-PK in DNA damage checkpoint signaling is controversial. Phosphorylation of replication protein A (RPA) by DNA-PK may be involved in DNA damage-induced replication arrest (17Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). DNA-PK selectively regulates p53-mediated apoptosis, but not cell cycle arrest, after exposure to IR (18Jimenez G.S. Bryntesson F. Torres-Arzayus M.I. Priestley A. Beeche M. Saito S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Wahl G.M. Hubank M.

Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 22Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T.

DNA-PK can phosphorylate and activate c-Abl, while c-Abl regulates DNA-PK in a negative feedback loop by phosphorylating DNA-PK and diminishing its binding to DNA (23Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Hence, the down-regulation of DNA-PK by c-Abl is dependent on ATM (24Shangary S. Brown K.D. Adamson A.W. Edmonson S. Ng B. Pandita T.K. Yalowich J. Taccioli G.E. Baskaran R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30163-30168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Many proteins have been identified that are phosphorylated by DNA-PK in vitro, including XRCC4, p53 and Sp1, but few have been corroborated by in vivo analysis (14Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). We have found that DNA-PK is the major constituent of an activity present in extracts of mammalian cells that phosphorylates Chk2. Our results suggest that hypophosphorylated Chk2 can be phosphorylated at Thr68 by DNA-PK in vitro. Likewise, DNA-PK appears to be involved in activation of Chk2 in response to DNA damage in vivo. We also found that Chk2 can form protein complexes with Ku70 and Ku80. These results support the model that the PIKKs ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK collaboratively transduce DNA damage signals to downstream kinases including Chk2.

Human fibroblasts from a patient with Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (GM07166A) were obtained from NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository. Other cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection. M059K and M059J cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (1:1 mixture) supplemented with 2.5 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. V3-H15 and V3-KA4 were maintained in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HEK293, U2-OS, and AT cells stably transfected with vector or wild-type ATM were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine and antibiotics. Cells were fractionated according to a protocol modified from Refs. 26Kappes F. Burger K. Baack M. Fackelmayer F.O. Gruss C. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization. The cytoplasmic fraction (S1) was separated from the nuclear pellet by centrifugation (5 min, 3,300 × g). Nuclei were washed with solution A (hypotonic buffer plus 0.34 m sucrose and 10% glycerol), resuspended in solution A supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) and kept on ice for 30 min. The soluble nuclear fraction (S2) was separated from the chromatin-enriched fraction (P) by centrifugation (10 min, 3,300 × g). The chromatin-enriched (P) fraction was then washed with solution A and resuspended in solution A. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-phospho-Thr68 Chk2 antibody was described previously (28Tsvetkov L. Xu X. Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8468-8475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Chk2 monoclonal antibody used for immunoblotting was from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-ATR and anti-ATM from GeneTex, anti-Chk1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-phospho-Ser345 Chk1 and anti-p70 S6 kinase from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-DNA-PKcs, anti-Ku70 and anti-Ku80 were from NeoMarkers. One of the rabbit polyclonal anti-Chk2 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation was produced by immunization with purified GST-Chk2 produced in Escherichia coli (28Tsvetkov L. Xu X. Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8468-8475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the other was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-phospho-Thr383/Thr387 was a generous gift from J. Chung. In Vitro Coupled Transcription-Translation Assays—pCDNA-FLAGChk2, wild type, and mutants (described in Ref. 11Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell.

In Vitro Chk2 Phosphorylation Assay—In vitro translation products were mixed with 300 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma) were added and immunoprecipitations performed for 3-4 h. Precipitates were washed three times with NETN buffer and then twice with kinase buffer A (20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The washed beads were then incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with either kinase buffer A only or cell fractions in kinase buffer A, in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (5 mm ATP, 70 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase). Alternatively, in vitro translation products were incubated first for 1 h at 30 °C with either kinase buffer A only or cell fractions in kinase buffer A, in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. Then NETN buffer and anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads were added and immunoprecipitations performed. Purified DNA-PK was obtained from Promega. Immunoprecipitation—U2-OS cells were lysed with lysis buffer (NETN buffer supplemented with 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture). For immunoprecipitation, in vitro translated FLAG-Chk2 was mixed with U2-OS lysates, and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads were added and immunoprecipitation performed for 3-4 h. For in vivo coimmunoprecipitation of Chk2 and Ku70/Ku80, MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 Gy of IR or were mock-irradiated. After 30 min of recovery, cells were lysed with lysis buffer. Endogenous Chk2 was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of two rabbit polyclonal anti-Chk2 antibodies. Experimental Treatments—Cells were irradiated in a Mark I 137Cs irradiator (Shepard) or treated with 1 μm camptothecin (Sigma). Where indicated, cells were pretreated with NU7026 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)-benzo[h]chromen-4-one), from Calbiochem) for 1 h or rapamycin (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1.5 h before irradiation. AT or U2-OS cells were treated with 3 mm or 1 mm hydroxyurea (HU, from Sigma) for 20 h. For UV treatment, cells were irradiated with 254-nm UV light at a dose of 50 J/m2 with a Stratalinker (Stratagene). siRNA—siRNA duplexes of 21 nucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Research. The siRNA-targeting ATR is 5′-AACCTCCGTGATGTTGCTTGA-3′ (29Casper A.M. Nghiem P. Arlt M.F. Glover T.W.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1958-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). siRNA transfection was carried out using Oligofectamine per procedures recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The luciferase GL2 siRNA (5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′) was used as control. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Chk2 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies from either V3-H15 or V3-KA4 cell lysates made with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated Chk2 was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 1× kinase buffer B (20 mm HEPES pH7.5, 70 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 2 μm nonradioactive ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>5,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Figures represent results from a minimum of two trials. An Activity That Phosphorylates Chk2 in Vitro Is Sensitive to Wortmannin and Is Enhanced by DNA—Thr26/Ser28 and Thr68 are preferred PIKK phosphorylation sites located within the SCD in the N terminus of Chk2 (7Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylation of Chk2 Thr68 is required for full activation of Chk2 (3Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 4Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Chk2 produced in vitro using a wheat germ-derived translation system is hypophosphorylated (as judged by electrophoretic mobility), is not recognized by phosphospecific antibodies for phospho-Thr26/Ser28 or phospho-Thr68, and has minimal autophosphorylation activity (11Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Incubation of hypophosphorylated wheat germ-translated Chk2 with rabbit reticulocyte lysates enhances Thr68 phosphorylation and kinase activity (11Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To further characterize cellular activities that phosphorylate Chk2, we prepared subcellular fractions from HEK293 cells. Incubation of wheat germ-translated hypophosphorylated Chk2 with cytoplasmic (S1), soluble nuclear (S2), or chromatin (P) fractions from HEK293 cells in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system resulted in Thr68 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4). The most efficient phosphorylation of Chk2 occurred after incubation with the chromatin-enriched fraction (P) (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Thr68 phosphorylation of Chk2 by the chromatin fraction was greatly diminished by preincubation of chromatin with wortmannin (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7), a specific PIKK inhibitor with stronger inhibitory effects on DNA-PK and ATM than on ATR at the concentrations used (32Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, preincubating chromatin fractions with another PIKK inhibitor, caffeine, at concentrations from 1 mm to 10 mm did not inhibit the Thr68 phosphorylation of Chk2 (Fig. 1A, lane 5 and data not shown). Among ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK, DNA-PK is the most resistant to caffeine (33Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the roles of different PIKKs in Chk2 phosphorylation, hypophosphorylated Chk2 was incubated with the chromatin-enriched fraction from AT cells that were either transfected with vector only, or were reconstituted with wild-type ATM. Reintroduction of ATM into AT cells restored the normal sensitivity to ionizing radiation and intra-S phase checkpoint (25Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Chromatin fractions from ATM-defective cells phosphorylated Chk2 at Thr68 to a similar extent as cells with reconstituted ATM (Fig. 1B, compare lane 1 to lane 4). This indicated that ATM is not the major PIKK phosphorylating Chk2 in this assay. Moreover, wortmannin inhibited the phosphorylation of Chk2 not only by chromatin preparations from cells with wild-type ATM (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6), but also by fractions from cells with defective ATM (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that another target of wortmannin is responsible for Chk2 phosphorylation. DNA-PKcs can bind to DNA in vitro in the absence of Ku, but its protein kinase activity is stimulated severalfold by the interaction with DNA-bound Ku (14Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Addition of DNA enhanced Thr68 phosphorylation of both wild-type and kinase-defective Chk2 by the subcellular fractions, especially cytosol (S1) and chromatin-enriched (P) fractions (Fig. 1C). Because DNA-PK is the major DNA-activated PIKK (14Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 16Yang J. Yu Y. Hamrick H.E. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), these data further support a role of DNA-PK in the phosphorylation of Chk2. The phosphorylation of Chk2 in vitro by ATM purified from human placenta was not enhanced by the addition of DNA (34Chan D.W. Son S.C. Block W. Ye R. Khanna K.K. Wold M.S. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A. Pelley J. Taya Y. Lavin M.F. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7803-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The effect of DNA on ATR activity is controversial. Some groups did not observe a stimulatory effect of DNA on the kinase activity of ATR (35Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), whereas other groups have reported that DNA activates ATR (36Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3989-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cellular Fractions from DNA-PK-defective Cells Do Not Phosphorylate Chk2 Efficiently in Vitro—Because these results suggested that DNA-PK is the wortmannin-sensitive kinase for Chk2 phosphorylation in these subcellular fractions, we determined if Chk2 is a substrate for DNA-PK. Purified DNA-PK holoenzyme phosphorylated wild-type or kinase-defective Chk2 at Thr68 most efficiently in the presence of both ATP and DNA (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6). We next determined if fractions from DNA-PK-defective cells would also phosphorylate Chk2. M059J is a human glioma cell line that does not express DNA-PKcs, and is the only DNA-PKcs-defective cell line of human origin. M059K is a cell line with wild-type DNA-PKcs that was established from the same malignant glioma and has DNA-PK activity (38Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day 3rd, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions were prepared from M059J and M059K cells, as well as from NBS and HCC1937 cell lines which have mutated NBS1 and BRCA1, respectively. Hypophosphorylated Chk2 produced by translation in wheat germ extracts was not efficiently phosphorylated at Thr68 by fractions from DNA-PK-negative M059J cells, while it was phosphorylated by fractions from M059K cells (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 11 and 12 to lanes 8 and 9), as well as by fractions from cells with mutated NBS1, BRCA1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-6), or ATM (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The protein levels of cytoplasmic (S1), soluble nuclear (S2), and chromatin-enriched (P) fractions from M059K and M059J cells were normalized by blotting for Grb2, Sp1, and histone 3, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 13-18). Cell lines V3-H15 and V3-KA4 were derived from the same parent clone of the DNA-PK-defective CHO cell line V3 by transfection with genes encoding wild type or kinase-defective DNA-PKcs, respectively. Reconstitution of DNA-PKcs expression in V3 cells complemented the radiosensitivity, but introduction of kinase-defective DNA-PKcs did not (15Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Fractions from V3-H15 cells phosphorylated hypophosphorylated Chk2 much more effectively than did fractions from V3-KA4 cells (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1-3 to lanes 4-6). The data further suggest that in this in vitro assay, DNA-PK is the major kinase that phosphorylates Chk2, and that the phosphorylation is not dependent on NBS1 and Brca1. The Interaction of Chk2 and Ku—The above data indicated a relationship between DNA-PK activity and Chk2 phosphorylation, so we next tested whether Chk2 and DNA-PK physically interact. In vitro transcribed-translated Chk2 was incubated with cellular extracts. Wild-type Chk2 coimmunoprecipitated endogenous Ku70 and Ku80 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6), whereas Chk2 with defective kinase activity or a deleted FHA domain only interacted weakly with Ku (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-10). Chk2 binding to Ku was unaffected by DNA damage (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). To further evaluate the specificity of the interaction between Chk2 and Ku, the interaction of endogenous proteins was studied (Fig. 3B). Chk2 interacts with both Ku70 and Ku80, and the interaction was not affected by prior DNA damage (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Chk2 and Ku70/Ku80 still co-precipitated in the presence of ethidium bromide (EtBr) (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the interaction is not mediated by DNA. Although these associations between Chk2 and the Ku complex may be indirect, bacterially expressed GST-Chk2 did pull down Ku from purified DNA-PK (data not shown). DNA Damage-induced Chk2 Phosphorylation in Vivo Is Reduced in DNA-PK-defective Cells—We next determined whe"
https://openalex.org/W2075941062,"We have identified, purified, and determined the complete amino acid sequence of a novel protein, ohanin from Ophiophagus hannah (king cobra) venom. It is a small protein containing 107 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 11951.47 ± 0.67 Da as assessed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. It does not show similarity to any known families of snake venom proteins and hence is the first member of a new family of snake venom proteins. It shows similarity to PRY and SPRY domain proteins. It is nontoxic up to 10 mg/kg when injected intraperitoneally in mice. Ohanin produced statistically significant and dose-dependent hypolocomotion in mice. In a pain threshold assay, it showed dose-dependent hyperalgesic effect. The ability of the protein to elicit a response at greatly reduced doses when injected intracerebroventricularly as compared with intraperitoneal administration in both the locomotion and hot plate experiments strongly suggests that ohanin acts on the central nervous system. Since the natural abundance of the protein in the venom is low (∼1 mg/g), a synthetic gene was constructed and expressed. The recombinant protein, which was obtained in the insoluble fraction in Escherichia coli, was purified under denaturing condition and was refolded. Recombinant ohanin is structurally and functionally similar to native protein as determined by circular dichroism and hot plate assay, suggesting that it will be useful in future structure-function relationship studies.

Snake venoms are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins, as well as low molecular weight components including peptides, lipids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amines (1.Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 1-34Google Scholar, 2.Lee C.Y. Snake Venoms. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 159-212Google Scholar). Venom proteins generally play a number of roles, such as immobilizing, paralyzing, killing, and digesting prey (3.Kordis D. Gubensek F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Hence, snake venoms serve both offensive and defensive purposes (4.Dufton M.J. Endeavor. 1993; 17: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Over the past 40 years, a plethora of toxin proteins have been isolated and characterized from venoms of snakes (5.Menez A. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1557-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These toxin proteins, however, belong to a very small number of structural superfamilies of proteins (6.Kini R.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2002; 29: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The members of a superfamily share similar molecular scaffold, but at times, exhibit distinct biological functions. The major enzyme groups found in snake venoms include phospholipases, serine proteinases, metalloproteinases, phosphodiesterases, acetylcholinesterase, l-amino acid oxidases, and nucleases (2.Lee C.Y. Snake Venoms. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 159-212Google Scholar, 7.Torres A.M. Wong H.Y. Desai M. Moochala S. Kuchel P.W. Kini R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40097-40104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Generally, enzymes in the venom have molecular masses ranging from 13,000 to 150,000 Da. Most of these are hydrolases and possess a digestive role. On the other hand, over 1,000 non-enzymatic venom proteins have been characterized, and they are grouped into three-finger toxins, serine proteinase inhibitors, lectins, sarafatoxins, nerve growth factors, atrial natriuretic peptides, bradykinin-potentiating peptides, helveprins/CRISP proteins, disintegrins, and waprins (6.Kini R.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2002; 29: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7.Torres A.M. Wong H.Y. Desai M. Moochala S. Kuchel P.W. Kini R.M. J. Biol.

Non-enzymatic polypeptide toxins have molecular masses around 1,000 to 25,000 Da and are rich in disulfide bonds. Therefore, they are robust and are relatively stable once isolated. The low molecular mass compounds have molecular masses of less than 1,500 Da. They are less active biologically and are presumed to be enzyme cofactors (2.Lee C.Y. Snake Venoms. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 159-212Google Scholar). So far, snake venom proteins that are found in abundance or that are highly toxic have been isolated and characterized. With the advent of new and more sensitive methods, we are able to characterize proteins that are found in smaller quantities. We are interested in the study of novel protein components from snake venoms (7.Torres A.M. Wong H.Y. Desai M. Moochala S. Kuchel P.W. Kini R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40097-40104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification, purification and functional characterization of the first member of a new family of snake venom proteins, ohanin from king cobra venom. It induces hypolocomotion and hyperalgesia in experimental mice. The action of ohanin appears to be mediated by central nervous system as it was 6,500-fold more potent when administered i.c.v. than intraperitoneal. Recombinant ohanin was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli for future cassette-based mutagenesis and structure-function relationship studies. This is the first snake venom protein reported so far which induces hypolocomotion and hyperalgesia in experimental mice. An understanding of its physiological role(s) and mechanism of action(s) is useful in the development of prototypes of new pharmaceutical agents or as research tools.

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma with the exception of the following: Lys-C endopeptidase and trypsin were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), reagents for Edman degradation N-terminal sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), acetonitrile (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), Luria Bertani broth and agar were purchased from Q.BIOgene (Irvine, CA) and SDS-PAGE gel standards (prestained broad range SDS-PAGE standards and Precision plus prestained dual-color standard) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Superdex 30 Hiload (16/60) and μRPC C2/C18 (10 μ, 120 Å, 2.1 mm × 100 mm) columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. RP-Jupiter C18 (5 μ, 300 Å, 1 mm × 150 mm) and RP-Jupiter C18 (10 μ, 300 Å, 10 mm × 250 mm) columns were purchased from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Nickel-NTA agarose was purchased from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany). All the oligonucleotides were purchased from BioBasic (Shanghai, China). Platinum Taq polymerase, dNTP mix and ladders (50 bp, 100 bp, and 1 kb Plus) were purchased from Invitrogen. All restriction endonucleases used were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and pGEMT-easy vector was obtained from Promega. Water was purified with a MilliQ system (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Animals—Swiss albino male mice (20 ± 2 g) were used for the animal experiments. In order to reduce the impact caused by environmental changes and handling during behavioral studies, mice were acclimatized to the Laboratory Animal Holding Center and laboratory surroundings for 3 days and at least 1 h prior to experiments, respectively. Animals were kept under standard conditions with food (low protein diet) and water available ad lib. The animals were housed 4 per cage in a light-controlled room (12 h light/dark cycle, light on 07:00 h) at 23 °C and 60% relative humidity. All behavioral experiments were performed between 08:30 and 13:00 h. Each test group consisted of at least 7 mice, and each mouse was used only once. All animal experiments were conducted according to guidelines set by the Laboratory Animal Holding Center of the National University of Singapore (adapted from Howard-Jones, Ref. 10.Howard-Jones N. WHO Chron. 1985; 39: 51-56PubMed Google Scholar).

The crude mixture was eluted using a linear gradient of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Electrospray ionization mass spectrum was acquired in positive ion mode with an orifice potential of 80 V. Nitrogen was used as curtain gas with a flow rate of 0.6 liters/min and as nebulizer gas with a pressure setting of 100 psi. Full scan data were acquired over the ion range from 500 to 3000 m/z with step size of 0.1 Da. Data processing was performed with the aid of BioMultiview software (PerkinElmer Sciex, Thornton, Canada). Isolation and Purification—Lyophilized crude venom (several batches of 200 mg each) was dissolved in 2 ml of MilliQ water and loaded onto a Superdex 30 column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The proteins were eluted with 50 mm of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (FPLC) (Amersham Biosciences). Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. The fraction of interest was then loaded onto an RP-Jupiter C18 semi-preparative column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) on Vision Work station (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min over an hour. Protein elution was monitored at 280 and 215 nm. The protein of interest was identified by mass determination (described below). Reduction and Pyridylethylation—Lyophilized and purified protein of interest was reduced and pyridylethylated using the procedure described earlier (11.Joseph J.S. Chung M.C.M. Jeyaseelan K. Kini R.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 621-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein (500 μg) was dissolved in 500 μl of denaturant buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnCl), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). After the addition of 10 μlof β-mercaptoethanol, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h under vacuum. Subsequently, 20 μl of 4-vinyl pyridine was added to the mixture and kept at room temperature (∼25 °C) for another 2 h under vacuum. The reduced and pyridylethylated protein was loaded onto an RP-μRPC C2/C18 analytical column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) on a SMART Workstation (Amersham Biosciences). The bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min over an hour. Protein elution was monitored at 280 and 215 nm. Enzymatic Cleavage—Digestion of pyridylethylated protein with Lys-C endopeptidase and trypsin were performed at 37 °C for 20 h. Protein (150 μg) was dissolved in 150 μl of enzymatic digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and proteases were added at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Chemical Cleavage—Digestion of reduced and pyridylethylated protein with formic acid (Asp-specific) was performed as described by Inglis (12.Inglis A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 μg of pyridylethylated protein was dissolved in 2% of formic acid in a glass vial and then frozen at -30 °C. Subsequently, under vacuum, the vial was thawed at room temperature and then sealed off. The vial was then heated at 108 °C for 2 h and allowed to cool to room temperature. Separation of Digested Peptides—The peptides generated by both the enzymatic and chemical digestions were fractionated using RP-μRPC C2/C18 analytical column on a SMART Workstation using a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over an hour. The elution of peptides was monitored at 215 and 280 nm. Molecular Mass Determination—ESI/MS was used to determine the precise masses and purity (± 0.01%) of both the native protein and peptides. The RP-HPLC fractions were directly injected into the API300 LC/MS/MS system mass spectrometer. Ionspray, orifice, and ring voltages were set at 4,600 V, 50 V, and 350 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as curtain gas with a flow rate of 0.6 liters/min and as nebulizer gas with a pressure setting of 100 psi. The mass was determined by direct injection at a flow rate of 50 μl/min using the LC-10AD Shimadzu Liquid Chromatography pump as solvent delivery system (40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). BioMultiview software was used to analyze and deconvolute the raw mass spectrum. N-terminal Sequencing—N-terminal sequencing of the native and digested peptides were performed by automated Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems 494 pulsed-liquid phase protein sequencer (Procise) with an on-line 785A PTH-derivative amino acid analyzer. The PTH-derivative amino acids were then sequentially identified by mapping the respective separation profiles with the standard chromatogram. Methods for Protein Administration—The volume injected via intraperitoneal route was 200 μl, and the protein was dissolved in water. The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection was made in a volume of 2 μl through a puncture point at 1.5-mm lateral and 1.0-mm posterior to bregma using a 10 μl of luer-tip Hamilton microsyringe with a modified needle so as to penetrate 2 mm from the top of the skull (13.Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 1st Ed. Elsevier Science, New York2004Google Scholar). The protein for i.c.v. injection was dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The needle was rotated on withdrawal. These two administration methods were used for the locomotor activity and hot plate experiments. In Vivo Toxicity Test—Native protein was injected intraperitoneal into the mice at doses of 0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg (n = 2). After injection, behavioral observations on the mice were recorded every 15 min for up to 6 h. Animals were sacrificed after 24 h, and postmortem examination was performed. Locomotor Activity—Locomotor activity of the mice was measured by an NS-AS01 activity monitoring system (Neuroscience, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), which is composed of an infrared ray sensor, a signal amplification circuit and a control circuit. Movement of the mice was detected by the infrared ray sensor on the basis of released infrared rays associated with their temperature. Each mouse was removed from its home cage and housed individually in a cage (12 cm × 12 cm × 30 cm) with an 8-channel infrared ray sensors placed over the cages. The cage contained ∼40 ml of sawdust on the floor. Motor activity of eight animals kept in separate cages was measured simultaneously. All movements of a distance of 4 cm or more were detected by the infrared ray sensors and each represented a measure of general mobility of the injected mice. The activity of the animals was assessed by performing a prerun experiment. Animals used for the subsequent experiment had a minimum of 450 counts and a maximum of 850 counts over the first 20 min of the prerun experiment. Active mice were then administered with the protein and placed in the same motor activity monitoring system. Immediately after this, counts of locomotor activity were collected in 10-min intervals for 80 min with a computer-linked analyzing system (AB System-24A, Neuroscience, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Hot Plate Assay—Each mouse was placed on a hot plate (55 °C) and confined using a transparent plastic ring (diameter 12 cm, height 13 cm). The hot plate apparatus was a sealed wooden box with smooth metal surface 15 cm × 15 cm and was heated using a water bath (Model Y22 Grant, Cambridge, UK). The latency time was measured from the time the mouse was gently introduced onto the hot plate to the time when it first showed one of the following responses: jumping, licking, or stamping of a limb, as described by Woolfe and MacDonald (14.Woolfe D. MacDonald A.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1944; 80: 300-307Google Scholar). The hot plate assay was carried out 15 min after drug administration by intraperitoneal or i.c.v. routes. Analysis of Results and Statistics—Changes in locomotor activity were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Hyperalgesic effect induced by ohanin was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. All ANOVAs were followed by post-hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance was indicated when p < 0.05. Design, Assembly, and Cloning of the Synthetic Gene—The full-length synthetic gene comprising of 369 bp was assembled from two fragments, and each fragment was constructed from two overlapping oligonucleotides, ranging from 96 bp to 117 bp, respectively, with an overlapping region of 21 bp enriched with more than 50% GC content to promote specific annealing. Primer 1 (5′-GGAATTCGTCGACGGATCCATGCTAGCCC GCCGGGTAACTGGCAGAAAGCGGACGTCACCTTCGATAGCAACACCGCGTTCGAAAGCCTGGTGGTGAGCCCGGAC-3′) and primer 2 (5′-TCC CCCCGGGCTGCCTAGGACGCACGGGCTCGAGGAGAAGCGTTCCGGGCTATCCGGCACACCTTTCGGCACACCAACGTTTTCCACGGTTTTTTTGTCCGGGCTCACCACCAGGCT-3′) were used to prepare the first fragment; primer 3 (5′-TCCCCCCGGGTTTCCGTTCCGGAAAACACTTCTTCGAGGTGAAATACGGTACCCAGCGTGAATGGGCGGTGGGGCTAGCGGGTAAAAGCGTGAAGCGTAAGGGTTAC-3′) and primer 4 (5′-GACTAGTAAGCTTGCGGCCGCCTACAGCCACCACAGACCTTTCTGCCAGATACGTTCTTCCGCACCAGCCTTAAGTAACCCTTACGCTTCACGCT-3′) were used to prepare the second fragment. (Nucleotides in the above sequences underlined were the flanking sequences for XmaI restriction site.) PCR mixture to generate both the fragments contained a final concentration of 0.3 units of Platinum Taq polymerase, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, and 0.2 μm primers in a total volume of 25 μl. The amplification condition was as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C/1 min; 20 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 55 °C/30 s, 72 °C/1 min; and a final extension of 72 °C/5 min. The two fragments were digested with XmaI and ligated together to obtain the full-length synthetic gene. This ligation product was cloned into pGEMT-easy vector and sequenced. Expression of Recombinant Ohanin—The 369-bp synthetic gene fragment was double-digested by restriction endonucleases BamHI and NotI for cloning into the expression vector. VectorM (a modified version of pET32A) was used to express the synthetic ohanin in E. coli BL21/DE3 strain. The subcloning resulted in an expression of fusion protein consisting of hexahistidine tag at the N-terminal. For expression, a single colony harboring vectorM/ohanin, was inoculated into LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin (Amp) incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 14 h. The overnight culture was inoculated into fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of Amp at 1:50 dilution. Again, the bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm until the culture reached an A600 of ∼0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce the expression and was further incubated at 16 °C and 200 rpm for 16 h before the bacteria were harvested. Bacterial cells were stored at -80 °C until used. The expression of recombinant protein in E. coli was analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) using 15% polyacrylamide gel. The cells expressing the His-tagged fusion protein were thawed for 15 min and lysed using a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme at 4 °C for 15 min followed by mild sonication (six 1-min bursts) with adequate cooling in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). After centrifugation at 16,000 rpm, the pellet containing the inclusion bodies and cell debris was collected and resuspended in binding buffer under denaturing conditions (6 m GdnCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). Purification, Refolding, and Cleavage of the Fusion Protein—The process of dissolution of the pellet was allowed to continue for at least 4 h at 4 °C using binding buffer under denaturing conditions. Cell debris that could not be dissolved by binding buffer was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded into a charged Ni-NTA resin column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. Affinity chromatography was carried out according to manufacturer's guidelines. After washing extensively using wash buffer (10 mm imidazole (IMD), 6 m GdnCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), the bound protein was eluted using minimum volume of elution buffer (250 mm IMD, 6 m GdnCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). Elution and concentration of the fusion protein was monitored at 280 nm. All the following refolding steps were carried out at 4 °C. First, the concentration of the denatured fusion protein was adjusted using the elution buffer to ∼6 mg/ml monitored at 280 nm. Then, 15 mg of the denatured fusion protein (2.5 ml) was diluted slowly in MilliQ water with 5 mm β-ME. MilliQ water containing 5 mm β-ME was delivered using a peristaltic pump (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min into the beaker containing the denatured fusion protein with vigorous stirring until the concentration of GdnCl slowly decreased to 1 m. The diluted unfolded fusion protein was dialyzed for 36 h against 200-fold excess MilliQ water containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, which was changed every 12 h. Lyophilized refolded fusion protein (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in 0.1 m HCl. The solution was flushed with N2 for 3 min prior to the addition of 100:1 molar excess of cyanogen bromide (CNBr) with respect to the Met content. Solutions of CNBr were prepared fresh prior to experiment by dissolving the appropriate amount of solid in 100% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature under darkness for 24 h before subjecting it to RP-HLPC for purification. Measurement of Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectra—The secondary structures of native and recombinant ohanin were measured by recording far-UV CD spectra on a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) witha2mm path-length cell over a wavelength range of 260 to 190 nm at 22 °C. The cuvette chamber was continuously purged with nitrogen before and during the experiments. Measurements for both the native and recombinant protein were made in MilliQ water and average of three scans taken to obtain a good signal to noise ratio. The results were expressed as the mean residue ellipticity (θ)in deg·cm2·dmol−1. The α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil contents were estimated using the method described at www.embl-heidelberg.de/∼andrade/k2d/. Identification of Novel Protein from King Cobra Venom— Crude venom from Ophiophagus hannah (king cobra) was profiled using LC/MS (Fig. 1) to identify new and interesting protein components in the venom. Peptides and proteins detected by LC/MS were organized by retention time (Table I). Proteins eluted after 50 min gave a relatively noisy m/z spectra and hence their molecular masses were not determined. This could be because of the large size of the proteins as well as the glycosylation and other post-translational modifications. Thus, mass profiling of king cobra venom using LC/MS demonstrates a limitation of this technique. With the LC/MS profile, we first searched for proteins with masses that are distinct from that of the well-established toxin families. We identified a protein with a molecular mass of 11951.35 ± 3.92 Da, which was different from any of the established families and hence we decided to carry out further studies on this novel protein.Table IMasses of peptides and proteins detected by LC/MS from king cobra venom25-30 min30-35 min35-40 min40-45 min45-50 min3,571.02 ± 1.42aPeptides and proteins that may belong to new families of venom proteins7,020.03 ± 0.016,324.49 ± 0.727,013.80 ± 1.277,100.02 ± 0.013,936.03 ± 0.04aPeptides and proteins that may belong to new families of venom proteins7,535.67 ± 0.606,339.99 ± 0.017,294.35 ± 2.0710,164.54 ± 0.75aPeptides and proteins that may belong to new families of venom proteins4,123.04 ± 1.44aPeptides and proteins that may belong to new families of venom proteins7,942.00 ± 2.867,013.80 ± 1.277,570.00 ± 1.9824,989.51 ± 2.427,451.34 ± 1.177,944.50 ± 0.677,055.52 ± 0.7011,951.35 ± 3.92aPeptides and proteins that may belong to new families of venom proteins7,941.35 ± 2.327,975.02 ± 1.017,294.35 ± 2.0713,667.48 ± 4.917,306.52 ± 2.1313,682.62 ± 3.477,395.51 ± 0.7313,838.42 ± 2.017,524.34 ± 0.567,557.00 ± 2.677,975.02 ± 1.01a Peptides and proteins that may belong to new families of venom proteins Open table in a new tab Isolation and Purification of the Novel Protein—The novel protein was purified from king cobra venom via a two-step purification procedure. The first step involved the separation of the crude venom using gel filtration chromatography. Because the molecular mass of the novel protein was ∼12 kDa, Superdex 30 (Hiload 16/60) column was selected for gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration of crude venom yielded six major peaks (Fig. 2A). We subjected the first three peaks: peak 1a, 1b, and 2, from gel filtration chromatography to RP-HPLC. Individual fractions from RP-HPLC were assessed using ESI/MS (data not shown). The protein fraction, which eluted at a gradient of 38–40% buffer B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) from peak 1b of gel filtration (Fig. 2B), was found to be homogenous with a molecular mass of 11,951.47 ± 0.67 Da (Fig. 2C). The overall yield of the novel protein was ∼1 mg from 1 g of crude venom. Determination of the Amino Acid Sequence—N-terminal sequencing of the native protein was determined by Edman degradation and it resulted in the identification of the first 40 residues. The N-terminal sequence showed no sequence homology to any of the proteins from known snake toxin families. To complete the sequence, pyridylethylated protein was digested with Lys-C endopeptidase, trypsin, and formic acid. Peptides from the respective digests were separated by reverse phase HPLC (data not shown). Molecular mass and the N-terminal sequences of the purified peptides were obtained to complete the full-length amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A). The sequences of peptides and the entire protein were verified by comparing the calculated and observed masses of the digested peptides (Table II). The observed molecular masses matched well with the calculated molecular masses. The novel protein contains 107 amino acid residues with one free cysteine and no post-translational modifications. We named this novel protein ohanin because it was purified from the venom of king cobra O. hannah.Table IITheoretical and experimentally determined masses of peptides of ohaninMolecular massObservedaMolecular masses determined by ESI/MSCalculatedbMolecular masses calculated from the peptides sequencesDaIntact Ohanin11,951.47 ± 0.6711,951.30Lys-C-digested peptides 1 (64-69)805.67 ± 0.07805.93 2 (39-63)2,656.23 ± 0.872,655.68 3 (70-83)1,535.33 ± 0.131,535.69 4 (89-102)1,786.36 ± 0.211,787.06 5 (9-29)2,270.24 ± 0.302,270.48 6 (29-38)1,070.42 ± 0.031,070.25Trypsin-digested peptides 1 (84-88)616.82 ± 0.25616.75 2 (64-69)805.67 ± 0.07805.91 3 (74-83)929.84 ± 0.50930.50 4 (47-60)1,545.12 ± 0.171,545.62 5 (9-29)2,270.24 ± 0.302,270.44 6 (103-107)673.82 ± 0.08673.79Formic acid-digested peptides 1 (27-41)1,568.09 ± 0.131,569.76 2 (1-13)1,446.00 ± 0.001"

EGF treatment of SHIP2 RNAi cells led to the following: enhanced EGF receptor (EGFR) degradation; increased EGFR ubiquitination; and increased association of EGFR with c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that SHIP2 functions in the maintenance and dynamic remodeling of actin structures as well as in endocytosis, having a major impact on ligand-induced EGFR internalization and degradation.

Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), produced by PI 3′-kinase (PI3K), is an important substrate of SHIP2 (2.Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 3.Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K products are critical second messengers in cell signal transduction pathways involving growth factors (e.g. EGF, vascular endothelial growth factor), hormones (e.g. insulin), and cell-cell (cadherins) and cell-matrix interactions (integrins) (4.Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI lipids interact with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing proteins, leading to their membrane recruitment and/or allosteric activation (5.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Examples of PH domain-containing enzymes include protein kinase B/Akt, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, Tec family tyrosine kinases, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ras and Rho family GTPases (e.g. Sos1 and Vav1). PIP3 is converted to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI-3,4-P2) by SHIP2 action. The role of PI-3,4-P2 in signaling is unclear as some suggest a lack of function for this intermediate perhaps due to its rapid rate of turnover (6.Taylor V. Wong M. Brandts C. Reilly L. Dean N.M. Cowsert L.M. Moodie S. Stokoe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6860-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas some evidence supports that PI-3,4-P2 may have a regulatory role in the signaling pathways because it binds to several PH domain proteins including Akt, which it activates in vitro (7.Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 8.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Moreover, Akt cannot be fully activated by PIP3 when PI-3,4-P2 is absent in vivo (9.Scheid M.P. Huber M. Damen J.E. Hughes M. Kang V. Neilsen P. Prestwich G.D. Krystal G. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9027-9035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition to PIP3, SHIP2 substrates include phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and a soluble inositol phosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakiphosphate, suggesting that SHIP2 may play a role in processes other than PI3K signaling (6.Taylor V.

SHIP2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously (2.Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). SHIP2 is thought to down-regulate insulin signaling (11.Baumgartener J.W. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2003; 3: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The genetic knockout of SHIP2 in mice led to neonatal lethality due to hypoglycemia caused by insulin hypersensitivity (12.Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.F. Behrends J. Pesesse X. Sasaki T. Penninger J. Doherty M. Malaisse W. Dumont J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Erneux C. Hue L. Schurmans S. Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, Clement et al. (12.Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.F. Behrends J. Pesesse X. Sasaki T. Penninger J. Doherty M. Malaisse W. Dumont J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Erneux C. Hue L. Schurmans S. Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) have acknowledged recently that this SHIP2 knock-out mouse strain had inadvertent deletion of the adjacent Phox2a gene. Thus, they were unsure whether the observed insulin hypersensitivity phenotype can be attributed solely to the absence of SHIP2 function (13.Clement S. Krause U. Desmedt F. Tanti J.-F. Behrends J.

However, studies in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes indicate that SHIP2 down-regulates insulin signaling (14.Wada T. Sasaoka T. Funaki M. Hori H. Murakami S. Ishiki M. Haruta T. Asano T. Ogawa W.

The effect of SHIP2 overexpression on Akt activation and cell cycle progression remains contentious, because two reports describe conflicting results (6.Taylor V. Wong M. Brandts C. Reilly L. Dean N.M. Cowsert L.M. Moodie S. Stokoe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6860-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20.Choi Y. Zhang J. Murga C. Yu H. Koller E. Monia B.P. Gutkind J.S. Li W.

Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4204-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) describes a dual role for SHIP2 in vascular smooth muscle cells: 1) an anti-apoptotic function dependent on the SH2 domain; and 2) a growth inhibitory function dependent on the catalytic activity. Thus, the functions of endogenous SHIP2 in different cell types and its role in signaling pathways that are mediated by growth factors, integrins, and cadherins remain poorly understood. SHIP2 contains an amino-terminal SH2 domain, a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region, and a central inositol phosphatase domain. In addition, SHIP2 contains a sterile α-motif domain at the carboxyl terminus and a NPXY motif. Previously, we showed that SHIP2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to treatment of cells with growth factors and insulin and is associated with Shc adaptor protein when treated with EGF and platelet-derived growth factor but not when treated with insulin (22.Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18605-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated an essential role for SHIP2 in adhesion and spreading of HeLa cells and have established a role for Src family tyrosine kinases in the regulation of SHIP2 during cell adhesion and spreading (23.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1416-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Others (25.Dyson J.M. O'Malley C.J. Becanovic J. Munday A.D. Berndt M.C. Coghill I.D. Nandurkar H.H. Ooms L.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have reported a role for SHIP2 in submembrane actin regulation through interaction with an actin-binding protein, filamin. In this report, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the endogenous SHIP2 levels in HeLa cells to further elucidate SHIP2 function. SHIP2 knockdown in these cells caused marked actin abnormalities and cell-spreading defects. Also, alterations in the endocytic vesicular distribution were evident upon SHIP2 silencing, having major impact on the ligand-dependent EGF receptor (EGFR) internalization and degradation pathway. Accordingly, we suggest that, in HeLa cells, SHIP2 functions to regulate actin remodeling and receptor endocytosis, specifically that of EGFR. Materials—For RNAi experiments, single-stranded or duplex RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Research. We obtained RNA Extraction kit from Qiagen, DNA-Free kit and 18 S rRNA primers from Ambion, and RT-PCR first-strand cDNA synthesis kit and high fidelity PCR mixture from Invitrogen. Generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SHIP2 and EGFR were described earlier (22.Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18605-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26.Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to c-Cbl (Cbl), EEA-1, and ubiquitin were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody and TRITC or fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates of phalloidin were from Sigma. We obtained antibody against Akt and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG from Cell Signaling Technologies, rhodamine-tagged EGF and Oregon Green-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from Molecular Probes, and rhodamine-conjugated transferrin from Rockland, Inc. Cell Culture and RNA Interference Experiments—HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293/T cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with high glucose, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and l-glutamine and without sodium pyruvate) containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum. Single-stranded RNA oligomers were annealed for 1 h at 37°C in 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate. Synthetic duplex or laboratory-annealed duplex RNA molecules (50 nm) were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. At the indicated intervals following transfection, cell lysates were routinely assayed for silencing effect by Western blots. Unique SHIP2-targeted oligomers (confirmed through BLAST analyses) contained the following sequences: S2 (nucleotides 2058–2076), 5′-TCA TGG TGT GAC CGG ATT C-3′; S2-a (nucleotides 191–209), 5′-GCA TGT GCA CAC GTA TCG C-3′; and MS2-a, 5′-GCA TGT GTT CAC GTA TCG C-3′ where the underlined nucleotides were mismatches in the sequence S2-a. A sequence (denoted by Ds), 5′-AGC CCA GCC TTC GAT CAA C-3′, with no significant homology to any published gene sequences is used as control. For RT-PCR, total RNA was prepared at the indicated intervals and was rendered free of DNA. First-strand reverse transcription reactions were carried out using random hexamer primers. PCR reactions were carried out using SHIP2-specific primers and high fidelity PCR mixture along with a 1:9 ratio of 18 S rRNA primers. Generation of expression constructs of FLAG-tagged wild type SHIP2 and mutant SHIP2 (R47G and 986YY987FF) were described previously (23.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1416-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of 293/T cells was performed using modified calcium phosphate method (Stratagene) as described previously (23.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1416-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining—F-actin organization was examined by staining the cells with 1 μg/ml F-actin-binding phalloidin (TRITC- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated) for 15 min. Endocytic vesicles were stained with an antibody against EEA1 (1 μg/ml for 60 min) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-Oregon Green (0.75 μg/ml) for 30 min. After three 5-min phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were mounted and fluorescent images were captured using a laser confocal microscope. F-actin staining of spreading cells was done 60 min after freshly plating on type I collagen-coated surfaces (3 μg/cm2). The procedures for harvesting cells and coating plates as well as for fixing, blocking, and washing were all described previously (24.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Preparation of whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitation experiments using Hepes-NaCl-Triton X-100-glycerol buffer as well as protein analyses by SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays were performed as described earlier (24.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Zhou D. Decker S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6929-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conditions for co-immunoprecipitations using low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer were also described previously (24.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNAi-mediated Silencing of SHIP2—To better understand SHIP2 function, we employed RNAi to suppress endogenous SHIP2 levels in HeLa cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes of the sequence specific to SHIP2 (denoted S2′ and S2-a in Figs. 1, 5, 6, and 7) significantly reduced SHIP2 levels at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Among three different sequences tested, two caused easily detectable gene silencing (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Sequence S2 consistently produced a target protein suppression of nearly 70–80%, an efficiency of silencing commonly achieved by this approach (Fig. 1, top and middle panels). Gene knockdown lasted between 70 and 100 h post-transfection in a reproducible and consistent manner as shown with the samples from five independent experiments in Fig. 1B. A duplex siRNA oligomer with two mismatches in the sequence S2-a (depicted as MS2-a in Fig. 1B, bottom panel) was completely inactive. SHIP2 protein levels returned to pre-transfection levels in 6–8 days post-transfection (data not shown). The silencing was evident at concentrations as low as 1 nm specific siRNA duplexes, whereas an siRNA for firefly luciferase (GL3) did not alter SHIP2 protein levels at concentrations of 50 nm (see supplementary data). Data from experiments with S2 siRNA are described below, whereas similar results were also obtained with S2-a siRNA as well (see supplementary data).Fig. 5Altered endocytic vesicular distribution after SHIP2 RNAi.A–F, 48 h after transfection with double-stranded (Ds) control siRNA (panels A, C, and E) or SHIP2-specific siRNA (S2) (panels B, D, and F), cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h.

All of the samples then were treated with rhodamine-tagged EGF (25 ng/ml) for 5 min. Following the washing of cells to remove tagged EGF, cells were chased for the indicated durations (panels A and B, 0 h/no chase; panels C and D, 1 h; and panels E and F, 3 h) in serum-free medium. Cells then were fixed and examined under fluorescence microscope for the distribution of internalized EGF. Panel G, localization of internalized TRITC-conjugated transferrin. Three days post-transfection with indicated 50 nm duplex siRNA oligomers, serum-starved HeLa cells were treated with TRITC-transferrin (5 μg/ml) for 20 min on ice and examined after 30 min of chase in the absence of conjugated transferrin. siRNA oligomers used are as follows: siRNA specific to firefly luciferase (GL3) and two siRNAs specific to SHIP2 (S2 and S2-a) (two fields are shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7A, silencing of SHIP2 enhances ligand-induced EGFR degradation.

Given our earlier findings of an important role for SHIP2 in cell adhesion and spreading events (23.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1416-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we reasoned that we should examine these changes at the level of actin cytoskeleton organization by staining for F-actin. Staining with phalloidin showed profound abnormalities in actin cytoskeleton following SHIP2 knockdown (Fig. 2). In the presence of serum, ∼10–15% SHIP2 RNAi cells displayed long transversely oriented actin filaments or stress fibers along with depletion of submembranous cortical actin (Fig. 2B). A majority of cells (nearly 75%) also presented long filamentous fascicles of actin that protruded at the periphery and at the extremities. These actin filamentous “spikes” became quite prominent (thick arrows), whereas stress fibers disappeared after 24 h of serum starving (Fig. 2D). The weakening of submembranous cortical actin upon suppression of SHIP2 was clearly evident in the absence of stress fibers (thin arrows point to cortical actin in all of the panels; Fig. 2D). Actin abnormalities were induced by SHIP2-specific siRNAs at low concentrations (10 nm), whereas the siRNA for luciferase (GL3) did not cause overt defects in the actin cytoskeleton (see supplementary data). Rho family small G proteins are central regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Important among them are RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Together, these enzymes play a coordinated role in cell migration process (28.Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). F-actin spikes and spreading defects are commonly observed in experimental dysfunction of one or more of these proteins in vitro (29.Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Stress fibers are induced by activated Rho A, whereas actin spikes are formed upon activation of Rac1 or Cdc42. Formation of lamellipodia is determined by the actions of PI3K and Rac1. Therefore, morphological changes seen after SHIP2 silencing suggest that SHIP2 may regulate coordinated functioning of Rho family members. We tested this notion by expressing dominant negative (d.n.) forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 in SHIP2 RNAi cells (a gift from Dr. A. Hall, University College, London, United Kingdom). Expression of d.n. Rac1 reduced the severity of F-actin deformities to a large extent in nearly 90% of the cells, whereas d.n. Cdc42 was somewhat less effective in this assay, which rescued the actin abnormalities in ∼40% cells (Fig. 2E). In control cells (transfected with Ds siRNA), expression of d.n. Rac1 caused no overt phenotypic change with the exception of a modest decrease in the F-actin network (data not shown). In HeLa cells, a phosphatase-inactive mutant of SHIP2 prevents cell spreading and mutations of the tyrosines in the NPXYY motif of SHIP2 disrupts lamellipodia extension on collagen I (23.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1416-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24.Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether suppression of SHIP2 similarly affected the spreading ability of HeLa cells. Fig. 3 depicts an experiment where control or SHIP2 siRNA-transfected cells were allowed to spread on type I collagen for 60 min. Although there were no significant differences between control and SHIP2 RNAi in the number of cells attached to the collagen-coated surface, striking actin deformities and spreading defects were seen following SHIP2 silencing. After SHIP2 RNAi, newly spreading cells showed a lack of formation of “focal contacts” (also called “contact points,” initial transitory structures formed upon cell contact with matrix proteins; see thin arrows in control cells in panel A) and failed to extend lamellipodia (see thick arrows in control cells in panel A). Instead, SHIP2 RNAi cells displayed numerous long membrane protrusions capped at their extremities by a fascicle of actin filaments. As many as 65–70% SHIP2 RNAi cells displayed these actin deformities. The cells maintained this phenotype for as long as 3 h after plating and eventually were able to spread but with a somewhat distorted morphology. Together, these results demonstrate an essential function for SHIP2 in the maintenance and dynamic remodeling of actin structures in HeLa cells. Cytoplasmic Vesicles following SHIP2 Silencing—Another striking feature of cells undergoing silencing of SHIP2 via RNAi was the accumulation of phase-bright cytoplasmic vesicular structures, indicative of disruption of vesicular trafficking (Fig. 4). These vesicles were easily detected in the perinuclear area in <10% cells (Fig. 4, middle panel, denoted by the arrow). Serum starvation did not cause significant alteration in these vesicles; but treatment with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 24 h markedly enhanced the extent of vesicular accumulation in some cells and increased the total number of cells displaying the phenotype as well (Fig. 4, bottom panel, denoted by the arrow). Some but not all of these enlarged vesicles were positive for the early endosome marker, EEA1, whereas markers for late endosomes and the lysosomes (LAMP1, LysoTracker dye, respectively) failed to co-localize to these enlarged vesicles (data not shown). Interestingly, after SHIP2 knockdown, endocytic vesicles identified by the presence of EEA1 markedly differed in their size and the distribution when compared with the control cells (Fig. 5). EEA1-positive vesicles appeared significantly larger than those in control cells and were distributed randomly in the cytoplasm of SHIP2 siRNA-transfected cells, in contrast to the perinuclear accumulations seen in a majority of control cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Increased numbers of small (pin-point) EEA1-positive vesicles were seen in the peripheral cytoplasm of SHIP2 RNAi cells immediately after treatment with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 5 min (Fig. 5D). Control cells displayed similar changes in response to EGF but to a reduced extent (Fig. 5C). EEA1-positive vesicles remained distributed in the cytoplasm in nearly 50–60% SHIP2 RNAi cells, whereas these vesicles re-accumulated at the perinuclear region in control cells when treated for 30 min with EGF (Fig. 5, E and F).

https://openalex.org/W1979856683,"Many lines of evidence suggest an interaction between glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and the PrP proteins as well as a possible role for GAGs in prion disease pathogenesis. In this work, we sought to determine whether the PrP-GAG interaction affects the incorporation of PrPSc (the scrapie isoform of PrP) to normal cells. This may be the first step in prion disease pathogenesis. To this effect, we incubated proteinase K-digested hamster scrapie brain homogenates with several lines of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the presence or absence of heparin. Our results show that over a large range of PrPSc concentrations the binding of PrPSc to wild type CHO cells, which do not express detectable PrP, was equivalent to the binding of PrPSc to CHO cells overexpressing PrP. A significant part of PrPSc binding to both lines could be inhibited by heparin. Additional evidence that PrPSc binding to cells was dependent on the presence of GAGs could be concluded from the fact that the binding of PrPSc to CHO cells missing GAGs on the cell surface was significantly reduced. Interestingly, preincubation of scrapie brain homogenate with heparin before intraperitoneal inoculation into normal hamsters resulted in a significant delay in prion disease manifestation.

During prion disease, an abnormal protease-resistant isoform of cellular PrP (PrPC), 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular PrP; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of PrP; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; wt, wild type; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PK, proteinase K; mAb, monoclonal antibody; XT, xylosyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PrPC, cellular PrP; PrPSc, scrapie isoform of PrP; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; wt, wild type; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PK, proteinase K; mAb, monoclonal antibody; XT, xylosyltransferase. denominated PrPSc, which is considered to be the major component of the prion, accumulates in the central nervous system (1DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Clin. Lab. Med. 2003; 23: 1-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that β-sheet-rich PrPSc is produced from mostly α-helical PrPC by a conformational-dependent conversion process (2May B.C. Govaerts C. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 162-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the detailed steps of such conversion as well as the mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis leading to death from prion disease are as yet unknown, the absolute requirement of endogenous PrPC in prion disease pathogenesis has been solidly demonstrated (3Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar).Studies in transgenic mice suggest that a host factor, designated protein X, is involved in the conversion of the normal cellular prion protein, PrPC, into the scrapie isoform, PrPSc (4Telling G.C.

Consequently, considerable effort has been devoted to the identification of natural receptors for the prion proteins, both to understand the prion pathogenesis process and to reveal potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Among the proteins that were shown to bind PrPC were amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (5Yehiely F. Bamborough P. Da Costa M. Perry B.J. Thinakaran G. Cohen F.E. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 339-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), stress-induced proteins, and the laminin receptors (6Tatzelt J. Voellmy R. Welch W.J. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Gauczynski S. Peyrin J.M. Haik S. Leucht C. Hundt C. Rieger R. Krasemann S. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5863-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Interestingly, antibodies to laminin receptors were shown to reduce the accumulation of PrPSc in ScN2a cells (8Leucht C. Simoneau S. Rey C. Vana K. Rieger R. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both PrP and laminin receptors have been shown to interact with glycosaminoglycans (GAGS), and especially with heparan sulfate (HS), supporting the possibility that these sugar polymers function as possible cofactors for 37-kDa laminin receptors mediating PrP binding (9Hundt C. Peyrin J.M. Haik S. Gauczynski S. Leucht C. Rieger R. Riley M.L. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5876-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).In addition to PrPC, GAGs are by far the most important host molecules connected so far to prion pathogenesis and to the metabolism of the prion proteins (10Diaz-Nido J. Wandosell F. Avila J. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). HS accumulates in cerebral prion amyloid plaques as it does in Alzheimer disease or other amyloidotic diseases (11Elimova E. Kisilevsky R. Szarek W.A. Ancsin J.B. FASEB J. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar, 12Snow A.D. Wight T.N. Nochlin D. Koike Y. Kimata K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lab. Investig. 1990; 63: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar). Also, addition of HS promotes the reconstitution of infectivity of dimethyl sulfoxide-solubilized PrPSc (13Shaked G.M. Meiner Z. Avraham I. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14324-14328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, several lines of evidences connect GAGs, and especially HS, to the metabolism of the PrP isoforms as well as to the accumulation of PrPSc in prion-infected cells. A variety of sulfated glycans, such as low molecular weight heparin (14Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suramin (15Ladogana A. Casaccia P. Ingrosso L. Cibati M. Salvatore M. Xi Y.G. Masullo C. Pocchiari M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73 (Pt. 3): 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), pentosan polysulfate, and dextran sulfate (16Ehlers B. Diringer H. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65 (Pt. 8): 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were shown to reduce the accumulation of PrPSc in ScN2a cells and in some cases prolong the incubation time of experimental prion diseases. In addition, long-term incubation of Scn2a cells with chlorate, which affects the sulfation of GAGs as well as of proteins and glycolipids, reduces PrPSc accumulation (14Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Finally, ScN2a cells treated with heparinase III showed a significant decrease in PrPSc accumulation (18Ben-Zaken O. Tzaban S. Tal Y. Horonchik L. Esko J.D. Vlodavsky I. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In this work, we investigated whether endogenous GAGs play a role in the first step of prion disease pathogenesis, i.e. the binding of PrPSc, the main if not the only prion component, to normal cells. We show here that, over a wide range of PrPSc concentrations, the binding of PrPSc to mutant cells in which expression of total GAGs or only HS was abolished was significantly reduced when compared with PrPSc binding to wt Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or to CHO cells overexpressing PrP. Most of this binding resulted in the internalization of PrPSc to the cells as can be seen by the fact that only a small part of PrPSc was bound to the cells at 4 °C. PrPSc binding to both wt CHO or to CHO cells overexpressing PrP was significantly inhibited when the cells were preincubated either with heparin or with copper. Because PrPSc is an insoluble molecule, it is unclear whether it binds directly to the GAGs on the cell surface or through some closely associated molecule.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHeparin, polyaspartic acid, and heparin-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Cell culture media and serum were purchased from Beit Haemek, Biological Industries.Cell Culture—Several cell lines were used: 1) wt CHO cells, 2) mutant CHO cells lacking xylosyltransferase (XT–/–), incapable of initiating the synthesis of both HS and chondroitin sulfate chains, or 3) CHO cells lacking glucuronic acid/N-acetylgalactosaminetransferase (HS–/–), selectively deficient for HS (19Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and 4) CHO cells transfected with a chimeric mouse hamster PrP, denominated MHM2 PrP (20Scott M.R. Kohler R. Foster D. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 986-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21Yanai A. Meiner Z. Gahali I. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in Hams F12 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). CHO MHM2 PrP cells were maintained by the addition of 1 mg/ml geneticin to the cell culture medium.Preparation of Scrapie Brain Homogenates—Normal or scrapie-infected hamster brains were homogenized in 10% (wt/v) cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, and 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g (2000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were frozen in aliquots for future experiments.Binding Experiments—Binding experiments were performed as reported previously (22Hijazi N. Shaked Y. Rosenmann H. Ben-Hur T. Gabizon R. Brain Res. 2003; 993: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, after reaching 80% of confluence in 25-cm2 flasks, cells were preincubated with Hams F12 medium supplemented with or without 4 mg/ml heparin for 2 h at 37°C. After the preincubation, PK-digested (40 μg/ml PK for 30 min at 37 °) scrapie hamster brain homogenate at the different concentrations used was added for each flask to the designated flasks for an additional 2 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed four times with medium and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lyzed in 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4,100 mm Nacl, 1% Nonidet P-40. PrP proteins were detected by immunoblotting with αPrP mAb 3F4, RO73, or D13 (Inpro) when required.Binding of Brain Homogenates to Heparin-Agarose—Equal amounts of total protein (0.37 mg) from normal or scrapie hamster brain homogenate digested with PK (40 μg/ml PK for 30 min at 37 °), were incubated for 1 h with 25 or 50 μg/ml of heparin or with 50 μg/ml polyaspartic acid or with no additions. Subsequently, the different aliquots were incubated with heparin-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 ° before washing the beads five times with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 100 mm Nacl, 1%Nonidet P-40. Beads were boiled in SDS to elute bound material that was then immunoblotted with αPrP mAb 3F4.In Vivo Experiments—Syrian hamsters (six animals in each group) at the age of 4 weeks were inoculated intraperitoneally (IP) with 100 μl (0.1%) of brain homogenate from either normal or scrapie-infected animals that were preincubated with or without heparin (2 or 4 mg/ml) for 2 h before injection. Animals were followed closely through the incubation time and sacrificed when showing distinct scrapie symptoms.RESULTSThe Binding of PrPSc to CHO Cells Is GAGs-dependent and PrPC-independent—Because PrPSc can only be purified as an insoluble aggregate, which may not exist as such in vivo, we used PK-digested scrapie brain homogenate from Syrian hamster brains for our binding experiments. In this context, PrPSc may be associated to components of membrane rafts (23Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, we should be aware that the binding of PrPSc to cells or heparin resins (see below) may be either direct or occur through other molecules. We have shown before (22Hijazi N. Shaked Y. Rosenmann H. Ben-Hur T. Gabizon R. Brain Res. 2003; 993: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that this preparation can be used to study PrPSc binding and internalization to cells. To determine the concentration of PK-resistant PrP in these preparations, we immunoblotted serial dilutions of the PK-treated brain homogenates as well as serial dilutions of purified recombinant hamster PrP and compared the appropriate bands (Fig. 1a). Recombinant Syria hamster (SHa)PrP (23Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar–232) was produced as insoluble inclusion bodies, purified, and refolded as previously described (24Gonzalez-Iglesias R. Pajares M.A. Ocal C. Espinosa J.C. Oesch B. Gasset M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1a, 1 μg of purified recombinant PrP represents the PrPSc present in ∼45 μg of total brain homogenate (after digestion with PK).To examine the role of PrPC and cellular GAGs on the binding of PrPSc to cells, we incubated PK-digested Syrian hamster scrapie brain homogenate (comprising ∼7.5 μg of PrPSc) with several types of CHO cells. These include wt CHO cells, which have been shown previously not to express detectable levels of endogenous Chinese hamster PrP (25Peters P.J. Mironov Jr., A. Peretz D. van Donselaar E. Leclerc E. Erpel S. DeArmond S.J. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. Vey M. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 703-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) as well as CHO cells overexpressing MHM2 PrP (21Yanai A. Meiner Z. Gahali I. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, we used CHO (XT–/–) and (HS–/–) mutant cells, which do not express chondroitin sulfate and HS or only HS, respectively (for explanation on mutant CHO cells, see “Experimental Procedures”) (19Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1b, only the extract of CHO-MHM2 PrP cells reacted with the 3f4 antibody. Similar results were obtained with other αPrP antibodies known to react with Chinese hamster PrP (not shown).Following incubation with the scrapie brain homogenate (see “Experimental Procedures”), cells were extracted, digested with PK, and immunoblotted with αPrP mAb 3F4 to assess the binding of PrPSc to the diverse cells. Regardless of the big difference in PrPC expression, similar concentrations of PrPSc were bound to both wt and MHM2 CHO cells (Fig. 1b, III). Contrary to the extensive binding of PrPSc to wt CHO cells, PrPSc binding to both mutant lines, lacking only HS or total GAGs, was very poor. These results suggest that the initial binding of PrPSc to CHO cells is independent of PrPC concentration but dependent on the presence of GAGs, and especially HS, on the cell surface.As opposed to PK-resistant PrP from either mouse or human, PK-resistant hamster PrP always shows a predominant band representing fully glycosylated PrP. As can be seen in the figures throughout this report, this pattern did not change after the binding of the scrapie protein to cells or heparin beads, indicating there was no preference for any glycosylated isoform. Similar results were obtained for PK-resistant mouse PrP (not shown).Heparin Inhibits the Binding of PrPSc to CHO Cells—To further assess the interaction of PrPSc with GAGs on the cell surface, we examined the effect of heparin (a naturally occurring analog of HS) on the binding of PrPSc to wt and mutant CHO cells. To this effect, cells were cultured in the presence of heparin for 2 h before the addition of PK-digested brain homogenate, as described above. Fig. 1b, IV, shows that heparin inhibited most of the PrPSc binding to wt and MHM2 PrP CHO cells but had no effect on the residual binding of PrPSc to HS–/– or XT–/– cells. These results suggest that PrPSc or a molecule closely associated with PrPSc may bind directly to cell-associated HS and that soluble heparin inhibits this interaction in a competitive manner. Moreover, Fig. 1b, IV, shows that heparin inhibited the binding of PrPSc to wt and PrP-overexpressing CHO cells to the same extent, consistent with the possibility that the presence of PrPC is not required for the heparin-dependent binding of PrPSc to cells. Heparin also inhibited the binding of PrPSc to neuroblastoma cells (not shown), which have been shown to support prion replication (26Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The Association of PrPSc with Cells Is Concentration- and Temperature-dependent—To test further the specificity of the PrPSc-GAG interaction on the cell surface, we performed the same binding experiments described in the previous section at several concentrations of PrPSc (as present in brain homogenate). To this effect, different concentrations of homogenate were added to the four lines of CHO cells described above, with and without preincubation of the cells with heparin. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, in the absence of heparin, PrPSc binding to wt CHO or to MHM2 CHO cells increased with the increasing concentration of homogenate until reaching saturation at about 45 μgofPrPSc (see also Fig. 2b). In the cells in which either HS or total GAGs were absent, the binding of PrPSc also increased with homogenate concentration but at a much lower rate. When heparin was added to the cells in culture before the scrapie homogenate, the binding of PrPSc was very similar in all four CHO cell lines regardless of the presence of either PrP or GAGs. These results suggest that at high PrPSc concentrations, PrPSc can bind to cells by a GAG-independent mechanism, the nature of which remains to be determined.Fig. 2a, the binding of PrPSc to different CHO cells is concentration-dependent. wt, XT–/–, HS–/–, and MHM2 PrP CHO cells were incubated as described at 37 °C with different concentrations of PK-resistant PrP in the presence or absence of 4 mg/ml heparin. The concentration of PrPSc added to cells was calculated by comparing with the signal obtained by serial dilutions of recombinant PrP. b, PrPSc binding to wt CHO cells is temperature-dependent. wt CHO cells were incubated with different concentrations of PK-digested scrapie hamster homogenate in the presence or absence of heparin at both 4 or 37 °C. Samples were processed as described and immunoblotted. The amounts of PrPSc added and bound to cells were calculated by comparing to serial dilutions of purified recombinant hamster PrP.

Kuo A. Rosenfeld L. Kariko K. Leski M. Robbiati F. Nolli M.L. Henkin J. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2865-2872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brunschede G.Y. Brown M.S. Cell. 1976; 7: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cells were processed as described in the previous experiments. Concentrations of added or bound PrPSc were calculated by comparing PK-resistant PrP bands on gels with serial dilutions of recombinant PrP (Fig. 1a). Because the amount of PrPSc associated with the cells at 4 °C at a range of PrPSc concentrations was very low (Fig. 2b), we conclude most of the PrPSc was rapidly internalized into the CHO cells. As suggested from the results in Fig. 2a, although heparin (at 37 °C) inhibited very strongly the incorporation of PrPSc to cells at low PrPSc concentrations, it was less efficient in higher PrPSc concentrations, when the binding of PrPSc reached saturation. This suggests the existence of a low affinity mechanism for PrPSc incorporation into cells that is GAG-independent. The internalization of PrPSc into CHO cells was also shown by immunocytochemistry methods to be inhibited by heparin-like reagents (29Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Gabizon R. Papy-Garcia D. Barritault D. Taraboulos A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The results in Fig. 2b may suggest heparin inhibited the binding of PrPSc to cells at 4 °C, indicating sulfated sugars may affect not only the internalization of PrPSc but also the initial binding of PrPSc to the CHO cells. However, because of the low binding of PrPSc to all CHO cells at this temperature, the results were not significant enough to assure this conclusion.PrPSc Binds to Immobilized Heparin—Although the binding of PrPC to heparin has been shown previously, this is not the case for PrPSc (14Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To this effect, we tested whether the protease-resistant core of PrPSc present in our protease-digested scrapie brain homogenate can bind to heparin-agarose. Homogenates from normal or scrapie-infected hamster brains were incubated in the presence of heparin-agarose, washed extensively, and boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer before immunoblotting with anti-PrP mAb 3F4 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3 depicts the results of such an experiment. Both PrPSc and PrPC bind to heparin specifically because this binding activity could be abolished when the incubation of the homogenates with the beads was performed in the presence of soluble heparin. As opposed to soluble heparin, polyaspartic acid, another negatively charged polymer, did not inhibit PrPSc or PrPC binding to heparin-agarose. As stated above, although these results are consistent with the possibility that PrPSc binds directly to heparin molecules, the insoluble nature of PrPSc prevents us from claiming a direct binding between PrPSc and any other molecule.Fig. 3Both PrPC and PrPSc bind to heparin-agarose. Normal or PK-digested scrapie brain homogenate was incubated with heparin beads following preincubation of the samples with 0, 25, or 50 μg/ml heparin or 50 μg/ml polyaspartic acid. Following extensive washing of the beads, they were boiled in SDS buffer and the eluents immunoblotted with mAb 3F4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Copper Also Inhibits the Binding of PrPSc to Cells in the Absence of PrPC—In a previous report (22Hijazi N. Shaked Y. Rosenmann H. Ben-Hur T. Gabizon R. Brain Res. 2003; 993: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we showed that the binding of PrPSc to N2a cells was inhibited when N2a cells were first cultured in the presence of copper ions, which have been shown to bind to PrPC. Incubation of such cells with copper resulted in increased accumulation of PrPC, probably because of its internalization and delayed degradation. We speculated at the time that the inhibition by copper of PrPSc binding to N2a cells may result from the absence of PrPC or another copper-internalized molecule from the cell surface. To test whether the presence of PrPC is required for copper to inhibit the binding of PrPSc to cells, we cultured wt and MHM2 PrP CHO cells in the presence or absence of 300 μm copper for 24 h (Fig. 4) and subsequently added PK-digested scrapie brain homogenate to the cell culture as described above. Fig. 3 shows the results of such an experiment. As was shown for N2a cells (22Hijazi N. Shaked Y. Rosenmann H. Ben-Hur T. Gabizon R. Brain Res. 2003; 993: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the concentration of PrPC in the presence of copper was largely increased in the MHM2 CHO cells (Fig. 4a), PrPSc binding was inhibited in a similar manner in both cell lines regardless of the presence of detectable PrPC on the cell surface. These results indicate that the copper-related inhibition of PrPSc binding to cells may not result only from the binding of copper to PrPC but rather from the binding of copper to cell surface GAGs, which have shown here to be essential for PrPSc binding to cells. It has been suggested previously that the formation of PrP-Cu(II)-glycosaminoglycan assemblies may be crucial entities in the metabolism of PrP (24Gonzalez-Iglesias R. Pajares M.A. Ocal C. Espinosa J.C. Oesch B. Gasset M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Preincubation with copper ions inhibited PrPSc binding to wt and MHM2 PrP CHO cells.a, wt and MHM2 PrP CHO cells were cultured in the presence and absence of 300 μm copper for 24 h. Cells were extracted and immunoblotted with mAb 3F4. b, cells as in panel a were incubated with scrapie brain homogenates for 2 h as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” After washing, cells were extracted, digested with PK, and immunoblotted with mAb 3F4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Incubation of Heparin with Prion Inoculum Delays Disease Onset in Hamsters—To test whether heparin can delay prion disease onset by inhibiting binding of PrPSc to its targets in vivo, we incubated normal or PK-digested scrapie brain homogenate in phosphate-buffered saline alone or in phosphate-buffered saline containing heparin (2 or 4 mg/ml) for 2 h before intraperitoneal inoculation to normal hamsters (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Incubation of prion inoculum with heparin increased prion disease incubation time. PK-digested scrapie brain homogenate was incubated with 0, 2, or 4 mg/ml heparin before intraperitoneal inoculation to hamsters. The bars measure incubation time to disease symptoms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Administration of normal brain homogenates in the presence or absence of heparin did not produce any adverse effects in any of the animals. Because none of the control animals developed prion disease even after long incubation times, this experiment also shows that incubation of PrPC with heparin at the present conditions did not convert PrPC into PrPSc. Preincubation of scrapie brain homogenate with heparin did delay incubation time significantly in both concentrations of heparin used. Together with our in vitro experiments, these results are consistent with the possibility that heparin delayed prion disease onset via the inhibition of PrPSc binding to GAGs on the cell surface. However, because of the complexity of in vivo mechanisms, it is not possible to conclude at this point whether this is the only or major function of heparin as an anti-prion agent.DISCUSSIONMany lines of evidence lead to the conclusion that PrPSc is the major, if not the only, component of the prion. Recently, a new and most awaited result has been provided by the Prusiner laboratory, indicating that an amyloid form of β-sheet recombinant PrP is enough to produce transmissible prion disease when inoculated to mice overexpressing PrPC (31Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). However, the molecules with which PrPSc approaches its cell targets and subsequently causes conversion of PrPC and neurodegeneration have yet to be elucidated.The results presented in this report suggest that GAGs may be the main, if not the only, receptor for PrPSc on the cell surface. The binding of PrPSc to cells was independent from the presence of GAGs only at high concentrations of the prion protein, which were much higher than required to produce minimum incubation time.

We identified the signaling pathways and promoter elements involved in regulation of versican expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, significantly decreased versican-luciferase (Luc) promoter activity and endogenous mRNA levels. We further examined the roles of protein kinase B and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in the regulation of versican transcription.

Software analysis of the versican promoter revealed two potential binding sites for T-cell factors (TCFs), proteins that confer transcriptional activation of β-catenin. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays revealed specific binding of human TCF-4 and β-catenin to oligonucleotides corresponding to a potential TCF binding site in the versican promoter. In addition to binding assays, we directly assessed the dependence of versican promoter activity on TCF binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of the TCF site located -492 bp relative to the transcription start site markedly diminished versican-Luc activity. Co-transfection of TCF-4 with versican-Luc did not increase promoter activity, but addition of β-catenin and TCF-4 significantly stimulated basal versican promoter activity.

Versican is generally considered to be pro-atherogenic because of its ability to trap cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (4.Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Genomics. 1995; 29: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The human and murine genes prove to be remarkably conserved in genomic organization. Both versican genes extend for ∼90 kb and contain 15 exons that align in an identical manner with the protein sub-domains. Naso et al. (9.Naso M.F. Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32999-33008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that the human versican gene has one transcription start site. Meanwhile, sequence analysis reveals potential binding sites for several transcription factors in addition to the TATA box. Transient expression assays of reporter constructs driven by an 876-bp (-632/+240 relative to the transcriptional start site) piece of the versican promoter in HeLa cells and IMR-90 embryonic lung fibroblasts have shown significant expression. These results indicate that the human versican 5′-flanking sequence contains promoter and enhancer elements able to drive reporter gene expression in cells derived from epithelial or mesenchymal tissues (9.Naso M.F. Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32999-33008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various growth factors and mediators influence the expression of versican. Studies using arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) have demonstrated that transforming growth factor β1 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB increase versican mRNA levels, core protein synthesis, and glycosaminoglycan chain length (11.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, normal human gingival fibroblasts respond to treatment with either transforming growth factor β or PDGF-BB by increasing versican mRNA levels (12.Kahari V.M. Larjava H. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Haase H.R. Clarkson R.W. Waters M.J. Bartold P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β appears to decrease the synthesis of this PG in human gingival fibroblasts and arterial SMCs (14.Qwarnstrom E.E. Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Ostberg C.O. Sandell L.J. Page R.C. Wight T.N. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Data from recent investigations suggest that versican synthesis by mesanchymal cells can be regulated by physical stimuli, including cell density and mechanical strain (15.Lee R.T. Yamamoto C. Feng Y. Potter-Perigo S. Briggs W.H. Landschulz K.T. Turi T.G. Thompson J.F. Libby P. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13847-13851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments using monkey arterial SMCs have shown that PDGF-BB stimulates versican core protein expression; this signaling apparently occurs through a receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent, protein kinase C-independent pathway (16.Schonherr E. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II-mediated stimulation of SMC versican expression is regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent tyrosine kinase pathways (17.Shimizu-Hirota R. Sasamura H. Mifune M. Nakaya H. Kuroda M. Hayashi M. Saruta T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2609-2615PubMed Google Scholar). The canonical Wnt-wingless signaling pathway regulates various biologic processes including early embryogenesis and neoplasia by increasing the stability and transcriptional activity of a key mediator, β-catenin (18.Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Taipale J. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 20.Korswagen H.C. Clevers H.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt ligand, GSK-3 promotes the phosphorylation of β-catenin at key serine/threonine residues, targeting it for degradation through the ubiquitin-ligase pathway (21.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). In response to Wnt, the GSK-3-binding protein inhibits GSK-3 activity (22.Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32475-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Some growth factors can regulate GSK-3 activity by mediating its phosphorylation at serine 9 independent of Wnt ligand. Although serine 9 phosphorylation of GSK-3 is associated with its inactivation, Wnt ligand does not necessarily regulate this phosphorylation (23.Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). GSK-3 inactivation leads to β-catenin stabilization and translocation into the nucleus, where it binds to T-cell factor(TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) family proteins to form a transcription factor complex that activates target genes such as the matrix metalloproteinase-7, fibronectin, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclin D1, and c-myc (24.Goodwin A.M. D'Amore P.A. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A variety of mitogenic stimuli including Wnts, insulin, epidermal growth factor, and PDGF result in catalytic inactivation of GSK-3. The catalytic inactivation of GSK-3 induced by most polypeptide mitogens is reversible by treatment with serine/threonine-specific phosphates (25.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The inactivation event has been demonstrated to be due to phosphorylation of serine 21 and serine 9 of GSK-3α and GSK-3β, respectively (26.Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 27.Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 28.Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These residues are specific targets for several protein-serine kinases, including PKB, pp90rsk, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (29.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar, 30.Fang X. Yu S.X. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The inactivating biochemical consequence of phosphorylation by all three enzymes is identical; what differs is the initiating signal. Thus, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (usually via receptor tyrosine kinase activation) results in stimulation of PKB. Inactivation of GSK-3 in response to many mitogens can be inhibited by antagonists of PI3K such as LY294002 inhibitor (25.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are all independent of Wnt-induced regulation of GSK-3. Most protein kinases are induced by cellular stimuli, whereas GSK-3 is shut down. In addition, the enzyme has a broad variety of target proteins, most of which are inactivated by phosphorylation of GSK-3. Thus, inhibition of this one enzyme will tend to induce the functions of a diverse array of targets including transcription factors and other regulatory molecules (31.Hardt S.E. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of versican in vascular pathophysiology, the function and regulation of expression of this versatile molecule in vitro and in vivo are unknown. Our results suggest that a signaling molecule activated by 3-phosphoinositides, namely PKB, plays a critical role in serum-stimulated versican transcription. Furthermore, we provide evidence that phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3β by PKB and subsequent activation of the β-catenin-TCF complex are essential for transcription from the versican promoter. Isolation and Primary Culture of Rat Aortic SMCs—A rat aortic SMC culture was established by a modification of the enzymatic dispersion technique (32.Thyberg J. Int. Rev.

Briefly, four adult male Fisher rats (275–350 g) were euthanized in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. The thoracic aorta was removed and immediately washed in MCDB-131 medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Enzyme I (0.5 mg/ml collagenase II; Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) was applied to the exposed media, and the tissue was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to loosen the media from the underlying adventitia. Medial strips were removed with sterile forceps, taking care not to reach the adventitial layer, transferred to a 35-mm tissue culture dish containing 500 μl of Enzyme II (0.5 mg/ml collagenase II, 0.2 mg/ml elastase; Worthington Biochemical Corp.), and minced. Medial tissue from the aortas of all four rats was pooled, additional Enzyme II solution was added to the dish, and the tissue was incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h with pipetting at regular intervals to disperse cells. Liberated cells were subsequently pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml of MCDB-131 containing 20% newborn calf serum, and seeded into a 35-mm tissue culture dish. Cells were grown to confluence, released by trypsinization, and subcultured at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2 in MCDB-131 supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. Cell Culture—Rat vascular SMCs were maintained in MCDB-131 plus 5% newborn calf serum as described previously in a controlled atmosphere of air-CO2 (5%) at 37 °C until confluence (6–7 days). Confluent SMCs at passages 4–8 were used for experiments. Human prostate cancer PC3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2.

Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32999-33008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generated by PCR from human genomic DNA with the appropriate sets of primers (available upon request). These inserts were cloned into a pGL3 basic vector (Promega) by standard molecular biology techniques and called wt-versican-Luc and -438del-versican-Luc as depicted in Fig. 5A. The putative TCF binding sites (TCCCTTTGATGG and TTCTTTGCTGAT at positions -546 and -492 bp, respectively) contained in the wt-versican-Luc were mutated as denoted in Fig. 5A by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene as described previously (35.Yeung L.H. Read J.T. Sorenson P. Nelson C.C. Gleave M. Jia W. Rennie P.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 843-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated inserts were generated by PCR and then inserted into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-Basic. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Plasmid Constructs—The DN-PKB (Upstate Biotechnology), CA-PKB (Upstate Biotechnology), and empty vector control were used in transient and stable transfection of SMCs and HeLa cells, respectively. The cDNAs for wild-type PTEN (wt-PTEN) and its mutant (mut-PTEN) were kindly provided by J. Dixon (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, CA) and subcloned into pXJ41-neo expression vector kindly provided by C. Pallen (Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). A dominant stable β-catenin construct was a kind gift of B. Gumbiner (Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). The expression vectors TCF-1E and TCF-4E harboring the wild-type human TCF-4 gene and chimeric TCF-1 construct lacking C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) structural domain, respectively, were a gift from A.

Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assays—Starved SMCs were transiently transfected in 6-well plates using up to 2 μg of plasmid DNA and FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, a 3:1 ratio of FuGENE 6 reagent (in microliters) to plasmid (in micrograms) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in incomplete medium before addition to 70–80% subconfluent cells in medium containing the mediator of interest or in complete medium for the period of time indicated in the figure legends. After the indicated incubation period, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured with a kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations were measured with a Bradford protein assay kit from Bio-Rad, and luciferase values were normalized to the obtained protein concentrations. In some transfection experiments, normalization was done by LacZ reporter (Promega), and β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoblotting—SMCs were grown in 6-well plates. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer. For PKB, lysis buffer contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. For GSK-3, lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-phospho-PKB (Ser-473; Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-phospho-GSK-3 (Ser-9; Oncogene Research Product) antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. The levels of wt-PTEN and mut-PTEN were determined 48 h post-transfection of PC3 cells by Western blot analysis using antibody against PTEN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The bound secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from treated and untreated SMCs using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). All preparations were treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) to remove genomic DNA. RNA (0.5–1 μg) was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl in the presence of 200 units of SuperScript RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), 40 units of RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μg of Oligo(dT) Primer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SYBR Green Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR— Quantitative two-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) in order to assess versican mRNA expression in SMCs. β-Actin was used as a housekeeping gene. Primer pairs were designed to flank an intron-containing sequence. PCR conditions used included 3 mm Mg2+, 0.3 μm forward and reverse primers, and 2 μl of LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix (Roche Applied Science) in a final volume of 20 μl. The samples were loaded in the LightCycler glass capillaries, closed, centrifuged, and placed in the LightCycler rotor. The cycling program consisted of 10 min of initial denaturation at 95 °C, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 55 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, and single detection for 1 s with a single fluorescence acquisition (ramp rates, 20 °C/s). The analytical melting program was 95 °C for 0 s and 65 °C for 15 s, increasing to 95 °C at a ramp rate of 0.2 °C/s, with continuous fluorescence acquisition. Each sample was run in triplicate. A standard curve was included in each run. Standards were prepared by cloning the target sequence into plasmid DNA. The data were analyzed by using the second-derivative maximum of each amplification reaction and relating it to its respective standard curve. The results from the quantitative PCR were expressed as the ratio of the mean target gene measurements to the mean housekeeping gene value for a given sample (target:reference). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Individual oligonucleotides were 5′-end [γ-32P]deoxyadenine triphosphate-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled oligonucleotides (100 ng) were annealed to equimolar amounts of their complementary strands (unlabeled) by heating to 95 °C for 5 min in Tris-EDTA supplemented with 50 mm NaCl and slowly cooling to room temperature. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were purified on a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA non-denaturing gel; eluted in 500 μl of elution buffer (0.6 m NH4OAC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mm EDTA); and ethanol precipitated prior to use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Nuclear extracts used in EMSAs were isolated from SW480 human colorectal carcinoma cells, using a modified version of the method of Dignam et al. (39.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). Final nuclear protein preparations were collected in buffer C (400 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). For band shift experiments, 20,000 cpm of labeled oligoduplex probes were added to 5 μl of nuclear extracts in 40 μl of DNA binding buffer (10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 mm KCl). To prevent nonspecific binding of nuclear proteins, poly(dI-dC) was added to a concentration of 100 ng/μl, and the binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. For supershift experiments, 1 μg of goat anti-TCF-4 polyclonal antibody (N-20; 0.4 μg/μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction and incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis. For EMSA interference experiments, 0.2 and 0.4 μg of goat anti-β-catenin polyclonal antibody was used (H-102; 0.4 μg/μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For both supershift and interference experiments, antibody control reactions contained an equivalent mass of normal mouse IgG, and antibody negative reactions were supplemented with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from unbound DNA using a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA non-denaturing gel run at a constant voltage of 400 V for 1 h. The oligonucleotides corresponding to the TCF/LEF site from versican promoter used for EMSAs were as follows: 5′-ACTTCCCTTTGATGGGACAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCCCATCAAAGGGAAGT-3′. The 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent Signaling Mediates Versican Transcription in Vascular SMCs—We examined the role of the PI3K-PKB pathway in induction of versican transcription as a result of serum stimulation in vascular SMCs. First, the levels of activated PKB were determined by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibody, after a 30-min pre-incubation of quiescent SMCs with different concentrations of LY294002, a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K, followed by serum stimulation. LY294002 inhibited activation of downstream PKB at all concentrations tested (Fig. 1A). Next we examined whether activation of PI3K and subsequent generation of 3-phosphoinositides is necessary for the stimulation of versican transcription by serum. We transfected SMCs with wild-type versican-Luc reporter construct, and 24 h after transfection, serum-starved, growth-arrested cells were pretreated with LY294002 for 30 min prior to stimulation with 5% newborn calf serum for 24 h. Versican promoter activation was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1B). We next determined the role of the PI3K pathway in the induction of expression of versican mRNA by real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. SMCs were growth-arrested for 24 h, pretreated with LY294002 for 30 min, and stimulated with 5% serum for 24 h. The induction of versican mRNA expression by serum was significantly suppressed by LY294002 pretreatment (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that reduced production of 3-phosphoinositides inhibits versican transcription (Fig. 1, A and B). To examine further the role of 3-phosphoinositides, we investigated the role of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) in control of versican expression. PTEN is a phosphatase that selectively dephosphorylates the 3 position of both phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (40.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), antagonizing the diverse downstream signaling effector pathways activated by PI3K-derived phospholipids. To investigate the effects of this protein on versican expression levels, we overexpressed it in a cell line normally lacking PTEN, the PC3 prostate"

https://openalex.org/W2104790339,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma represents a tumor type with extremely poor prognosis. High apoptosis resistance and a strong invasive and early metastatic potential contribute to its highly malignant phenotype. Here we identified the death receptor adaptor molecule TRAF2 as a key player in pancreatic cancer pathophysiology. Using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis we found TRAF2 overexpressed in 34 of 36 pancreatic tumor samples as well as in pancreatic tumor cell lines resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. The high TRAF2 protein level was not related to chromosomal changes, as monitored by FISH analysis. Instead, the NF-kappaB- and MEK-signaling pathways were involved. Introduction of a TRAF2 expression vector in CD95-sensitive Colo357 cells resulted in (i) resistance to CD95-induced apoptosis; (ii) increased constitutive NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity; and (iii) higher basal secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and IL-8, leading to increased invasiveness. High apoptosis resistance and uPA secretion could be reverted by TRAF2-specific siRNA. Stimulation of TRAF2-overexpressing cells with CD95 ligand led to induction of NF-kappaB and AP-1, enhanced IL-8- and uPA-secretion, and a further increased invasiveness. Thus, TRAF2 overexpression does not only block apoptosis induction by CD95 but also converts this death receptor into a mediator of invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2009281360,"Activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor leads to a variety of effects within the nervous system, including neuronal apoptosis. Both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the tumor suppressor p53 have been reported to be critical for this receptor to induce cell death; however, the mechanisms by which p75 activates these pathways is undetermined. Here we report that the neurotrophin receptor interacting factor (NRIF) is necessary for p75-dependent JNK activation and apoptosis. Upon nerve growth factor withdrawal, nrif–/– sympathetic neurons underwent apoptosis, whereas p75-mediated death was completely abrogated. The lack of cell death correlated with a lack of JNK activation in the nrif–/– neurons, suggesting that NRIF is a selective mediator for p75-dependent JNK activation and apoptosis. Moreover, we document that NRIF expression is sufficient to induce cell death through a mechanism that requires p53. Taken together, these results establish NRIF as an essential component of the p75 apoptotic pathway.

The p75 neurotrophin receptor is a pleiotropic signaling molecule that regulates cellular survival, neurite outgrowth, and myelin formation (1.Barker P.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 529-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This founding member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily can directly bind all of the neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; ProNGF, proform of NGF; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; NRIF, neurotrophin receptor interacting factor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2; TrkA, tropomylosin-related kinase A. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 and -4 (NT-3, NT-4), but it also functions as a co-receptor in a variety of protein complexes. p75 can interact with TrkA to form a high affinity neurotrophin binding site (2.Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and enhance survival signaling (3.Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). It can also associate with the Nogo receptor and Lingo-1 and, upon interaction with myelin proteins, block neurite outgrowth (4.Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 5.Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. Crowell T. Cate R.L. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and, together with Sortilin, the neurotensin 3 receptor, it binds the proform of NGF and initiates apoptosis (6.Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Kliemannel M. Schwarz E. Willnow T.E. Hempstead B.L. Petersen C.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The divergent cellular responses depend on the receptor complex as well as the cellular context. For example, sympathetic neurons of superior cervical ganglia undergo a period of programmed cell death during ontogenesis, and NGF, supplied by the tissues innervated, prevents the loss of these neurons through binding to a p75-TrkA complex (7.Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In contrast, specific activation of p75 (8.Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) or a p75-sortilin complex (6.Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K.

Genetic deletion of p75 prevents the normal period of cell death in the developing superior cervical ganglia (8.Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating the key role of this receptor in regulating the survival of this neuronal population. How p75 initiates this variety of biological effects is not well understood; however, the stress kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK, has been suggested to play a role in mediating this apoptotic signal. Neurotrophin activation of JNK through p75 correlates with the induction of cell death (43.Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and inhibition of the kinase prevents the receptor from killing (23.Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Harrington A.W. Kim J.Y. Yoon S.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 156-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Jun, the downstream target of the kinase, is not required for the receptor to activate apoptosis (11.Palmada M. Kanwal S. Rutkoski N.J. Gustafson-Brown C. Johnson R.S. Wisdom R. Carter B.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); however, other JNK substrates have been implicated in the p75 death pathway, including the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bad (12.Bhakar A.L. Howell J.L. Paul C.E. Salehi A.H. Becker E.B. Said F. Bonni A. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11373-11381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the tumor suppressor p53 (13.Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). p53 was suggested to function in p75 signaling, because expression of the viral p53 inhibitor E1B prevented the receptor from inducing apoptosis in sympathetic neurons and mice lacking p53 show a significant reduction in the normal attrition of sympathetic neurons during development (13.Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have also been identified that can bind the intracellular domain of the receptor (1.Barker P.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 529-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and several have been implicated in regulating apoptosis, including NRAGE (14.Salehi A.H. Roux P.P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); however, evidence demonstrating a direct requirement for any of these proteins in p75-mediated apoptosis is lacking. Moreover, the mechanisms through which they regulate cell death pathways remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examine the role of NRIF (neurotrophin receptor interacting factor, also known as ZFP 110) in p75-mediated cell death. NRIF was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen and encodes a 94-kDa zinc finger protein of the Krüppel family (16.Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It was suggested to have role in p75-mediated apoptosis based on the fact that mice lacking nrif display a significant reduction in cell death in the developing retina (16.Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a phenotype also observed in p75 null mice (17.Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Despite this in vivo correlative evidence, it remains to be shown that NRIF is directly involved in signaling through the p75 receptor. Here, we demonstrate that NRIF is required for p75-mediated apoptosis of sympathetic neurons, but is dispensable for cell death after NGF withdrawal. In addition, we establish a link between NRIF and both of the known components of p75 apoptosis signaling, JNK and p53. Cell Culture—Mice lacking nrif were maintained on a 129Sv background and genotyped as previously described (16.Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and p53–/– mice on a mixed background were genotyped as previously described (18.Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). Sympathetic neurons were isolated from the superior cervical ganglia as described by Palmada et al. (11.Palmada M. Kanwal S. Rutkoski N.J. Gustafson-Brown C. Johnson R.S. Wisdom R. Carter B.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, superior cervical ganglia from nrif or p53 wild type, heterozygous, or null animals were isolated at postnatal days 2–4, and the sympathetic neurons were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin and 0.3% collagenase for 30 min at 37 °C. The nonneuronal cells were removed with a 2-h preplating on uncoated, Falcon 60-mm plates (BD Biosciences). The neurons were cultured on poly-l-ornithine and laminin-coated 4-well slides (Nalge Nunc International) in Ultraculture medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 20 ng/ml NGF (Harlan). The neurons were maintained for 4–5 days in the presence of NGF before being used for survival assays in NGF withdrawal and p75 activation experiments. Rat Schwann cells were isolated from postnatal day 4 rats as described by Carter et al. (19.Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm-Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 μm forskolin (Sigma). Cells were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. When adenovirally infected, cells were split the day before infection and infected with 4.5 × 106 plaque-forming units/cell of virus expressing NRIF and GFP bicistronically or GFP alone for mouse embryo fibroblasts or 7.5 × 106 plaque-forming units/cell for sympathetic neurons or Schwann cells. At the indicated times, cells were harvested for staining or immunoblotting, as indicated. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were split every 3 days, and all experiments were done with cells that had been passaged fewer than 12 times. ProNGF Production—ProNGF was generated by transfection of HEK 293 cells with a furin-resistant, His-tagged construct, and the protein was purified using nickel-bead chromatography (Xpress System Protein purification, Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions using imidazole for elution, as previously described (21.Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Mature NGF was similarly produced and used for comparison in all experiments with ProNGF. Survival Assays—For NGF withdrawal experiments, NGF was removed by washing the cultures twice in Ultraculture medium lacking NGF, and once with Ultraculture containing an antibody to NGF at 0.1 μg/ml (Chemicon International). The procedure was similar for the p75 activation experiments except that after the anti-NGF wash, the neurons were switched to media containing anti-NGF together with 12.5 mm KCl, to promote survival, with or without 200 ng/ml BDNF (a gift from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after the switch to NGF-free or BDNF-containing media, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and the number of surviving neurons, identified by DAPI staining the nuclei (Vector Laboratories), were counted. The induction of cell death was confirmed by evaluating condensed or fragmented nuclei, which was also verified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining in some experiments. For proNGF treatment, the neurons were plated directly in media containing 4.6 mm imidazole (used to elute pro- or mature NGF off the nickel beads), 20 ng/ml NGF or proNGF and fixed 20 h later. Schwann cells and MEFs infected with adeno-NRIF or GFP were similarly scored for apoptosis. In the assays done with infected cells, only GFP-expressing cells were quantified. In all cases, at least 100 cells per condition were counted. NF-κB Activation Assays—Activation of NF-κB was assessed in primary cultures of Schwann cells, 1 or 2 days after isolation, using a luciferase reporter 6XκB-Luc (a gift from Larry Kerr). The cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of 6×κB-Luc reporter and 0.02 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-Renilla (used as internal control for transfection efficiency) per well of a 24-well plate using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 4–6 h and lysed in 40 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) using a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The results were normalized to the basal activity for each treatment and genotype. There was no consistent difference in the basal activity between genotypes, although there was considerable variability. Immunostaining—Rat Schwann cells were maintained as described above. After transfection with adeno-GFP or GFP-NRIF, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 10% goat serum in PT (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100) and immunostained with antiserum to caspase 3 (a gift from Idun Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) diluted 1:1000 in PT, followed by a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) and Cy-3 streptavidin. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI, and slides were viewed by fluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Sympathetic neurons were isolated and treated with BDNF as described. Twenty hours after treatment, neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% goat serum in PT, and immunostained with 1 μg/ml phospho-JNK antiserum (BIOSOURCE) overnight, followed by anti-rabbit Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibody. For c-Jun immunostaining, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 10% goat serum, and immunostained with antiserum to c-Jun (Cell Signaling), diluted 1:500, followed by biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) and Cy-3 streptavidin. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI and viewed by fluorescence microscopy as described. Western Analysis—Schwann cells were cultured and transfected as described and 18 h later, mitochondrially enriched fractions were prepared as described (20.Lipscomb E.A. Sarmiere P.D. Freeman R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5085-5092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, each plate was rinsed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline before adding homogenization buffer (17 mm MOPS, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were scraped from the dishes, Dounce-homogenized, and centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resultant pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 15 min to enrich for mitochondria. The mitochondrial fraction was suspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies at the following dilutions: 1:1000 cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen) and 1:1000 manganese superoxide dismutase (BD Biosciences). Sympathetic neurons were isolated and treated with BDNF as described. Neurons from both CD-1 and 129Sv mice were used as control for comparison to those from nrif–/– animals; however, there was no difference between the control strains in the ability of BDNF to activate the kinase. Twenty-four hours after treatment, neurons were lysed in lysis buffer (2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) with protease inhibitors 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies at the following dilutions: 1:500 JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1:500 phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling). MEFs were infected as described or treated with 60 J/mm2 ultraviolet light and 24 h later, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using JNK and phospho-JNK antibodies as above. NRIF Is Required for Apoptosis Mediated by the p75 Receptor—NRIF was first suggested to have a role in p75-mediated apoptosis based on the fact that mice lacking the nrif gene exhibit a reduction in the amount of naturally occurring cell death in the embryonic retina (16.Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a process known to depend on the p75 neurotrophin receptor (17.Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Therefore, to directly investigate whether nrif is essential for p75-mediated apoptosis we activated the receptor in sympathetic neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia from nrif+/+, +/–, and –/– mice. Sympathetic neurons require NGF binding the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA for survival; however, they can be maintained in the absence of neurotrophin using 12.5 mm KCl. These conditions allow selective activation of the p75 receptor by BDNF, resulting in neuronal apoptosis (8.Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 11.Palmada M. Kanwal S. Rutkoski N.J. Gustafson-Brown C. Johnson R.S. Wisdom R. Carter B.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Using this experimental paradigm, we found that neurons from the nrif null mice do not die in response to BNDF, in contrast to neurons from+/+ and +/– littermates (Fig. 1A). Recent data has suggested that the proform of NGF (proNGF) can also induce apoptosis in these neurons through interaction with the p75 receptor (21.Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Similar to the results with BDNF, the nrif–/– neurons were resistant to proNGF (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that NRIF is essential for p75 to signal neuronal apoptosis. The difference in the response to p75 activation between nrif–/– and +/+ was not due to loss of p75 expression (data not shown) nor was there any difference in general neuronal viability between the two genotypes. The NGF-mediated survival of the nrif–/– neurons was not different from the nrif+/+ cells (relative to wild type, 110 ± 29% of the nrif–/– neurons were viable after 48 h in the presence of 20 ng/ml NGF) nor was the survival in KCl (relative to wild type, 99 ± 16% of the nrif–/– neurons were viable). In addition, there was no difference in the degree of apoptosis in response to NGF withdrawal between the genotypes (Fig. 2). Thus, although NRIF is required for p75-mediated cell death, it is not required for apoptosis that occurs when neurons are deprived of NGF. The Activation of JNK by p75 Is Attenuated in the Absence of NRIF—Activation of the stress kinase JNK by p75 has been shown to be necessary for the receptor to induce cell death (10.Harrington A.W. Kim J.Y. Yoon S.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 156-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of JNK activation by p75 has not been delineated; however, TRAF6, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor family (25.Khursigara G. Bertin J. Yano H. Moffett H. DiStefano P.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5854-5863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the GTP-binding protein Rac (10.Harrington A.W. Kim J.Y. Yoon S.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 156-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated as upstream activators. Furthermore, it was recently reported that co-expression of NRIF, TRAF6, and p75 in 293 HEK cells reconstituted JNK activation by neurotrophin (24.Gentry J.J. Rutkoski N.J. Burke T.L. Carter B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16646-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the stimulation of this kinase in neurons from mice lacking nrif. Sympathetic neurons isolated from nrif–/– or wild type mice were cultured in KCl, as for the cell death assays, treated with BDNF for 24 h and the activation of JNK assessed by Western blotting for phospho-JNK. Unlike wild type neurons, there was no JNK activation detectable in those from nrif–/– mice (Fig. 3A). The total level of JNK was not significantly different between the wild type and null neurons (based on normalization to tubulin and a Student's t test, p = 0.36, n = 4). In addition, we evaluated the stimulation of this kinase by immunostaining for phospho-JNK. Approximately 80% of the wild type neurons were phospho-JNK positive upon p75 activation compared with <20% of the nrif null neurons after p75 activation (Fig. 3B). Thus, the expression of NRIF is required for the stimulation of JNK by p75. We also investigated p75 regulation of this pathway by immunostaining for the transcription factor c-Jun. c-Jun is a well characterized downstream target of JNK, which up-regulates itself and accumulates in the nucleus following phosphorylation by JNK, thus it is often used to evaluate the activation of the kinase. Surprisingly, we found that the overall level of c-Jun was significantly reduced in the nrif–/– neurons and BDNF treatment still elicited some accumulation of the transcription factor in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that there is a mechanism by which the transcription factor is regulated that is independent of JNK. However, p75-mediated cell death does not require c-Jun (11.Palmada M. Kanwal S. Rutkoski N.J. Gustafson-Brown C. Johnson R.S. Wisdom R. Carter B.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), thus our results implicating NRIF in the activation of JNK are more relevant to the apoptotic pathway. Deletion of nrif Does Not Alter the Ability of p75 to Activate NF-κB—Another signaling system that regulates cellular viability and is under the influence of p75 is the NF-κB pathway. This transcription factor was shown to be activated in Schwann cells by NGF binding to p75 and to promote survival (25.Khursigara G. Bertin J. Yano H. Moffett H. DiStefano P.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5854-5863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the stimulation of NF-κB by neurotrophins in Schwann cells from nrif+/+ and –/– mice by a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 4). There was no significant difference between the genotypes in the ability of p75 to activate this transcription factor. NRIF Expression Induces Apoptosis in Primary Cells—The observation that neurons do not undergo p75-mediated cell death or JNK activation in the absence of nrif suggested that this interactor mediates an apoptotic signal. Previous findings demonstrated that expression of NRIF in cell lines, such as 293 HEK cells, primarily caused cell cycle arrest (26.Benzel I. Barde Y.A. Casademunt E. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however we considered the possibility that NRIF may activate cell death in primary, non-immortalized cells. To test this hypothesis, NRIF was expressed in primary Schwann cells, sympathetic neurons, or mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). When mouse sympathetic neurons were infected with an adenovirus expressing GFP and NRIF bicistronically, ∼45% of the GFP-positive neurons were apoptotic, determined by DAPI staining of condensed or fragmented nuclei (Fig. 5A). In contrast, <10% of these neurons were apoptotic when infected with the GFP virus alone. Similarly, when primary rat Schwann cells or mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with the NRIF virus, a significant increase in apoptosis was observed as compared with the GFP control. Similar results were seen in the absence of the adenovirus when the Schwann cells were transiently transfected with NRIF or GFP expression vectors (data not shown). These results demonstrate that expression of NRIF is sufficient to induce cell death in multiple primary cell types. The cell death induced by NRIF expression involved activation of caspase 3 and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. As depicted in Fig. 5B, 24 h after transfecting rat Schwann cells with GFP-NRIF, the GFP-positive cells typically displayed a condensed or fragmented nucleus and were reactive to an antibody that recognizes the activated form of caspase 3. In many situations, it has been found that release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria precedes the activation of caspase 3. To determine if NRIF-mediated apoptosis involved cytochrome c release, Schwann cells were infected with adenovirus expressing NRIF or GFP, subjected to subcellular fractionation and the heavy membrane fraction, which is enriched with mitochondria, was evaluated for cytochrome c content by immunoblotting. At both 18 and 24 h (data not shown) after infection we observed a decrease in the amount of cytochrome c in the mitochondria from NRIF-expressing cells relative to those infected with adeno-GFP (Fig. 5C). Taken together, we conclude that NRIF is a pro-apoptotic molecule that induces the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and activates caspase 3. Given that p75 was not able to maximally activate JNK in the absence of NRIF, we considered the possibility that NRIF induced cell death by activating this kinase; however, over expression of NRIF in MEFs or Schwann cells (data not shown) did not significantly increase the levels of phospho-JNK (Fig. 5D). Thus, NRIF is necessary, but not sufficient for stimulating the kinase, as was previously suggested based on ectopic expression of NRIF in 293 HEK cells (24.Gentry J.J. Rutkoski N.J. Burke T.L. Carter B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16646-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both p75- and NRIF-mediated Apoptosis Are p53-Dependent—The tumor suppressor p53 has also been implicated in p75-mediated apoptosis, based on the ability of the inhibitor E1B to prevent the receptor induced death (13.Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D. Toma J.G. Atwal J. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1691-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To directly determine whether the neuronal apoptosis induced by p75 activation requires p53, sympathetic neurons were isolated from p53+/+ and –/– mice and subjected to NGF withdrawal or p75 activation by BDNF, as above. Interestingly, although the p53–/– neurons were totally resistant to cell death induced by p75 activation (Fig. 6A), they underwent apoptosis as well as the wild type following NGF removal (Fig. 6B). Thus, these results demonstrate that, like NRIF, p53 is required for p75- mediated apoptosis but is dispensable for cell death occurring after NGF deprivation. To determine whether p53 was also required for NRIF-mediated cell death in these neurons, we cultured sympathetic neurons from p53 littermates and infected them with the GFP- or NRIF-expressing adenovirus and scored the number of apoptotic nuclei 48 h later. While the p53+/+ neur"

PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation has been observed following mechanical stimulation of EC but its role in mechanosensing is still incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of PECAM-1 in signaling cascades in response to fluid shear stress (SS) in vascular ECs. PECAM-1-deficient (KO) and PECAM-reconstituted murine microvascular ECs, 50 and 100% confluent bovine aortic EC (BAEC), and human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) transfected with antisense PECAM-1 oligonucleotides were exposed to oscillatory SS (14 dynes/cm2) for 0, 5, 10, 30 or 60 min. The tyrosine phosphorylation level of PECAM-1 immunoprecipitated from SS-stimulated PECAM-reconstituted, but not PECAM-1-KO, murine ECs increased. Although PECAM-1 was phosphorylated in 100% confluent BAEC and HUVEC, its phosphorylation level in 50% confluent BAECs or HUVEC was not detected by SS. Likewise PECAM-1 phosphorylation was robust in the wild type and scrambled-transfected HUVEC but not in the PECAM-1 antisense-HUVEC. ERK½, p38 MAPK, and AKT were activated by SS in all cell types tested, including the PECAM-1-KO murine ECs, 50% confluent BAECs, and HUVEC transfected with antisense PECAM-1. This suggests that PECAM-1 may not function as a major mechanoreceptor for activation of MAPK and AKT in ECs and that there are likely to be other mechanoreceptors in ECs functioning to detect shear stress and trigger intercellular signals.

Other investigators have recently demonstrated that a glycoprotein, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in bovine ECs (BAEC) exposed to fluid flow; this is thought to play important roles in transducing chemical stimuli received on the cell surface to the cytoplasmic aspects of the cell (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Harada N. Lopes R.B. Fujiwara K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fujiwara K. Masuda M. Osawa M. Kano Y. Katoh K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PECAM-1, also known as CD31 or endoCAM (endothelial cell adhesion molecule), is a 130-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on ECs, platelets, monocytes, and leukocytes (15Newman P. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Specifically, PECAM-1 has been found to concentrate at the junctions of ECs. PECAM-1 is a member of immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and has a large extracellular domain containing six Ig homology units, a single membrane-spanning sequence, and a cytoplasmic tail. PECAM-1 has a relatively long (118 amino acids) cytoplasmic tail encoded by seven separate exons (16Newman P.J. Berndt M.C. Gorski J. White 2nd, G.C. Lyman S. Paddock C. Muller W.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 17Xie Y. Muller W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) domain, encoded by exons 12, 13, and 14, has been identified in the cytoplasmic tail of PECAM-1 (19Lu T.T. Barreuther M. Davis S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14442-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 has been noted to be phosphorylated by fluid flow and osmotic shock and also to associate with adapter and signaling molecules in an ITAM-independent manner, as was recently shown for β-catenin (20Ilan N. Mahooti S. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), γ-catenin (21Ilan N. Cheung L. Pinter E. Madri J.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) family members. Functionally, PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (23Lu T.T. Yan L.G. Madri J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11808-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Solowiej A. Biswas P. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, whether PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the signaling pathway activated by shear stress in ECs is poorly understood. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family participates in transmitting extracellular signals to cytoplasmic and nuclear pathways. We and other laboratories have reported that fluid shear stress activates several members of the MAPK family including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK in cultured bovine ECs (1Azuma N. Duzgun S.A. Ikeda M. Kito H. Akasaka N. Sasajima T. Sumpio B.E. J. Vasc. Surg. 2000; 32: 789-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Azuma N. Akasaka N. Kito H. Ikeda M. Gahtan V. Sasajima T. Sumpio B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H189-H197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, another distinct but important cell signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT, has been shown to be activated by fluid shear stress and other hemodynamic forces (26Li W. Sumpio B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar, 27Haga M. Chen A. Gortler D. Dardik A. Sumpio B.E. Endothelium. 2003; 10: 149-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we measured the phosphorylation and enzyme activity of MAPK and AKT to identify the signal events involved in the response of vascular ECs to shear stress. We also addressed the question of whether PECAM-1 functions as a mechanoreceptor of shear stress, activating MAPK and AKT in vascular ECs. We show here the magnitude and time course of PECAM-1, MAPK, and AKT activation induced by shear stress in murine knock-out (KO) and reconstituted (RC) PECAM-1 EC cell lines as well as in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) transfected with antisense or scrambled PECAM-1 oligonucleotides. We also compare the results from confluent cultured and sparsely cultured BAEC and HUVEC. Murine Microvascular EC—The PECAM-KO endothelioma cell line luEND.PECAM-1.1, isolated from a PECAM-1-KO mouse lung, was established by retroviral transduction of the primary endothelial cell culture with the polyoma virus middle T-oncogene. PECAM-1-KO endothelial cells were then retrovirally transduced with full-length murine PECAM-1 cDNA as described previously (28Wong C.W. Wiedle G. Ballestrem C. Wehrle-Haller B. Etteldorf S.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% pyruvate, 10,000 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 105m 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen) and were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Selection of PECAM-1 expression on RC cells was maintained with 1 mg/ml puromycin. Bovine Aortic EC—BAEC were obtained by scraping the intimal surface of aorta obtained from freshly killed calves at a local slaughterhouse (30Awolesi M.A. Sessa W.C. Sumpio B.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For all experiments, ECs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and antibiotics (penicillin 100 units/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml, and amphotericin B 250 ng/ml, (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 on type I collagen-coated 35-mm 6-well culture dishes at 37 °C. Serum-containing medium was replaced by serum-free medium 24 h prior to each experiment. Cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h. PECAM-1 expression was confirmed in BAEC (Fig. 1) Human Umbilical Vein EC—HUVEC were purchased from the BCMM cell culture core (Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, Yale University Medical School) and cultured on gelatin in HUVEC media (M199 medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics). HUVEC were used between passages 3 and 4. Antisense oligonucleotide 5′-TCCTTCCAGGG ATGTGATC-3′ for human PECAM-1 and control scrambled oligonucleotide 5′-TTCTACCTCGCGCGATTTAC-3′ were provided by F. Bennett and T. Condon at Isis™ Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA). HUVEC at 70–80% confluence were transfected using Lipofectin as described (31Gratzinger D. Barreuther M. Madri J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After 48 h of transfection, cells were subjected to serum-free medium during 60 min for synchronization, previous to exposure to shear stress. Pilot studies have confirmed that the expression of PECAM-1 in PECAM-1 scrambled HUVEC was notably stronger compared with the PECAM-1 antisense HUVEC and comparable with the wild type HUVEC (Fig. 1). A transfection efficiency of >90% was observed by fluorescence microscopy when cells were transfected with fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. Fluid flow was applied to confluent cultures with an orbital shaker (Lab-Line, Melrose Park, IL) (32Yun S. Dardik A. Haga M. Yamashita A. Yamaguchi S. Koh Y. Madri J.A. Sumpio B.E. J. Biol.

Although this technique does not result in uniform application of laminar shear stress across the entire monolayer, the majority of the cells are exposed to near maximal shear stress (τmax), which can be calculated as τmax=aρη(2πf)3(Eq. 1) where a is the radius of orbital rotation (1.4 cm), ρ is the density of the culture medium (1.0 g/ml), η is the viscosity of the medium (0.0075 poise measured by viscometer), and f is the frequency of rotation (rotations/s). This equation yields shear stress of 14 dynes/cm2, normal arterial level, at shaking frequency of 270 rpm for 0, 5, 10, 30 or 60 min. ECs were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μg of leupeptin/ml). The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. After centrifugation for 15 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and the extract was precleared with 20 μl of protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h with rotation. The beads were pelleted, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 20 μl of protein G Plus-agarose beads conjugated to PECAM-1-specific antibody (M20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with rotation, after which the immunoprecipitated proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer. After the last wash, the beads were resuspended in 12.5 μl of 2× Laemmeli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred on to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Tyrosine-phosphorylated PECAM-1 was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. Activation of the MAPKs and AKT was assessed by determining phosphorylation of ERK½, p38 MAPK, and AKT with immunoblotting using phosphospecific antibodies (Cell Signaling) as described previously (25Azuma N.

In brief, after exposure to the shear stress, ECs were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extracts were heat-denatured in Laemmeli sample buffer, size-fractionated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and 5% nonfat dry milk, the blots were exposed to polyclonal antibodies. After rinsing three times for 15 min in TTBS, the blot was incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgGs and anti-mouse IgGs for 1 h. After three additional 15-min rinses in TTBS, the resulting protein-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for analyzing densitometric data for each experiment compared with the respective static control (time, 0 min). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Effect of Cell-Cell Contact of BAEC or HUVEC Exposed to Fluid Shear Stress on PECAM-1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation and ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and AKT Activation—PECAM-1 protein is predominantly localized at lateral cell-cell adhesion sites in confluent EC but not in sparsely cultured cells. We investigated whether the formation of cell-cell contact was necessary for PECAM-1, ERK½, p38, and AKT phosphorylation induced by shear stress in BAEC and HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 2, 14 dynes/cm2 shear stress applied to 100% confluent BAEC resulted in PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner that peaked 10 min after initiation of the stimulus. However, in 50% confluent BAEC, PECAM-1 was not phosphorylated, suggesting that PECAM-1 engagement through cell-cell contact is necessary for its tyrosine phosphorylation as a response to shear stress. In both confluent and subconfluent BAEC, ERK½, p38 MAPK, and AKT were activated by shear stress in a time-dependent manner. Activated levels of ERK½ phosphorylation peaked at 5 min, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation peaked after 10 min. AKT phosphorylation could be detected at 10 min and peaked at 30 min. Fig. 3 demonstrates that confluent and subconfluent layers of HUVEC had a similar response to fluid shear stress. PECAM-1 was phosphorylated by 10 min after initiation of the stimulus in confluent but not in subconfluent HUVEC. In both confluent and subconfluent HUVEC, ERK½, p38 MAPK, and AKT were activated by shear stress in a time-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with the concept that MAPK and AKT activation are both independent of PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in BAEC and HUVEC exposed to fluid shear stress. Effect of Fluid Shear Stress on PECAM-1 Antisense Transfected HUVEC—Fig. 4 summarizes the effects of shear stress on PECAM-1 scrambled and PECAM-1 antisense oligonucleotide-transfected HUVEC. Shear stress activated PECAM-1 phosphorylation after 10 min of stimulus in confluent PECAM-1 antisense and scrambled oligonucleotide-transfected HUVEC, although, as expected, the total PECAM-1 expression and its phosphorylation in the PECAM-1 antisense oligonucleotide-transfected HUVEC was significantly weaker when compared with the PECAM-1 scrambled oligonucleotide-transfected HUVEC. PECAM-1 was not phosphorylated by shear stress in sparse PECAM-1 antisense or scrambled oligonucleotide-transfected cells. These findings are again consistent with the concept that cell-cell PECAM-1 engagement is necessary for its tyrosine phosphorylation following shear stress. Furthermore, in PECAM-1 antisense and scrambled oligonucleotide-transfected HUVEC, activation of ERK½, p38 MAPK, and AKT induced by shear stress was present both in confluent and sparse culture conditions. These findings indicate a minimal role, if any, of PECAM-1 on the activation of MAPKs ERK½ and p38 and AKT intracellular signaling following shear stress in the conditions examined. PECAM-1, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and AKT Expression Are Activated after Shear Stress in PECAM-1-KO and -RC Murine Microvascular EC—As shown in Fig. 5, 14 dynes/cm2 shear stress induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 in murine PECAM-1 RC in a time-dependent manner. The time for peak activation was between 10 and 30 min, and the phospho-activation returned to static levels after 60 min. The PECAM-1-KO cells were absent any PECAM-1. In the PECAM-1-RC and -KO cells, shear stress activated ERK½ very rapidly, reaching a peak as early as 5 min after the initiation of the stimulus. There was also a similar time-dependent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the cells, with a significant increase after 30 min compared with control. AKT was also significantly phosphorylated after 30 min of exposure to shear. These findings suggest that neither the expression nor the tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 had any major modulatory effect on the activation of ERK½, p38 MAPK, or AKT intracellular signaling following shear stress in murine microvascular EC. The vascular endothelium is consistently exposed to hemodynamic forces of blood flow. In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that flow induces a number of morphological, physiological, and biological changes in ECs (2Sumpio B.E. Hemodynamic Forces and Vascular Cell Biology. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1993Google Scholar), and disturbed flow is observed in the areas of high incidence of atherosclerosis and intimal hyperplasia. In such areas there is disturbed flow, and specifically there is reduced shear stress compared with unaffected portions of the vessel. Thus, it is widely accepted that the reduced level of fluid shear stress in large arteries is proatherogenic and is also thought to be involved in the arterialization and development of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia of vein grafts (2Sumpio B.E. Hemodynamic Forces and Vascular Cell Biology. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1993Google Scholar). There are most likely many different mechanoreceptors in ECs to detect the different hemodynamic forces or alternative coupling pathways from single receptors (36Davies P.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1755-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that rapid change of flow shear stress activates trimeric G protein (4Gudi S.R. Clark C.B.

Cell Res. 1992; 198: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which may be caused by K+-channel activation in ECs. These early signaling events occur at the cell surface. Tyrosine phosphorylation of receptors and regulatory proteins of various signal transduction pathways have been shown to play important roles in transducing chemical and mechanical stimuli received on the cell surface (14Fujiwara K. Masuda M. Osawa M. Kano Y. Katoh K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Davies P.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

PECAM-1, also known as CD31 or endoCAM, is a 130 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein belonging the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and is most abundantly expressed on ECs, making it a useful and commonly used marker of EC, platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, and certain subsets of T-cells (15Newman P. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 16Newman P.J. Berndt M.C. Gorski J. White 2nd, G.C. Lyman S. Paddock C. Muller W.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 has important intracellular signaling/scaffolding capacities that function to control the activation and cell survival (22Ilan N. Madri J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 38Newman P.J. Newman D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The best described signaling property of PECAM-1 is the phosphorylation of the two ITAM tyrosine residues at positions 663 and 686 of the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain, which occur in response to exposure of cells to a number of different chemical and mechanical stimuli (13Osawa M.

Physiol. 2003; 285: H2336-H2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Functionally, PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in the migration of EC, neutrophil transmigration, and angiogenesis (23Lu T.T. Yan L.G. Madri J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11808-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Solowiej A. Biswas P. Graesser D. Madri J.A. Am. J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) In cultured endothelial cells, PECAM-1 is distributed diffusely in the plasma membrane of solitary cells, but once a cell-cell contact is made, it accumulates at lateral contact sites and is thought to play a role in the formation and maintenance of monolayer integrity and in platelet and leukocyte interactions with endothelium (29Graesser D. Solowiej A. Bruckner M. Osterweil E. Juedes A. Davis S. Ruddle N.H. Engelhardt B. Madri J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 40Albelda S.M.

In EC forming a 100% confluent monolayer, PECAM-1 is predominantly localized to the cell-cell borders in culture and in tissue, and its localization does not change before and after tyrosine phosphorylation initiated by mechanical stress (14Fujiwara K. Masuda M. Osawa M. Kano Y. Katoh K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that in confluent EC, phosphorylation of PECAM-1 does not depend on membrane localization of the protein or on cell-cell binding. Furthermore, the transmembrane and extracellular domains of PECAM-1 do not appear to be necessary for responsiveness of EC to shear stress (42Kaufman D.A. Albelda S.M. Sun J. Davies P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observed that in all of the EC populations studied cell-cell contact was required for shear stress-induced PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These differences may be ascribed to differences in the derivations of the endothelial cell populations and/or the substrate used in the studies (gelatin versus native type I collagen) and the effects it may have on cell responsiveness. Previous studies have shown that Tyr-686 is phosphorylated in EC that are stimulated by fluid shear stress of more than 5 dynes/cm2 or hyper- and hypoosmotic shocks (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Harada N. Lopes R.B. Fujiwara K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar). Such PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in mechanically stimulated EC is a rapid event, detectable within 30 s of stimulation (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Harada N. Lopes R.B. Fujiwara K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar, 43Harada N. Masuda M. Fujiwara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Other studies revealed that mechanically induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 is not a downstream event of Ca2+ mobilization, K+ channel activation, stretch-activated cation channel activity, or protein kinase C activation, which are all known as the earliest flow-dependent cellular events; this PECAM-1 phosphorylation also initiates a signaling cascade leading to ERK activation. Therefore, although these data are not conclusive, these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 induced by fluid shear stress can be a mechanosensing event in ECs (14Fujiwara K. Masuda M. Osawa M. Kano Y. Katoh K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Current thinking also holds that the activation of PECAM-1 is a prerequisite for the expression of subsequent MAPKs in ECs. The MAPK family is a class of signal transduction proteins capable of transmitting extracellular signals to cytoplasmic and nuclear pathways (1Azuma N. Duzgun S.A. Ikeda M. Kito H. Akasaka N. Sasajima T. Sumpio B.E. J. Vasc. Surg. 2000; 32: 789-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Ikeda M. Takei T. Mills I. Kito H. Sumpio B.E. Am. J.

Physiol. 2000; 89: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The activation of MAPK induces a number of cellular changes including cell proliferation, morphologic changes, and increased transcription of immediate early genes, leading to altered vasoactive protein production. Thus, activation of mechanoreceptors on the cell surface must be necessary to transmit the extracellular signals to the nucleus through MAPK activation. In our studies, shear stress tyrosine-phosphorylated PECAM-1 in PECAM-reconstituted microvascular ECs and BAECs, with peak activation at 10 min. We also demonstrated that shear stress activated ERK½ in microvascular ECs and BAECs. However, the latter activation occurred almost immediately, as early as 5 min after the initiation of shear stress, and was sustained for at least 60 min. Thus, the temporal pattern of PECAM-1 activation was significantly different from that of ERK½ activation in ECs exposed to shear stress, suggesting that other mechanoreceptors existing on the cell surface, other than PECAM-1, may be activated by shear stress and may cause a much more rapid induction of MAPK activity. Although we have studied the downstream pathways and subsequent nuclear events modulated by shear stress, additional studies still need to be performed to elucidate the upstream mechanisms of the mechanosensing signaling pathway(s). PECAM-1 has been shown to be an important scaffolding molecule involved in several signaling pathways (22Ilan N. Madri J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 38Newman P.J. Newman D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, the data presented in this report are consistent with the concept that PECAM-1 is not a major mechanosensor in the EC populations studied. Our studies differ from those performed previously in that we performed all our studies on a type I collagen coating compared with poly-l-lysine or gelatin coating, and EC populations were utilized exclusively throughout the studies (14Fujiwara K. Masuda M. Osawa M. Kano Y. Katoh K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 42Kaufman D.A. Albelda S.M. Sun J. Davies P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As cell-matrix adhesion is known to be a major determinant of cellular responsiveness to a wide variety of mechanical and chemical stimuli, we suggest that in our in vitro studies (and possibly in vivo as well) the dynamic adhesion and interaction of EC with physiologic substrata likely play major roles in modulating the responsiveness of EC to shear forces (45Bershadsky A.D. Balaban N.Q. Geiger B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies are obviously needed to definitively identify and characterize the many other potential mechanoreceptors likely responsible for transducing shear stimuli in EC (42Kaufman D.A. Albelda S.M. Sun J. Davies P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45Bershadsky A.D. Balaban N.Q. Geiger B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

This intervening domain exerts quite a surprising characteristic to the structure by introducing significant asymmetry in the tetramer. The asymmetric unit is composed of two identical subunits that exist in two different conformations characterized by rotation of ∼180° around a hinge connecting two of the four domains. This asymmetric arrangement results in the formation of two different and distinct domain interfaces between identical domains in the asymmetric unit. As a result, the surface of the intervening domain that is exposed to solvent in one subunit is turned inward in the other subunit toward the center of the structure where it makes contact with other structural elements. Significant asymmetry is also seen at the subunit level where different conformations exist at the NAD-binding site and the putative serine-binding site in the two unique subunits.

Subsequently, phosphohydroxypyruvate is converted to phosphoserine by phosphoserine transaminase and then to l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (1Walsh D.A. Sallach H.J. J. Biol.

Harutyunyan E.H. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 759-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Goldberg J.D. Yoshida T. Brick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1123-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PGDH appears to be ubiquitously found in all organisms. It exists in at least three different basic structural motifs that do not appear to be strictly specific for organism type (6Dey S. Hu Z. Lan Xu X. Sacchettini J.C. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14884-14891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The PGDH of some bacteria and some lower eukaryotes, such as yeast and Neurospora are similar to the Escherichia coli enzyme. In addition to substrate and nucleotide-binding domains, they possess a homologous C-terminal domain that, in E. coli, is involved in regulation of activity through binding the effector, l-serine. Other bacteria such as Mycobacterium, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium, plants such as Arabidopsis, and higher order eukaryotes, including mammals, possess a large polypeptide insertion (∼150–200 amino acids) in their C-terminal segment immediately following the substrate-binding domain and before the C-terminal domain. A third motif, which lacks the C-terminal regulatory domain altogether, is also found in some bacteria such as Clostridium and including some, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that also produce PGDH with the extended C-terminal motif. Recent studies on the parasite Entamoeba histolytica (7Ali V. Hashimoto T. Shigeta Y. Nozaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2670-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) found a variation of this third motif where the dimeric enzyme appears to have a lysine residue rather than a histidine at the active site. The SerA1 gene from M. tuberculosis (H37Rv lab strain) coding for PGDH has been found to be an essential gene in mycobacterium by Himar1-based transposon mutagenesis in H37Rv strain (8Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2025) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies (6Dey S. Hu Z. Lan Xu X. Sacchettini J.C. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14884-14891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have revealed that M. tuberculosis PGDH has a Km value of ∼85 μm for hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate and a kcat/Km value of ∼5.6 × 106 m–1 s–1. Unlike E. coli PGDH, it displays no activity with α-ketoglutarate. In addition, M. tuberculosis PGDH exhibits substrate inhibition similar to what has been reported for rat liver PGDH (9Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Increased ionic strength (100–400 mm) reduces the degree of substrate inhibition and shifts the maximal activity to higher substrate concentrations, also seen in rat liver PGDH. In addition, the activity of the enzyme is also dependent on the ionic strength of the buffer. E. coli PGDH is strongly inhibited by l-serine (I0.5 ∼ 2–4 μm) and classified as a V-type enzyme in which the velocity of the reaction rather than the affinity of the substrates is mainly affected (10Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In B. subtilis (11Saski R. Pizer L.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Corynebacterium glutamicum (12Peters-Wendisch P. Netzer R. Eggeling L. Sahm H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), PGDH is less sensitive to l-serine and requires extensive preincubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor. In the pea (Pisum sativum), the sensitivity to l-serine has been reported to be cold labile (13Slaughter J.C. Davies D.D. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). l-Serine has been reported to have no effect on the activity of PGDH from rat liver and chicken liver (9Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Walsh D.A. Sallach H.J. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the contrary, M. tuberculosis PGDH is strongly inhibited by l-serine, with an I0.5 value for l-serine of ∼30 μm (6Dey S. Hu Z. Lan Xu X. Sacchettini J.C. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14884-14891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), making it the next most sensitive enzyme after E. coli to be reported. Unlike the E. coli enzyme, M. tuberculosis PGDH displays a Hill coefficient of ∼1.0, indicating the absence of cooperativity for serine inhibition. However, kinetic studies show that cooperativity can be induced in M. tuberculosis PGDH by the presence of chloride ions (6Dey S. Hu Z. Lan Xu X. Sacchettini J.C. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14884-14891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent by bromide and iodide. In this study, we report the crystal structure of PGDH from M. tuberculosis in the absence of physiological ligands. This structure represents the second class of PGDH with extended motif at the C terminus. This structure provides information about how this extra region is affecting the overall structure of this class of PGDH and may eventually lead to important insights into the allosteric regulation of this protein. Remarkably, although the tetramer is composed of identical subunits, significant asymmetry is seen in the tertiary structure of the subunits. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of M. tuberculosis PGDH Protein—The SerA1 gene (Rv2996c) from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome was cloned into pET30b vector (Novagen) using NdeI and HindIII sites. The NdeI site contained the ATG start codon, and the HindIII site was preceded immediately by a stop codon following the C-terminal residue of the enzyme. Production of a selenomethionylated (SeMet) protein for multiple anamolous dispersion (MAD) phasing was facilitated by mutation of Ile (ATC) at position 514 to Met (ATG) using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This site was chosen because the homologous position in E. coli PGDH is a methionine residue. The mutated gene was cloned into the pET30b vector in the same way as in the wild type. The pET30b-SerA1 clone was transformed into the E. coli overexpression strain BL21 (DE3). The culture was grown in LB medium with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 18 °C overnight. For SeMet protein, the pET30b-SerA1 (I514M) clone was transformed into E. coli B834 (DE3) (Novagen), Met auxotrophic cells. The cells were grown in M9 minimal medium with all of the 19 standard amino acids except Met. Selenomethionine (50 mg/liter) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were also added to the culture. The culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then grown overnight at 18 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min and resuspended in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl. The cells were lysed using a French Press, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was then loaded on to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, and protein was eluted using a KCl gradient. The fractions containing PGDH were pooled and concentrated by Centriprep (Millipore) and applied to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. Crystallization—Native and SeMet PGDH (13 mg/ml) were crystallized in 1 m NaK tartrate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5 (Wizard condition) at 18 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. This precipitant condition was found to produce crystals of good diffraction quality after doing a matrix screening with different kits (Hampton Crystal Screens and Wizard screens I and II from Emerald Biosystems). The crystals grew within 3–4 days in 4-μl hanging drops of 2 μl of PGDH (13 mg/ml) and 2 μl of precipitant. The same conditions were used for SeMet, but the crystals took more than a week to grow. The crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen using 20% propylene glycol as cryoprotectant for data collection. Data Collection and Processing—The initial native data set for M. tuberculosis PGDH was collected at 2.8 Å at APS 14-BMC (Advance Photon Source). Molecular replacement of high resolution data of M. tuberculosis PGDH was attempted with the E. coli PGDH monomer or its nucleotide-binding domain (the largest domain) as a model using various programs (AMORE, MOLREP, and PHASER). However, no clear solution was obtained. Subsequently, several different heavy metals such as mercury, platinum, and neodynium were tried but failed to produce an acceptable isomorphous or anamolous signal. SeMet MAD phasing with PGDH was originally not possible because this 529-amino acid protein did not contain any methionyl residues except the N-terminal methionine, which was cleaved during expression. Therefore, a single methionine residue was introduced at position 514 that was sufficient to obtain complete and highly redundant SeMet MAD data sets (peak, inflection) for PGDH at 3.15 Å, collected at APS 14-BMD station in Chicago. High resolution data for PGDH at 2.3 Å was also collected at APS 14-BMC in Chicago. The diffraction data sets were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38698) Google Scholar). The space group was found to be P6522. Solvent content indicated either a dimer or a trimer in the asymmetric unit. Two selenium sites were found using SHELXD (16Sheldrick G.M. Gould R.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1995; 51: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and further refined using AUTOSHARP (17Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). An interpretable density modified solvent flattened map was also obtained using AUTOSHARP showing two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—Using this density modified map, chain tracing and automated model building was done using CAPRA in TEXTAL (18Ioerger T.R. Sacchettini J.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All of the residues of PGDH except the first two residues could be built in the electron density map. The model was then refined against the high resolution (2.3Å) data using REFMAC (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13945) Google Scholar). The geometry of the model was greatly improved using CNS (rigid body refinement and then simulated annealing refinement at 4000 K) (20Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16990) Google Scholar). Several rounds of manual model building with Xtalview (21McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) using the Shake&wARP (22Kantardjieff K.A. Hochtl P. Segelke B.W. Tao F-M. Rupp B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) bias minimized electron density maps and refinement using REFMAC were performed. After the model reached a reasonable R factor, water was added to the structure using automated water picking in Xtalview as well as manual picking using unbiased electron density maps. Finally, the model was translation-libration-screw (TLS) restrained and refined using REFMAC, and the final structure has an R factor of 20.5% and an Rfree value of 25% with good stereochemistry as analyzed by PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab All of the structure figures were prepared using PyMOL (24DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) except for panels A and B of Fig. 3, which were made using Raster 3D (25Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3879) Google Scholar), and the molecular surface representations in Fig. 3 (C and D), which were made using SPOCK (26Christopher J. SPOCK. The Center for Macromolecular Design, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX1999Google Scholar). The structure of M. tuberculosis PGDH has been refined to 2.3 Å resolution using SeMet MAD phasing (27Hendrickson W.A. Ogata C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To use this method, the isoleucyl residue at position 514 was mutated to methionine. Based on sequence alignment, this position is occupied by a methionyl residue in E. coli PGDH. Although it is generally suggested that there should theoretically be one selenomethionine for ∼100 amino acids to yield sufficient MAD phasing (27Hendrickson W.A. Ogata C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), a complete and highly redundant data set at 3.15 Å provided an interpretable electron density map of high quality from this one Met in the 529-amino acid protein (two/asymmetric unit, no NCS averaging). The structure was refined to an R factor of 20.5% and Rfree of 25% with good stereochemistry. The refined structure contains all the amino acid residues except the first two residues of the protein (Fig. 1A). The x-ray crystallographic structure shows that there are two molecules found in the asymmetric unit (chain A and chain B) that form a tetramer with the crystallographic symmetry related molecules (2-fold axis of symmetry). Four well defined domains can be discerned in each subunit of 55,000 Daltons (Fig. 1C). These are referred to as the substrate-binding domain (residues 3–98 and 283–319), the nucleotide-binding domain (residues 99–282), the regulatory domain (residues 454–529), and the intervening domain (residues 320–453). The substrate-binding, nucleotide-binding, and regulatory domains are homologous to those found in E. coli PGDH (Fig. 1, B and D). The intervening domain between the substrate-binding and regulatory domains is not present in E. coli PGDH. Superposition of M. tuberculosis chain B on chain A with the nucleotide-binding domain and substrate-binding domain as reference shows a rotation of the other two domains by approximately 180°, indicating the presence of two different conformations among the molecules of the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1E). Nucleotide-binding Domain—The nucleotide-binding domain in M. tuberculosis PGDH consists of residues Asn99 to Gly282 and contains seven parallel β strands interconnected with seven helices. This is a variation of the Rossman fold that is a characteristic of dehydrogenases. Sequence alignment of the nucleotide-binding domain in M. tuberculosis PGDH and E. coli PGDH shows 33.9% sequence identity, and superimposition of these domains in chain A shows a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 5.28 Å for Cα atoms. This deviation is largely due to the presence of a helix between residues Ser176 and Gln182 in M. tuberculosis PGDH where there is a loop in E. coli PGDH, as well as variable loop regions in the structures of both enzymes (Pro173–Tyr174 in M. tuberculosis and Ala271–Asp275 in E. coli). Superimposition of M. tuberculosis PGDH nucleotide-binding domain chain B on chain A (r.m.s.d. = 1.5 Å for Cα atoms) shows that they have different conformations in the area where nucleotide binding occurs. In chain A, the fingerprint region (Gly149-Xaa150-Gly151-Xaa152-Xaa153-Gly154-Xaa17-Asp172) in the Rossman fold where NAD binds is solvent-accessible (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, in chain B, the orientation of the loop region (residues His203–Leu213) that faces this fingerprint is different and is oriented in such a way that it appears to block access to the NAD-binding site (Fig. 2B). The nucleotide-binding site in E. coli PGDH is different from either the open channel seen in chain A or the closed channel seen in chain B because it is completely exposed (Fig. 2C). This most likely explains why the M. tuberculosis PGDH does not bind to 5′-AMP-Sepharose because the linkage to the resin would not allow the AMP to gain sufficient access to the binding site within the channel. Substrate-binding Domain—The substrate-binding domain is adjacent to both the nucleotide-binding domain and the intervening domain and is composed of residues Ser3–Ser98 and Ala283–Val319. This N-terminal domain contains five parallel β strands flanked by five helices similar to E. coli PGDH (r.m.s.d = 3.87 Å for Cα atoms), but it has only approximately 29.7% sequence identity with E. coli PGDH in both regions 3–98 and 283–319. There is no significant difference in the structure of the substrate-binding domain in chain A and B of M. tuberculosis PGDH (r.m.s.d. = 0.96 Å for Cα atoms). Active Site Cleft—Similar to E. coli PGDH, and as seen in most of the dehydrogenases, the nucleotide-binding domain and substrate-binding domain form the active site cleft. The presence of the active site in this cleft is further supported by the presence of the nucleotide-binding site fingerprint (Gly149-Xaa150-Gly151-Xaa152-Xaa153-Gly154-Xaa17-Asp172). Adjacent to this NAD-binding site on the nucleotide-binding domain are His280 and Glu262, which are homologous to His292 and Glu269 in E. coli PGDH and which form a charge relay system common to many dehydrogenases and also seen in serine proteases as a His-Asp pair. Also common to dehydrogenases is a basic residue in the cleft region that serves to anchor the C-1 carboxyl group, which is Arg233 in M. tuberculosis PGDH and Arg240 in E. coli PGDH. Amino acid sequence alignment of PGDH with homologous proteins shows that these three residues are universally conserved. Additional homologous residues found in the cleft region are Arg51 and Arg132′ (′ signifies that the residue resides on the adjacent subunit), which correspond to Arg60 and Lys141′ in E. coli PGDH. Arg132′ is contributed by the adjacent nucleotide-binding domain. These residues, along with Arg72, may play a role in the binding of the negatively charged substrate. Also apparent in M. tuberculosis PGDH is Trp130′, homologous to Trp139′ in E. coli PGDH, that is also located in the nucleotide-binding domain of the adjacent subunit and whose side chain inserts into a hydrophobic pocket near the active site of the neighboring subunit where the His-Glu pair forms the top of the pocket. This residue is thought to play an important role in subunit communication and tetramer formation in E. coli PGDH. The active site clefts in this structure of M. tuberculosis PGDH seem to be in an open state exposed to solvent. NAD-dependent dehydrogenases transfer a hydride ion during their catalytic process, and these hydride ions are unstable in water, so the active site must be shielded from bulk solvent during hydride transfer. This presumably unproductive state is very similar to the situation seen in the crystal structure of inhibited E. coli PGDH and seems to represent a precatalytic conformation. Intervening Domain—The intervening domain (residues Val320 to Glu453) is termed as such because it is a new domain not present in E. coli PGDH that is located between the substrate-binding domain and the regulatory domain where l-serine binds. It consists of six β strands, of which two strands are flanked by two helices and the remaining four strands form an anti-parallel β sheet. Superimposition of the intervening domains of chain B on chain A in M. tuberculosis PGDH (r.m.s.d. = 1.8 Å for Cα atoms) does not show any significant secondary structure differences. However, as noted previously, the orientation of the intervening domain in chain B is approximately 180° opposite and inverted compared with that in chain A (Fig. 1E). The average B factor values (ranging from 25 to 41 Å2) for all the domains from both the chains (A and B) are not significantly different. This inversion results in the regulatory domain of chain A occupying a position much closer to its nucleotide-binding domain than in chain B. These conformations will be referred to as syn(chain A) and anti(chain B) to distinguish them from each other for the purpose of discussion. One result of this inversion, other than the reorientation of the domains, is that there are two different interfaces between the nucleotide-binding domain and the intervening domain in the two unique subunits. Because of this, the inversion also results in the exposure of a loop region, consisting of residues 376–386 in chain B, to the solvent. This appears to lead to increased flexibility of this loop, leading to disorder in the electron density in this region. A VAST and DALI structural alignment search using only the intervening domain found similarity with a region of domain II of 2-methylcitrate dehydratase from E. coli (Protein Data Bank Code 1SZQ; r.m.s.d of 2.8 Å for 83 Cα atoms). This enzyme is involved in propionate catabolism and catalyzes the conversion of 2-methylcitrate to 2-methyl-cis-aconitate. Unfortunately, the role of this domain in this enzyme is not known. Apart from the numerous other hits with a Z score of 2–4.5, DALI search also found similarity with chorismate mutase in B. subtilis (Z score = 5; Protein Data Bank code 2CHS; r.m.s.d. of 3.8 Å for 83 Cα atoms) (28Chook Y.M. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8600-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) that is a homotrimer with the monomer having a single domain that catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to prephenate in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. There was also some structural similarity with urocanate hydratase from Pseudomonas putida (VAST score = 7.8; Protein Data Bank code 1UWK; r.m.s.d. of 2.3 Å for 52 Cα atoms) (29Kessler D. Retey J. Schultz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) involved in the histidine degradation pathway. Interestingly, the structural similarity is seen in the region that is part of the NAD-binding domain in this enzyme, but no such NAD-binding fingerprint region is present in the intervening domain of the PGDH. There are two distinct areas of electron density visible in the region where adjacent intervening domains converge. These areas of electron density are surrounded by the positively charged residues, His447, Lys439′, Arg451′, and Arg501′. These densities appear to represent tartrate molecules, which are included as a part of the crystallization condition. The tartrate is within hydrogen bond distance of His447 from one subunit and Lys439′, Arg451′, and Arg501′ from the adjacent subunit. Arg501′ is found in the regulatory domain and forms an ion pair with the C-4 carboxyl group of tartrate. His447, which is found in the strand connecting the intervening domain and the regulatory domain, forms ionic contact with the C-1 carboxyl group of tartrate. Two molecules of tartrate bind to this region because of the symmetr"
https://openalex.org/W2062914927,"A human β-ketoacyl synthase implicated in a mitochondrial pathway for fatty acid synthesis has been identified, cloned, expressed, and characterized. Sequence analysis indicates that the protein is more closely related to freestanding counterparts found in prokaryotes and chloroplasts than it is to the β-ketoacyl synthase domain of the human cytosolic fatty acid synthase. The full-length nuclear-encoded 459-residue protein includes an N-terminal sequence element of ∼38 residues that functions as a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The enzyme can elongate acyl-chains containing 2–14 carbon atoms with malonyl moieties attached in thioester linkage to the human mitochondrial acyl carrier protein and is able to restore growth to the respiratory-deficient yeast mutant cem1 that lacks the endogenous mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase and exhibits lowered lipoic acid levels. To date, four components of a putative type II mitochondrial fatty acid synthase pathway have been identified in humans: acyl carrier protein, malonyl transferase, β-ketoacyl synthase, and enoyl reductase. The substrate specificity and complementation data for the β-ketoacyl synthase suggest that, as in plants and fungi, in humans this pathway may play an important role in the generation of octanoyl-acyl carrier protein, the lipoic acid precursor, as well as longer chain fatty acids that are required for optimal mitochondrial function.

The enzymes involved in the pathway are freestanding, monofunctional proteins of the type II variety and are distinct from the multifunctional polypeptide type I FASs 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; KSmit, mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase; mitochondrial KSmit38, mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase with the first 37 residues deleted; KSmit1–38, first 38 residues derived from the mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ACPmit, mitochondrial ACP; EGFP, a red-shifted variant of green fluorescent protein; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; KSmit, mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase; mitochondrial KSmit38, mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase with the first 37 residues deleted; KSmit1–38, first 38 residues derived from the mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ACPmit, mitochondrial ACP; EGFP, a red-shifted variant of green fluorescent protein; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. present in the cytosol of fungi and animals. Thus far, the preponderance of evidence suggests that these mitochondrial FAS pathways function to produce octanoyl-ACP, the precursor of lipoic acid (4.Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and longer chain-length fatty acids that may be utilized for the remodeling of mitochondrial membrane phospholipids (7.Schneider R. Brors B. Massow M. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The presence of a similar mitochondrial FAS system in animals has been suspected for some time, based initially on the discovery of an ACP-like protein in animal mitochondria (8.Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9.Triepels R. Smeitink J. Loeffen J. Smeets R. Buskens C. Trijbels F. van den Heuvel L. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, only recently have other components of a putative mitochondrial FAS been identified, cloned, and characterized; they include the human ACP and malonyl transferase (10.Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40067-40074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and enoyl reductase (11.Miinalainen I.J. Chen Z.J. Torkko J.M. Pirila P.L.

In continuation of the search for other components, we have now identified and characterized a single candidate for a type II human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase, the critical enzyme required for catalysis of the chain-elongating condensation reaction. Cloning of the Human Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase—Using the sequences of several authentic type I and type II β-ketoacyl synthases as probes to BLAST search the human genome sequence data base, we identified a sequence (accession NP_060367) that also was represented in a human EST clone (IMAGE clone 3446492, ATCC MGC-4956) and appeared likely to encode a full-length human β-ketoacyl synthase, together with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. A cDNA from this EST clone was used as template to generate a construct for expression in Escherichia coli. Specific primers (KSmitqeT/B, Table I) with appropriate restriction sites for cloning were designed, and the cDNA encoding the putative β-ketoacyl synthase was amplified using PCR, essentially as described earlier (12.Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli expression construct carried a 37-residue N-terminal deletion that we deduced, by analysis of multiple sequence alignments, might represent a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The amplified fragment was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), cleaved with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the pQE80 L (QE) E. coli expression vector (Qiagen). To facilitate purification of the recombinant protein by affinity chromatography, a His6-tag was encoded at the N terminus of the construct. The authenticity of the cloned, amplified fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IPCR primers used in this studyPrimersSequenceLocationaThe base pair numbers are according to the sequence in EST cDNA clone IMAGE-3446492.E. coliKSmitqe.T5′-attcaggatccAGATTGCATAGGCGAGTTGTCAT214-236 bpBamHIKSmitqe.B5′-gacttggtaccTACAGTCCAGCAATACAAAGTGTTGCA1452-1478 bpKpnIHeLa cellsKSmitgfp.T5′-attcagaattcagagccATGTCCAACTGCCTGCAAAATTTCC100-124 bpEcoRIKSmitgfp.B5′-gacttggtaccGGATATTGGCACAGTTCCGAA193-213 bpKpnIYeastKSmitcem1.T5′-actaactagtTCATGTCCAACTGCCTGCAAAA75-96 bpSpeIKSmitcem1.B5′-tataatcgatCAGTCCAGCAATACAAAGTGTT1432-1453 bpClaIa The base pair numbers are according to the sequence in EST cDNA clone IMAGE-3446492. Open table in a new tab Verification That the Putative N-terminal Mitochondrial Recognition Elements Direct the β-Ketoacyl Synthase into Mitochondria—A PCR-amplified fragment (primer set KSmit1–38gfpT/B, Table I) encoding the first 38 amino acid residues (putative targeting sequence) of the human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase was directionally cloned into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) to facilitate expression as the N-terminal partner of a KSmit1–38-EGFP fusion protein. Authenticity of the cloned fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum, were cotransfected with two plasmids using FuGENE 6 reagent; one plasmid encoded the KSmit1–38-EGFP fusion protein (or as a control the pEGFP-N3 parental vector), the other encoded pDsRed2-Mito (Clontech), which served as a mitochondrial marker. Cells were cultured for 60 h, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and analyzed for green and red fluorescence using a Sony confocal microscope. Complementation of the Yeast Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase Mutant, cem1, by the Human Mitochondrial Enzyme—The human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase cDNA sequence was amplified by the PCR from plasmid pCMV-SPORT6 using the primers KSmitcem1.T and KSmitcem1.B. The resulting SpeI/ClaI fragment was incorporated into pUG35 (13.Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) giving the multicopy yeast expression plasmid pKSmit-GFP. The plasmid was transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant BY4743 (Euroscarf, Frankfurt/Main, Germany; MATa/α, his3Δ/1his3Δ1, leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0/LYS2, MET15/met15Δ0, ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0, Δcem1::kanMX4/CEM1). In this diploid, one of the two CEM1 alleles (condensing enzyme mitochondrial) is disrupted by the kanMX4 marker, providing resistance against the antibiotic geneticin (G418). The transformed diploid was sporulated, and subsequently the spore tetrads were dissected by micromanipulation. Individual spores were analyzed for respiratory competence on YEPL (yeast extract/peptone/lactose) medium containing lactate as a carbon source. CEM1 disruption was indicated by G418 resistance and the presence of pKSmit-GFP by uracil prototrophy of the cells. Dextrose-containing complex (YEPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose)) medium and uracil-free synthetic complete (SCD-Ura) medium were prepared according to Ausubel et al. (14.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). YEPL media contained 2% lactate, pH 6.5, instead of glucose, and YEPD + G418 contained 200 mg/l of geneticin (Sigma). Tissue Specificity of Expression of Human Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase—A 32P-labeled probe was synthesized by the random priming method using [α-32P]dCTP (3000Ci/mmol), a PCR-amplified mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase template cDNA and NEBlot kit (New England Biolabs). A human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was exposed to the purified radiolabeled probe (∼1 × 107 dpm/blot), using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech), and was processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The blot was analyzed using a phosphoimager (Strom 840, Molecular Dynamics). Expression and Purification of Human Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase—The recombinant pQE 80L vector was expressed in E. coli DH5α cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to a density equivalent to A600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature overnight. Cells were harvested and using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton MA) were lysed in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin 5 μg/ml, trans-epoxysuccinyl-LGB 10 μm, pepstatin 1 μg/ml, and antitrypsin 5 μg/ml). The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded at 20 °C onto a HiTrap Chelating HP column (5 ml bed volume, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) then the tightly bound proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The latter protein fraction was rechromatographed on the same column, essentially in the same manner, except that an additional wash with 100 mm imidazole in buffer A was included prior to elution of the tightly bound proteins. The purified protein was subjected to ultrafiltration, both to remove imidazole and to effect transfer to the storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The enzyme was stable for at least 6 months when stored at –80 °C. β-Ketoacyl Synthase Activity Using Acetyl-CoA as Primer—Recombinant mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase was assayed for condensing activity using [1-14C]acetyl-CoA as the primer and malonyl-ACPmit as the chain extender. The malonyl-ACPmit was first generated in situ from malonyl-CoA and holoACPmit using human mitochondrial malonyl transferase (10.Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40067-40074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 83 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm malonyl-CoA, 60 μm holoACPmit, and 100 ng of human mitochondrial malonyl transferase in a final volume of 30 μl and was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (54 Ci/mol, 50 μm final concentration) was added. The mixture was aliquotted into two tubes and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C without or with 1 μg (725 nm) of mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase. The reaction was terminated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Synthesis of Acyl-ACPmit Substrates—The C2:0–C16:0 acyl-ACPmit thioesters were synthesized enzymatically using recombinant human phosphopantetheinyl transferase (15.Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and C-terminally His6-tagged apoACPmit. A typical reaction mixture, 5 ml in volume, containing 20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 μm apoACPmit and 75 μm acyl-CoA, was incubated with 250 nm phosphopantetheinyl transferase at 37 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was then desalted into buffer B (20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol) using a Vivaspin concentrator (5,000-Da cutoff, Vivascience) and repurified at 20 °C on a Hi-Trap Q HP anion exchange column. The bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in buffer B, followed by a 5-ml gradient of 250–500 mm NaCl in buffer B. The anion exchange chromatography procedure effected a partial separation between residual unmodified apoACPmit and the various acyl-ACPmit species, which eluted later. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess protein purity and by mass spectrometry to identify those fractions that contained authentic acyl-ACPmit thioesters, essentially free of residual apoACPmit. Starting with ∼1 mg of apoACPmit, the overall yields of acyl-ACPmit thioesters were typically ∼ 60%, with the exception of C-16-ACPmit for which the yield was 30%. Isolation of Apo and Holo Forms of Human Mitochondrial ACP—The C-terminally His6-tagged apoACP was expressed in an Sf9/baculoviral host/vector system and purified as described earlier, and the holo-form was derived from it using human phosphopantetheinyl transferase (10.Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40067-40074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15.Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Samples were desalted using a C4 ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MS), mixed with the matrix (sinapinic acid, 10 mg/ml in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in a 10:1 ratio (v/v), and 1 μl of the resulting mixture was spotted onto a stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization plate. Analysis was performed on an Autoflex® matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight biospectrometry work station (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) in a positive linear mode. The mass scale was externally calibrated utilizing cytochrome c. Both singly and doubly charged ions were used for a molecular mass determination. β-Ketoacyl-ACP Synthase Assay—The β-ketoacyl synthase activities were assayed according to Garwin et al. (16.Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation mixture (total volume 20 μl) contained 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 660 nm malonyl/acetyl transferase (a recombinant form of the single domain derived from the rat cytosolic type I FAS (17.Rangan V.S. Serre L. Witkowska H.E. Bari A. Smith S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)), 10 μm ACPmit, 20 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (52 Ci/mol), 1–50 μm acyl-ACPmit, and 25 ng (27 nm) of mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase. The malonyl-ACPmit was first generated from malonyl-CoA and ACPmit, using malonyl/acetyl transferase, by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Then the reaction was started by addition of acyl-ACPmit and mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase, continued for 2 min at 37 °C, and finally terminated by the addition of 0.4 ml of reducing reagent (0.1 m K2HPO4, 0.4 m KCl, 30% tetrahydrofuran, and 5 mg/ml NaBH4). The contents of the assay tubes were mixed vigorously and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Toluene (0.4 ml) was added, the contents of the tubes were vortexed for 2 min, and a portion (0.4 ml) of the upper phase was taken for liquid scintillation spectrometry. Blank reactions were performed without acyl-ACPmit. Kinetic parameters were determined using EnzymeKinetics (Trinity Software); values represent the means ± S.D. for calculations using Lineweaver-Burk and non-linear regression methods. Effects of Cerulenin on Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase Activity— Mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase (0.25 μg) was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with 0–1 mm cerulenin in a final volume of 20 μl. Portions of the reaction mixture were then assayed for residual activity in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 660 nm malonyl/acetyl transferase, 10 μm ACPmit, 20 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (52 Ci/mol), 10 μm C6:0-ACPmit, and 25 ng of β-ketoacyl synthase (final volume of 20 μl). Identification of the Putative Human Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase—A single candidate sequence for a freestanding, type II β-ketoacyl synthase was identified in both the human and mouse genomic sequence data bases (sequences 85% identical). Compared with β-ketoacyl synthase sequences from prokaryotes, the putative 459-residue mammalian mitochondrial counterparts have extensions of ∼40 residues at the N termini that are rich in basic amino acids and lack acidic residues (Fig. 1). These features are characteristic of mitochondrial targeting sequence elements. The sequence of a recently discovered β-ketoacyl synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana also includes an N-terminal extension that functions as a mitochondrial targeting sequence (18.Yasuno R. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Wada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, sequences for fungal mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthases do not include obvious N-terminal extensions, although the actual sequences at the N termini possess the general characteristics of mitochondrial targeting sequence elements. Thus, it is unclear at present how these fungal enzymes are targeted for import into mitochondria. X-ray crystallographic analysis and mutagenesis of β-ketoacyl synthases associated with type II FAS systems have established the importance of several residues in the functioning of this type of enzyme (19.Moche M. Dehesh K. Edwards P. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Moche M. Schneider G. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol.

A multiple sequence alignment revealed that all of these residues were positionally conserved in the putative mammalian mitochondrial enzymes, as well as in the confirmed plant and fungal mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthases (Fig. 1). These residues included the cysteine nucleophile (residue 209), two catalytic histidine residues thought to be required for promoting the decarboxylation of malonyl moieties (residues 348 and 385), an essential lysine of uncertain function (residue 380), a glycine residue that allows entrance into the substrate-binding tunnel (residue 273), two threonine residues that hydrogen bond with the ACP phosphopantetheine moiety (residues 350 and 352), and a glycine-rich motif near the C terminus that contributes to the oxyanion hole (residues 443–449). This analysis provided a strong indication that mammalian nuclear genomes encode a single, type II β-ketoacyl synthase having an extended sequence at the N terminus. The coding sequence for the human enzyme is located on chromosome 3 (3p24.2) and that for the mouse counterpart on chromosome 14. Verification That the Putative Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase Contains an N-terminal Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence—A cDNA encoding the putative human β-ketoacyl synthase mitochondrial targeting sequence (residues 1–38) fused in-frame with the coding sequence for EGFP, a red-shifted variant of green fluorescent protein, was coexpressed in HeLa cells together with a fusion protein consisting of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of cytochrome c coupled to the Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that the KSmit1–38-EGFP colocalized with the red fluorescent mitochondrial marker protein (Fig. 2). In contrast, the EGFP protein lacking the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence of the β-ketoacyl synthase expressed throughout the cytoplasm. Thus, this experiment confirmed that the N-terminal region of the full-length β-ketoacyl synthase indeed is a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Complementation of the Yeast cem1 Mutant Strain by the Human β-Ketoacyl Synthase—The in vivo function of the cDNA-encoded human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase was established by complementation of the mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase defect of a S. cerevisiae cem1 mutant (2.Harington A. Herbert C.J. Tung B. Getz G.S. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This mutation is characterized by a nuclear-encoded respiratory-defective petite phenotype, resulting in the inability to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol or lactate. Consequently, the four spores originating from a sporulated BY4743 diploid consist of two lactate-positive and two lactate-negative segregants (Fig. 3B). In accordance with the use of kanMX4 as a disruption cassette for CEM1, the two lactate-negative spores are G418-resistant (Fig. 3B). In contrast, sporulation of BY4743 cells transformed with pKSmit-GFP resulted in four respiratory-competent spores, even though two of them were again G418-resistant and hence contained the defective cem1Δ allele (Fig. 3A). Obviously, the β-ketoacyl synthase defect in these cells was compensated by the human β-ketoacyl synthase homolog expressed from pKSmit-GFP. Because this plasmid contains the yeast URA3 gene as a selection marker, the uracil-prototrophy of all four spores proved the equal distribution of the multicopy plasmid among the meiotic segregants. The C-terminal fusion of GFP to pKSmit-GFP-encoded human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase apparently did not interfere with the β-ketoacyl synthase function. Furthermore, the successful complementation of the respiratory defect implied that the mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus of the human β-ketoacyl synthase was recognized in the fungal host. This conclusion was supported by the observation that in situ fluorescence elicited by the C-terminal GFP marker was not distributed throughout the cytoplasm but was limited to specific regions of the cell likely corresponding to mitochondria (data not shown). Tissue Distribution of Human Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase—Analysis of a multiple tissue Northern blot with a radiolabeled cDNA probe revealed that mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase transcripts are most abundant in the heart and skeletal muscle, as well as the liver and kidney, tissues that contain high levels of active mitochondria (Fig. 4). Transcripts were present at relatively low levels in the placenta, brain, spleen, and lung and were barely detectable in the colon, thymus, and leukocytes. This relatively broad tissue expression contrasts with that of the type I cytosolic FAS, which is not expressed at significant levels in heart or skeletal muscle and is expressed at high levels in tissues such as liver that are involved in lipogenesis and energy homeostasis. Expression and Purification of the Human Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase—The mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase construct KSmit38, in which the first 37 residues constituting the mitochondrial targeting sequence were replaced by a His6-tag, expressed well in E. coli, although appreciable amounts of the protein were sequestered in inclusion bodies when the cells were grown at temperatures above 20 °C. The protein could be obtained in high purity by two successive metal-ion affinity chromatography steps, and its mobility on SDS-PAGE corresponded closely to that of a species with the expected molecular mass of 45.8 kDa (Fig. 5). Substrate Specificity and Kinetic Properties of the Human Mitochondrial β-Ketoacyl Synthase—The type II FAS systems of prokaryotes and chloroplasts typically employ a specialized enzyme (β-ketoacyl synthase III) for catalysis of the first elongation step that uses acetyl-CoA, rather than acetyl-ACP, as the primer. Therefore, the possibility that the mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase could utilize acetyl-CoA directly as a substrate for elongation was evaluated using the malonyl thioester of human mitochondrial ACP (ACPmit) as the chain extender; however, no activity was observed even when high concentrations (0.725 μm) of enzyme were used. For evaluation of catalytic activity using various acyl-ACPmit thioesters as primers, we devised a novel, simple, efficient procedure for synthesis of these substrates by exploiting the broad substrate specificity of the human phosphopantetheinyl transferase. This enzyme will transfer the phosphopantetheinyl moiety from CoA to a variety of apoACPs, essentially independent of whether the donor CoA substrate is offered as the free thiol, or as an acyl-CoA thioester. Thus, acyl-CoAs containing 2–16 C atoms were all efficiently converted to the corresponding acyl-ACPs by this enzyme. The human phosphopantetheinyl transferase has a remarkably broad tolerance not only for the acyl-S-phosphopantetheinyl donor but also for the carrier protein acceptor and can phosphopantetheinylate both peptidyl and acyl carrier proteins from prokaryotes and eukaryotes (15.Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzyme is ideally suited for routine synthesis of acyl-ACPs of any acyl chain length and ACP origin. In the kinetic studies, care was taken to validate steady state conditions with each substrate. Typically, only 27 nm enzyme and incubation times of 2 min were used. When 40-fold higher concentrations of enzyme were used, a significant radiolabel from malonyl moieties was recovered in the"
https://openalex.org/W1969816095,"Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase is conserved through evolution and regulates initiation and progression of DNA replication. In human, ASK/hsDbf4 binds and activates huCdc7 during S phase and this kinase complex is essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation. Drf1/ASKL1, a second human Dbf4/ASK-related protein, shares three conserved Dbf4 motifs previously identified on all of the Dbf4-related molecules. Drf1/ASKL1 can bind and activate huCdc7, and Cdc7-ASKL1 complex phosphorylates MCM2. ASKL1 transcription and protein levels oscillate during cell cycle and increase at late S to G2/M phases. The protein is detected predominantly in the nuclear-soluble fraction but not in the chromatin-bound fraction. Inhibition of Drf1/ASKL1 expression by siRNA results in attenuation of cell growth and in the increase of late S and G2/M phase population. siRNA treatment on synchronized cell population revealed that S phase progression is delayed when ASKL1 protein level is decreased. S phase delay may be linked to replication fork block, because increased levels of γH2AX and activated form of Chk2 are detected with ASKL1 siRNA in the absence of any additional DNA damages. Furthermore, mitotic progression is retarded in ASKL1 or Cdc7 siRNA-treated cells. Our results suggest that ASKL1 in a complex with Cdc7 may play a role in normal progression of both S and M phases. Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase is conserved through evolution and regulates initiation and progression of DNA replication. In human, ASK/hsDbf4 binds and activates huCdc7 during S phase and this kinase complex is essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation. Drf1/ASKL1, a second human Dbf4/ASK-related protein, shares three conserved Dbf4 motifs previously identified on all of the Dbf4-related molecules. Drf1/ASKL1 can bind and activate huCdc7, and Cdc7-ASKL1 complex phosphorylates MCM2. ASKL1 transcription and protein levels oscillate during cell cycle and increase at late S to G2/M phases. The protein is detected predominantly in the nuclear-soluble fraction but not in the chromatin-bound fraction. Inhibition of Drf1/ASKL1 expression by siRNA results in attenuation of cell growth and in the increase of late S and G2/M phase population. siRNA treatment on synchronized cell population revealed that S phase progression is delayed when ASKL1 protein level is decreased. S phase delay may be linked to replication fork block, because increased levels of γH2AX and activated form of Chk2 are detected with ASKL1 siRNA in the absence of any additional DNA damages. Furthermore, mitotic progression is retarded in ASKL1 or Cdc7 siRNA-treated cells. Our results suggest that ASKL1 in a complex with Cdc7 may play a role in normal progression of both S and M phases. Cell cycle progression of eukaryotic cells is strictly regulated by a series of phosphorylation events. Among them, multiple cyclin-dependent kinases play crucial roles to facilitate the progression of cell cycle at various stages. Multiple cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases have been identified in various eukaryotes, each acting at specific stages of the cell cycles (1.Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Spurr N.K. Nurse P.

Conserved cyclin-box sequences have been identified on the cyclin molecules, and significant homology is present in the kinase-conserved domains of various cyclin-dependent kinases (8.Radzio-Andzelm E.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, the presence of a second set of Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase, Spo4-Spo6, was reported (24.Nakamura T. Kishida M. Shimoda C. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25.Nakamura T. Nakamura-Kubo M. Nakamura T. Shimoda C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas only one set of Cdc7-Dbf4 has been identified on the genome of budding yeast. Spo4 and Spo6 were shown to play essential roles during meiosis but not during the mitotic cell cycle, in contrast to Hsk1-Dfp1/Him1, which is essential for cell viability. The presence of more than one Cdc7-Dbf4-related kinase in a single eukaryotic species suggests a possibility that they also constitute a novel kinase family, each member of which may play distinct roles in cell cycle progression.We have identified a novel human cDNA, designated ASKL1, 1The abbreviations used are: ASK, activator of S-phase kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; siRNA, small interference RNA.1The abbreviations used are: ASK, activator of S-phase kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; siRNA, small interference RNA. which shares significant homology with Dbf4 protein family. ASKL1 is identical to Drf1 reported recently by Montagnoli et al. (26.Montagnoli A. Bosotti R. Villa F. Rialland M. Brotherton D. Mercurio C. Berthelsen J. Santocanale C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was reported that Drf1 binds to huCdc7 and activates its kinase activity and that its transcription and protein levels increase during late S to G2/M. The protein exists in nuclei, and its role in S phase progression is speculated (26.Montagnoli A. Bosotti R. Villa F. Rialland M. Brotherton D. Mercurio C. Berthelsen J. Santocanale C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the functional analyses of Drf1 have not been conducted and its precise roles during cell cycle remained elusive. Therefore, we have undertaken studies aimed at clarifying the roles of the Cdc7-ASKL1 complex during cell cycle regulation of human cells.We have found that Drf1/ASKL1 is primarily recovered in nuclear-soluble fractions but is not associated with Triton-insoluble chromatin fractions. To elucidate biological functions of the Cdc7-ASKL1 complex, we examined the effects of down-regulation of Drf1/ASKL1 expression by siRNA on cell cycle progression. Inhibition of Drf1/ASKL1 expression resulted in retardation of both S phase and M phase progression. We discuss possible mechanisms of how Drf1/ASKL1 may regulate the cell cycle through association with huCdc7 kinase subunit.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDevelopment of Antibody against ASKL1 Protein—DNA encoding a polypeptide of ASKL1 (residues 211–355; minimum ASKL1) was amplified by PCR (5′-CGGGGATCCCCGGAACATGTCCAGCAGCA-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTCACCTGGGGAGGCCAGCCTG-3′) and cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-5X-3 to generate a GST-ASKL1[minimum] fusion protein. The protein was insoluble after overexpression and purified from inclusion bodies by extraction into SDS-PAGE running buffer followed by dialysis against PBS containing 0.1% SDS. The antibody was developed in rabbit, and the serum was run through a GST-affinity column to remove GST-reactive antibody and was further affinity-purified by adsorption to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to which purified His-tagged ASKL1c protein (448 amino acids, also see Supplemental Fig. S2B) was transferred. The ASKL1c cDNA was amplified by 5′-GAGGATCCCATATGAGCGAACCGGGAAAGGGAGAC-3′ and 5′-CGAATTCTAGTGATGATGGTGATGATGACAGGAATGTCCGCCGGGGCA-3′ to be subcloned into a T7 promoter vector, pT7-7. The antibody was eluted from the membrane by 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, and 1 mm EGTA, and the pH of the eluate was adjusted by addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris base.Other Antibodies—Antibodies against huCdc7, anti-huCdc7#1, were described previously (13.Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Anti-H2AX S139P antibody was a gift from Katsuyuki Tamai. Anti-GST, anti-Myc, anti-Iκβ, anti-lamin B2, anti-Chk1, and anti-Chk2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-α-tubulin and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-Chk1 S317P and anti-Chk2 T68P antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-RPA p34 antibody was from NeoMarkers. In some experiments, anti-Cdc7 mouse monoclonal antibody from MBL was also used.Establishment of Stable Cell Lines Expressing GST-ASKL1—A NotI-fragment containing GST-ASKL1[minimum] or GST coding region was cloned at the NotI site of pKU3 vector, and the resulting plasmid DNAs were transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 2 days of incubation, cells were grown in a medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 for 10 days and the surviving colonies were selected. They were further cloned and amplified to establish HeLa cells constitutively expressing GST-ASKL1 or GST protein.Synchronization of Cell Cycle and Cell Fractionation—Cell cycle of HeLa cells was synchronized either by release from G1/S arrest or that from mitotic arrest. For G1/S arrest, the cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 14–16 h twice with a 9-h interval of growth without the drug. For mitotic arrest, the cells were first treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h and then treated with 50 ng/ml nocodazole for 8 or 10 h. The cells then were incubated in the absence of the drug for indicated times and harvested. Half of the cells were resuspended in 70% ethanol and were processed for FACS analyses of cell cycle distribution as described previously (21.Takeda T. Ogino K. Matsui E. Cho M.K. Kumagai H. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5535-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the remaining half was used for cell fractionation. To quantify DNA content histogram, FACS data were analyzed by ModFit LT software (Verity Software House). To fractionate cells into Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions, the cells were resuspended in CSK buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min to obtain Triton-soluble extracts. The Triton-insoluble pellet enriched for chromatin-bound proteins after being washed once with the CSK buffer was resuspended in the same buffer.To fractionate cells into cytoplasm, nuclear-soluble and nuclear pellet fractions, cells washed with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), were homogenized in a minimal volume of the same buffer followed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 3 min to separate the supernatant (cytoplasm) and pellet (nuclei). The pellet was resuspended in CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min to separate the supernatant (nuclear-soluble fractions) and pellet (chromatin-enriched nuclear-insoluble fractions). The pellet was washed once with CSK-Triton X-100 buffer and resuspended in the same buffer.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RT-PCR was conducted on cDNAs generated from the total RNA, which was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) with Expand reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). Sets of primers (5′-CTTGACATTTCCGAACAC-3′/5′-TATTATTTTCACTTTTCGATGT-3′ or 5′-GACTACCTCATGAAGATCCT-3′/5′-GTCCTCCTCGTTACTAGAAC-3′) were used to amplify portions of ASK or actin cDNA, respectively, resulting in generation of a 360 or 442-bp fragment.Detection of BrdUrd Incorporation—After treatment with siRNA and synchronization of HeLa cells, BrdUrd was added at 10 μm and incubation was continued for 30 min before cell harvest at each time point. For immunostaining of BrdUrd-incorporated DNA, recovered cells were fixed with 50 mm glycine, 70% ethanol, pH 2.0, at -30 °C for 30 min and washed with PBS. Immunostaining was conducted as recommended by the manufacturer (5-bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine labeling kit, Roche Applied Science). DNA was costained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The coverslips then were washed with PBS and mounted with PBS containing 90% glycerol, 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane (DABCO, Sigma). Samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiophot) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera. Images were processed with software Aquacosmos (Hamamatsu Photonics). Classification of “strong” or “weak” positive cells was determined by pixel intensities of the BrdUrd-incorporating cells in the digital fluorescent images.For detection of BrdUrd-incorporating cells by flow cytometry, cells were denatured with 2 n HCl at room temperature for 20 min and washed with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After neutralization with 0.1 m Na2B4O7 for 2 min, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) followed by incubation with propidium iodide to detect total DNA. Both fluorescence images were analyzed simultaneously by FAC-SCalibur (BD Biosciences).siRNAs and Transfection—Four sets of double-stranded siRNA specific to ASKL1 were generated. They are as follows: ASKL1-1, 5′-CAGUUUUUGACGGGGGCCATT-3′ + 5′-UGGCCCCCGUCAAAAACUGTT-3′; ASKL1-2, 5′-CAGCUGUCUUGCGUCUUTT-3′ + 5′-AAGACGCAAGAGACAGCUGTT-3′; ASKL1-3, 5′-GUUACAUCGUGUCCAGCCGTT-3′ + 5′-CGGCUGGACACGAUGUAACTT-3′; and ASKL1-4, 5′-GCCCAUCUAUAUGCAGAAGTT-3′ + 5′-CUUCUGCAUAUAGAUGGGCTT-3′. siRNAs for Cdc7 and ASK were 5′-GCUCAGCAGGAAAGGUGUUTT-3′ + 5′-AACACCUUUCCUGCUGAGCTT-3′ and 5′-GUCCAGAAUCUGCAUAUACTT-3′ + 5′-GUAUAUGCAGAUUCUGGACTT-3′, respectively. siRNA for luciferase used as a negative control in some experiments was 5′-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGATT-3′ + 5′-UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAGTT-3′. In some experiments, only sense strand of ASKL1-1 siRNA was transfected as a control. In the siRNA experiments targeting ASKL1, ASKL1-1 siRNA was used unless it was specifically noted. Transfection of siRNA was conducted by using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen).RESULTSIdentification of Human ASKL1—We previously reported the presence of three short stretches of amino acids conserved in Dbf4-related molecules and named them Dbf4 motif-N, -M, and -C (27.Masai H. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Further characterization of these motifs revealed that the motif-M and -C polypeptides are capable of binding to the catalytic subunit and that the bipartite binding of these two motifs is essential and sufficient for activation of Cdc7 kinase (28.Ogino K. Takeda T. Matsui E. Iiyama H. Taniyama C. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31376-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29.Sato N. Nakayama M. Arai K. Genes Cells. 2004; 8: 451-463Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Data base search revealed the presence of a genomic DNA segment derived from the human chromosome 17, which has a potential of encoding an amino acid segment sharing a homology with Dbf4 motif-C. We then further searched the genomic region for the presence of sequences resembling Dbf4 motif-M and -N. We found genomic segments potentially encoding motif-N and motif-M, enabling us to amplify the cDNA, which we named ASKL1. We also found the potential C-terminal segment of ASKL1 on the genomic data base. Consequently, we were able to obtain a putative full-length ASKL1 cDNA encoding a 615 amino acid coding region, which contained the three conserved Dbf4 motifs and shared 25% overall identity with human ASK. ASKL1 turned out to be identical to Drf1 as reported by Montagnoli et al. (26.Montagnoli A. Bosotti R. Villa F. Rialland M. Brotherton D. Mercurio C. Berthelsen J. Santocanale C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Drf1/ASKL1 is composed of a N-terminal segment (35% identity with huASK) carrying conserved Dbf4 motif-N, -M, and -C and a long C-terminal tail that is much less conserved (Supplemental Fig. S1).Complex Formation with huCdc7 and Kinase Activation—As reported previously, Drf1/ASKL1 binds to huCdc7 and forms a complex. We have confirmed this by expressing them both in insect cells (Supplemental Fig. S2A) and mammalian cells.We have identified four distinct transcripts for Drf1/ASKL1 (ASKL1a, ASKL1b, ASKL1c, and ASKL1d, see Supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). We then expressed these four forms of the FLAG-tagged ASKL1 derivatives in combination with GST-tagged huCdc7 in insect cells and attempted to purify the huCdc7-ASKL1 complex through glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. S2D). Affinity-purified huCdc7-ASKL1a or huCdc7-ASKL1c complex can phosphorylate MCM2 in the MCM2·MCM4·MCM6·MCM7 complex causing the downward mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (Supplemental Fig. S2E, lanes 3 and 1), as observed with the huCdc7-ASK complex. However, ASKL1b or ASKL1d lacking motif-M or both motif-M and motif-C, respectively, did not generate a complex with Cdc7 (Supplemental Fig. S2D, lanes 5–8). We have also coexpressed GST-fused ASKL1 polypeptide (residues 211–355; GST-ASKL1[minimum]) and hemagglutinin-tagged huCdc7 in bacterial cells and purified the complex. The wild-type complex was active in phosphorylating MCM2 in the MCM2·MCM4·MCM6·MCM7 (data not shown). These results indicate that Drf1/ASKL1 can form active kinase complexes with huCdc7 and that the amino acid segment containing motif-M and motif-C is required and sufficient for the generation of an active kinase.We also examined whether endogenous huCdc7 associates with Drf1/ASKL1. We have established a stable HeLa cell line expressing GST-ASKL1 fusion protein containing the “minimum” ASKL1 region (Dbf4 motif-M and -C) under a constitutively active promoter. In control, a stable cell line expressing GST alone was also established. The GST-ASKL1[minimum] stable cell line was synchronized by hydroxyurea arrest, and GST-ASKL1 was pulled down from the Triton-soluble extracts at 0 h (early S) and 9 h (G2/M) after release. Western blotting confirmed the presence of GST-ASKL1 protein. More GST-ASKL1 was pulled down from the G2/M extracts (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). In the same fraction, huCdc7 protein was detected and its amount was roughly proportional to that of GST-ASKL1. In control, the pull down from HeLa cells expressing GST alone indicated the presence of an equal amount of GST protein in early S and G2/M extracts but no huCdc7 was detected (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Endogenous ASKL1 protein was immunoprecipitated next with affinity-purified anti-ASKL1 antibody from Triton-soluble extracts of asynchronous culture (Fig. 1B, left panel, lane 1), and Cdc7 was detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, right panel, lane 4). The interaction was detected at any stages of cell cycles, but ASKL1-bound fractions of huCdc7 appeared to increase during S phase (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that endogenous huCdc7 forms a complex with ASKL1 throughout the cell cycle.Expression of Drf1/ASKL1 during Cell Cycle—Transcription of human ASK is known to fluctuate during the cell cycle, increasing at late G1 and staying at a high level during the S phase (16.Kumagai H. Sato N. Yamada M. Mahony D. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were synchronized, and the expression of Drf1/ASKL1 was examined by Northern analyses during cell cycle progression. After release from hydroxyurea arrest, the Drf1/ASKL1 transcript increased at 8–10 h after release when the cells were in late S to G2 and started to increase again at the next late S phase (24 h after release) (Supplemental Fig. S3A). In the release from arrest at mitosis by TN-16 treatment, transcription of Drf1/ASKL1 was high at the time of release and decreased as the cell cycle progressed into G1/S. It increased again in the next late S phase (Supplemental Fig. S3B). This result indicates that transcription of Drf1/ASKL1 is regulated during cell cycle and increases at the late stage of DNA synthesis through G2 and mitosis. Transcription of Drf1/ASKL1 was detected in various other cell lines including human kidney-derived 293 cells and human amnion-derived FL cells, and its level in these cell lines also increased after arrest with TN-16 (data not shown).Affinity-purified anti-ASKL1 antibody was used to identify the endogenous Drf1/ASKL1 protein. Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were prepared from asynchronously growing HeLa cells and were examined by Western blotting. The bands migrating slightly faster than FLAG-tagged ASKL1 expressed in COS7 cells were identified in the Triton-soluble fraction. To confirm that this band indeed represents the endogenous Drf1/ASKL1 protein, we conducted siRNA experiments. We have designed four different siRNA derived from different portions of Drf1/ASKL1 as well as control siRNA derived from the luciferase gene. The intensities of the putative Drf1/ASKL1 protein bands decreased with ASKL1-1 and ASKL1-2 siRNA but not with other siRNAs (Fig. 2A). This result strongly indicates that they represent the endogenous ASKL1 protein. We were not able to determine the cause for the presence of two bands.Fig. 2Depletion of Drf1/ASKL1 protein causes retardation of cell growth in HeLa cells.A, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA as shown, and Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against the proteins indicated. Luc, luciferase; #1, ASKL1-1; #2, ASKL1-2; #3, ASKL1-3; and #4, ASKL1-4. B, asynchronously growing HeLa cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic (lane 1, C), nuclear-soluble (lane 2, NS), and nuclear pellet (lane 3, NP) as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were blotted with ASKL1 antibody. C, HeLa cells transfected with control (sense strand of ASKL1 siRNA; C, lanes 1 and 2), ASKL1 (lanes 3 and 4), ASK (lanes 5 and 6), or Cdc7 (lanes 7 and 8) siRNA were collected at 48 h after transfection and were fractionated into Triton-soluble (S) and -insoluble (P) fractions. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated. D, RT-PCR was conducted with total RNA prepared from the HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or ASK siRNA (lanes 2, 4, and 6). The transcription of ASK (upper panel) or actin (lower panel) was analyzed by specific primers. E, the numbers of viable HeLa cells in 60-mm culture dishes (upper panel) or those of viable U2OS cells in a 24-well plate (lower panel) were counted at the times indicated after transfection. As controls, sense-strand RNA for ASKL1 (HeLa) or for luciferase siRNA (U2OS) were used. This experiment was conducted at least three times with similar results, and representative data are shown. Open column, 2 days after transfection; filled column, 3 days after transfection. F, FACS analyses of DNA content of control or ASKL1 siRNA-transfected HeLa cells at 48 h after transfection. G, phase-contrast images of ASKL1, ASK, or Cdc7-depleted cells at 48 h after transfection. Magnification: ×10 (upper) or ×20 (lower). Images were observed by IX50 (Olympus) and recorded by digital camera C-4100 (Olympus).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Drf1/ASKL1 protein level was examined in cells in which cell cycle was synchronized by release from double thymidine block-induced G1/S arrest. The Drf1/ASKL1 protein was detected almost exclusively in the nuclear-soluble fraction (Fig. 2B). The protein level increased as the cells entered late S through G2/M (9–12 h), slightly decreased during G1-S (18 h), and increased again at next late S to G2 (24 h) (Supplemental Fig. S3C). Drf1/ASKL1 protein was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction at a low level but was not detected in the Triton-soluble chromatin-enriched fractions throughout the cell cycle (data not shown). These results indicate that the Drf1/ASKL1 protein level oscillates during cell cycle and increases at late S to G2/M and that the protein is almost exclusively present in the nuclear-soluble fraction.To examine whether the protein level oscillates in a manner independent from transcriptional regulation, stably expressed GST-ASKL1[minimum] protein under the control of a constitutive promoter was examined. The cells were released from hydroxyurea arrest and were fractionated into cytoplasm and nuclear-soluble and nuclear pellet fractions. The levels of the stably expressed proteins were detected by anti-GST antibody (Supplemental Fig. S3D). The majority of GST protein was detected in cytoplasmic fractions, and a small amount was detected in nuclear-soluble fractions at a constant level throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, GST-ASKL1 protein was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear-soluble fractions but not in nuclear pellet fractions. The total amount of GST-ASKL1 protein peaked at late S to G2/M phase. The protein level in nuclear-soluble fractions reached maximum at 6–8 h after release (late S to G2), decreased at 10–12 h (M to G1), and increased again at 24 h (late S), whereas the protein level in cytoplasm reached maximum at 10 h after release. In controls, RPA p34 subunits were detected in nuclear pellet (enriched in chromatin-bound proteins) only during S phase and Iκβ protein was recovered only in cytoplasm fractions, verifying the procedure of cell fractionation. Because the transcription of the exogenous GST-ASKL1 is under a constitutive promoter (30.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the result indicates that the level of Drf1/ASKL1 protein is regulated at post-transcriptional levels as well.Potential Roles of Drf1/ASKL1 during Cell Cycle Progression—To obtain insight into the roles of Drf1/ASKL1 in human cell cycle progression, we have examined the effect of reducing the level of Drf1/ASKL1, ASK, and Cdc7 proteins in HeLa cells. The knockdown of target proteins or transcript was confirmed by immunoblotting or RT-PCR in HeLa cells treated with siRNA specific to ASKL1, ASK, or Cdc7. Drf1/ASKL1 and Cdc7 protein levels were reduced in Drf1/ASKL1 and Cdc7 siRNA-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4 and 7 and 8). Drf1/ASKL1 protein level was reduced also in Cdc7 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2C, lane 7). Reduction of ASK expression was confirmed by RT-PCR with ASK siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2D, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Interestingly, in ASK-depleted cells, the Cdc7 protein level also significantly decreased (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6) but not in ASKL1-depleted cells.Drf1/ASKL1 siRNA slowed down the rate of cell growth. In HeLa cells, the knockdown of ASKL1 resulted in the reduction of cell counts by 36% compared with control siRNA at 3 days after treatment (Fig. 2E, upper panel). Significant growth retardation was observed also in U2OS cells treated with ASKL1 siRNA (Fig. 2E, lower panel). The majority of ASK-depleted cells appeared to stop growth and undergo cell death at as early as 24 h after siRNA treatment. The phenotypes of Cdc7-depleted cells were similar to those of ASK-depleted cells, although cell death was not triggered until later time poi"
https://openalex.org/W2041705439,"Transcription is regulated by a network of transcription factors and related cofactors that act in concert with the general transcription machinery. Elucidating their underlying interactions is important for understanding the mechanisms regulating transcription. Recently, we have shown that Krüppel-like factor KLF5, a member of the Sp/KLF family of zinc finger factors and a key regulator of cardiovascular remodeling, is regulated positively by the acetylase p300 and negatively by the oncogenic regulator SET through coupled interaction and regulation of acetylation. Here, we have shown that the deacetylase HDAC1 can negatively regulate KLF5 through direct interaction. KLF5 interacts with HDAC1 in the cell and <i>in vitro</i>. Gel shift DNA binding assay showed that their interaction inhibits the DNA binding activity of KLF5, suggesting a property of HDAC1 to directly affect the DNA binding affinity of a transcription factor. Reporter assay also revealed that HDAC1 suppresses KLF5-dependent promoter activation. Additionally, overexpression of HDAC1 suppressed KLF5-dependent activation of its endogenous downstream gene, platelet-derived growth factor-A chain gene, when activated by phorbol ester. Further, HDAC1 binds to the first zinc finger of KLF5, which is the same region where p300 interacts with KLF5 and, intriguingly, HDAC1 inhibits binding of p300 to KLF5. Direct competitive interaction between acetylase and deacetylase has been hitherto unknown. Collectively, the transcription factor KLF5 is negatively regulated by the deacetylase HDAC1 through direct effects on its activities (DNA binding activity, promoter activation) and further through inhibition of interaction with p300. These findings suggest a novel role and mechanism for regulation of transcription by deacetylase."
https://openalex.org/W2085036618,"Previous studies reached different conclusions about whether class I hyaluronan synthases (HASs) elongate hyaluronic acid (HA) by addition to the reducing or the nonreducing end. Here we used two strategies to determine the direction of HA synthesis by purified class I HASs from Streptococcus equisimilis and Streptococcus pyogenes. In the first strategy we used each of the two UDP-sugar substrates separately to pulse label either the beginning or the end of HA chains. We then quantified the relative rates of radioactive HA degradation by treatment with β-glycosidases that act at the nonreducing end. The results with both purified HASs demonstrated that HA elongation occurred at the reducing end. In the second strategy, we used purified S. equisimilis HAS, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP[β-32P]-Glc-NAc to radiolabel nascent HA chains. Under conditions of limiting substrate, the 32P-labeled products were separated from the substrates by paper chromatography and identified as HA-[32P]UDP saccharides based on their degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase or hyaluronidase and by their binding to a specific HA-binding protein. The 32P radioactivity was chased (released) by incubation with unlabeled UDP-sugars, showing that the HA-UDP linkages turn over during HA biosynthesis. In contrast, HA-[32P]UDP products made by the purified class II Pasteurella multocida HAS were not released by adding unlabeled UDP-sugars, consistent with growth at the nonreducing end for this enzyme. The results demonstrate that the streptococcal class I HAS enzymes polymerize HA chains at the reducing end.

The molecular masses of the streptococcal (∼49 kDa) or eukaryotic (∼65 kDa) HASs are relatively small in view of the multiple functions mediated by these enzymes in order to synthesize HA (8.Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

HAS binds UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in the presence of MgCl2 and catalyzes two distinct intracellular glycosyltransferase reactions. HAS also binds and translocates the growing HA chain through the enzyme, thereby extruding the polymer through the cell membrane, and releases the HA chain extracellularly after up to 50,000 monosaccharides (∼107 Da) have been assembled. Based on differences in protein structure and mechanism of action, the known HASs have been categorized into two classes (5.DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Class I members include HASs from Streptococcus, mammals, and other eukaryotes, whereas the bacterial HAS from Pasteurella multocida is the only class II member. Despite great progress in our understanding of HAS structure and function, there is still controversy regarding the direction of HA synthesis. Stoolmiller and Dorfman (9.Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded in 1969 that the streptococcal HAS adds new sugars to the nonreducing end of HA. In conflict with this result, Prehm in 1983 (10.Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Asplund et al. in 1998 (11.Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) performed studies with membranes from eukaryotic cells and concluded that HA synthesis occurs at the reducing end. Although differences in the contributions of the three mammalian HAS isoenzymes to these latter results were not considered, it is highly likely that the mechanisms of HA chain elongation for all of the class I HAS members are the same (3.Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recently, Hoshi et al. (12.Hoshi H. Nakagawa H. Nishiguchi S. Iwata K.

Because the crude membranes used in all the above studies contain multiple glycosyltransferases, some of these reported results might have alternate interpretations. To resolve these conflicting results about the direction of HA synthesis, which is a fundamental mechanistic feature of HAS function, we performed several types of experiments using two purified streptococcal HASs. Our results verify that addition of new saccharides does occur at the reducing end. Materials, Strains, and Plasmids—Reagents were supplied by Sigma unless stated otherwise. Media components were from Difco. The has gene from Streptococcus equisimilis or Streptococcus pyogenes was inserted into the pKK223-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and cloned into E. coli SURE™ cells (2.DeAngelis P.L.

Each HAS contained a C-terminal fusion of six His residues to facilitate purification (14.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

UDP[32P]-GlcNAc (containing [32P]phosphate in the β position) was synthesized at a specific radioactivity of ∼50 Ci/mmol as described by Reitman et al. (16.Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S.

Cell Growth and Membrane Preparation—E. coli SURE™ cells containing the HAS-encoding plasmids were grown at 32 °C in Luria broth, HAS expression was induced, and membranes containing seHAS or spHAS were prepared as described recently (18.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baron C.A. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9234-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The membrane pellets were washed once with PBS containing 1.3 m glycerol and protease inhibitors, sonicated briefly, aliquoted, and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final pellets were stored at -80 °C (14.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

HAS was eluted with 25 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.7 m glycerol, 1 mm dodecylmaltoside, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 46 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 mm histidine. HAS activity was determined using the standard assay conditions described previously (14.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Pulse Labeling of HA Chains and Direction of Synthesis Assay— Purified seHAS or spHAS was prepared as noted above, except that the enzyme was not eluted from the Ni-NTA column after washing. Instead, the bound enzyme was incubated for two short successive periods designed to label HA chains early or late during one round of chain synthesis. There were four labeling situations for each HAS, namely early or late labeling with either UDP-[14C]GlcUA or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. The first incubation was for 1.5 min at 22 °C with 0.08 mm UDP-GlcUA and 0.08 mm UDP-GlcNAc as well as 0.14 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcUA, 0.2 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, or no radiolabeled UDP-sugar. The HA·HAS·Ni-NTA resin complex was then washed with 4 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Na2KPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% dodecylmaltoside, and 2 m glycerol), and the second labeling mixture was then added. After 1.5 min at 22 °C the resin was washed as above, and the radiolabeled HA was eluted with digestion buffer (25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, containing 50 mm NaCl) at 37 °C for 1 h. Recovery of labeled HA was essentially complete as judged by the subsequent elution of bound HAS and any remaining HA with 1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 1-ml sample of labeled HA (∼ 50,000 dpm) was then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times (Fig. 1) with 5 units of β-glucuronidase and 0.15 units of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The exoglycosidase digestions were terminated by the addition of SDS to a 2% (w/v) final concentration at room temperature. The amount of [14C]HA or [3H]HA remaining was determined by descending paper chromatography using Whatman 3MM paper developed in 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, and ethanol (7:13). The piece (∼1 × 1 cm) at the origin containing large HA products was cut out and incubated in 1 ml of distilled water overnight; 5 ml of UltimaGold scintillation fluid (Packard) was added, and radioactivity was determined using a Packard model A2300 scintillation counter. Controls included samples treated with only one exoglycosidase or sheep testicular hyaluronidase to verify, respectively, that degradation required both endoglycosidases and that the radiolabeled material was destroyed by hyaluronidase. Synthesis of 32P-labeled HA—UDP[32P]-labeled HA was produced by incubating purified seHAS or pmHAS with 0.025 μm UDP[32P]-GlcNAc and 0.025 μm UDP-GlcUA. These conditions present limiting amounts of UDP-sugars so that the enzymes can only make short HA oligosaccharides. For seHAS, the reaction was performed in 50 μl of 25 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m glycerol, and 2 mm bovine cardiolipin. For pmHAS, the reaction was performed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 m ethylene glycol and 5 mm MnCl2. One μg of purified seHAS or pmHAS was added to initiate HA synthesis, which was allowed to proceed for 1.5 min at 22 °C for seHAS or 6 h at 30 °C for pmHAS. pmHAS has a long lag period for the initiation of HA synthesis, especially at low substrate concentrations. Reactions were then terminated by the addition of 2 mm UDP (14.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At the end of the labeling period in some experiments, the samples were then incubated with unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA (1 mm each), sheep testicular hyaluronidase, or snake venom phosphodiesterase for 3 h at 30 °C with gentle agitation in a MicroMixer E-36 (Taitec). The 32P-labeled products were separated from unincorporated substrates by descending paper chromatography as described above. The 32P content at the origin and at 1-cm increments along each chromatogram strip were assessed by monitoring Cherenkov radiation using a Packard model A2300 scintillation counter. The Biotin-HABP HA Capture Assay—Streptavidin-coated wells were treated for 1 h at 22 °C with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and either 3 μg/ml biotin-HABP alone, 3 μg/ml biotin-HABP plus 100 μg/ml unlabeled HA, or 3 μg/ml biotin-HABP plus 25 μg/ml free biotin. The treated wells were then washed extensively with PBS/Tween and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with 5–50 μl of a seHAS or pmHAS reaction mix (50 μl total volume) containing 32P-labeled products. The supernatants containing unbound 32P were removed, and the wells were washed. Bound 32P components were removed from each well by three consecutive treatments with 1 mg/ml sheep testicular hyaluronidase in PBS/Tween at 30 °C. Ninety percent of the bound radioactivity was released in the first hyaluronidase digestion. The three digestion supernatants for each well were collected and pooled, and their Cherenkov radiation was determined. Total (100%) bound 32P values were the sum of radioactivity recovered in all three hyaluronidase treatments, which reduced the radioactivity in the wells to background levels (assessed with a Geiger counter). Direction of Synthesis by Degradation of Pulse-labeled HA— Purified seHAS and spHAS were used to pulse label polysaccharide chains (11.Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19.Robbins P.W. Bray D. Dankert M. Wright A. Science. 1967; 158: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). While still bound to the Ni-NTA resin, purified HAS was incubated with both substrates for two successive 1.5-min periods. One of the two UDP-sugars was radiolabeled, either in the first or the last 1.5 min phase of chain synthesis. After the first phase of synthesis, the unincorporated UDP-sugars were washed away, and the second incubation was performed with either radiolabeled UDP-sugar or non-radiolabeled UDP-sugar. This procedure creates four situations in which HA chains are radiolabeled, either with [3H]-GlcNAc or [14C]GlcUA, either at the beginning or at the end of the chain. The labeled HA was eluted and then digested with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and β-glucuronidase for various times (Fig. 1). The combined exoglycosidases were able to degrade the 14C- or 3H-labeled HA completely (not shown). When the HA was pulse-labeled late (the second synthesis phase), the rate of radioactivity release was relatively slow (Fig. 1, A–D, open symbols). In contrast, when the HA was pulse-labeled early (the first synthesis phase), the rate of radioactivity release was relatively fast (Fig. 1, A–D, filled symbols). For example, when HA produced by purified seHAS was labeled with [3H]GlcNAc in the first phase and then incubated with nonlabeled substrates in the second phase, 47 ± 1% of the [3H]HA remained intact after 180 min of glycosidase treatment (Fig. 1D). When the order of labeling was switched so that the last sugars added, rather than the first, were radiolabeled, then 84 ± 3% of the [3H]HA remained after 180 min of digestion. The results were the same for both seHAS and spHAS, using either labeled UDP-sugar in either labeling phase. The earliest sugars incorporated during HA synthesis were released preferentially by the two exoglycosidases. Preferentially released sugars are closer to the nonreducing end, at which the two glycosidases act, whereas sugars that are resistant to release are closer to the reducing end. Thus, the sugars that were added earliest (first) were nearest to the reducing end. As chain growth progressed and chain length increased, these sugars then became closer to the nonreducing end. We conclude that seHAS and spHAS synthesize HA by the addition of monosaccharides to the reducing end of the polysaccharide. To obtain independent evidence for this conclusion, we sought to demonstrate the presence of HA-UDP intermediates that turn over rapidly during HA biosynthesis. As shown in Schemes 1 and 2, the addition of sugars to the reducing end necessarily produces HA-UDP intermediates. Scheme 1, presented here,UDP−GlcUA+UDP−GlcNAc+(HA)n−UDP→(HA)n+1−UDP+UDP+UDPScheme 1 shows the fate of the three UDP groups that participate in one round of disaccharide synthesis. Each UDP-sugar added to the polymer chain is transferred intact, without cleavage of its UDP linkage. The UDP released during each transfer step comes from the HA-UDP intermediate formed by the addition of the previous sugar. Thus, of the two net UDP groups released when a disaccharide unit is assembled at the reducing end, only one UDP comes from the last two UDP-sugars added. The other UDP (set as UDP (boldface) in this example) comes from the last sugar added prior to addition of the new disaccharide unit. Scheme 2, shown here, (i)N−UDP+A−UDP→A−N−UDP+UDP (Eq. 2) (ii)A−N−UDP+A−UDP→A−N−A−UDP+UDP (iii)A−N−A−UDP+N−UDP→A−N−A−N−UDP+UDP illustrates the individual steps in this reaction mechanism with GlcUA and GlcNAc indicated by A and N, respectively, and the UDP groups for these sugars indicated, respectively, by italic or boldface font. Because a key feature of synthesis at the reducing end is the rapid turnover of the UDP groups on growing HA chains, we sought to demonstrate this feature for class I HASs. Using UDP[32P]-GlcNAc and limiting substrate concentrations, we established conditions in which seHAS makes a very large number of shorter HA chains rather than fewer longer chains (Fig. 2). These conditions favor detection of seHAS products that are end-labeled with 32P. After descending paper chromatography, UDP[32P]-GlcNAc and a variety of smaller 32P-labeled breakdowns (such as UDP[32P], UMP[32P], [32P]phosphate and [32P]pyrophosphate) migrated in a broad region ∼17–27 cm from the origin (Fig. 2A). In the presence of purified seHAS most of the 32P products were found at the origin, although this varied from experiment to experiment, but some products also migrated as a broad peak between ∼7 and 13 cm. However, in the absence of seHAS, essentially background radioactivity was detected between the origin and the large peak starting at ∼17 cm (Fig. 2C). When samples were treated with snake venom phosphodiesterase or hyaluronidase prior to chromatography, the radioactivity at the origin and in the 7–13 cm region was substantially reduced, close to that of the no-HAS controls (Fig. 2, B and C). In multiple experiments, the amount of larger 32P products remaining at the origin after chromatography was reduced by ∼80% after treatment with either hyaluronidase or phosphodiesterase (Fig. 2D), supporting the conclusion that these products are UDP[32P]-HA oligomers. As chromatography references, we used reduced HA-alditol oligomers containing 4 or 8 sugars; these migrated, respectively, at 10–15 cm and 0–2 cm (Fig. 2B). In a separate experiment (Fig. 3), similar samples were incubated after the labeling period and prior to chromatography with unlabeled substrates. The “chase” with UDP-sugars eliminated almost all of the 32P products. The results are consistent with the conclusion that seHAS synthesizes HA saccharides that are still linked to UDP and that the HA-[32P]UDP linkage is dynamic. The experiment in Fig. 3 also shows that, at a fixed UDP-sugar concentration, the amount of 32P products first increases and then decreases as the seHAS concentration is increased. A maximum occurred at ∼0.4 μm enzyme; above and below this value 32P incorporation decreased by >90% to near control levels. This biphasic behavior is expected because, as the enzyme concentration decreases, fewer but longer end-labeled HA chains are made (i.e. the maximum number of HA chains is equal to the number of seHAS molecules). As the enzyme concentration increases, shorter and shorter oligosaccharides are made until a point is reached at which, theoretically, only disaccharides or no products can be made. To confirm that seHAS synthesizes HA-UDP, we also developed an HA capture assay using streptavidin-coated wells loaded with biotin-HABP. If the 32P products made by seHAS are HA oligosaccharides, then they should be bound by this highly specific HABP, which is purified from bovine cartilage (20.Kongtawelert P. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In particular, most of the larger HA saccharides remaining at the origin are likely longer than a dodecamer, which is the minimum size needed to occupy the HABP binding site with high affinity (21.Christner J.E. Brown M.L. Dziewiakowski D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4624-4630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These larger HA products are preferentially represented in this assay, because only a few percent of the total radiolabeled products is captured by the biotin-HABP. When increasing volumes of seHAS reaction mix were incubated per well, the amount of bound 32P progressively increased ∼4–5-fold (Fig. 4). However, when the streptavidin-coated wells were treated with either free biotin or unlabeled HA during the initial incubation with biotin-HABP, the amount of bound 32P was decreased by 92 and 88%, respectively. These controls demonstrate that the capture of HA-[32P]UDP in this assay is specifically mediated by the biotin-HABP. Consistent with the conclusion that the 32P products are HA-UDP, virtually all of the captured radioactivity was released by hyaluronidase treatment. Finally, treatment of the seHAS/UDP[32P]-GlcNAc reaction mixes with unlabeled UDP-sugars, hyaluronidase, or phosphodiesterase decreased the 32P radioactivity captured by the biotin-HABP by ∼90% (Fig. 5, black bars). Reaction mixes using the class II pmHAS and UDP[32P]-GlcNAc also produced HA-[32P]UDP products that were captured by the biotin-HABP-coated well assay (Fig. 5, gray bars), as indicated by ∼90% decreases in bound 32P-radioactivity after hyaluronidase or phosphodiesterase treatment. Unlike the results with seHAS, however, the UDP-sugar chase did not decrease the amount of HA-[32P]UDP recovered from pmHAS reactions. With the exception of mouse HAS1 (22.Yoshida M. Itano N. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the mammalian HASs have been very difficult to solubilize and purify. In contrast, we have readily been able to purify large amounts of the recombinant streptococcal HASs (14.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17.Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5153-5160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the streptococcal HASs have been an excellent experimental model in which to address the molecular details of how the class I HAS enzymes function (7.Weigel P.H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine the direction of synthesis by purified seHAS and spHAS, we pulse-labeled HA either at the beginning or at the end of chains during one round of chain synthesis. We then quantified the rate of radioactivity released from the labeled HA by β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, both of which act only at the nonreducing end. The results showed that the first sugars added during HA biosynthesis were preferentially removed by the later glycosidase treatment, i.e. the first sugars added become closer to the nonreducing end as HA chains elongate. Thus, both of the purified class I enzymes extend HA chains by addition to the reducing end and, therefore, the direction of HA chain growth is from the nonreducing to the reducing end of the polysaccharide. Our second strategy to confirm that these class I HASs catalyze HA chain growth at the reducing end used purified seHAS and UDP-GlcNAc, with 32P in the β position, to radiolabel nascent HA chains. The results showed that purified seHAS synthesizes HA with a UDP group remaining at the reducing end of the growing HA chain. HA-[32P]UDP products, made using a high ratio of enzyme-to-substrate, could be separated from the substrates by paper chromatography and were destroyed by treatment with hyaluronidase or phosphodiesterase. Importantly, the 32P could also be removed by “chasing” the enzyme reaction mixtures with excess unlabeled UDP-sugars. These results demonstrate that the [32P]UDP group is present at the reducing end and turns over when a new UDP-sugar is added. For the class II pmHAS, because the sugar addition is at the nonreducing end, a chase had no effect, and the [32P]UDP was not removed from the HA chain. Our results confirm the earlier studies by Prehm (10.Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Asplund et al. (11.Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that class I HASs can elongate at the reducing end. The conflicting results of Stoolmiller and Dorfman (9.Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may have been due to other glycosyltransferases in the crude membrane preparations used, whose products may have confounded the analysis. There are at least two possible explanations for the report (12.Hoshi H. Nakagawa H. Nishiguchi S. Iwata K. Niikura K. Monde K. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2341-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that a recombinant HAS2 fragment, expressed in E. coli, was able to synthesize short oligosaccharides by addition to the nonreducing end. First, because only indirect evidence was obtained in the latter study, the authors did not rule out that another cellular glycosyltransferase, whose specificity was altered by expression of the HAS fragment, was responsible for the observed synthesis. Direct evidence would have been provided if a purified HAS fragment was shown to possess this activity. However, if the results are valid, they indicate a second possibility, i.e. that the normal mode of synthesis by intact HAS may be dramatically altered by elimination of multiple protein domains and disruption of the protein's normal topological organization (3.Weig"
https://openalex.org/W2005891990,"The properties of the protein encoded by YKL174c (TPO5) were studied. It was found that TPO5 excretes putrescine effectively and spermidine less effectively. γ-Aminobutyric acid slightly inhibited the excretion of putrescine, but basic amino acids did not affect excretion, suggesting that TPO5 preferentially recognizes polyamines. Accordingly, yeast cells transformed with the plasmid encoding YKL174c (TPO5) were resistant to toxicity caused by 120 mm putrescine or by 3 mm spermidine, and a mutant with a disrupted YKL174c (TPO5) gene was sensitive to toxicity by 90 mm putrescine. The growth of this mutant was faster than that of the wild-type strain. In parallel, there was an increase in putrescine and spermidine content of the YKL174c (TPO5) mutant compared with wild-type. It is noted that TPO5 functions as a suppressor of cell growth by excreting polyamines. The level of YKL174c (TPO5) mRNA was increased by the addition of polyamines to the medium. The degree of induction of the mRNA was spermine > spermidine > putrescine. The subcellular localization of TPO5 was determined by immunostaining of hemagglutinin-tagged TPO5, and it was found on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles. Excretion of putrescine and spermidine by TPO5 was reduced in cells that have mutations in the secretory or endocytic pathways, indicating that both processes are involved in the excretion of polyamines.

Excretion of putrescine and spermidine by TPO5 was reduced in cells that have mutations in the secretory or endocytic pathways, indicating that both processes are involved in the excretion of polyamines. Polyamines, aliphatic cations present in almost all living organisms, are necessary for normal cell growth (1.Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines.

Intracellular polyamine levels are elaborately regulated by biosynthesis, degradation, and transport (3.Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). With regard to transport, the properties of three polyamine transport systems were characterized in Escherichia coli (4.Kashiwagi K.

They include spermidine-preferential and putrescine-specific uptake systems, which belong to ATP-binding cassette transporters, and a protein, PotE, involved in the excretion of putrescine by a putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified four genes which encode polyamine transport proteins TPO1–TPO4 (7.Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8.Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Among the four polyamine transporters, those encoded by TPO2 and TPO3 were specific for spermine, whereas those encoded by TPO1 and TPO4 recognized putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Furthermore, we recently reported that UGA4, which catalyzes the transport of γ-aminobutyric acid (9.André B. Hein C. Grenson M. Jauniaux J.-C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is located on vacuoles and also catalyzes the transport of putrescine into vacuoles (10.Uemura T. Tomonari Y. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). UGA4 is classified into the family of amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporters (11.Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The name “polyamine” of amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporters is originated from polyamine transporter PotE. Among the family, there is only one gene (YKL174c) whose function has not yet been identified. In this study, we tried to clarify properties of the protein encoded by YKL174c. We found that YKL174c excretes putrescine and spermidine from cells and that the protein is located on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles. Thus, we termed the YKL174c gene as TPO5, which is involved in transport of polyamines. Plasmids—For construction of YEpYKL174c, the gene for the YKL174c open reading frame and its upstream region was amplified by PCR from yeast X2180-1A (MATa SUC2 mal0 gal2 CUP1) genomic DNA as template, using primers HindIII-YKL174cF (5′-CCCAAGCTTCAATGACACCAACATTTATTATCC-3′) and BamHI-YKL174cR (5′-CGCGGATCCCATCATCATCAAGGAGAAGG-3′). The resulting 2.5-kb fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI, and inserted into the same restriction sites of the plasmid YEp352 (12.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). For construction of YEpYKL174c-HA3, which encodes five glycine residues and three copies of Haemophilus influenzae HA 1The abbreviation used is: HA, hemagglutinin. epitope at the C terminus of YKL174c lacking the termination codon, PCR was performed as described above using primers HindIII-YKL174cF and SalI-YKL174c-StopR (5′-TAACGCGTCGACTATATCATATCTACGATCATCGGCA-3′). The product was digested with HindIII and SalI and inserted into the same sites of YEpUGA4-HA3 (10.Uemura T. Tomonari Y. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into yeast cells by the lithium acetate method of Ito et al. (13.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A.

Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. The yeast strain deficient in END4, DEY1531 (MATα ade6 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 end4::LEU2) (14.Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Eide, University of Missouri-Columbia. The strains BY4741, DEY1531, and YPH499 (MATa ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 trp1-Δ63 ura3-52) carrying the plasmid YEpYKL174c or YEpYKL174c-HA3 were cultured in Mg2+-limited synthetic complete medium (15.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar), devoid of CaCl2, containing 50 μm MgSO4 instead of 2 mm at 30 °C with shaking (16.Maruyama T. Masuda N. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The culture was started at A540 ≈ 0.03. The temperature-sensitive sec6 mutant ANS6-2D (MATα sec6-4 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3/4) (17.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by Dr. A. Nakano, Molecular Biology Laboratory, RIKEN. The strain ANS6-2D carrying the plasmid YEpYKL174c was cultured in Mg2+-limited synthetic complete medium at 23 °C for permissive conditions or at 23 and then 37 °C for 2 h for non-permissive conditions. The YKL174c gene-disrupted mutant of YPH499 was constructed by one-step gene disruption (18.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 141-143Google Scholar) with the YKL174c::TRP1 PCR product. The YKL174c::TRP1 construct was generated by inserting the DNA fragment encoding TRP1 gene into the PstI site of YKL174c gene on YEpYKL174c. Correct disruption was confirmed by PCR. As occasion demands, 20 mg/l adenine sulfate, uracil, l-histidine, l-leucine, l-lysine, and/or l-tryptophan were added to the medium. Cell growth was monitored by measuring A540 in a 5-ml culture. Antibodies—The antibodies used in this study were mouse monoclonal anti-HA, clone HA-7, purchased from Sigma, mouse monoclonal anti-VPH1, clone 10D7, purchased from Molecular Probes, rabbit polyclonal anti-PMA1 (19.Eraso P.

Polyamine Transport Assay—Yeast cells in a 20-ml culture were harvested during the exponential growth phase (A540 = 0.5), washed three times with 20 mm Na-Hepes buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mm glucose, suspended at 0.2 mg protein/ml in the same buffer, and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by the addition of labeled substrates. After incubation for 20, 40, or 60 min, a 0.5-ml aliquot of reaction mixture was filtered through cellulose acetate filter (pore size 0.45 μm, Advantec) and washed twice with the buffer described above containing a 10-fold concentration of non-labeled substrates. The radioactivity of the filters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The concentrations and specific activities of substrates were as follows: 0.5 mm [14C]putrescine (37 MBq/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals), 0.1 mm [14C]spermidine (37 MBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 0.1 mm [14C]spermine (37 MBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). For the assay of putrescine excretion, [14C]putrescine was preloaded by the incubation of cells (0.2 mg of protein/ml) with 2.0 mm [14C]putrescine (18.5 MBq/mmol) at pH 8.0 for 90 min. After cells were washed as described above, [14C]putrescine-loaded cells were incubated in the buffer containing 20 mm Na-MES buffer, pH 5.0, and 10 mm glucose. After incubation for 30, 60, 90, or 120 min at 30 °C, a 0.5-ml aliquot of the reaction mixture was centrifuged (17,000 × g, for 5 min at 4 °C), and the radioactivity of the supernatant was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Measurement of Polyamine Contents in Whole Cells—Yeast cells were grown in the presence and absence of putrescine in 5 ml of medium and harvested at the exponential growth phase (A540 = 0.5). Polyamines were extracted by the treatment with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 70 °C for 1 h with occasional shaking. Polyamine contents were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (22.Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—This was carried out according to the methods of Pringle et al. (23.Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) using mouse monoclonal anti-HA as a primary antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 as a secondary antibody, or using rabbit anti-SEC7 as a primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 546 as a second antibody. For the staining of DNA, fixed and permeabilized cells were treated with 200 μg/ml RNase A for 1 h and stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide for 1 h. The slides were immersed in ProLong antifade solution (Molecular Probes) and fluorescence was analyzed with a confocal microscope (ZEISS, LSM510 Laser Scanning Microscope) with an argon laser (λex = 488 nm and λem = 505 nm) for YKL174c-HA3 or with HeNe laser (λex = 543 nm and λem = 560 nm) for SEC7 and DNA. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Yeast cells carrying the plasmid encoding the HA-tagged YKL174c in a 600-ml culture were harvested at A540 = 0.5. The subcellular distribution of HA-tagged YKL174c protein was determined according to the method of Sorin et al. (24.Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with 40 μg/ml zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo) at 30 °C for 30 min, cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm E64C, a thiol proteinase inhibitor (Peptide Institute, Inc.), and 20 μm FUT-175, a serine protease inhibitor (25.Fujii S. Hitomi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar)) and fractionated by a discontinuous sucrose gradient ranging from 18 to 54% (w/v) in 10 steps of 4% difference each. The fractionated membrane was suspended in 100 μl of a SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2% sodium deoxycholic acid, and 0.05% bromphenol blue), and a 50-μl aliquot of samples was separated on a 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), HA-tagged TPO5, SEC7 (a marker of Golgi complex), VPH1 (vacuolar H+-ATPase) and PMA1 (plasma membrane ATPase) were detected using ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern Blot Analysis of YKL174c mRNA—Yeast cells in 100-ml culture were harvested at A540 = 0.5, washed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 m sorbitol, and then resuspended in the same buffer at 5 × 108 cells/ml. After incubation with 40 μg/ml zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo) at 30 °C for 30 min, RNA was extracted from the spheroplast with an RNAqueous-MiDi Kit (Ambion). Northern blot analysis was performed using 20 μg of total RNA as described previously (26.Suzuki T. Sadakata Y. Kashiwagi K. Hoshino K. Kakinuma Y. Shirahata A. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using ECL direct nucleic acid labeling and detection systems with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Probes for YKL174c and ACT1 mRNAs were amplified by PCR using HindIII-YKL174cF and BamHI-YKL174cR for YKL174c, ACT1-P1 (5′-GGAATAAATAGGGGCTTGA-3′) and ACT1-P2 (5′-AAGAAGATTGAGCAGCGGT-3′) for ACT1 as primers, and genomic DNA of X2180-1A as a template. Chemical luminescence was detected by a LAS-1000 plus luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film). Preparation of Phylogenetic Tree—The phylogenetic tree was calculated from profile-derived multiple alignments by the ClustalW V1.8 program including bootstrapping (27.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar) with the use of the neighbor-joining algorithm (28.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Excretion of Putrescine and Spermidine by YKL174c (TPO5)—Fig. 1 shows a phylogenetic tree of the family of amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporters in yeast. Among these proteins, there is one, termed YKL174c, whose function is unknown but which is highly homologous with UGA4, a γ-aminobutyric acid and putrescine transport protein on the vacuolar membrane (10.Uemura T. Tomonari Y. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In light of this, we carried out experiments to determine whether YKL174c has polyamine transport activity. We looked for activity using YPH499 cells transformed with YEpYKL174c (or the vector YEp352 for control cells) and cells in which the native YKL174c gene is disrupted (Δykl174c). As shown in Fig. 2, uptake of putrescine and spermidine was lower in YPH499/YEpYKL174c cells than in control YPH499/YEp352 cells. Uptake of spermine was not affected by transformation with YEpYKL174c. Furthermore, uptake of putrescine was enhanced in Δykl174c cells compared with wild type (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that YKL174c catalyzes the excretion of putrescine and, to a lesser degree, of spermidine. Thus, the YKL174c gene is hereafter termed TPO5. Excretion of putrescine by TPO5 was examined directly by using cells preloaded with [14C]putrescine. As shown in Fig. 3, the excretion of putrescine was enhanced by TPO5; that is, excretion of [14C]putrescine was faster in wild-type cells than Δykl174c cells. The excretion of paraquat, a polyamine analogue (8.Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), was not influenced by TPO5 (data not shown). The results indicate that TPO5 preferentially excretes putrescine. The increased putrescine uptake seen in cells with a disrupted YKL174c gene (equal to putrescine excretion activity by TPO5) was slightly inhibited by non-labeled γ-aminobutyric acid (1 mm), but not by lysine, arginine, histidine, and ornithine (Fig. 4), indicating that TPO5 recognizes polyamines preferentially.Fig. 2Inhibition of putrescine and spermidine uptake activity by TPO5 protein encoded byYKL174c.

GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of TPO5 on polyamine toxicity were then measured using cells transformed with YEpYKL174c (TPO5). As shown in Fig. 5, cells transformed with YEpTPO5 grew faster than control cells (containing the vector) in the presence of 120 mm putrescine or 3 mm spermidine. In addition, the Δykl174c mutant showed strong sensitivity to 90 mm putrescine (Fig. 5) but showed no difference in sensitivity to spermidine compared with the wild-type strain (data not shown). The results are in accordance with the finding that spermidine is not effectively effluxed. An effect of polyamines on cell growth was clearly observed, because the time course for cell growth was followed for more than 150 h, whereas polyamine uptake activity was followed for only 60 or 120 min. It should be noted that the Δykl174c mutant grows faster than the wild-type strain in the absence of polyamines (Fig. 5B). Such a growth difference was observed even in the presence of 0.3 or 1 mm putrescine (Fig. 6A). Under these conditions, cellular polyamine content was measured (Fig. 6B). Levels of polyamines in the Δykl174c mutant cultured without putrescine increased from 2.97 and 30.4 (wild-type) to 21.5 and 60.0 nmol/mg of protein (mutant) for putrescine and spermidine, respectively. The amount of putrescine and spermidine accumulated in the Δykl174c mutant corresponds to 1.84 and 5.13 mm, respectively, if the intracellular water space is estimated as 11.7 μl of cell volume/mg of protein (15.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Even if 0.3 or 1 mm putrescine was added to the medium, the levels of putrescine and (for 0.3 mm putrescine) spermidine were still higher in the Δykl174c mutant than in wild-type. These results suggest that wild-type yeast having TPO5 gene do not maintain an optimal level of polyamines necessary for cell growth under these conditions. Subcellular Localization of TPO5—The subcellular localization of TPO5 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using HA-tagged TPO5 and an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 7A, TPO5 was located on small vesicles existing in the vicinity of plasma membrane. The vesicles were different from vacuoles, which were observed by differential interference contrast and from nuclei judged by DNA staining with propidium iodide. Accordingly, colocalization of TPO5 with SEC7, a marker of the Golgi complex (20.Franzusoff A. Redding K. Crosby J. Fuller R.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was examined. As shown in Fig. 7B, most of TPO5 was colocalized with SEC7, indicating that TPO5 is located on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles. Subcellular localization of TPO5 was then analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 8, most of TPO5-HA3 was localized in the low density position similar to Golgi complex, estimated by SEC7, and vacuoles, estimated by VPH1 (a subunit of vacuolar proton ATPase), and very small amount of TPO5 was localized in the high density position similar to plasma membrane, estimated by PMA1 (plasma membrane ATPase 1). Some portion of SEC7 was also located in the high density portion. This was probably because of the coagulation of SEC7 during the preparation of cell lysate, because SEC7 was not observed on plasma membrane (see Fig. 7). These results are in accordance with an idea that TPO5 is located mainly on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles.Fig. 8Subcellular localization of TPO5 determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Cell culture, subcellular fractionation, and Western blot analysis were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blotting of HA-tagged TPO5 was performed together with SEC7, a marker of Golgi complex, VPH1, a subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase, and PMA1, plasma membrane ATPase 1. Data on the two top fractions (0 and 18% sucrose) were omitted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the location of TPO5 on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles, polyamine transport activity was measured using a temperature sensitive mutant deficient in the process of secretion (sec6) (17.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and a mutant deficient in endocytosis (Δend4) (14.Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the sec6 mutant, fusion of the secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane during the final exocytosis process is inhibited at non-permissive temperatures (17.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and endocytosis of a zinc transporter ZRT1 is deficient in Δend4 mutant (14.Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9A, putrescine and spermidine excretion activity was lower with a sec6 mutant containing YEpYKL174c (TPO5) than with its parent strain containing YEpYKL174c (TPO5) at a non-permissive temperature (37 °C), but the activity of these two strains containing YEpYKL174c (TPO5) was nearly equal at a permissive temperature (23 °C). Excretion activity of putrescine and spermidine was also lower with the endocytosis mutant containing YEpYKL174c (TPO5) than its parent strain containing YEpYKL174c (TPO5) (Fig. 9B). These results indicate that excretion of putrescine and spermidine by TPO5 was not observed in the exocytosis and endocytosis mutants and that both exocytosis of polyamines by TPO5 and endocytosis of TPO5 for recycling are involved in the activity of TPO5. Induction of TPO5 mRNA by Polyamines—We next tested whether TPO5 mRNA is induced by polyamines. Northern blot analysis was carried out using total RNA isolated from YPH499/YEpYKL174c cultured in the absence and presence of polyamines. As shown in Fig. 10, TPO5 mRNA was most strongly induced by 0.2 mm spermine, even though spermine is not a substrate for TPO5. Spermidine and putrescine also caused induction of TPO5 mRNA. As a control, the level of ACT1 mRNA encoding actin 1 was measured. It was not influenced by polyamines. Because the effective concentration is in the order putrescine > spermidine > spermine in terms of the stimulation of protein synthesis (29.Ogasawara T. Ito K. Igarashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is thought that induction of TPO5 mRNA depends on the effective polyamine concentration in cells. We studied the function of a protein encoded by an unidentified gene YKL174c, which has high homology with UGA4, a member of the family of amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporters in S. cerevisiae. We found that YKL174c catalyzes the excretion of putrescine and spermidine, and thus termed this protein as TPO5. The homology of an amino acid sequence between TPO5 and UGA4 was 42%, and the major difference was observed in the C-terminal regions of the two proteins. Thus, the cellular localization of these two proteins (TPO5 is found on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles, and UGA4 is found on vacuoles) may be determined by the C termini of these proteins. Our data clearly indicate that TPO5 is mainly located on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles and that both processes of exocytosis and endocytosis are involved in the secretion of putrescine and spermidine. This is the first report that shows the necessity of these two processes for secretion of small molecules in yeast. In yeast, it has been reported that the process of exocytosis is necessary for the sorting of tryptophan permease to the plasma membrane (17.Umebayashi K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1117-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and also the process of endocytosis is necessary for degradation in vacuoles of the zinc transporter ZRT1 (14.Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a general amino acid permease (30.Chen E.J. Kaiser C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14837-14842Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and a uracil permease (31.Dupre S. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Traffic. 2003; 4: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) on plasma membrane. However, there is no report thus far stating that both processes are necessary for the function of a specific protein. It has been reported that both exocytosis and endocytosis are necessary for neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles in mammalian cells (32.Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). At present, we do not know the exact reason why TPO5 mainly exists on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles. It may be better for TPO5 to exist on Golgi or post-Golgi secretory vesicles to excrete polyamines more effectively once polyamines are accumulated in secretory vesicles like neurotransmitters accumulated in synaptic vesicles. Polyamine transporters previously characterized were not specific for polyamines in S. cerevisiae. TPO1 can excrete other substances that are not related to polyamines (33.do Valle Matta M.A. Jonniaux J.-L. Balzi E. Goffeau A. van den Hazel B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34.Teixeria M.C. Sa-Correia I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35.Desmoucelles C. Pinson B. Saint-Marc C. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27036-27044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and UGA4 has higher affinity for γ-aminobutyric acid rather than putrescine (10.Uemura T. Tomonari Y. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, TPO5 is the only protein studied to date that recognizes putrescine and spermidine preferentially. Because TPO2 and TPO3 only recognize spermine among polyamines, experiments are in progress to test whether TPO2 and TPO3 specifically recognize spermine. The existence of spermine (or acetylspermine) oxidase has been reported recently in yeast (36.Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). If the enzyme also catalyzes the conversion of spermidine to putrescine, excess polyamines may be excreted effectively by TPO5. It is surprising that cells with a disrupted TPO5 gene (Δykl174c) grow more rapidly than wild-type cells. Under these conditions, the accumulation of putrescine and spermidine in Δykl174c cells was observed. The results suggest that the existence of TPO5 slows down cell growth through excretion of putrescine. It has been reported that excess spermidine inhibits protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes in E. coli (37.Raj V.S. Tomitori H. Yoshida M. Apirakaramwong A. Kashiwagi K. Takio K. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Acetylation of polyamines decreases their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and their toxicity (38.Kakegawa T. Takamiya K. Ogawa T. Hayashi Y. Hirose S. Niitsu M. Samejima K. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Acetyltransferases of polyamines are present in both mammalian cells and E. coli (1.Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 1-543Google Scholar). However, the existence of acetyltransferase(s) of polyamines has not been reported in S. cerevisiae, although the whole genome sequence was determined. TPO5 together with spermine oxidase (36.Chattopadhyay M.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) may function for detoxification of polyamines in yeast. When cells were cultured in the presence of high concentrations of putrescine (120 mm) or spermidine (3 mm), it took 50–100 h until reaching the logarithmic phase of cell growth (see Fig. 5). It may take a long time to induce the expression of the YKL174c (TPO5) gene under these experimental conditions. Induction of TPO5 mRNA was measured in the presence of 50 mm putrescine or 2 mm spermidine (Fig. 10). Under these conditions, the lag time was within 24 h, and the difference in cell growth between cells transformed with YEpYKL174c (TPO5) and YEp352 in the presence of polyamines was not clearly observed (data not shown).

This is modulated by the gain of cooperativity in serine binding for the first two effector sites. The basis for the chloride modulation of cooperativity is not known, but the sensitivity to serine inhibition can be explained in terms of certain amino acid residues in critical areas of the structures. The differential sensitivity to serine inhibition by M. tuberculosis and human PGDH may open up interesting possibilities in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been isolated to homogeneity and displays an unusual relationship to the Escherichia coli and mammalian enzymes.

Biophys. 1970; 137: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and is a member of a family of proteins classified as 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases that are generally specific for substrates with a D-configuration (5Grant G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PGDH catalyzes the first committed step in the phosphorylated pathway of l-serine biosynthesis by converting d-3-phosphoglycerate to hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate utilizing NAD+ as a cofactor (1Walsh D.A. Sallach H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4068-4076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ichihara A. Greenberg D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate is converted to phosphoserine by phosphoserine transaminase and then to l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (6Ichihara A. Greenberg D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by PGDH occurs spontaneously in vitro in the direction of conversion of hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate to phosphoglycerate. In some organisms, such as Escherichia coli (7Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3934-3944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PGDH is strongly inhibited by l-serine (I0.5 =∼2–4 μm), the end product of the pathway. E. coli PGDH is the most studied and is classified as a V-type enzyme (8Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because l-serine regulates catalysis by altering the velocity of the reaction rather than the affinity of the substrate. In Bacillus subtilis, inhibition of PGDH by l-serine is less sensitive (I0.5 ∼ 0.6 mm) but appears to lose its sensitivity to l-serine under oxidizing conditions (9Saski R. Pizer L.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PGDH from Corynebacterium glutamicum has also been reported to be inhibited by l-serine only at very high concentrations (I0.5 ∼ 10 mm) but has not been studied in homogeneous form (10Peters-Wendisch P. Netzer R. Eggeling L. Sahm H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, l-serine inhibition of both the B. subtilis and C. glutamicum PGDH require extensive preincubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor before appreciable inhibition can be measured. In the pea (Pisum sativum), the sensitivity to l-serine has been reported to be cold labile (3Slaughter J.C. Davies D.D. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In crude extracts of wheat germ (4Rosenblum I.Y. Sallach H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), PGDH activity appears to be inhibited by high concentrations of l-serine, but this sensitivity is reported to be lost upon incubation, and the purified wheat germ PGDH is not inhibited by l-serine. l-Serine has been reported to have no effect on the activity of PGDH from rat liver (11Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and chicken liver (12Walsh D.A. Sallach H.J. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The effect of l-serine on the activity of PGDH from other species has not been reported. PGDH exists in at least three different basic structural motifs that do not appear to be strictly specific for organism type (11Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The PGDH of some bacteria and some lower eukaryotes, such as yeast, Leishmania, and Neurospora, are structurally similar to the E. coli enzyme (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition to substrate and nucleotide-binding domains, they possess a homologous C-terminal domain that, in E. coli, is involved in effector binding (l-serine) and regulation of activity. This third domain has been called the “ACT domain” and consists of a βαββαβ structural motif that has been found in other proteins as well (13Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 14Chipman D.M. Shaanan B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Other bacteria and higher order eukaryotes, including mammals, possess a large polypeptide insertion in their C-terminal segment immediately following the substrate-binding domain. Furthermore, the homology to the ACT domain following this insertion is minimal. A third motif, which lacks the C-terminal regulatory domain altogether, is also found in some bacteria, including some, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that also produce PGDH with the extended C-terminal motif. Recently, a variation of this third motif has been recognized in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica (15Ali V. Hashimoto T. Shigeta Y. Nozaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2670-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that appears to utilize a lysyl residue rather than a histidyl residue at the active site for proton transfer.Fig. 2Sequence homology of d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.

However, all of these enzymes except E. coli PGDH appear to be missing a critical hinge region consisting of two adjacent glycine residues that appears to be critical for the ability of serine to inhibit the active site (16Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The PGDH from rat, with the extended C-terminal motif similar to that found in other mammals, has been reported to be insensitive to l-serine. Other mammalian enzymes such as those from the mouse and human have not been characterized, but the human enzyme exhibits 94% amino acid identity with the rat enzyme. PGDH from M. tuberculosis contains an extended C-terminal domain like that found in mammalian PGDH, but we have observed that it is readily inhibited by l-serine. In fact, it is the only other purified PGDH that has been shown to be inhibited by l-serine. Although it has not yet been characterized, the human enzyme is expected to have properties similar to the rat PGDH, which is insensitive to l-serine, because they are 94% identical. Tuberculosis is a deadly disease that is prevalent throughout much of the world and that is showing significant development of multidrug resistance. If the human enzyme is, in fact, insensitive to l-serine, this may provide a possible avenue toward the development of new drugs to treat tuberculosis. This study reports the expression and characterization of l-serine-sensitive PGDH from M. tuberculosis and demonstrates that it possesses a unique mode of regulation. PGDH activity was measured by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in the presence of NADH and hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate (HPAP). Unless otherwise indicated, the assays were performed in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 μm NADH and 350 μm HPAP. HPAP was purchased from Sigma as the dimethylketal tri(cyclohexylammonium) salt and converted to HPAP according to the instructions accompanying the reagent. The concentration of HPAP was determined by the amount of NADH that could be converted to NAD+ and was stored in frozen aliquots prior to use. The concentration of HPAP was determined each time the assays were performed. NADH and l-serine are also from Sigma. All of the other reagents were analytical grade. Protein quantitation was performed by amino acid analysis and was used to determine an E1% (absorbance of a 10 mg/ml solution) at 280 nm of 5.6. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of PGDH from M. tuberculosis—The SerA1 gene, Rv2996c, from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome, was identified from the Tuberculist data base. The SerA1 gene was amplified using the H37Rv genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was cloned into the pET 30b vector by insertion into the NdeI and HindIII sites. The NdeI site contained the ATG start codon, and the Hind III site was preceded immediately by a stop codon following the codon for the C-terminal residue of the enzyme. The culture is grown in LB medium with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the A600 nm reaches 0.6–0.8. PGDH expression is induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to grow at 37 °C for 6–7 h. The cells are harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl. After the addition of lysozyme (0.16 mg/ml), the cells are disrupted by sonication for 2–3 min. Cell debris is removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant is dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl in preparation for ion exchange chromatography. A 2.6 × 8-cm column of Q-Sepharose is equilibrated in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl. After the sample is applied to the column, the column is washed with starting buffer until the A280 reaches approximately 0. The protein is eluted with a 1200-ml linear gradient of 25 to 1000 mm KCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and the fractions are collected. M. tuberculosis PGDH is located by assaying for enzymatic activity, and the appropriate fractions are pooled. The pooled fractions are dialyzed against 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl and rechromatographed on an identical Q-Sepharose column with a linear gradient from 25 to 1000 mm KCl. Sequence Homology—All of the sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ENTREZ data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Sequence alignments were initially performed using the SIM program from the ExPASY Molecular Biology server at us.expasy.org/tools/. Serine Inhibition and Binding—Serine inhibition plots were fit to the Hill equation as previously described (17Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Binding of l-serine to M. tuberculosis PGDH was performed as described previously (18Grant G.A. Hu Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18170-18176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using tritiated l-serine. Stepwise intrinsic dissociation constants for l-serine were determined by fitting to the Adair equation for four binding sites as previously described. Hill plots were utilized to determine the dissociation constant for the binding of the first serine (19Grant G.A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 106-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This was subsequently used to constrain K1′ in the Adair equation. All of the data were fit with Kaleidograph version 3.6 from Synergy Software. M. tuberculosis is a prokaryote, but the amino acid sequence of its PGDH more closely resembles that from mammalian species (Fig. 2). PGDH from M. tuberculosis has been isolated to homogeneity and characterized. It runs as a single band on SDS-PAGE with a subunit molecular weight of ∼55,000 that is consistent with the molecular weight predicted from its sequence (Fig. 3). Activity, Substrate Specificity, and Stability—The physiological substrate of PGDH from all species is hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate. E. coli PGDH can also utilize α-ketoglutarate as a substrate (20Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Neither substrate produces inhibition of E. coli PGDH activity at high concentrations. In contrast, M. tuberculosis PGDH is specific for hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate as a substrate as was also demonstrated for rat liver PGDH. Neither enzyme displays any activity with α-ketoglutarate. In addition, M. tuberculosis PGDH exhibits substrate inhibition (Fig. 4) similar to what has been reported for rat liver PGDH (11Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Utilizing the initial part of the curve in a v versus S plot and fitting it to the Michaelis-Menten equation, the Km for hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate is ∼85 μm, and the kcat/Km is ∼5.6 × 106m–1 s–1. The E. coli enzyme has a Km of ∼40 μm and a kcat/Km of ∼7 × 105m–1 s–1 for hydoxypyruvic acid phosphate. For α-ketoglutarate the E. coli enzyme has a Km of ∼ 0.5 mm and a kcat/Km of ∼3 × 10 4m–1 s–1. The pH at which M. tuberculosis PGDH displays optimal activity is ∼6.5, whereas that for E. coli PGDH is ∼8.5. Although M. tuberculosis PGDH utilizes NADH to catalyze the same reaction as the E. coli and rat liver enzymes, it is not retained on a column of 5′AMP-Sepharose as they are. These characteristics are summarized in Table I.Table IProperties of E. coli, M. tuberculosis, and rat liver d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenasesE. coliaFrom this study and Refs. 16-19 and 27.M. tuberculosisbFrom this study.Rat livercSee Ref. 11.Subunit molecular weight44,04454,52256,650pH optimum8.56.5NRdNot reported.

Open table in a new tab As has been reported for rat liver PGDH (11Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the ionic strength of the buffer affects the substrate inhibition characteristics of M. tuberculosis PGDH (Fig. 5). Optimal activity is seen at ∼75–100 mm potassium phosphate. Only about 30% of the optimal activity can be measured in 5 mm potassium phosphate. Increasing ionic strength also reduces the degree of substrate inhibition and shifts the maximal activity to higher substrate concentrations (Fig. 4). Ionic strength is also critical for the stability of the purified enzyme. At low ionic strength the enzyme irreversibly looses activity with time (Fig. 6). For example, in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, most of the activity is lost within 24 h. The activity loss is prevented if the ionic strength is kept above ∼100 mm salt. It is not specific for phosphate buffer because the same protection is gained with salts such as KCl and NaCl. Furthermore, the rate of activity loss is dependent on the concentration of the enzyme (Fig. 7). At low ionic strength, the more dilute the enzyme, the faster the rate of loss of activity. However, dilute enzyme can be protected from the loss of activity by a higher ionic strength environment. The activity loss profiles in Fig. 7 could only be fit well with an equation representing biphasic exponential decay, suggesting that the loss of activity proceeds by a two-step mechanism. None of these effects of ionic strength are observed with E. coli PGDH. Inhibition by l-Serine—Rat liver PGDH contains an extended C-terminal motif and is reported to be insensitive to l-serine. In contrast, M. tuberculosis PGDH, which also contains the extended C-terminal motif, is easily inhibited by l-serine, with an I0.5 for l-serine of ∼30 μm. This compares to ∼2–4 μm for E. coli PGDH. E. coli PGDH also shows positive cooperativity for serine inhibition with a Hill coefficient of ∼2.0. Unlike the E. coli enzyme, when assayed in phosphate buffer, M. tuberculosis PGDH displays a Hill coefficient of ∼1.0, indicating the absence of cooperativity for serine inhibition. However, positive cooperativity can be induced by the presence of chloride ions. Table II demonstrates that when chloride ion is present in the phosphate buffer, Hill coefficients greater than 1.0 are observed. Although the effect of chloride on the Hill coefficient seems to be optimal at high chloride ion concentrations (250 mm), the effect is present at physiological levels of chloride ion as well (0.02–0.10 mm). This effect does not involve the potassium ion because it is present in the phosphate buffer salts, and NaCl produces similar results. When chloride ion is missing, even at high salt concentrations such as 250 mm sodium acetate, the effect is not observed. The I0.5, the concentration of inhibitor at which half-maximal inhibition is observed, also increases with the chloride ion concentration. So, although chloride induces cooperativity, it decreases sensitivity to serine. Table II also demonstrates that the effect is maximal for chloride ion among the halogen group. Fluoride ion does not induce cooperativity, whereas bromide and iodide display a small effect. In addition, tartrate ions, which were identified in the crystal structure at an anionic binding site between the intervening and regulatory domains, do not induce cooperativity (Table II).Table IIThe effect of ionic environment on the cooperativity of l-serine inhibition in M. tuberculosis d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenaseConcentrationaAll conditions are in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5.SaltHill coefficientI0.5μmNonenone0.98 ± 0.0921.2 ± 1.80.02 mmKCl1.38 ± 0.0718.2 ± 0.80.10 mmKCl1.41 ± 0.0826.1 ± 1.050 mmKCl1.45 ± 0.0929.9 ± 1.450 mmNaCl1.59 ± 0.0730.8 ± 0.9150 mmKCl1.38 ± 0.1063.3 ± 3.0250 mmKCl1.65 ± 0.08123.3 ± 3.2250 mmSodium acetate1.06 ± 0.0817.7 ± 1.350 mmNaF1.05 ± 0.0538.1 ± 1.550 mmNaBr1.21 ± 0.0666.8 ± 2.250 mmNaI1.14 ± 0.0878.2 ± 3.910 mmPotassium tartrate1.17 ± 0.0727.6 ± 0.1a All conditions are in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Open table in a new tab Double reciprocal plots of velocity versus substrate concentration (Fig. 8) display the upward curvature at high substrate concentrations expected for substrate inhibition. Extrapolation of the data at low substrate concentration show that inhibition by l-serine is not of the competitive type and is most likely of the mixed noncompetitive type. The E. coli enzyme displays strict noncompetitive inhibition with HPAP. This indicates that l-serine most likely binds at an allosteric site somewhere in the C-terminal domain similar to that of the E. coli enzyme. In the accompanying paper (21Dey S. Grant G.A. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14892-14899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that describes the crystal structure of M. tuberculosis PGDH, the serine-binding site has been tentatively identified by structural and sequence homology to the serine site in E. coli PGDH. However, the spatial relationship of the effector site to the active site is altered by the presence of an intervening domain. l-Serine Binding—The binding of l-serine to M. tuberculosis PGDH as a function of serine concentration in the absence and presence of KCl is shown in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. The stepwise intrinsic dissociation constants derived from the data are listed in Table III. Fitting of the data with the Adair equation with four variables produced values with relatively large error values such that it was difficult to interpret the results. Fitting the data with a Hill plot (shown in the insets to Figs. 9 and 10) allowed the value for K1′ to be derived independently. Constraining the Adair equation using this value reduced the error values for the other dissociation constants so that a more meaningful evaluation could be made. The results show that in the absence of KCl, there appears to be little cooperativity in the binding of the first two serines. The third serine appears to bind with increased affinity, whereas the final serine shows very little affinity for the protein. A similar pattern is seen in the presence of KCl except that now the binding of the first two serines exhibit positive cooperativity as well as the third. The relationship between ligand binding data and the inhibition data can be explained on the basis of the half-the-sites reactivity determined for l-serine binding to E. coli. PGDH (17Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In E. coli PGDH the binding of the first two serine molecules are responsible for inhibition of the active site. Binding of more than two serines may occur, but they have no additional effect on the inhibition of activity. If a similar mechanism is functional in M. tuberculosis PGDH, the dissociation constants of only the first two serines to bind should be considered within the context of inhibition of activity. Thus, in the presence of KCl, the binding and the inhibition are cooperative, and in the absence of KCl they are not.Fig. 10Binding of l-serine to M. tuberculosis PGDH in the presence of KCl. The data are plotted as fractional occupancy of sites (Y) versus free serine concentration (μm). The solid line is the fit of the data to the Adair equation for a molecule with four sites.

Open table in a new tab Although d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases from E. coli and M. tuberculosis catalyze identical reactions in the first committed step for the biosynthesis of l-serine, they exhibit markedly different characteristics, and M. tuberculosis PGDH shares many characteristics with rat liver PGDH. These include the extended C-terminal motif, substrate inhibition kinetics, dependence of activity levels and stability on ionic strength, and the inability to utilize α-ketoglutarate as a substrate. However, the M. tuberculosis enzyme does not display the affinity for 5′-AMP-Sepharose that the rat liver and E. coli enzyme do, although all three utilize NAD as a cofactor. A possible reason for this is addressed in the accompanying article (21Dey S. Grant G.A. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14892-14899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which describes the crystal structure of M. tuberculosis PGDH. The single property that M. tuberculosis PGDH shares with the E. coli enzyme, other than utilizing their common physiological substrates, is that it is inhibited by l-serine at relatively low levels. Interestingly, in potassium phosphate buffer alone, M. tuberculosis PGDH is not inhibited in a positively cooperative manner by l-serine, as is E. coli PGDH. However, the presence of chloride ion converts the inhibition by l-serine from a noncooperative to a cooperative process. Chloride ion is not a requirement for the positively cooperative inhibition of E. coli PGDH by l-serine. Moreover, this modulation occurs at relatively low levels of chloride ion, certainly within physiological levels. As the chloride ion is increased, the I0.5 for l-serine increases, but the value for the Hill coefficient remains >1. Thus, the effect of chloride seems to be fully in force at a relatively low level. The effect of the chloride ion is also manifest in the binding of l-serine to the enzyme, which shows positive cooperativity in the binding of the first two serine molecules in the presence of chloride ion but not in the absence. This is consistent with the mechanism of serine inhibition in E. coli, where it was shown that inhibition of activity is dependent on only the first two serines to bind. It is not known at this point how the chloride ion contributes to this phenomenon. Modulation of enzyme activity by chloride ion has been reported in a number of cases. For example, it has been reported that rat liver glucose-6-phosphatase (22Pederson B.A. Nordlie M.A. Foster J.D. Nordlie R.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and glycogen synthase (23Meijer A.J. Baquet A. Gustafson L. van Woerkom G.M. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5823-5828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are inhibited by chloride ion. On the other hand, human cathepsin C (24Cigic B. Pain R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 944-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is activated by chloride ion. Chloride ion also produces a minor heterotropic effect on hemoglobin, but it does not alter the hill coefficient for ligand binding (25Van Beek G.G. DeBruin S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that the cooperativity of inhibition is modulated specifically by chloride ion appears to be relatively unique. The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis PGDH does not reveal the site for chloride binding. A potential site for the binding of anionic molecules has been identified by virtue of the binding of tartrate molecules from the crystallization buffer at a site between the intervening and regulatory domains (21Dey S. Grant G.A. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14892-14899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, tartrate itself does not exhibit an effect on the cooperativity of inhibition by serine. Fig. 2 presents a sequence alignment of PGDH from eight species. Four are from prokaryotic sources, and four are from eukaryotic sources, two of which are mammalian. Five of these species contain the large C-terminal extension, but only two are eukaryotic organisms. The two other eukaryotes are missing the C-terminal extension, and three prokaryotes contain it. There are 53 residues or 15% that are identical in the N-terminal portion of all the species shown (up to position 346 in Fig. 2). These include residues known to be involved in cofactor binding and at the active site. After position 346, there is less than 1% identity in all eight sequences and less than 2% identity in the C-terminal extensions found in five of the sequences. Of the PGDH enzymes reported to be inhibited by l-serine, their sensitivity to serine ranges over 3 orders of magnitude. The concentration of l-serine that produces half-maximal inhibition of catalytic activity for PGDH from E. coli, M. tuberculosis, C. glutamicum, and B. subtilis are ∼3, 30, 640, and 10,000 μm. Some insight into the structural basis for serine sensitivity among these species may be gained from inspection of the homology based on what is known about the E. coli enzyme, although it is not entirely straightforward. In E. coli PGDH, l-serine binds to the allosteric site through hydrogen bonding interaction with a histidine and two asparagine residues. These are found at positions 493, 495, and 513 in Fig. 2. In addition, a potential molecular hinge, defined by a Gly-Gly sequence at positions 356 and 357 in E. coli PGDH, seems to be required for optimal serine inhibition. It has been shown that the Gly-Gly sequence can be replaced by an Ala-Ala sequence without a major effect (16Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, residues with larger side chains interfere significantly with serine-induced inhibition. PGDH from Leishmania and yeast possess the requisite serine-binding residues but are missing the Gly-Gly hinge region. Although not yet tested, they would be predicted to be insensitive to l-serine. On the other hand, PGDH from M. tuberculosis and C. glutamicum possess a Gly-Gly sequence in this area, but their serine-binding residues differ at two positions. However, these residues are capable of forming hydrogen bonds and may function similarly. Both mammalian enzymes are completely devoid of any of these necessary features. The rat liver PGDH has been shown to be completely insensitive to l-serine. A similar situation would be predicted for the human enzyme because it is 94% identical. However, several things are left unexplained by this simple analysis. The C. glutamicum and M. tuberculosis enzymes both have the same residues corresponding to the serine binding positions as well as a Gly-Gly sequence in the right general area, but the C. glutamicum enzyme has been reported to be over a 100-fold less sensitive to l-serine. On the other hand, the B. subtilis enzyme, which has very similar serine-binding residues (but with an Asp replacing an Asn), does not contain a recognizable hinge in the region of position 356. When comparing the enzymes with the C-terminal extension to that of E. coli, the effect of the additional polypeptide must be taken into account and may change the manner in which serine interacts and inhibits the enzyme quite significantly. The structural and kinetic characteristics of the M. tuberculosis enzyme indicate that it is more closely related to the mammalian PGDHs. However, its sensitivity to serine inhibition suggests that it possesses metabolic features more consistent with the E. coli enzyme. These observations suggest that the M. tuberculosis PGDH may be a link between the E. coli and mammalian enzymes. This is supported by the phylogenetic tree presented by Ali et al. (15Ali V. Hashimoto T. Shigeta Y. Nozaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2670-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The intracellular soluble levels of l-serine in E. coli and B. subtilis have been reported to be in the 0.5–1.5 mm range (9Saski R. Pizer L.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). If a similar l-serine concentration is found in M. tuberculosis, the I0.5 for l-serine for M. tuberculosis PGDH suggests that it may well be regulated in vivo by l-serine pools. l-Serine is a central cellular intermediate in bacteria that serves as a source for the synthesis of protein, glycine, cysteine, tryptophan, phospholipids, purines, and single carbon metabolites. In fact, ∼15% of glycolytic flux is directed into the l-serine biosynthetic pathway (26McKitrick J.C. Pizer L.I. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 235-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, PGDH is a constitutive enzyme; that is it cannot grow without an external source of l-serine (27Tobey K.L. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12179-12183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene that codes for M. tuberculosis PGDH, SerA1, has been shown to be an essential gene in that organism (28Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that analogs of l-serine that cannot be used otherwise by the M. tuberculosis organism could be potential new drugs for the control of active M. tuberculosis infection when it is growing mainly on carbon as a source. The mechanism of E. coli PGDH has been studied in great detail. A recent report has shown that the enzyme displays half-of-the-sites activity for both catalysis and regulation by l-serine (17Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, that investigation has shown that the magnitude of inhibition of activity depends on the intersubunit relationship of effector site to active site and that this relationship can begin to be defined in a quantitative manner. This picture of how the various ligand sites in PGDH interact has more clearly defined the intermolecular mechanism of allosteric regulation in this enzyme and presented the question as to how general the mechanism may be, not only across species within homologous proteins, but as a general regulatory mechanism for enzymes of diverse function that contain the ACT domain. The unique properties of M. tuberculosis PGDH provide an intriguing and potentially enlightening opportunity to explore this question in regard to the former case and will contribute to our understanding of protein regulatory mechanisms."

Binding of Ang II to the G-protein-coupled receptor AT1, which is thought to mediate most of the biological responses of Ang II, leads to rapid activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαq/11, Gα12/13, and Gβγ) that subsequently activate phospholipase Cβ and phospholipase Cγ to generate inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which in turn cause intracellular calcium mobilization and activation of protein kinase C, respectively (3.Sadoshima J.

It appears that the diversity of Ang II actions is regulated at the level of AT1 receptor, where different adaptor proteins may preferentially recruit second messenger pathways in different types of cells to execute the distinct functions of Ang II in the target cells. Therefore understanding the AT1 receptor-associated proteins is a key step to understanding the molecular basis of Ang II signaling. A novel protein, AT1 receptor-associated protein (ATRAP), has been identified in our laboratory and shown to be an intracellular partner of the AT1 receptor, interacting physically with the receptor both in vitro and in vivo (14.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Liu X. Tamura K. Dzau V.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5038-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15.Daviet L. Lehtonen J.Y. Tamura K. Griese D.P. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol.

Functionally, ATRAP is capable of reducing the generation of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate in an agonist-dependent manner and of enhancing AT1 internalization (14.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Liu X. Tamura K.

We identified calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) as an ATRAP partner and present evidence that this interaction contributes to the ATRAP-mediated AT1 receptor signaling pathway. Reagents and Plasmids—ATRAP full-length cDNA or deletions were cloned into vector pGBKT7 as described (14.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Liu X. Tamura K. Dzau V.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5038-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mouse CAML was cloned from a mouse heart cDNA library (Clontech) by standard PCR with a forward primer containing an NdeI site: 5′-cgg gaa tcc cat atg gag ccg gtg cct gcg gcc ac-3′ and a reverse primer containing a BamH1 site: 5′-gcg cgg atc ctc agg gta ctt cag gac ccc agt aat c-3′. The full-length CAML cDNA was cloned into pGADT7 vector at NdeI and BamH1 cloning sites. Full-length CAML (aa 1–296), CAML N terminus (aa 1–189), and CAML C terminus (aa 189–296) were cloned into pGFP-N2 (BioSignal Packard, Montreal, Canada) expression vector with BglII and KpnI. PCR primers were: CAML1–189, 5′-aaa gag atc ttt aat acg act c-3′ and 5′-gcg cgg tac caa ata ttc gaa aag atg caa ac-3′; CAML189–296, 5′-gga aga tct acc atg ggg ttt cga ttg gtg ggg tgc-3′ and 5′-gcg cgg tac cgg gta ctt cag gac ccc ag-3′; CAML1–296, 5′-aaa gag atc ttt aat acg act c-3′, and 5′-gcg cgg tac cgg gta att cag gac ccc a-3′. Full-length CAML also was cloned into pRluc expression vector (BioSignal Packard, Montreal, Canada) with luciferase fused to the N- or C-terminal ends. All the vectors were sequenced, and the inserts were confirmed to be in the correct reading frame. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A pretransformed cDNA library from mouse testis constructed in fusion with the GAL4 activation domain was purchased from Clontech. The yeast reporter strain AH109 (Clontech) containing three GAL4-inducible reporter genes (His, Ade2, and LacZ) was cotransformed with ATRAP fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain cloned into the two-hybrid expression vector pGBKT7. Double transformants were plated on yeast SD drop-out medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine (QDO). The transformants were grown, and clones were then patched on selective medium. The yeast α-galactosidase activity, expressed from the MEL1 gene in response to Gal4 activation, was determined in plates containing X-α-gal (2 mg/ml) as a chromogenic substrate. The cDNA inserts from positive clones were then sequenced. Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) Assays— ATRAP and CAML were cloned in-frame into the expression vectors pRluc and pGFP2 (Biosignal, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Their identity was verified by DNA sequencing. For experiments on the interaction of ATRAP with CAML, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 3:1 of green fluorescent protein (GFP):luciferase constructs. 48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/EDTA and washed twice with PBS. Approximately 50,000 cells/well were distributed in a 96-well microplate (White Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The DeepBlue coelenterazine substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected with a Victor microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) that permits detection of signals using filters at 410 and 515 nm wavelengths. Fluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 cells were seeded in glass coverslips and cotransfected with DNA constructs expressing CAML· GFP or ATRAP·RFP. 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and washed twice with PBS. The cells were observed under microscopy, and all images were acquired and processed with a scientific grade, cooled, charge-coupled camera in the Nikon 80i microscopy system (Thromwood, NY) and Image processing software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD), respectively. Immunoprecipitation—2 × 106 of HEK293 cells were plated on 10-cm diameter dishes, and 5 μg of DNA was transfected with 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h later, the cells were lysed in buffer developed by Von Bulow and Bram (17.von Bulow G.U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which contains 1% dodecyl maltoside, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. HA-tagged CAML and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody clone 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science) conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to protein immunoblotting. The blot was probed with polyclonal antibody to ATRAP followed by chemiluminescence detection. Parallel protein immunoblots of each sample were performed to confirm the expected expression of CAML constructs in the cells. Cell Culture and NFAT-Luciferase Assays—HEK293 cells plated in 24-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) containing equal amounts of DNA including reporter gene, expression vector CAML-PEGFPN1, or ATRAP-PCDNA3.1 with appropriate amounts of empty vector pGEFPN1. The ratio of DNA to Lipofectamine was 1 μg to 3 μl. Reporter gene NFAT-Luc (Clontech) contains three tandem copies of the NFAT consensus sequence (18.Fiering S. Northrop J.P. Nolan G.P. Mattila P.S. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1823-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) located upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and the TATA box from the herpes simplex virus TK promoter. Located downstream of TK is the firefly luciferase reporter gene (luc) followed by the SV40 late polyadenylation signal. After endogenous NFAT transcription factors bind to the cis-acting enhancer element, transcription is induced, and the reporter gene is activated. The negative control construct TK-luciferase, in which the reporter gene is controlled by thymidine kinase minimal promoter without upstream NFAT binding sites, was used as described (19.Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h, and quiescent cells were pretreated with 100 nm Ang II (Sigma) for 18 h. The cells were lysed with 50 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min. 10 μl of the cell extract was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase reagent, and the light produced was measured for 10 s with a Victor microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results were normalized to the CMV-Renilla-luciferase internal control. RNA Interference and Western Blot—Human ATRAP small interference RNA with 19 nucleotides overhung by 3′ dTdT was synthesized from Invitrogen. The sense oligonucleotide is 5′-CCU GAA GGU GAU UCU CCU AdTdT-3′, and the antisense oligonucleotide is 5′-UAG GAG AAU CAC CUU CAG GdTdT-3′. The annealed double-stranded small interference RNA (siRNA) was introduced into HEK293 cells with the help of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to analysis of luciferase activities. For Western blot analysis, 107 HEK293 cells were plated on 6-well plates and transfected the next day by siRNA with 9 μl of Lipofectamine/well. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed in cold PBS buffer twice and harvested by scraping in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μl/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The insoluble protein was dissolved in 1× NuPAGE SDS sample buffer, and equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto 12% NuPAGE bis-tris gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then incubated with ATRAP antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBST, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Pierce) was used for detection. The membrane was stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature, and β-actin antibody was used to determine equal protein loading. Secondary antibodies were either anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate or anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) as required. Our laboratory previously identified the novel protein ATRAP that interacts with the C-terminal end of mouse AT1 receptor. The functional significance of ATRAP in AT1 receptor signaling remains unclear. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of ATRAP-mediated AT1 signaling, we employed the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify candidate proteins that interact with mouse ATRAP. Screening of 3 × 106 transformants from a mouse testis primary cDNA library resulted in the isolation of several independent clones that have the potential to interact with ATRAP. Sequence analysis identified 12 clones that encoded for CAML. On the basis of information from the yeast screening, mouse CAML full-length cDNA was cloned into the yeast two-hybrid expression vector pGADT7. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, CAML expressed in the reporter strain AH109 does not interact with lamin C, but CAML expressed in yeast can interact with ATRAP by activating the reporter gene α-galactosidase. Furthermore, using a series of deletions of ATRAP, we were able to determine that the N-terminal domain of ATRAP (aa 40–80) primarily mediates this interaction. No interaction between CAML and AT1 or AT2 was observed. To determine the CAML structural domain involved in the interaction with ATRAP, the N-terminal end of CAML spanning aa 1–189 and C-terminal end of CAML spanning aa 189–296 were cloned into two-hybrid expression vector pGADT7. As shown in Fig. 1B, a strong interaction between ATRAP and the N-terminal end of CAML (aa 1–189) was observed; in contrast, the C-terminal end of CAML (aa 189–296) does not interact with ATRAP. We next validated the interaction of ATRAP and CAML in cells by immunoprecipitation assays. We transfected HEK293 cells with the expression vector pCMV-HA encoding CAML aa 1–189, CAML aa 189–296, or no insert. As shown in Fig. 1C, the N-terminal end of CAML (aa 1–189) but not the C-terminal end of CAML (aa 189–296) was able to interact with endogenous ATRAP, which is consistent with the result from a yeast assay, as shown in Fig. 1B. Moreover, we confirmed the interaction of CAML with ATRAP in intact cells by the use of BRET assays. BRET is a sensitive technology developed for detecting protein-protein interactions (20.Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) in living cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, HEK293 cells expressing chimeric forms of ATRAP fused to GFP and CAML fused to luciferase provided a significant BRET signal only when ATRAP was tagged with GFP at the C-terminal end and when luciferase was tagged at the N-terminal end of CAML. We next tested whether the subcellular distribution of ATRAP colocalizes with that of CAML. Immunohistochemistry of endogenous ATRAP and CAML has shown these proteins located in endoplasmic reticulum vesicular structures (14.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Liu X. Tamura K. Dzau V.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5038-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21.Holloway M.P. Bram R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in the Fig. 2C, cotransfection of GFP·CAML and RFP·ATRAP in HEK293 cells shows a sharp colocalization of both proteins at perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum structures, in a pattern similar to the distribution of endogenous ATRAP (14.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Liu X. Tamura K. Dzau V.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5038-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we determined the distribution of N-terminal end and C-terminal deletion mutants of CAML. As expected, the N-terminal end of CAML (aa 1–189) projects the protein into cytoplasm, whereas the C-terminal end of CAML (aa 189–296) is membrane-associated, showing a pattern similar to the full-length CAML (data not shown). These results provide evidence for ATRAP and CAML interaction both in yeast and in mammalian cells. We next sought to determine the functional significance of the interaction between ATRAP and CAML. CAML protein has been shown to participate in the activation of NFAT transcription factor in T cells by stimulating calcium release and then activating calcineurin (23.Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that Ang II is an activator for the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes, where it contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (25.Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Walsh K. Goto A. Omata M. Fujita T. Nagai R. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that CAML mediated the effect of Ang II in regulation of NFAT signaling. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of CAML mimics the effect of Ang II; however, there was little additive effect of Ang II in cells transfected with CAML expression vector. Deletion of the NFAT consensus sequence on the reporter gene abolished the effect of Ang II or CAML (data not shown). Previous studies have suggested that the N-terminal end of CAML is responsible for mediating protein interactions, whereas the C-terminal acts as an effector domain (17.von Bulow G.U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 21.Holloway M.P. Bram R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16346-16350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); therefore, we further tested whether the expression of truncated forms of CAML could modulate the effect of Ang II on NFAT promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpression of ATRAP-interacting domain of CAML (aa 1–189) sensitized the effect of Ang II on NFAT promoter activity by increasing its activation by 12-fold over the untreated control, whereas overexpression of the C-terminal end of CAML (aa 189–296) disrupted the effect of Ang II. The expression of CAML truncations did not significantly change the basal level of the reporter gene activity. These data suggest that CAML is actively involved the Ang II-induced NFAT signal pathway. We next determined whether ATRAP is a critical mediator for the Ang II-CAML-NFAT pathway. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of cells with Ang II or overexpression of CAML induced the NFAT reporter gene by 4-fold. In contrast, overexpression of ATRAP decreased the basal level of NFAT reporter gene expression and disrupted Ang II-induced promoter activity. Moreover, overexpression of ATRAP blocked CAML-induced promoter activity. These results indicate that ATRAP is involved in the NFAT pathway activated by Ang II and may be a negative regulator in the AT1 signaling pathway. To confirm the putative role of ATRAP in the NFAT pathway, we examined the effect of RNA interference ATRAP knockdown in the regulation of promoter activity in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, transfection of 40 nm ATRAP siRNA significantly decreased ATRAP protein levels, whereas the control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA had no effect on the protein levels of ATRAP. Furthermore, transfection of 40 nm ATRAP siRNA increased the basal level of NFAT promoter activity by 2-fold, and knockdown of ATRAP sensitized the effect of Ang II on promoter activity, increasing it by 6-fold (Fig. 4C). Thus, CAML is actively involved in the Ang II-induced NFAT signaling pathway by interacting with ATRAP. We explored the signaling cascade of AT1 receptors by identifying candidate proteins that can interact with ATRAP. Discovering that CAML as a partner for ATRAP enabled us to examine the molecular mechanisms by which ATRAP is involved in AT1 receptor-mediated cellular actions. CAML was initially identified as an important regulator of the T cell receptor signaling pathway (21.Holloway M.P. Bram R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16346-16350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22.Holloway M.P. Bram R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23.Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), where it causes increase of Ca2+ influx, which can in turn activate the phosphatase calcineurin, leading to dephosphorylation of NFAT transcription factor. CAML has been implicated in the signal transduction cascade from a member of the tumor necrosis receptor family (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI)) to activation of NFAT, AP-1, and NFκB transcription factor (17.von Bulow G.U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and also has been reported to interact with epidermal growth factor receptor (24.Tran D.D. Russell H.R. Sutor S.L. van Deursen J. Bram R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CAML is thought to be a signal intermediate in T cell receptor signaling and may act upstream of calcineurin/NFAT and downstream of T cell receptor. Several other lines of evidence have shown that Ang II can activate the NFAT pathway, which contributes to cell growth and cardiac hypertrophy (25.Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Walsh K. Goto A. Omata M. Fujita T. Nagai R. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R.

Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The finding of CAML associated with the AT1/ATRAP complex may help us to elucidate a molecular link between AT1 receptor signaling and the downstream activation of NFAT signaling. Our previous studies of the association of ATRAP with AT1 receptor suggest that ATRAP reduces Ang II-induced inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate generation (14.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Liu X. Tamura K. Dzau V.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5038-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15.Daviet L. Lehtonen J.Y. Tamura K. Griese D.P. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17058-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the current study, we employed gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches and demonstrated that ATRAP negatively regulates Ang II-induced NFAT signaling. Overexpression of ATRAP in cells not only blocked the Ang II-induced NFAT reporter gene activity but also impaired the CAML-mediated transactivation of the NFAT reporter gene, suggesting that ATRAP disrupts the Ang II effect on NFAT by interacting with CAML, leading to down-regulation of cell signaling. Conversely, the ATRAP knockdown by siRNA increased the NFAT transcriptional activity and sensitized the effect of Ang II on gene expression. Interestingly, overexpression of the N-terminal end (aa 1–189) of CAML, which can interact with ATRAP, sensitized the effect of Ang II on NFAT reporter gene activity, suggesting that CAML N-terminal end might act in a dominant negative fashion for ATRAP, and the interaction between ATRAP and N-terminal end of CAML releases the inhibition of ATRAP for downstream signaling. On the basis of our current understanding of ATRAP and CAML interaction, we proposed a model to interpret the interaction between ATRAP and CAML in cells, as shown in Fig. 5. In this model, the AT1 receptor complex consists of different protein partners, of which CAML acts as a mediator and ATRAP acts as a desensitizer. ATRAP could act as a brake for the AT1 receptor activation toward CAML-NFAT signaling. On the other hand, CAML could also be able to regulate the ATRAP inhibitory role since overexpression of an ATRAP-interacting domain of CAML (aa 1–189) increased NFAT activity, probably by interfering with ATRAP actions. There may also be an additional not yet identified X factor that could act as a modulator of ATRAP; this factor could be displaced by overexpression of the N-terminal domain of CAML (aa 1–189). On the other hand, CAML has been shown to interact with transmembrane activator and CAML interactor in cell membranes and/or intracellular Ca2+ pools, such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (17.von Bulow G.U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 21.Holloway M.P. Bram R.J. J. Biol.

Considering the colocalization of CAML and ATRAP, we speculate that their interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum may also regulate intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, dependent on or independent of AT1 signaling. The pools of endogenous ATRAP and CAML provide a regulatory system for the Ang II signaling onto NFAT. In this study, we provide evidence that the interaction of ATRAP and CAML mediates the action of Ang II on NFAT activation. However, several important issues remain unclear. For example, to what extent does the interaction of ATRAP and CAML control the physiological function of Ang II? What is the role of this pathway in regulating vascular contraction in which Ca2+ metabolism is actively involved? What is the functional significance of the ATRAP pathway in regulating cardiac hypertrophy? Molkentin's group (26.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R.

Our preliminary data show that CAML is up-regulated, whereas ATRAP is down-regulated in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy. 2S. Guo, M. Lopez-Ilasaca, and V. J. Dzau, unpublished observations.

In the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ATP-evoked rises of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i>) because of mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These responses were reduced by prior exposure to hypoxia but potentiated during hypoxia. Hypoxia itself liberated Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER, but unlike the effects of ATP this effect was not inhibited by blockade of the inositol trisphosphate receptor. By contrast, ryanodine blocked the effects of hypoxia but not those of ATP. Antioxidants abolished the effects of hypoxia but potentiated the effects of ATP. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase also augmented ATP-evoked responses but was without effect on hypoxia-evoked rises of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i>. However, either uncoupling mitochondrial electron transport or inhibiting complex I markedly suppressed the actions of hypoxia yet exerted only small inhibitory effects on ATP-evoked rises of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i>. Both hypoxia and ATP were able to activate capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Our results indicate that hypoxia regulates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via two distinct pathways. First, it modulates agonist-evoked liberation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER primarily through regulation of reactive oxygen species generation from NADPH oxidase.

These results demonstrate the utility of PWR spectroscopy to provide insights into raft formation and protein sorting in model lipid membranes. The classical textbook model of biomembrane structure, usually referred to as the fluid-mosaic model, envisions a two-dimensional solution of integral membrane proteins in a homogeneous lipid solvent, albeit one composed of many molecular lipid species and possessing inside-outside asymmetry with respect to both protein and lipid components. However, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition that lateral segregation of lipids and proteins occurs within regions of biomembranes called rafts (cf. Refs. 1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar and 2Simons K. Vaz W.L.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33 (W. L. C.): 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Along with caveolae, which are invaginations of raft regions stabilized by interactions with oligomers of the protein caveolin, these microdomains have been suggested to play important roles in cell polarity, protein sorting, signal transduction, and membrane trafficking (cf. Refs. 3Chini B. Parenti M. J. Mol. Endrocrinol. 2004; 32: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar and 4Ostrom R.S. Insel P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 145: 235-245Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar).One of the key properties of rafts is their high content of sphingomyelin (SM) 1The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; POPC, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; PWR, plasmon-waveguide resonance; PLAP, placental alkaline phosphatase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; POPC, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; PWR, plasmon-waveguide resonance; PLAP, placental alkaline phosphatase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and cholesterol, which leads to their being organized into what are referred to as liquid-ordered domains. These are characterized by being more highly ordered and somewhat thicker than the surrounding liquid-disordered regions of the membrane. This is a consequence of the ordering influence of cholesterol and the presence in SM of a larger proportion of saturated fatty acyl chains. However, it should be noted that studies of model membranes have shown that microdomain formation also occurs in phosphatidylcholine (PC)/SM mixtures in the absence of cholesterol (2Simons K. Vaz W.L.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33 (W. L. C.): 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). These lipid phases can coexist within a single bilayer, giving rise to a heterogeneous pattern of islands of differing composition. Protein enrichment in raft/caveola microdomains (cf. Refs. 4Ostrom R.S. Insel P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 145: 235-245Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar and 5Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) is thought to be a consequence of selective interactions between the liquid-ordered microdomains and various types of membrane anchors, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moieties bound to the C terminus or fatty acyl chains attached to serine residues, as well as interactions occurring between proteins and caveolin oligomers or via hydrophobic matching to the slightly thicker rafts in the case of transmembrane proteins. Such enrichment can have two consequences, i.e. co-localization of various signaling components (e.g. receptors and G-proteins) and microenvironmental effects on protein functional properties, both of which have important pharmacological implications (cf. Refs. 3Chini B. Parenti M. J. Mol. Endrocrinol. 2004; 32: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar and 4Ostrom R.S. Insel P.A. Br. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10219-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by raft localization.Model membrane studies have shown that lipid-lipid interactions are sufficient to induce the formation of raft-like domains (12Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volvyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar, 13Saslowsky D.E.

It is well established that phase separation can occur in binary lipid mixtures consisting of lipids that have different phase transition temperatures. Typically, a gel phase, which is characterized by tightly packed lipids that have limited mobility, coexists with a fluid or liquid-disordered phase in which the lipids are loosely packed and have a high degree of lateral mobility. Addition of cholesterol has been reported to modify the gel phase component of such systems, resulting in the formation of a liquid-ordered phase in which the lipids are still tightly packed, but acquire a relatively high degree of lateral movement (14Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 15Crane J.M. Tamm L.K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2965-2979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Currently, however, the requirement for cholesterol in raft formation in biological membranes is unclear (13Saslowsky D.E. Lawrence J. Ren X. Brown D.A. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26966-26970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Lawrence J.C. Saslowsky D.E. Edwardson J.M. Henderson R.M. Biophys.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).To investigate lipid raft characteristics in model membranes, SM is commonly combined with phospholipids having unsaturated and therefore kinked fatty acyl chains, such as dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), with or without cholesterol. As noted above, SM lipids typically have long saturated acyl chains that facilitate close packing, an important feature of lipid raft organization (18Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). For this reason, SM-enriched domains in a bilayer are thicker than areas enriched in more fluid, unsaturated lipids, which have kinked chains that effectively shorten the molecular length. These structural differences between diverse types of membranes create significant modifications in their mechanical properties that in turn can lead to segregation of transmembrane proteins (19McIntosh T.J. Vidal A. Simon S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1656-1666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5107) Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy experiments (21Giocondi M.-C. Boichot S. Plenat T. Le Grimellec C. Ultramicroscopy. 2004; 100: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have revealed the existence of a marked structural diversity of gel phase SM-enriched microdomains, which can adopt mesoscopic structures of varied sizes and shapes, for both single mixtures as well as different PC species (e.g. DOPC and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC)).A number of biochemical and biophysical methodologies have been used to investigate microdomain systems in both whole cells and model membranes, such as low temperature extraction with nonionic detergents; effects of cholesterol depletion; and various forms of visualization, including electron, atomic force, and fluorescence microscopies. All of these methods have potential problems (5Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar); and thus, despite a great deal of effort in recent years, there is no consensus yet on the size, lifetime, composition, or even existence of rafts in the plasma membrane of living cells (cf. Refs. 2Simons K. Vaz W.L.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33 (W. L. C.): 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar and 22Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). As might be expected, the most definitive studies have been done with model membranes (cf. Ref. 2Simons K. Vaz W.L.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33 (W. L. C.): 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), with atomic force microscopy (13Saslowsky D.E. Lawrence J.

Ronzon F. Roux B. Le Grimelec C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (23Bacia K. Scherfeld D. Kahya N. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) being particularly effective in such systems. These methodologies have clearly shown the spontaneous formation of laterally segregated domains within lipid bilayers and selective protein incorporation into such domains.In this work, we will demonstrate that plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy, applied to self-assembled solid-supported lipid bilayers, provides a uniquely useful method for observing raft formation in real-time and for obtaining information on the molecular composition of microdomains. The uniqueness of this spectroscopic technique is that it allows the most important structural parameters of a lipid membrane, such as thickness, average surface area occupied by one lipid molecule (or molecular packing density), and degree of long-range molecular order, to be characterized for a single lipid bilayer in both steady-state and kinetic modes. Unlike other techniques for domain visualization, PWR can also provide insights into microenvironmental effects on protein functional properties (24Alves I.D. Ciano K.A. Boguslavski V. Varga E. Salamon Z. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Tollin G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44673-44682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have applied this methodology to solid-supported lipid bilayers composed of mixtures of SM with DOPC and with POPC. As will be seen below, these spontaneously generate segregated microdomains that can be directly observed and characterized by PWR spectroscopy. We have also incorporated a GPI-linked protein (placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP)) into such bilayers and have shown that this protein preferentially associates with the SM-enriched microdomains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPWR Spectroscopy—The principles of PWR spectroscopy have been thoroughly described in previous publications (25Salamon Z. Macleod H.A. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2791-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 26Salamon Z. Tollin G. Spectroscopy. 2001; 15: 161-175Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we will briefly review those aspects that are especially relevant to this study. PWR spectra can be described by three parameters: spectral position, spectral width, and resonance depth. These experimental features depend on the optical properties of the bilayer membrane, which are determined by the surface mass density (i.e. the amount of mass per unit surface area), the spatial mass distribution (i.e. the internal structure of the membrane, including molecular anisotropy and the long-range molecular order of the bilayer), the membrane thickness, and the absorption or light scattering properties of the membrane at the plasmon excitation wavelength. These optical properties are described by three optical parameters, refractive index (n), extinction (or scattering) coefficient (k), and thickness (t) of the membrane, which can be evaluated by thin film electromagnetic theory based on Maxwell's equations (27Macleod H.A. Thin Film Optical Filters. ADAM Hilger, Bristol1986Crossref Google Scholar, 28Salamon Z. Brown M.F. Tollin G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 213-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as both excitation wavelengths (632.8 and 543.5 nm) in this work are far removed from the absorption bands of the lipids and proteins used, a k value different from zero reflects a decrease in reflected light intensity due only to scattering resulting from imperfections in the membrane film. It is important to recognize that for anisotropic thin films, such as the lipid bilayer membranes in this work, scattering will be different for different exciting light polarizations.The refractive index is a macroscopic quantity and is related to the properties of individual molecules through the molecular polarizability tensor as well as to the environment in which these molecules are located (e.g. packing density and internal organization) (29De Jeu W.H. Gray G. Liquid Crystal Monographs. 1. Gordon and Breach, Amsterdam1978: 31-48Google Scholar). Environmental properties are especially important when molecules are located in a matrix (such as a biomembrane) that has a nonrandom organization and thus possesses long-range spatial molecular order. Such molecular ordering creates an optically anisotropic system with a uniaxial optical axis having two (different) principal refractive indices, ne (also denoted as n∥ or np) and no (also referred to as n⊥ or ns) (29De Jeu W.H. Gray G. Liquid Crystal Monographs. 1. Gordon and Breach, Amsterdam1978: 31-48Google Scholar). The first of these indices is associated with a linearly polarized light wave in which the electric vector is polarized parallel to the optical axis. The second one is observed for light in which the electric vector is perpendicular to the optical axis. This is the fundamental basis upon which measurement of refractive indices with polarized light can lead to the evaluation of the structural parameters of anisotropic systems such as a lipid bilayer membrane. In the simplified case in which the molecular shape is rod-like (e.g. phospholipid molecules) and the molecules are ordered such that their long axes are parallel, one has an optically anisotropic system whose optical axis is perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer (30Salamon Z. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1557-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The values of the refractive indices measured with two polarizations of light (i.e. parallel (np) and perpendicular (ns) to the optical axis) will describe this optical anisotropy (An) as follows (Equation 1), An=((np)2−(ns)2)/((nav)2+2)(Eq. 1) where nav is the average value of the refractive index. A uniaxial system in which the optical axis is parallel to the membrane normal is described by Equation 2. nav=1/3((np)2+2(ns)2)(Eq. 2) In summary, An reflects the spatial mass distribution created by both the anisotropy in the molecular polarizability and the degree of long-range order of molecules within the system (30Salamon Z. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1557-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Furthermore, as can be seen from the Lorentz-Lorenz relation, nav is also directly related to the mass surface density (for details, see Refs. 31Born M. Wolf E. Principles of Optics. Pergamon Press, New York1965Google Scholar and 32Cuypers P.A. Corsel J.W. Janssen M.P. Kop J.M.M. Hermens W.T. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2426-2431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Equation 3), m=0.1M/A(t((nav)2−1)/(nav)2+2)(Eq. 3) where M is molecular weight, A is molar refractivity, and t is the thickness of the membrane. For the lipid molecules used in this work, a reasonable approximation of M/A is 3.6 (32Cuypers P.A. Corsel J.W. Janssen M.P. Kop J.M.M. Hermens W.T. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2426-2431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, from the thickness of the membrane (t) and nav, one can calculate the surface mass density (or molecular packing density), i.e. mass per unit surface area (or number of moles/unit surface area (30Salamon Z. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1557-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)), which reflects the surface area occupied by a single molecule.In these experiments, the plasmon-generating device was calibrated by measuring the PWR spectra of the resonator using two laser light wavelengths, green (λ = 543.5 nm) and red (λ = 632.8 nm), with both p- and s-polarized light and then simulating these spectra with theoretical curves. Both of these wavelengths produced essentially equivalent results in our experiments. The goal of such a calibration is to obtain the optical parameters of the sensor. This provides an input set of data that is used in analyzing the resonance spectra obtained with the lipid membrane system deposited on the resonator surface.Spectral Simulation—The purpose of simulating experimental spectra by theoretical resonance curves is to evaluate the optical parameters of the bilayer membrane (i.e. np, ns, t and k) and then to use these values (see Equations 1, 2, 3) to calculate the surface mass density (or packing density) and the refractive index anisotropy. This provides a detailed description of the membrane structure. Simulation is based on two facts. First, the PWR spectrum can be described by the classical electromagnetic theory of thin films (27Macleod H.A. Thin Film Optical Filters. ADAM Hilger, Bristol1986Crossref Google Scholar), and the equations describing such resonance curves can be used in the simulation to obtain the component curves. Second, the number of measured parameters (i.e. position, width, and depth of the curve) equals the number of unknown optical parameters. Hence, one can uniquely determine the latter from the simulated spectra. We used this approach in our previous study (33Salamon Z. Cowell S. Varga E. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2463-2474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by nonlinear least-squares fitting of a theoretical resonance curve to the experimental spectra. This is relatively easy to do when the spectrum corresponds to a single resonance. The current application of such an approach is made more complicated by the fact that the experimental spectrum is a complex one, i.e. it consists of more than one (usually two) single resonance curves. Therefore, the simulation has to be done in two steps. First, one must calculate single resonance curves for the components; and second, one must sum such single resonance curves using appropriate ratios to fit the complex spectrum.It is important to emphasize that the first step results in an evaluation of the optical parameters that describe the physical properties of those parts of the lipid membrane that contribute to this particular single resonance curve. As discussed in our previous studies (26Salamon Z. Tollin G. Spectroscopy. 2001; 15: 161-175Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Salamon Z. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1557-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Salamon Z. Cowell S. Varga E. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2463-2474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the three optical parameters characterizing an immobilized lipid bilayer (n, k, and t) can be obtained with a high degree of accuracy because they are well separated in their effects on the plasmon resonance spectra. Theoretical analysis of the effect of each optical parameter on the resonance spectra allows the evaluation of error limits for each of these parameters (26Salamon Z. Tollin G. Spectroscopy. 2001; 15: 161-175Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The values of such errors have been included in the analysis of the experimental results presented below. The second step provides information about the ratio of the bilayer surfaces covered by the two different kinds of membrane that are exposed to the excitation laser beam. This is based on the fact that the area under a resonance curve is constant; and therefore, a single resonance will result in a narrow and deep resonance curve, whereas two resonances occurring simultaneously will broaden the spectrum and make it shallower. There is another important consequence of the simulation process in the case of PWR measurements with a single lipid membrane. Although repetition of the measurements in separate experiments with the same type of membrane will result in similar values of the optical properties of the components, the ratio of the surface areas covered by the different membrane components that are exposed to the excitation laser beam may vary from membrane to membrane; and therefore, the final complex spectrum may change its visual characteristics (see below). This implies that one can average the parameter values obtained from different measurements and use them to calculate physical quantities describing the properties of such types of bilayers. This has been done in this work.In the present case, because we were able to measure and simulate the spectra of membranes formed from a single component lipid (DOPC, POPC, and SM), we could use such curves as a starting point in simulation of spectra of lipid membranes consisting of mixtures of these components. Iteration of such simulation was performed by variation of the optical parameters of the appropriate single lipid component spectrum until appropriate agreement with the experimental spectra was obtained. As we will demonstrate below, the final deconvoluted component spectra obtained from the mixture that describe the separate phases were always different from those of the single component curves, indicating that each of the separate phases contained small amounts of the other lipid. This will be discussed further.Formation of Lipid Membranes and Incorporation of Protein—In this study, self-assembled solid-supported lipid membranes were used. The details of sample compartment design and the protocols for membrane formation and protein incorporation have been described previously (for example, see Refs. 25Salamon Z. Macleod H.A. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2791-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 26Salamon Z. Tollin G. Spectroscopy. 2001; 15: 161-175Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, and 33Salamon Z. Cowell S. Varga E. Yamamura H.I. Hruby V.J. Tollin G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2463-2474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here, we present a short summary of these descriptions. The method for membrane preparation involves spreading a small amount of lipid solution across an orifice in a Teflon block separating the silica surface of the PWR resonator from the aqueous phase. The hydrated silica surface attracts the polar groups of the lipid molecules to form a monolayer with the hydrocarbon chains oriented toward the excess lipid solution. Spontaneous bilayer formation is initiated when the sample compartment of the resonator is filled with an aqueous solution, resulting in a thinning process to form the second monolayer of the lipid and a plateau-Gibbs border consisting of lipid solution that anchors the bilayer to the Teflon block. This border allows excess lipid solution to flow in or out of the orifice in response to protein insertion and/or conformation changes.When the appropriate lipid compositions were used, the bilayers produced PWR spectra that displayed two resonances. As we will demonstrate below, these can be ascribed to the spontaneous formation of microdomains within the bilayer due to lateral segregation of lipid molecules. As has been shown by atomic force microscopy (13Saslowsky D.E. Lawrence J. Ren X. Brown D.A. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26966-26970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Milhiet P.-E. Giocondi M.-C. Baghdadi O. Ronzon F. Roux B. Le Grimelec C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), SM-enriched microdomains are randomly distributed within the liquid-disordered regions of the bilayer. In the PWR device, the size of the laser probe (∼0.2-mm cross-section) is much larger than the individual microdomain sizes. Thus, in a typical PWR experiment, we are averaging across many such microdomains. Since the microdomain distribution, as well as the sampling of the population by the laser probe, can vary from one experiment to another, some variability is expected in the observed ratio between resonances associated with the liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains. As will be described below, this was indeed observed. However, the analysis of the resonance spectra in terms of the optical properties of the components will not be affected by this variability. It is important to point out that diffusion of these microdomains within the bilayer is relatively slow (on the order of minutes; see below for examples), so an individual PWR spectrum, which is obtained in a few seconds, is not influenced by such movement. Furthermore, we estimated that to be observable by PWR at the wavelengths we used, microdomain sizes must be larger than ∼100 nm.After lipid membrane equilibration, G"
https://openalex.org/W2075269627,"The pollutant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (“dioxin”), has been implicated in the etiology of a wide variety of human birth defects. In an effort to identify pharmacological blockers of dioxin-induced terata, we performed a histological and microscopic analysis of the developing murine palate that had been exposed to dioxin. In both in vivo and in vitro model systems, we observed that dioxin exposure leads to a reduction in the number of filopodial extensions at the medial epithelial edge of the developing palate. Given that this filopodial aberration is similar to the phenotype observed in Tgfβ3 null mice, a mutant known to display a 100% incidence of cleft palate, we examined the interaction between TGFβ3 and dioxin in palatal fusion. We found that that the addition of TGFβ3 to an in vitro palate culture model prevented the dioxin-induced reduction in filopodial density. Moreover, TGFβ3 exposure completely prevented the dioxin-induced block of palatal fusion in this system. Although these data do not point to a direct cellular or molecular mechanism for TGFβ3 dioxin antagonism, these results do suggest that TGFβ3 or stimulators of this signaling pathway hold potential as antidotes for dioxin-induced terata and that this opposing pharmacology may extend to additional toxicological endpoints.

Thus, existing epidemiological data suggest that prenatal and postnatal populations are sensitive to halogenated dioxin/halogenated dibenzofuran exposure and that these compounds may be significant human teratogens. The identification of blockers of dioxin-induced toxicity/teratogenicity could have significant benefit to human and wildlife populations. If such antidotes can be developed with a high therapeutic index, they could be used to minimize consequences in situations where dioxin exposure is known and an individual or developing fetus is at high risk. To work toward this goal, we have begun using late stage developmental endpoints and in vitro organ culture models in a search for pharmacological blockers of dioxin teratogenicity. In this effort, we identified TGFβ3 as an effective antidote to dioxin-induced cleft palate. Mice—Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility on corn-cob bedding with food and water ad libitum according to the rules and regulations set by the University of Wisconsin. All of the C57BL6/J mice were obtained originally from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in-house. Cleft Palate Assessment in Vivo—Female mice were weighed at E0. The E0 time point is defined as the time directly prior to females being mated to male mice for 12 h. At E10, females were weighed and those gaining at least two grams were assumed pregnant. Pregnant females were dosed intraperitoneally with 64.0 μg of dioxin/kg body weight. At E18, the embryos were harvested. Normal palatogenesis was assessed based on gross examination of the palate surface after an incision was made through the temporal-mandibular joint. A diagnosis of “cleft palate” was made if there was no fusion between the secondary palatal shelves. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Scanning electron microscopy (SE) was used to characterize the fine surface structure of the palate. Micrographs were taken at the surface of the palate at E18.5 and at the medial edge epithelia (MEE) at E13.5. The SE was performed according to previously described methods (24.Arvidson K. Grafstrom R.C. Pemer A. Scanning Microsc. 1988; 2: 385-396PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were fixed for 12 h in modified Karnovsky's fixative (30% paraformaldehyde, 60% glutaraldehyde, 30% 0.2 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4). Samples were subsequently washed three times for 20 min in 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 7.4, 7.5% sucrose. After washing, the samples were incubated overnight in 2% OsO4 and then washed three times for 15 min in H2O. The embryos were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol for 10 min each until the specimen was stored in 100% ethanol. After dehydration, the samples were dried with a Samdri-780A Supercritical Point Dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD). Samples were “gold sputter-coated” using an Autoconductavac IV (See Vac, Pittsburgh, PA), and images were viewed on a Hitachi S-570 with a LaB emitter (Hitachi, Schaumburg, IL). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Palatal shelves were fixed, processed, and viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Samples were immersed for fixation in Karnovsky's fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m NaPO4 buffer (v/v), pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C. Following fixation, the samples were washed in rinsing buffer (0.1 m NaPO4) and post-fixed in 2% OsO4 buffered in 0.1 m NaPO4 buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. Post-fixed samples were washed in rinsing buffer and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol baths at 50, 70, 80, 90, and 95% for 7 min each step. The final dehydration was performed three times for 12 min each in 100% ethanol. All of the dehydration steps were performed at 25 °C. Final dehydration was performed twice for 7 min at 25 °C using propylene oxide as a transition solvent. Dehydrated samples were infiltrated in mixture EMbed-812 and Spurr's Low Viscosity embedding media (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). All of the infiltration steps used a 1:1 mixture of EMbed-812 and Spurr's medium. Ultrathin sections (70 nm thickness) were collected on Pioloform (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA)-coated 2 × 1-mm aperture copper electron microscope grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Ultrathin sectioning was performed on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E Ultra Microtome. The sections were post-stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The samples were viewed and documented on a Philips CM120 at 80 kV. Filopodial extensions and cellularity were quantified directly from the TEM micrographs and histology slides, respectively. Light microscope sections were cut at 0.5 μm and stained with 1% methylene blue and 1% AzureII. Palate Organ Culture—C57BL/6J female mice were weighed at gestation day 0 and mated via cohabitation with a C57BL/6J male for 6 h. The E13.0 embryos were harvested from the uterus, and palatal shelves were dissected from the embryos. Shelves were separated from the embryo proper by an incision at the mandibular joint, and the cerebrum and the cerebellum were dissected away from the palatal shelves. The remaining opposing shelves were placed into cold phosphate-buffered saline. Suspended palate organ cultures were performed as described previously (25.Taya Y. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3869-3879PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Pisano M.M. Greene R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 137: 267-274PubMed Google Scholar). Shelves were cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 1% ascorbate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cultures were treated with Me2SO, 3.3 nm dioxin in Me2SO, saline, and/or 10 ng/ml recombinant human TGFβ3 in saline (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After 72 h, the organ cultures were fixed in 10% formalin and stained with hematoxylin for visualization or cultured for 48 h and processed for transmission electron microscopy. Histological examination was performed through hematoxylin and eosin-stained 5-μm serial sections of each culture condition in triplicate. Known Teratology of Dioxins—Halogenated dioxins, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, have proven to be powerful tools in understanding environmentally mediated teratogenesis. This power stems from the extensive pharmacological, genetic, and molecular evidence that the teratogenicity of dioxin is mediated through a ligand-activated transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (27.Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Yao E.F. Denison M.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5060-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29.Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A.

Lett. 1995; 82–83: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two lines of experimental evidence provide compelling proof for the role of AHR in dioxin-induced terata. First, dioxin congeners that bind most avidly to the AHR are the most potent with regard to the induction of both cleft palate and hydronephrosis (32.van Leeuwen F.X. Feeley M. Schrenk D. Larsen J.C. Farland W. Younes M. Chemosphere. 2000; 40: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 33.van Leeuwen F.X. Organohalogen Compounds. 1997; 34: 237Google Scholar, 34.Van den Berg M.

Toxicol. 1986; 26: 371-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a naturally occurring polymorphism in the gene encoding the murine AHR yields mouse strains that bind dioxin with both high and low affinity (37.Gonzalez F.J. Tukey R.H. Nebert D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 117-121PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Poland A. Palen D. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 915-921PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 306-312PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with the high affinity receptor are ten times more sensitive to the teratogenic effects of dioxin (27.Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar). It is the working model of our laboratory that dioxin-induced up-regulation of AHR-transcriptional targets is responsible for teratological endpoints such as cleft palate (41.Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E. Thomae T.L. Lahvis G.P. Lin B.C. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17767-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). An understanding of a toxicants mechanism of action has two major values. The most common application of mechanistic information is to help in estimating risk from exposure (42.Safe S. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1990; 21: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). For example, in the case of dioxin toxicology, mechanistic information has been used to model the dose response curve for tumor promotion based upon data from surrogate transcriptional endpoints, such as interleukin-1α, plasminogen activator-1, and cytochromes P450 (43.Sutter T.R. Guzman K. Dold K.M. Greenlee W.F. Science. 1991; 254: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A second use of mechanistic information in toxicology is to aid in the design of intervention strategies that can be employed in the case of accidental exposure, i.e. to help develop antidotes. A classic example of an antidote being developed based on mechanistic insight is the treatment of acetaminophen overdose by the permeable thiol drugs diethyldithiocarbamate and dithiothreitol (44.Klaassen C.D. Bracken W.M. Dudley R.E. Goering P.L. Hazelton G.A. Hjelle J.J. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1985; 5: 806-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Lauriault V.V. O'Brien P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 125-134PubMed Google Scholar). It is our proposal that similar antidotes can be developed for highly toxic receptor-mediated toxicants/teratogens such as dioxin. Novel Teratology of Dioxin—Many laboratories have established that dioxin is a potent teratogen in the mouse (46.Courtney D.K. Moore J.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 47.Couture L.A. Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1990; 42: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 48.Birnbaum L.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 103: 89-94Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 49.Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Pratt R.M. Teratology. 1987; 35: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 50.Pratt R.M. Dencker L. Diewert V.M. Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen. 1984; 4: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand this model system, we initiated a thorough description of the cellular phenotypes that occur in dioxin-treated palates. The rationale was that this characterization could provide insights into the mechanism that underlies dioxin-induced teratogenesis. Earlier studies have defined a critical developmental window between E9.0 and E12.0 where the fetus is most sensitive to dioxin-induced cleft palate (50.Pratt R.M. Dencker L. Diewert V.M. Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen. 1984; 4: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Based on these earlier studies, we induced cleft palate in vivo by administration of 64 μg/kg dioxin at E10. Consistent with earlier reports, we found these conditions to yield a 100% frequency of cleft palate (data not shown). Because dioxin-induced cleft palate is known to result from failure of the palatal shelves to fuse, we found it to be present as a binary phenotype. That is, we observed either complete separation of the palatal shelves or normal fusion when assessed at E18, (Fig. 1). In addition to the well described clefting of the secondary palate, we observed that dioxin exposure leads to a number of additional endpoints that had not been previously described. These endpoints include a “heart”-shaped morphology and disorganized muscle pattern of the tongue, hypermaturation of hair follicles, absence of rugae in the posterior secondary palate, and keratinization of the hair follicles and the MEE (data not shown). Most important for the experiments described here was the observation under electron microscopy of a reduction in number and length the filopodia at the MEE of the developing palate (Fig. 1, C and D). Dioxin and TGFβ3 Opposition—The reduction in filopodia at the MEE was of interest for two reasons. First, this phenotype has previously been described in the TGFβ3 null mouse model (25.Taya Y. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3869-3879PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Martinez-Alvarez C. Bonelli R. Tudela C. Gato A. Mena J. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 331-335PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Tudela C. Formoso M.A. Martinez T. Perez R. Aparicio M. Maestro C. Del Rio A. Martinez E. Ferguson M. Martinez-Alvarez C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 333-336PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a reduction in filopodia is consistent with a failure to fuse mechanism (52.Martinez-Alvarez C. Bonelli R. Tudela C. Gato A. Mena J. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 331-335PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Ferguson M.W. Development. 1988; 103: 41-60PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Ferguson M.W. Ir. J. Med. Sci. 1987; 156: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the filopodia at the MEE intercalate and hold the shelves in proximity, allowing fusion to proceed (53.Tudela C. Formoso M.A. Martinez T. Perez R. Aparicio M. Maestro C. Del Rio A. Martinez E. Ferguson M. Martinez-Alvarez C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 333-336PubMed Google Scholar). The similarities of the palatal phenotypes between TGFβ3 null mouse embryos and those dosed in utero with dioxin prompted us to examine this relationship further. In particular, this observation suggested an opposing effect of TGFβ3 and dioxin. This led us to examine whether exogenous TGFβ3 would restore normal fusion to dioxin-treated palates. Although some attempts were made at maternal dosing regimens for TGFβ3, limited knowledge with respect to TGFβ3 transport across the placenta led us to test our ideas in a more defined system. To this end, palatal shelves were excised from E13.0 embryos and placed into a suspended culture system (26.Pisano M.M. Greene R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 137: 267-274PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Kaartinen V. Cui X.M. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Shuler C.F. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Palate fusion was scored with a dissecting microscope and verified by histological examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained serial sections through the palate organ tissue (Fig. 2, B and C). In this system, 3.3 nm dioxin completely prevents palatal fusion (Fig. 2A) (57.Abbott B.D. Diliberto J.J. Birnbaum L.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 100: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 58.Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1991; 43: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). More importantly, we observed that the addition of 10 ng/ml TGFβ3 concomitant with 3.3 nm dioxin blocked the teratogenic effects of dioxin and restored palatal fusion to 90% (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that TGFβ3 may rescue fusion in dioxin-treated palate cultures through a restoration of filopodial extensions at the MEE (25.Taya Y. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3869-3879PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the embryonic palatal tissues were treated with Me2SO, dioxin, and dioxin + TGFβ3 and scored for density of filopodia at the MEE (Fig. 3, A–C). This quantification was performed across 242 μm of the MEE surface extending equilaterally from the tip of the palatal shelf. The average number of filopodial extensions per shelf for a Me2SO-treated, dioxin-treated, and dioxin + TGFβ3-treated culture was 234, 70, and 133, respectively (Fig. 4). That is, dioxin exposure led to a 3-fold reduction in the number of filopodial extensions at the MEE compared with the control. More importantly, the addition of TGFβ3 with the dioxin treatment doubled the number of filopodial extensions compared with cultures treated with dioxin alone.Fig. 4Quantification of filopodial extensions. Filopodial extensions were quantified directly from the TEM micrographs. Filopodial extensions were quantified across 242 μm of shelf surface from each treatment condition. The bars on the histogram represent the mean filopodia number per shelf performed in triplicate for each treatment. Me2SO (DMSO) had significantly more filopodia than dioxin- or dioxin + TGFβ3-treated palate cultures, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.002, respectively. The dioxin + TGFβ3-treated palate shelves had significantly more filopodial extensions than the dioxin-treated cultures (p < 0.003).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With respect to the cell biology of the MEE, the influence of dioxin and the opposing effects of TGFβ3 extend beyond the surface of the apical membrane. We also observed that dioxin exposure increases the cellularity of the MEE and that cotreatment with TGFβ3 normalizes this cellularity (Fig. 5). In this regard, the cell number of the MEE was counted across 81 μmof MEE surface extending equally from the tip of the palatal shelves. These data showed a doubling in the number of cells at the medial edge of the palate in dioxin versus Me2SO-treated cultures (p < 0.003). Yet, when TGFβ3 was added along with dioxin, the cellularity was indistinguishable from control (Fig. 5). Potential Mechanism—Our results suggest that dioxin causes cleft palate through its ability to block the exposure, maintenance, or formation of filopodial extensions at the MEE. This model is consistent with evidence from other laboratories, indicating that intercalation of filopodia at the MEE is essential for adherence of the opposing shelves and normal palatal fusion (25.Taya Y. O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 3869-3879PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Tudela C. Formoso M.A. Martinez T. Perez R. Aparicio M. Maestro C. Del Rio A. Martinez E. Ferguson M.

Biol. 2002; 250: 393-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, evidence has been previously published (60.Nawshad A. LaGamba D. Hay E.D. Arch. Oral Biol. 2004; 49: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) to indicate that apoptosis of the outer or “peridermal” cell layer of the MEE leads to exposure of the basal epithelial cell layer, which then displays the filopodia required for palatal adherence and fusion. It has also been shown previously that dioxin exposure enhances proliferation of the MEE, prevents the degeneration of the peridermal layer, and can cause the periderm to differentiate into a stratified squamous epithelium (58.Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1991; 43: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This description of the dioxin-induced response of the MEE is similar to the increase in MEE cellularity reported here (Fig. 5). We have further characterized the dioxin-induced palatal phenotype by showing that dioxin causes a reduction in filopodia at the MEE (Figs. 3 and 4). Taken together, these data are in line with a model where dioxin alters the presentation of filopodia at the MEE and prevents palatal fusion. The mechanism by which dioxin influences MEE cell biology may be through a combination of its known activities on epithelia, including stimulation of hyperplasia, metaplasia, and inhibition of apoptosis (58.Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1991; 43: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 61.Loertscher J.A. Lin T.M. Peterson R.E. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Toxicol.

These data are consistent with the idea that the mechanism for the opposition of TGFβ3 and dioxin lies at the level of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. The observation that TGFβ3 can block dioxin-induced cleft palate is also in line with the possibility that these two signaling molecules stimulate pathways that represent opposing forces in the presentation of filopodial extensions. Importantly, the MEE in TGFβ3 knock-out mice shows decreased apoptosis and an attenuated epithelial-mesenchymal transition, leading to impaired intercellular adhesion and failure of palatal fusion (66.Martinez-Alvarez C. Blanco M.J. Perez R. Rabadan M.A. Aparicio M. Resel E. Martinez T. Nieto M.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At the present time, we do not know the molecular details of the dioxin-TGFβ3 opposition. In preliminary experiments, we examined the hypothesis that dioxin inhibits intracellular signals initiated by TGFβ3. To this end, we monitored levels of TGFβ3 signaling through Western blot analysis of SMAD2 phosphorylation (67.Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Using the HepG2 cell culture model, we were unable to demonstrate any dioxin-induced interference on TGFβ3 signaling. That is, in two independent experiments, TGFβ3-induced SMAD2 phosphorylation was unaffected by dioxin treatment. 3E. A. Stevens, unpublished observation. These preliminary data lead us to suggest that dioxin does not directly inhibit intracellular TGFβ3 signaling but may influence this pathway via an indirect mechanism. It is also possible that TGFβ3 interferes with dioxin signaling. In this regard, others (68.Wolff S. Harper P.A. Wong J.M. Mostert V. Wang Y. Abel J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have reported evidence that TGFβ3 influences the expression from the AHR promoter in a cell-specific manner. Conclusions—These experiments demonstrate that dioxin and TGFβ3 have opposing effects on the developing MEE. Specifically, filopodial density and palatal fusion are reduced, whereas MEE cellularity is increased, by dioxin exposure. These three toxic endpoints are all rescued when TGFβ3 is coadministered with dioxin. At the present time, we do not know whether this opposition of TGFβ3 extends to other dioxin-induced teratological or toxic endpoints that are relevant to the human population, such as hydronephrosis, porphyria, or chloracne. Given that such dioxin-induced endpoints occur at different doses and routes of administration, they were not examined in this study (69.Wang X. Santostefano M.J. Evans M.V. Richardson V.M.

Although these results are preliminary, they do demonstrate the potential for TGFβ3 or its analogues to serve as part of interventional strategies used to treat acute dioxin exposure. Such potential may be realized if methods of safely delivering TGFβ3 can be developed (40.Zober A. Messerer P. Huber P. Int. Arch. Occup. Environ.

https://openalex.org/W2050780592,"Rod phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is the central effector enzyme in vertebrate visual transduction. Holo-PDE6 consists of two similar catalytic subunits (Pαβ) and two identical inhibitory subunits (Pγ). Pαβ is the only heterodimer in the PDE superfamily, yet its significance for the function of PDE6 is poorly understood. An unequal interaction of Pγ with Pβ as compared with Pα in the PDE6 complex has not been reported. We investigated the interaction interface between full-length Pγ and Pαβ, by differentiating Pγ interaction with each individual Pαβ subunit through radiolabel transfer from various positions throughout the entire Pγ molecule. The efficiency of radiolabel transfer indicates that the close vicinity of serine 40 on Pγ makes a major contribution to the interaction with Pαβ. In addition, a striking asymmetry of interaction between the Pγ polycationic region and the Pαβ subunits was observed when the stoichiometry of Pγ versus the Pαβ dimer was below 2. Preferential photolabeling on Pβ from Pγ position 40 and on Pα from position 30 increased while lowering the Pγ/Pαβ ratio, but diminished when the Pγ/Pαβ ratio was over 2. Our finding leads to the conclusion that two classes of Pγ binding sites exist on Pαβ, each composed of GAF domains in both Pα and Pβ, differing from the conventional models suggesting that each Pγ binds only one of the Pαβ catalytic subunits.

PDE6 mediates the photoresponse from rhodopsin to cGMP-gated ion channels, which eventually results in vision through neuronal activities (1.Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of rod PDE6 is unique within the PDE superfamily. The rod PDE6 holoenzyme is composed of two homologous catalytic subunits (Pαβ) and two identical inhibitory subunits (Pγ). The Pαβ catalytic subunits form the only heterodimer among the PDE families, although even the cone PDE6 has a catalytic homodimer Pα′α′ (2.Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Under dark conditions in the rod photoreceptor cells, the two γ subunits bind Pαβ to inhibit the catalytic activity of PDE6. Upon reception of one photon of light by rhodopsin and activation of transducin, Pγ is displaced from the catalytic site of Pαβ by interaction with the transducin α subunit (Gαt), and PDE6 is thus activated (2.Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following GTP hydrolysis on Gαt, which is greatly accelerated by the GTPase-accelerating protein complex of RGS9–1/Gβ5/R9AP (3.Keresztes G. Martemyanov K.A. Krispel C.M. Mutai H. Yoo P.J. Maison S.F. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. Heller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1581-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Pγ is released from Gαt and re-inhibits Pαβ, and thus Pαβ returns to an inactive state, ready for the next round of light activation (1.Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Therefore, because of the critical role of the Pγ/Pαβ interaction in turning on and off the rod photoresponse, the question of how Pγ binds the Pαβ heterodimer is an important issue for understanding how the activation and inactivation of PDE6 is precisely regulated in visual signal transduction. The rationale for different Pγ binding properties with Pα and Pβ arises from the following facts. 1. Although Pα and Pβ share high homology in their catalytic domains, these two subunits are 27% heterogeneous in amino acid sequence mainly in the N-terminal-half (4.Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V. Muradov K.G. Gubanov V.V. Li T. Johnston J.P. Volpp K.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12955-12959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the GAF domain (cGMP phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclases, and the Escherichia coli protein Fh1A) (5.Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), which is a structural module for regulation and signal transduction (6.Hurley J.H. Sci. STKE. 2003; 164: PE1Google Scholar). In accordance with the heterogeneous GAF sequences, the GAF domains of Pα and Pβ may have somewhat different conformations because mild trypsinization truncates Pβ in GAFa domain without cleaving Pα GAF domain (7.Catty P. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8.Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 2. The noncatalytic GAF domain plays a regulatory role in catalytic activity of PDE6, and this regulation is mediated by binding of Pγ in concert with cGMP (9.Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Two classes of cGMP binding sites and two classes of Pγ binding sites have been reported (10.Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Whalen M.M. Bitensky M.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 3. Thus far, no homodimers of Pαα or Pββ has been found to be functional, although their potential presence as minor isoforms has not been ruled out, indicating the essential role of the Pαβ heterodimer in rods (12.Artemyev N.O. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25382-25388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies of PDE6, heterogeneity of the Pα and Pβ catalytic subunits, in terms of their interactions with Pγ in the PDE6 complex, has been poorly understood. It has been reported that the N-terminal Pγ binding regions on Pα and Pβ were different, but the binding was investigated using short Pα and Pβ peptides (13.Oppert B. Cunnick J.M. Hurt D. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16607-16613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Oppert B. Takemoto D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A direct demonstration of different Pγ/Pαβ interactions in the PDE6 complex has not been shown. The difficulty for obtaining differentiated structure/function information for Pα and Pβ is because of the lack of atomic structure and the further lack of an efficient expression system to obtain recombinant Pαβ heterodimers for analysis by mutagenesis. Additionally, these two subunits are always tightly associated with each other to achieve their functions. Once separated, their function is lost. The PDE6 activity assay is a very popular method used for the study of Pγ/Pαβ interactions (2.Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but there is no readily available approach by which Pα and Pβ functions can be differentiated. The recent electron microscopy (EM) structures of rod Pαβ associated with δ subunit (15.Kameni Tcheudji J.F. Lebeau L. Virmaux N. Maftei C.G. Cote R.H. Lugnier C. Schultz P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Pαβ with bound Pγ (16.Kajimura N. Yamazaki M. Morikawa K. Yamazaki A. Mayanagi K. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 139: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have revealed the arrangement of the distinct domains of PDE6, the tandem two GAF domains and the catalytic domain. However, details of the association between Pγ and the Pα and Pβ subunits remain vague because of the low resolution (2.8 nm) of the EM-derived structures. In our approach, the reversible Pγ photoprobes, prepared with 125I-labeled ACTP (N-[3-iodo-4-azidophenylpropioamido-S-(2-thiopyridyl)] cysteine) (17.Dhanasekaran N. Wessling-Resnick M. Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17942-17950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), provide powerful tools to differentiate Pα and Pβ in their interactions with Pγ. In this study, 13 Pγ photoprobes that were generated as mixed disulfides with single cysteine substitutions at various positions throughout the entire Pγ molecule enabled us to systematically explore the Pαβ interaction interface with Pγ. Strikingly, we found a preference of radiolabel transfer to one subunit over the other from the polycationic region of Pγ following DTT reduction of the photocrosslinked Pγ/Pαβ complex, when we lowered the Pγ/Pαβ molar ratio to less than 2. Our data support a new view of interaction between the Pγ and Pαβ subunits in the rod PDE6 holoenzyme. Materials—All the restriction enzymes and chitin beads were purchased from New England Biolabs. Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. TPCK-treated trypsin was from Promega. Oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies. BBM (2-[Na-benzoylbenzoicamido-N6-(6-biotinamidocaproyl)-l-lysinyamido] ethyl methanethiosulfonate) was from Toronto Research Chemicals. Na125I was from New England Nuclear. Antibodies against Pα and Pβ are products of Affinity Bioreagents. Anti-Pα is against the bovine Pα N-terminal sequence 1–16 (MGEVTAEEVEKFLDSN); Anti-Pβ is against the mouse Pβ N-terminal sequence 20–36 (HQYFGKKLSPENVAGA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated elsewhere. Preparation of the Single Cysteine Pγ Constructs—The full-length Pγ-intein fusion construct was prepared using the IMPACT system obtained from New England Biolabs. The Pγ sequence was ligated into pTXB1 at SapI and NdeI restriction sites, in-frame with the intein domain. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the QuikChange method using Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase to mutate the single cysteine at position 68 on wild-type Pγ into alanine, and this cysteine-less construct was used as a template to substitute amino acids at various positions on Pγ with single cysteines. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, which was carried out in the Biotechnology Center at University of Wisconsin, Madison. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 DE3 cells (Novagen) for overexpression. The cells in LB culture were induced for 4–5 h at 30 °C after adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 ∼1. The cells were then lysed by sonication, and the lysate cleared by centrifugation was applied to the chitin affinity column. After extensive washing, Pγ was eluted with 140 mm β-mercaptoethanol by incubation at room temperature overnight. The eluted Pγ was ∼90% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. This preparation was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Waters 616/626 LC System) using a PEEK column (4.6 mm D/100 mm L, Applied Biosystems) self-packed with POROS 20 R2 Perfusion Chromatography Resin (PerSeptive Biosystems). Pγ fraction at ∼35% acetonitrile was lyophilized and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Holo-PDE6 and the Catalytic Pαβ Heterodimer—The preparation of holo-PDE6 and Pαβ is essentially described in Artemyev and Hamm (18.Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bovine rod outer segment membranes were prepared by the method of Papermaster and Dreyer (19.Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Holo-PDE6 was then extracted from bleached rod outer segment membranes. The holo-PDE6-containing extract was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM-30 Amicon membrane. The PDE6 catalytic heterodimer (Pαβ) was prepared by mild tryptic proteolysis of holo-PDE6 followed by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography to remove proteolytic Pγ fragments. The Pαβ preparation was >95% pure as judged from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. ACTP Derivatization of the Single Cysteine Pγ Constructs and Activity Assay—The radiosynthesis of 460 Ci/mmol 125I-ACTP was accomplished by the reaction of 125I-3-iodo-4-azidophenylpropionyl succinimide (AIPPS) and cysteine thiopyridyl (CTP) at room temperature for 12 h, based on the method described by Dhanasekaran et al. (17.Dhanasekaran N. Wessling-Resnick M. Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17942-17950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-ACTP was purified by silica gel thin layer chromatography. The derivatization reactions for the single cysteine Pγ constructs were carried out by incubating purified Pγ constructs with 46Ci/mmol 125I-ACTP (1:2 molar ratio) (20.Liu Y. Arshavsky V.Y. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26900-26907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) overnight at room temperature in a solution containing 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5 and 100 mm NaCl. The derivatized Pγ constructs were purified with AutoSeq G-50 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The specific radioactivity of each derivatized Pγ was determined by measuring the radioactivity with PhosphorImager (445 SI, Molecular Dynamics), and protein amount from scanned Coomassie Blue-stained gels. To assess function of the ACTP-modified Pγ probes, the nonradioactive Pγ derivatives were prepared using 127I-ACTP. The derivatization reaction included 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.7), 50% acetonitrile, and 127I-ACTP at ∼20-fold molar excess over Pγ. The reaction mixture was incubated under argon and at room temperature for 3 h in the dark, and then subjected to reversed phase HPLC for purification of the 127I-ACTP-derivatized Pγ using a Vydac C4 column (214MS510). An acetonitrile gradient of 0.125% per minute was applied to separate 127I-ACTP-Pγ (eluted at ∼45% acetonitrile) from underivatized Pγ at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The Pγ probe derivatized with the benzophenone compound BBM at position 40 was prepared under similar conditions. To characterize the ACTP-Pγ derivatives, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was carried out in Department of Chemistry at University of Wisconsin, Madison. The mass spectra were obtained with a Micromass (Beverly, MA) LTC mass spectrometer using a time-of-flight analyzer. The inhibition of cyclic GMP hydrolysis by the 127I-ACTP-Pγ derivatives was determined using PDE assay that utilizes [3H]cGMP, based on the method previously described (2.Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 pm Pαβ subunits were incubated in 80 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 units of bacterial alkaline phosphatase, 200 μm [3H]cGMP (100,000 cpm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the ACTP-Pγ derivatives at 25 °C. After addition of [3H]cGMP, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min, and was stopped by the addition of AG1-X2 cation exchange resin (0.5 ml of 20% bed volume suspension). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with occasional mixing and spun at 9,000 × g for 2 min. Aliquots of 0.25 ml were removed for counting in a scintillation counter. To determine Ki values, the data were fit to the equation Y = Bmax × X/(Ki + X) where X is the free Pγ concentration, and Bmax is the maximal inhibition. Photocrosslinking of ACTP-Pγ Derivatives with Pαβ—The photocrosslinking reactions were performed in the buffer UB (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 3 μm Pαβ and 125I-ACTP-Pγ. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and then photolyzed for 6 s in ice water at a distance of 10 cm from a water-jacketed AH-6 1-kilowatt high pressure mercury lamp. To reverse the disulfide bond, the sample buffer was added to a final concentration of 50 mm DTT and 0.5% SDS immediately after photolysis or after subsequent Pβ truncation with trypsin. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE 16.5% gel, and the 125I-label transfer was detected by PhosphorImager. To separate the Pα and Pβ subunits by SDS-PAGE, the N terminus of Pβ was truncated by limited trypsinization on ice following a photocrosslinking reaction. Typically, ∼4 μg of Pαβ was incubated with 2 μl of TPCK-treated trypsin on ice for 2.5 h in buffer UB, and then 5× soybean trypsin inhibitor was added, and the reaction maintained on ice for 10 min to terminate the trypsin digestion. Western and Far-Western Blotting—For Western blotting, the protein samples were prepared in 5× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, 0.45 μm) and analyzed using rabbit anti-Pα (5,000× dilution) and anti-Pβ (1,000× dilution) antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (500,000× dilution) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents obtained from Pierce. Biotin label was detected by far-Western blotting using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and ECL reagents. The separated proteins were transferred to the same brand of polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as were used for Western blotting. Horseradish peroxidase was diluted up to 200,000-fold. Analytical Methods—The Pγ concentration was measured using an extinction coefficient of 6990 at 280 nm, or by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad reagent and then corrected based on the 280 nm spectrophotometric measurement. Pαβ concentration was measured by the Bradford method using IgG as a standard. Proteins on the scanned Coomassie Blue-stained gels were quantitated using NIH Image 1.62. The Vicinity of Pγ Ser40 Is a Major Site of Interaction with Pαβ—In our study, two major Pγ binding regions with Pαβ were revealed by detection of the direct interaction between Pγ and Pαβ using the full-length Pγ probes. The region on Pγ that provided a major contribution to the interaction with Pαβ, as determined by label transfer, was defined to be in close vicinity to serine 40. To map the whole spectrum of interaction of full-length Pγ with Pαβ subunits, we generated 13 Pγ constructs with single cysteines at various positions from N-terminal position 3 through the very C-terminal position 87. The single cysteine substitutions occurred in the Pγ molecule approximately every 5–10 residues (Fig. 1A). The radioiodinated, photoreactive, and disulfide-reversible cross-linker 125I-ACTP (Fig. 1B) was used to derivatize each single cysteine through a mixed disulfide bond. Fig. 1C shows that the 125I-ACTP-Pγ derivatives were effectively purified free of excess unreacted 125I-ACTP by use of AutoSeq G50 spin columns. The mixed disulfide linkage formed between 125I-ACTP and single cysteine on Pγ was confirmed by DTT reversal (data not shown). The relatively uniform derivatization of Pγ constructs by 125I-ACTP (Table I) and the high sensitivity of the 125I radiolabel made the detection and quantitation of label transfer from Pγ to Pαβ quite convenient and accurate.Table ICharacterization of the ACTP-Pγ derivativesSingle cysteine positions125I-ACTP-Pγ-specific radioactivity127I-ACTP-Pγ derivativesESI massPDE inhibitory activityPredictedMeasuredKiBmaxCPM/μg Pγdaltonpm%WtaThe wt-Pγ (68C) sample that is not ACTP-modified.N/A9,6699,997.4 ± 0.6bA mass adduct of 328 Da has been constantly observed with the wt-Pγ construct, which has a single cysteine at position 68.12.293Leu319,45710,05010,042.0cNot measured. ± 0.215.391Ile1015,46032.289Val1616,56910,05810,056.8cNot measured. ± 0.3dThese masses were measured at a different time than the other constructs.37.096Val2119,91025.985Phe309,80510,01610,008.4 ± 0.217.076Ser406,57210,07610,068.6 ± 0.284.395Phe5019,26410,01610,009.4cNot measured. ± 0.345.193Leu604,93443.173Cys6813,83710,08610,414.1 ± 0.1bA mass adduct of 328 Da has been constantly observed with the wt-Pγ construct, which has a single cysteine at position 68.17.481Trp703,6789,9719,970.9cNot measured. ± 2.1dThese masses were measured at a different time than the other constructs.48.091Phe736,50619.383Leu766,68910,05010,043.6 ± 0.213.281Ile8712,63910,04410,045.3 ± 1.5dThese masses were measured at a different time than the other constructs.25.481a The wt-Pγ (68C) sample that is not ACTP-modified.b A mass adduct of 328 Da has been constantly observed with the wt-Pγ construct, which has a single cysteine at position 68.c Not measured.d These masses were measured at a different time than the other constructs. Open table in a new tab To assess the functional activity of the derivatized Pγ photoprobes, the nonradioactive Pγ derivatives were synthesized using 127I-ACTP. These derivatives were purified and estimated to be at least 90% pure by HPLC. Their masses were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) (Table I), and the functional activity was determined by inhibition of PDE6 cGMP hydrolysis. The 127I-ACTP derivatives of Pγ have a PDE6 inhibitory activity similar to that of the wild-type (wt) Pγ (Table I). Using the radiolabeled ACTP derivatives of single cysteine Pγ constructs, we were able to compare the interactions of various sites on Pγ with Pαβ on the same SDS-PAGE after photocrosslinking and DTT reversal (Fig. 2). The specificity of Pγ/Pαβ cross-linking was demonstrated by the fact that no 125I-label transfer occurred in the dark control and that very low background label transfer was observed in the photocrosslinking reaction with the holoenzyme of PDE6, which contained two endogenous Pγ molecules prebound (Fig. 2A). This observed basal label transfer was very likely caused by the exchange of 125I-ACTP-Pγ and the endogenous Pγ during the dark incubation prior to photolysis. Furthermore, the fact that photolysis did not cause label transfer to BSA, which was included in the photocrosslinking reactions as an internal control (Fig. 2B), also strongly demonstrates the specificity of radiolabel transfer to Pαβ from 125I-ACTP-Pγ after photocrosslinking and disulfide reversal. Taking into consideration the specific radioactivity of the Pγ photoprobes (Table I), the profiling of photolabel transfer from various positions on Pγ to Pαβ (Fig. 3A) indicates two major regions on Pγ that interacted with Pαβ, the central polycationic region and the C-terminal region. The validity of the label transfer approach in this study is further supported by the consistency of our data with the previous observations by others. It is well established that there are two major regions of Pγ that interact with Pαβ, the C-terminal region that approximately includes the Pγ residues from Cys68 to the very C-terminal residue Ile87, and the central polycationic region spanning the residues from Val21 to Lys45. It has been suggested that the polycationic region enhances overall Pγ affinity to Pαβ by binding to the GAF domain while the C terminus of Pγ binds to the catalytic site of Pαβ thus maintaining the enzyme in an inactivated state (18.Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Lipkin V.M. Bondarenko V.A. Zagranichny V.E. Dobrynina L.N. Muradov K.G. Natochin M.Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Through kinetic measurements of PDE6 activity using synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions in the Pγ molecule, Mou and Cote (9.Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) showed that the Pγ central region mainly accounted for the binding affinity with the Pαβ GAF domains. Our data obtained from full-length Pγ (Fig. 3) are consistent with the two-region interaction pattern and also revealed that the Pγ polycationic region provided a major contribution to the affinity of Pγ/Pαβ interaction. Moreover, a probable site on Pγ effecting the strongest interaction with Pαβ was further defined to the vicinity around position 40. Since the spacer arm from cysteine on Pγ to the photoreactive moiety (estimated to be 9∼12 Å) confers flexibility to some extent, the site on wild-type Pγ that interacts with Pαβ is likely close to but may not be precisely at the covalent derivatization position. The Pγ Polycationic Region Binds Pα and Pβ Subunits Asymmetrically—By performing radioactive photolabel transfer experiments with Pαβ and full-length Pγ photoprobes and subsequent truncation of Pβ, we were able to differentiate the binding property of each ACTP derivatization site on Pγ to each individual Pα and Pβ subunit. It is not readily possible to separate the two Pαβ subunits by SDS-PAGE since the Pα and Pβ molecular masses are similar. However, appropriate trypsinization cleaves Pβ GAFa domain between residues 146 and 147 while leaving the Pα GAF domains intact (8.Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In SDS-PAGE, the truncated Pβ is separated into bands of size ∼70 kDa and ∼17 kDa, whereas Pα migrates as a band of 90 kDa. The photolabel transfer from Pγ to Pα and Pβ can therefore be differentially detected by autoradiography (Fig. 4A). The appropriate Pβ truncation was confirmed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5, only a very small amount (<5%) of Pβ remained after trypsin truncation, as detected with antibody against the N terminus of Pβ. The truncated Pβ of ∼70 kDa (the lower Coomassie Blue band) was not detected by immunoblotting because the N terminus, which includes the antigenic sequence was removed.Fig. 5Immunodetection of Pβ truncation by trypsin.Upper panel, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Lower panel, Western blotting using anti-Pα (lanes a and b) or anti-Pβ (lanes c and d) as a primary antibody. Duplicate Pαβ samples were loaded without (lanes a and c) or with (lanes b and d) Pβ truncation by trypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We observed a significant labeling preference to Pβ from Pγ positions 40, 50, and 60, and a preference to Pα from positions 21 and 30, when the photocrosslinking reactions were performed with a Pγ/Pαβ ratio at ∼1 (only one Pγ per Pαβ dimer) (Fig. 4). These positions encompass the central polycationic region of Pγ. In contrast, Pα and Pβ were almost equally labeled from the positions in the C terminus. The Pαβ labeling from the N terminus also appeared equal, but considering the low level of label transfer, the significance of equal labeling from the N-terminal positions is not clear. No obvious labeling was found in the 17-kDa band, which is likely the truncated portion of Pβ (data not shown). These data also indicate that the observed labeling preference on Pα from Pγ positions 30 and 21 was not due to removal of a labeled N-terminal fragment of Pβ. This conclusion is further confirmed by the data in Fig. 6B that the labeling ratio of Pβ versus Pα from Pγ position 30 was close to 1 (∼0.93) at high Pγ/Pαβ ratio, indicating that there was no significant loss of photolabeling because of the N-terminal truncation of Pβ. Regarding positions 40, 50, and 60, if there were labeling on the Pβ N terminus that was removed by truncation, the preference of labeling on Pβ would have b"
https://openalex.org/W2077400632,"The present study describes the role of glycosphingolipids in neuroinflammatory disease and investigates tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced astrogliosis following spinal cord injury. Astrogliosis is the hallmark of neuroinflammation and is characterized by proliferation of astrocytes and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene expression. In primary astrocytes, TNFα stimulation increased the intracellular levels of lactosylceramide (LacCer) and induced GFAP expression and astrocyte proliferation. d-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol·HCl (PDMP), a glucosylceramide synthase and LacCer synthase (GalT-2) inhibitor, inhibited astrocyte proliferation and GFAP expression, which were reversed by exogenous supplementation of LacCer but not by other glycosphingolipids. TNFα caused a rapid increase in the activity of GalT-2 and synthesis of LacCer. Silencing of GalT-2 gene using antisense oligonucleotides also attenuated the proliferation of astrocytes and GFAP expression. The PDMP and antisense-mediated inhibition of proliferation and GFAP expression was well correlated with decreased Ras/ERK1/2 pathway activation. Furthermore, TNFα-mediated astrocyte proliferation and GFAP expression was also inhibited by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, which was reversed by exogenous LacCer. LY294002 also inhibited TNFα-induced GalT-2 activation and LacCer synthesis, suggesting a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated regulation of GalT-2. In vivo, PDMP treatment attenuated chronic ERK1/2 activation and spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced astrocyte proliferation with improved functional recovery post-SCI. Therefore, the in vivo studies support the conclusions drawn from cell culture studies and provide evidence for the role of LacCer in TNFα-induced astrogliosis in a rat model of SCI.

Although many reasons have been put forward to explain the obvious lack of CNS regeneration following injury/neurotrauma, the robust formation of the glial scar, as a result of astrogliosis, is also known to interfere with subsequent neural repair or axonal regeneration (2.Ridet J.L. Malhotra S.K. Privat A. Gage F.H. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 570-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 10.Steeves J.D. Tetzlaff W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 860: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, considerable effort is being directed toward understanding the mechanisms involved in astrocyte proliferation and reactivity in order to design therapeutic approaches to modulate gliosis, which is an impediment to neuronal recovery and axonal regeneration. Studies from our laboratory and others have shown the involvement of sphingolipids such as ceramide and psychosine in the potentiation of cytokine-mediated inflammatory disease (11.Giri S. Jatana M. Rattan R. Won J.S. Singh I. Singh A.K. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12.Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Biol.

In addition, we have recently reported the involvement of lactosylceramide in the regulation of inducible nitricoxide synthase gene expression and the efficacy of the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor (PDMP) in attenuating spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced inflammatory disease, demonstrating significantly improved functional outcome post-SCI (15.Pannu R. Won J.S. Khan M. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activation of sphingomyelinases and the resulting sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway has been closely linked with TNFα-induced apoptosis in numerous cell types. However, TNFα is also known to cause sphingosine 1-phosphate and lactosylceramide generation through activation of sphingosine kinase and lactosylceramide synthase (GalT-2), respectively, which have been implicated in inducing cell proliferation, which is antagonistic to the effects observed with ceramide (16.Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Porcelli A.M. Reames D.L. Johnson K.R. Morrow J. Chalfant C.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 17.Bhunia A.K. Han H.

Whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate is mitogenic for primary astrocytes (18.Pebay A. Toutant M. Premont J. Calvo C.F. Venance L. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Tence M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 2067-2076Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), LacCer has been linked with hyperproliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis (17.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to delineate the role of glycosphingolipids in TNFα-induced astrocyte proliferation and GFAP expression. LacCer generated through TNFα stimulation was found to be the effector molecule that regulated TNFα-induced proliferation of astrocytes and GFAP expression through the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway. LacCer generation in response to TNFα stimulation was found to be regulated in a PI3K-dependent manner, since 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002 or LY; a PI3K inhibitor) attenuated TNFα-induced GalT-2 activation and LacCer production. In vivo, PDMP-treatment was efficacious in attenuating pathological ERK1/2 activation, astrocyte proliferation, and GFAP overexpression in a rat model of SCI. These studies underline the efficacy of modulating the GSL pathway in suppressing gliosis in SCI, which finds relevance in other CNS disorders as well. Reagents—Recombinant rat TNFα was obtained from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Glucosylceramide (GluCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), galactosylceramide (GalCer), gangliosides, PDMP, and dl-erythro-PDMP (inactive enantiomer) were purchased from Matreya Inc. LY294002 and PD98059 were obtained from BIOMOL Research Laboratories. [14C]Galactose and [3H]UDP-galactose were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Cell Culture—Primary astrocyte-enriched cultures were prepared from the whole cortex of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described earlier (12.Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortex was rapidly dissected in ice-cold calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) at pH 7.4 as described previously (19.Won J.S. Choi M.R. Suh H.W. Brain Res. 2001; 903: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The tissue was then minced, incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing trypsin (2 mg/ml) for 20 min, and washed twice in plating medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin and then disrupted by triturating through a Pasteur pipette, following which cells were seeded in 75-cm2 culture flasks (Falcon, Franklin, NJ). After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 day, the medium was completely changed to the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin). The cultures received half exchanges with fresh medium twice a week. After 14–15 days, the cells were shaken for at least 24 h on an orbital shaker to remove the microglia and then seeded on multiwell tissue culture dishes. All the cultured cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At 80% confluence, the cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h prior to incubation with TNFα and other chemicals. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—Proliferation of primary astrocytes was assayed by using the cell proliferation ELISA, BrdUrd colorimetric assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in quadruplicate, and following overnight serum starvation they were stimulated with mitogenic stimulants. 2 h before termination of the proliferation assay, BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to each well, following which cells were fixed, and levels of incorporated BrdUrd were assayed using a conjugated anti-BrdUrd enzyme. Colorimetric analysis was done by measuring absorbance at 370 nm using a spectramax MAX 190 (Molecular Devices) multiwell plate reading spectrophotometer. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Trizma base and 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and lysed in 1× SDS sample loading buffer (62.5 mm Trizma base, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol), and following sonication and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was used for the immunoblot assay. The protein concentration of samples was determined with the detergent-compatible protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Sample was boiled for 3 min with 0.1 volumes of 10% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.5% bromphenol blue mix. 50 μg of total cellular protein was resolved by electrophoresis on 8 or 12% polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filter, and blocked with Tween 20-containing Tris-buffered saline (TBST; 10 mm Trizma base, pH 7.4, 1% Tween 20, and 150 mm NaCl) with 5% skim milk. After incubation with antiserum raised against rat GalT-2 (Abjent Inc.), phosphospecific ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Tech Inc.), or GFAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG for 1 h. The membranes were detected by autoradiography using ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences) after washing with TBST buffer. Quantification of Ras Activation—After stimulation, primary astrocytes in 6-well plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in membrane lysis buffer (0.5 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm of sodium orthovanadate, and EDTA-free Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation (5,000 × g) at 4 °C for 5 min, supernatant was used for the Ras activation assay. 100 μg of supernatant was used for binding with agarose-conjugated Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1, which was expressed in BL21 (Invitrogen), Escherichia coli strain, transformed by pGEX-2T-GST-RBD in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (20.Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The binding reaction was performed at 4 °C for 30 min in membrane lysis buffer. Following washing with membrane lysis buffer three times, Ras-RBD complexes were denatured by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Ras protein was identified by Western blot analysis with Ras antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograph was carried out to determine Ras activation and represented as arbitrary density units. Measurement of LacCer Synthesis—Cultured cells were incubated in growth medium containing [14C]galactose (5 μCi/ml) for 24 h as described previously. The medium was removed, and the cell monolayer was washed with sterile PBS. After stimulation with TNFα (1 ng/ml) for various periods of time, cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed by sonication. 200 μg of protein was used for extraction of lipids using chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:1). The organic phase was dried under nitrogen. Glycosphingolipids were resolved by high performance thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/0.25% KCl (70:30:4, v/v/v) as the developing solvent. The gel area corresponding to LacCer when compared with pure LacCer used as a standard (Matreya Inc.) was scraped, and radioactivity was measured employing Liquiscint (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as the scintillating fluid. GalT-2 Activity Assay—The activity of GalT-2 was measured using [3H]UDP-galactose as the galactose donor and GlcCer as the acceptor as described previously (15.Pannu R. Won J.S. Khan M. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5942-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, following stimulation, cells were harvested in PBS, and cell pellets were suspended in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Cell lysates were sonicated, and following protein quantification, 100 μg of cell lysate was added to reaction mixture containing 20 μm of cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8), 1 mm manganese/magnesium, 0.2 mg/ml Triton X-100 (1:2, v/v), 30 nmol of GluCer, and 0.1 mmol of UDP-[3H]galactose in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 0.25 m EDTA, 10 μl of 0.5 m KCl, and 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the products were separated by centrifugation. The lower phase was collected and dried under nitrogen. Following resolution on HPTLC plates, the gel was cut out, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Assay without exogenous GluCer served as blank, and their radioactivity counts were subtracted from all respective data points. Gal T-2 Antisense Oligonucleotide—A 20-mer antisense oligonucleotide of the following sequence (5′-CGC TTG AGC GCA GAC ATC TT-3′) targeted against rat GalT-2 was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology. A scrambled oligonucleotide (5′-CTG ATA TCG TCG ATA TCG AT-3′) was also synthesized and used as control. Cells were counted and plated a day before transfection, and the following day they were treated with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen)-oligonucleotide complexes (200 nm oligonucleotide) under serum-free conditions. 48 h following transfection, the protein levels of GalT-2 were analyzed using polyclonal antibodies raised against rat GalT-2 (Abjent Inc.). 48 h following transfection, the cells were stimulated with TNFα (1 ng/ml), and BrdUrd incorporation was assayed 18 h following stimulation. Plasmids, Transient Transfection, and FACS Analysis—Dominant negative Ras expression vector (pCMVrasN17) was purchased from BD Biosciences. pEGFP expression plasmid was purchased from Clontech. p110*Δkin, a kinase-deficient version of p110 (the catalytic subunit of PI3K) was obtained from Tanti et al. (21.Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Grillo S. Calleja V. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25227-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 3 × 105 cells/well were cultured in 6-well plates for 1 day before the transfection. Transfection was performed with plasmid concentration constant (2.5 μg/transfection) and 8 μl of Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h following transfection, the cells were placed in serum-free media overnight. Following stimulation for 18 h, the cells were trypsinized and pelleted, and the cell pellets were washed with cold PBS and finally resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. The cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h. Following fixation, cells were pelleted and the cell pellets were washed with PBS three times. The DNA was stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD). Cell cycle analysis was done. Events were acquired using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur equipped with a 488-nm argon laser and CellQuest software. pEGFP was acquired using a 515–545-nm bandpass filter (FL1), and 7-AAD was acquired using a 670-nm longpass filter (FL3). DNA histograms were generated using Modfit LT software. The collected data were gated for doublet discrimination and pEGFP-positive events. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Following total RNA extraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA. 5 μg of total RNA was treated with 2 units of DNase I (bovine pancreas; Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature in an 18-μl volume containing 1× PCR buffer and 2 mm MgCl2. It was then inactivated by incubation with 2 μl of 25 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 15 min. 2 μl of random primers were added and annealed to the RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized in a 50-μl reaction containing 5 μg of total RNA and 50–100 units of reverse transcriptase by incubating the tubes at 42 °C for 60 min. Real-time PCR—Total RNA isolation from rat spinal cord sections was performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real time PCR was conducted using Bio-Rad iCycler (iCycler iQ Multi-Color Real Time PCR Detection System; Bio-Rad). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA as described. The primer sets for use were designed (Oligoperfect™ designer, Invitrogen) and synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The primer sequences for GFAP (forward, 5′-cca agc cag acc tca cag c-3′; reverse, 5′-ccg ata cca ctc ttc tgt ttc ttg-3′), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-cct acc ccc aat gta tcc gtt gtg-3′; reverse-5′-gga gga atg gga gtt gct gtt gaa-3′). IQTM SYBR Green Supermix was purchased from Bio-Rad. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: activation of DNA polymerase at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 30 s and 58.3 °C for 30 s. The normalized expression of target gene with respect to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was computed for all samples using Microsoft Excel data spreadsheet. Induction of SCI in Rats—Sprague-Dawley female rats (225–250 g in weight) were purchased (Harlan Laboratories, Durham, NC) for induction of SCI. All rats were given water and food pellets ad libitum and maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). We have used a clinically relevant weight drop device for the induction of SCI in rats as described earlier (22.Gruner J.A. J. Neurotrauma. 1992; 9: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (80 mg/kg) plus xylazine (10 mg/kg) followed by laminectomy at T12. While the spine was immobilized with a stereotactic device, injury (30 g/cm force) was induced by dropping a weight of 5 g from a height of 6 cm onto an impounder gently placed on the spinal cord. Sham-operated animals underwent laminectomy only. However, no prophylactic antibiotics or analgesics were used in order to avoid their possible interactions with the experimental therapy of SCI. Treatment of SCI—Within 30 min after induction of SCI, rats received the glycosphingolipid inhibitor, PDMP (Matreya). PDMP was dissolved in 5% Tween 80 in saline and diluted with sterile saline (0.85% NaCl) at the time of intraperitoneal administration to SCI rats. Animals (six per group) were randomly selected to form four different groups: vehicle (VHC) (5% Tween 80 in saline)-treated sham (laminectomy only) and SCI and PDMP (20 mg/kg in 5% Tween 80)-treated sham and SCI. A single dose of PDMP was administered every 24 h after the first dose until 72 h after injury. Animals were sacrificed under anesthesia 1 h, 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 1 week following treatment. Preparation of Spinal Cord Sections—Rats were anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation. Spinal cord sections with the site of injury as the epicenter (lesion epicenter) were carefully extracted from VHC-treated sham and SCI as well as PDMP-treated sham and SCI animals. Tissue targeted to be used for RNA and protein extraction was immediately homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until further use. Total RNA was extracted per the manufacturer's protocol and used for cDNA synthesis as described earlier. Sections of spinal cord to be used for histological examination as well as immunohistochemistry were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, NJ). The tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 4-μm thickness. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Spinal cord sections were deparaffinized and sequentially rehydrated in graded alcohol. Slides were then boiled in antigen unmasking fluids (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 10 min, cooled in the same solution for another 20 min, and then washed three times for 5 min each in Tris-sodium buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TNT). Sections were treated with trypsin (0.1% for 10 min) and immersed for 10 min in 3% hydrogen peroxide to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were blocked in Tris sodium buffer with 0.5% blocking reagent (TNB) (supplied with the TSA-Direct kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min to reduce nonspecific staining. For immunofluorescent double labeling, sections were incubated overnight with anti-pERK1/2 antibody (1:100; mouse monoclonal; Cell Signaling) followed by antibodies against the astrocyte marker, GFAP (1:100; rabbit polyclonal; DAKO, Japan) for 1 h. Anti-GFAP was visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Sigma), and pERK was visualized using TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Sigma). The sections were mounted in mounting media (EMS, Fort Washington, PA) and visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Olympus) using Adobe Photoshop software. Rabbit polyclonal IgG was used as control primary antibody. Sections were also incubated with conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Sigma) or TRITC-conjugated IgG (1:100) without the primary antibody as negative control. Statistical Analysis—All values shown in the figures are expressed as the means ± S.E. of values obtained from at least three independent experiments. The results were examined by one- and two-way analysis of variance; then individual group means were compared with the Bonferroni test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. TNFα-induced Proliferation of Rat Primary Astrocytes Is Mediated by GSL—TNFα stimulation of primary astrocytes, resulting in proliferation of astrocytes and their reactive transformation characterized by increased GFAP expression, is a complex multistep process. In the present study, we tested whether GSLs were somehow involved in astrocyte proliferation. Increasing concentrations of TNFα (0, 0.1, 1, and 5 ng/ml) induced proliferation of astrocytes, which was assayed by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 1A). To address the involvement of GSL in TNFα-mediated proliferation, primary astrocytes were pretreated for 0.5 h with several concentrations of the glycosphingolipid inhibitor PDMP (0, 10, 20, 30, and 50 μm) or its corresponding inactive enatiomer, InPDMP (0, 10, 20, 30, and, 50 μm), followed by stimulation with TNFα (1 ng/ml) for 18 h. PDMP dose-dependently inhibited cellular proliferation assayed by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 1B), whereas InPDMP has no effect (Fig. 1C). TNFα (at a concentration of 1 ng/ml) and PDMP (25 μm) were used for subsequent studies. Furthermore, increasing doses of lactosylceramide (LacCer) induced proliferation of astrocytes; however, GluCer did not have a similar effect (Fig. 1D). Additionally, exogenously supplemented LacCer but not GluCer was able to bypass PDMP-mediated inhibition of TNFα-induced proliferation (Fig. 1E). A similar trend was observed with regard to GFAP gene expression. Pretreatment of astrocytes with PDMP inhibited TNFα-induced GFAP mRNA and protein expression, which was reversed by exogenously supplemented LacCer (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2, exogenous supplementation of other GSL metabolites such as GalCer (Fig. 2A) and gangliosides GM1 (Fig. 2B), GM3 (Fig. 2C), and GD3 (Fig. 2D) neither induced proliferation themselves nor reversed the PDMP-mediated inhibition of TNFα-induced proliferation, thus indicating this to be a LacCer-specific effect. Therefore, a me"

In this study, we have investigated how the binding of a panel of synthetic phenylglyoxal derivatives influences the opening and closing of the PTP. Using both isolated mitochondria and mammalian cells, we demonstrate that the resulting arginine-phenylglyoxal adduct can lead to either suppression or induction of permeability transition, depending on the net charge and hydrogen bonding capacity of the adduct. We report that phenylglyoxal derivatives that possess a net negative charge and/or are capable of forming hydrogen bonds induced permeability transition. Derivatives that were overall electroneutral and cannot form hydrogen bonds suppressed permeability transition. When mammalian cells were incubated with low concentrations of negatively charged phenylglyoxal derivatives, the addition of oligomycin caused a depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This depolarization was completely blocked by cyclosporin A, a PTP opening inhibitor, indicating that the depolarization was due to PTP opening. Collectively, these findings highlight that the target arginine(s) is functionally linked with the opening/closing mechanism of the PTP and that the electric charge and hydrogen bonding of the resulting arginine adduct influences the conformation of the PTP. These results are consistent with a model where the target arginine plays a role as a voltage sensor.

Permeability transition promotes cell death by inducing a cellular bioenergetic crisis and by causing the release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins that activate caspases and degrade DNA (9.Van Gurp M.

Opening of the PTP is inhibited by mitochondrial cyclophilin ligands, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and sanglifehrin A (SfA) (10.Clarke S.J. McStay G.P. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34793-34799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, the opening and closing of the PTP is modulated by adenine nucleotide carrier ligands (2.Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys.

Collectively, these findings have led to a model in which the PTP is formed by an interaction between the adenine nucleotide carrier (ANT), cyclophilin and the voltage-dependent anion channel (1.Kim J -S.

However, the recent finding that mitochondria from ANT knock-out mice, lacking both ANT isoforms, undergo CsA-sensitive permeability transition (15.Kokoszka J.E. Waymire K.G. Levy S.E. Sligh J.E. Cai J. Jones D.P. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) suggests that ANT is not an essential component of the PTP. Previously, we have studied PTP regulation using amino acid-specific covalent modification. Employing histidine- and cysteine-specific covalent reagents, we identified three separate sites through which matrix pH and the NADH/NAD+ ratio can influence the opening and closing of the PTP (16.Nicolli A.

Using phenylglyoxal (PGO), 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxal (OH-PGO), 2,3-butanedione, and methylglyoxal, which form stable adducts with guanidino groups, we have also detected reactive arginine residue(s) on the PTP (8.Scorrano L.

The arginine adducts formed by methylglyoxal, PGO, and 2,3-butanedione stabilize the closed conformation of the PTP, preventing triggering signals from inducing PTP opening, whereas the arginine adduct formed by OH-PGO results in PTP opening even in the absence of triggering signals (20.Linder M.D. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Kinnunen P.K.J. Bernardi P. Eriksson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This suggests that the glyoxal-reactive target arginine(s) is functionally coupled to the opening and closing mechanism of the pore (20.Linder M.D. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Kinnunen P.K.J. Bernardi P. Eriksson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, methylglyoxal is constantly formed during glucose metabolism (22.Thornalley P.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 99: 99-128Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of methylglyoxal is increased during hyperglycemia, and this leads to the formation of methylglyoxal-induced protein modifications, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which disrupt the function of target proteins (22.Thornalley P.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 99: 99-128Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). AGEs are involved in several pathological processes, including diabetes mellitus and cellular proliferative disorders (23.Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7060) Google Scholar). We have proposed that methylglyoxal-induced disruption of the PTP function contributes to the development of these pathological conditions (21.Speer O. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Liobikas J. Franck M.

Several experimental findings indicate that a decrease in the electric potential difference (ΔΨ) across the inner mitochondrial membrane leads to an increase in the probability of the PTP being open, suggesting that the PTP directly senses the ΔΨ. In isolated Ca2+-primed mitochondria, a partial depolarization of the ΔΨ is sufficient to open the PTP (24.Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Petronilli V. Cola C. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, in patch-clamping experiments of mitoplasts, the PTP is more likely to be open at low ΔΨ (26.Szabo I. Zoratti M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The mechanism for voltage sensing by voltage-dependent ion channels is based on the movement and reorientation of positively charged amino acids in the transmembrane electric field (27.Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Based on (i) the effect of arginine modification on PTP conformation and (ii) the exquisite sensitivity of PTP opening and closing to small structural differences between the arginine-reactive compounds, we have proposed that the arginine(s) is located on a putative voltage-sensing element of the PTP (19.Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20.Linder M.D. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Kinnunen P.K.J. Bernardi P. Eriksson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Covalent modification of the voltage-sensing arginines is expected to exert a large influence on sensor orientation and therefore on pore conformation. However, the resulting sensor orientation, opened or closed, is determined by an interplay between the steric and electronic properties of the resulting arginine adduct. In this study, we have used a set of synthetic phenylglyoxal derivatives to investigate how arginine modification alters PTP function in isolated mitochondria and mammalian cells. These phenylglyoxal derivatives differ only in the functional groups attached to the 2-, 3-, and/or 4-position of the phenyl ring. This allowed us to compare the specific physicochemical properties of the attached groups with their effects on PTP opening and closing. We found that arginine modification by these derivatives could lead either to induction or suppression of permeability transition. A physicochemical analysis revealed that negative charge and/or an ability to form hydrogen bonds was a common property of phenylglyoxal derivatives that induced permeability transition. Incubation of mammalian cells with negatively charged phenylglyoxal derivatives resulted in an increased probability of the PTP being open, and this correlated with a decrease in cell viability. These findings are consistent with a model where the target arginine(s) plays a role in the PTP voltage sensing and indicate that covalent arginine modification can affect the regulation of the PTP in intact cells. Chemicals and Reagents—The structural formulas of the phenylglyoxal derivatives used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. OH-PGO and MeO-PGO were synthesized from 4-hydroxyacetophenone and 4-methoxyacetophenone by oxidation with selenium dioxide (28.Fodor G. Kovacs O. J. Am. Chem.

No information is available about the reaction products formed between peptidylarginine and the following phenylglyoxal derivatives: Me-PGO, F-PGO, Cl-PGO, CamOH-PGO, 2,4-diF-PGO, Mor-PGO, and NO-PGO. Using a set of synthetic test peptides (NRVYIHPFHL, NRVYIHPF, RVYVHPF, and YGGFMRF), we investigated whether these phenylglyoxal derivatives can react covalently with the guanidine moiety of peptidylarginine. To induce the formation of the arginine adduct, 100 μm test peptide was allowed to react with 2 mm of phenylglyoxal derivative in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid and cooling to +4 °C. The reaction mixture was desalted using a Zip Tip C18 silica bead microcolumn (Millipore Corp.). Peptides were eluted with 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with an equal volume of saturated α-hydroxycyanocinnamic acid in 33% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the peptides were recorded on a Bruker Autoflex spectrometer using the reflective detector in positive mode. Calibration of the spectrometer was performed using the peaks of peptides with known masses. All of the tested phenylglyoxal compounds reacted with the peptide YGGFMRF, resulting in the formation of stable products (Fig. 2). The molecular masses of the products indicated that the phenylglyoxal derivatives were bound to the arginine residue through imidazole formation. These phenylglyoxal derivatives also reacted with the other three test peptides in a similar way. Physicochemical Properties of Phenylglyoxal Derivatives—Dipole moments were calculated from equilibrium geometry using standard semiempiric AM1 wave functions provided in GAMESS (31.Schmidt M.W. Baldridge K.K. Boatz J.A. Elbert S.T. Gordon M.S. Jensen J.H. Koseki S. Matsunaga N. Nguyen K.A. Su S.J. Windus T.L. Dupuis M. Montgomery J.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1993; 14: 1347-1363Crossref Scopus (19262) Google Scholar). Log P values were calculated for the nonionic species using KowWin version 1.67 (www.syrres.com/esc/est_kowdemo.htm). The surface activity profiles of the phenylglyoxal derivatives (the surface tension versus concentration isotherms) were measured in modification medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 μm EGTA, 1 μm rotenone, supplemented with 10% Me2SO, using a Delta-8 instrument (Kibron Inc.) as described (32.Suomalainen P. Johans C. Söderlund T. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The apparent air/water partition coefficient was determined from the isotherms as described (32.Suomalainen P. Johans C. Söderlund T. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The pKa of the OH group of OH-PGO and CamOH-PGO was 7.50 and 7.15, respectively, as determined by the absorbance spectra of the protonated (λmax at 282 and 278 nm) and deprotonated (λmax at 335 and 333 nm) molecules. Titration was performed with 1 m NaOH in assay medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm succinate, 5 mm Pi-Tris, 2 mm Mg2+, 5 μm EGTA, 1 μm rotenone, supplemented with 20 mm phosphorous acid. Isolation of Mitochondria—Liver mitochondria from male Wistar rats were prepared as described (18.Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The freshly isolated mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were preincubated in modification medium with or without the individual phenylglyoxal derivatives for 15 min at +25 °C. The modification reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 6.8 with Hepes buffer and cooling to +4 °C. Mitochondria were separated from the reaction mixture containing residual free reagent by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min. Mitochondria were resuspended at a concentration of 50 mg of protein/ml in assay medium. Sequential modification experiments were performed as described (20.Linder M.D. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Kinnunen P.K.J. Bernardi P. Eriksson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Assessment of Permeability Transition in Isolated Mitochondria— Permeability transition was induced either by a single addition of 60 μm Ca2+ or by repeated additions of 15 μm Ca2+ until fast Ca2+ release ensued. Permeability transition was assayed by measuring Ca2+ transport, mitochondrial swelling, and ΔΨ. Medium [Ca2+] was measured using the fluorescent indicator dye Fluo-4FF, which becomes fluorescent upon Ca2+ binding (excitation, 494 nm; emission, 516 nm). Mitochondrial swelling was measured as a decrease in turbidity at 540 nm. ΔΨ was indirectly measured by TMRM accumulation, which is sensitive to the transmembrane potential (excitation, 550 nm; emission, 575 nm). Measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer. PTP opening was quantified by the swelling rate and Ca2+ threshold, as described (21.Speer O. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Liobikas J. Franck M. Hensbo L. Linder M.D. Kinnunen P.K.J. Wallimann T. Eriksson O. J. Biol.

Cell Culture—MH1C1 rat hepatoma cells were grown in Ham's F-10 (Invitrogen) nutrient mixture supplemented with 40 mm NaHCO3, 10% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were kept at +37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To induce arginine modification, cells were incubated in a culture medium supplemented with the phenylglyoxal derivatives for 12 h. The remaining derivative was removed from the culture medium after the incubation, and cell viability was assessed using the resazurin assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 h, the ratio of reduced to oxidized resazurin was measured using a microplate reader (Spectracount; Packard) at the wavelength couple 620–540 nm. Microscopy—For light microscopy, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. The coverslips were mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope equipped with a mercury lamp (100 watts). ΔΨ was measured using the fluorescent indicator dye TMRM. The excitation filter wavelength was 546 ± 5 nm, the emission filter wavelength was 580 ± 15 nm, and the dichroic mirror cut-off wavelength was 560 nm. Images were acquired using a 12-bit CCD camera and analyzed using the MetaFluor imaging software (Micromax; Princeton Instruments). Before the measurement, cells were incubated for 30 min at +37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) supplemented with 20 nm TMRM and 1.6 μm cyclosporin H. Unlike CsA, cyclosporin H does not inhibit the PTP, whereas both compounds inhibit the multidrug resistance pump, and therefore cyclosporin H was used to optimize TMRM loading as detailed (34.Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial clusters were defined as regions of interest, and background fluorescence was measured from fields without cells. Sequential digital images were acquired every 0.5–2 min for 60 min, and the average fluorescence intensity of all of the selected regions of interest and of the background was recorded and stored for subsequent analysis. To investigate the structure-function relationship of arginine-glyoxal adducts upon PTP opening and closing, we used a set of phenylglyoxal derivatives that differ only in the functional groups attached to the phenyl ring (Fig. 1). All of these phenylglyoxal derivatives can react with peptidylarginine and form stable adducts as evidenced by the molecular mass of the resulting reaction products (Fig. 2). We then investigated the effects of the phenylglyoxal derivatives on the PTP in isolated rat liver mitochondria, and Fig. 3 shows our findings with Me-PGO. Mitochondria were incubated with or without 2 mm Me-PGO and subsequently resuspended in assay medium, and permeability transition was induced by a single addition of 60 μm Ca2+. Control mitochondria that had been incubated without Me-PGO took up Ca2+ from the medium (Fig. 3A, trace a). The addition of Ca2+ to the assay medium can be seen as an increase in the Fluo-4FF fluorescence at 2 min. As the control mitochondria took up the added Ca2+, the Fluo-4FF fluorescence decreased. However, these mitochondria subsequently released Ca2+ back into the medium and underwent large amplitude swelling as indicated by the large decrease in turbidity (Fig. 3, A and B, traces a). Concomitantly, the ΔΨ diminished (Fig. 3C, trace a), indicating that deenergization had occurred. Supplementing the assay medium of control mitochondria with 1 μm CsA (Fig. 3, all panels, traces b) or SfA (data not shown) completely inhibited Ca2+ release, swelling, and the ΔΨ decrease, indicating that these events were due to PTP opening. In contrast, mitochondria that had been incubated with Me-PGO were able to retain the added Ca2+ in the matrix throughout the experiment (Fig. 3A, trace c). Me-PGO-treated mitochondria remained energized, and swelling did not occur as indicated by the unchanged turbidity of the mitochondrial suspension (Fig. 3, all panels, traces c). These results show that brief Me-PGO treatment results in suppression of permeability transition. Since Me-PGO had no detrimental effect on the generation of ΔΨ or Ca2+ uptake, we conclude that Me-PGO acted directly on the PTP. The results of similar measurements on isolated mitochondria incubated with the other phenylglyoxal derivatives are summarized in Table I. For comparison, we included data on PGO and OH-PGO (19.Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20.Linder M.D. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Kinnunen P.K.J. Bernardi P. Eriksson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order to quantify the PTP opening/closing, we also determined the Ca2+ uptake threshold for PTP opening as described (33.Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.-P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To illustrate how Ca2+ uptake threshold measurements were performed, we show results for mitochondria incubated with either Me-PGO (Fig. 4A) or CamOH-PGO (Fig. 4B). After removal of excess phenylglyoxal derivative, mitochondria were suspended in the assay medium as described above, and pulses of 15 μm Ca2+ were added until Ca2+ release ensued. The results showed that mitochondria incubated without phenylglyoxal derivative (Fig. 4, A and B, traces a) were able to take up about 55 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein from the medium before Ca2+ release occurred, whereas treatment with Me-PGO (Fig. 4A, trace b) increased the Ca2+ uptake threshold to 190 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein. Supplementing the medium of control mitochondria with 1 μm CsA or SfA increased the Ca2+ uptake threshold to over 200 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein (data not shown). Therefore, Me-PGO treatment of mitochondria resulted in a 4-fold increase in the Ca2+ threshold, showing that Me-PGO was almost as effective as the cyclophilin ligands for closing the PTP. In contrast, incubation with CamOH-PGO resulted in a dramatic decrease in the Ca2+ threshold. In this case, one single pulse of 15 μm Ca2+ was sufficient to trigger Ca2+ release, compared with the four pulses for mitochondria incubated without phenylglyoxal derivative (Fig. 4B, traces a and b). The Ca2+ release from mitochondria incubated with CamOH-PGO remained fully sensitive to both 1 μm CsA and SfA (Fig. 4B, traces c and d). This result demonstrates that CamOH-PGO acts selectively on the PTP and increases the likelihood of PTP opening in response to Ca2+. During incubation of isolated mitochondria with the phenylglyoxal derivatives CamOH-PGO, OH-PGO, and NO-PGO, energization by succinate was required to prevent spontaneous permeability transition (data not shown). Comparing the results of the phenylglyoxal derivatives, it is evident that rapid mitochondrial swelling correlated with a low Ca2+ uptake threshold, and vice versa. None of the phenylglyoxal derivatives had any major effects on the generation of ΔΨ or Ca2+ uptake at concentrations that effectively modify the PTP (data not shown).Table IEffect of phenylglyoxal derivatives on the PTP and their physicochemical propertiesCompoundSwelling rateaSince the sensitivity of the PTP to Ca2+ can vary between different mitochondrial preparations, the swelling rate and Ca2+ threshold are expressed in relative values as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Ca2+ thresholdaSince the sensitivity of the PTP to Ca2+ can vary between different mitochondrial preparations, the swelling rate and Ca2+ threshold are expressed in relative values as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Dipole moments (D)Log PApparent log Kaw/MHydrogen bond donorHydrogen bond acceptorxyzTotal%%PGO12487-2.10.0-4.24.71.03.0NoNoMe-PGO143502.10.04.75.21.52.7NoNoMeO-PGO361830.80.02.42.51.02.2NoWeakF-PGO12550-2.00.0-2.73.31.2NDbNot determined.NoNo2,4-diF-PGO322503.10.0-3.24.41.42.7NoNoCl-PGO25237-2.00.0-2.93.51.62.4NoNoNO-PGO300151.60.01.22.00.82.2NoYesOH-PGO430cDetermined for the prevailing equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated form at pH 7.4.18cDetermined for the prevailing equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated form at pH 7.4.-0.90.04.24.30.51.6YesYes(O−)-PGO430cDetermined for the prevailing equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated form at pH 7.4.18cDetermined for the prevailing equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated form at pH 7.4.-2.60.0-2.23.4NDdLog P not defined for ions.YesYesCamOH-PGO550cDetermined for the prevailing equilibrium between the protonat"

In particular, STAT2 is a critical component of IFN signaling (7.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell.

ISGF3-independent STAT2-containing complexes translocate into the nucleus and bind γ-activated sequence (GAS)-like palindromic IFN-response element (pIRE) (10.Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S.

Alternatively, STAT2:1 heterodimers may associate with the DNA-binding adaptor protein, IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), to form the ISGF3 complex that binds the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) (1.Stark G.R.

Together, ISGF3 and ISGF3-independent STAT2-containing complexes mediate transcriptional activation of IFN-sensitive genes (ISGs), including double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (OAS), and IRF-1, involved in mediating the biologic effects of IFNs (10.Li X.

The carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of STAT2 also contributes to the transcriptional activation potential of ISGF3-independent complexes (10.Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E.

However, the role of STAT2 in ISGF3-independent STAT2:1 heterodimers is not fully defined and the contribution of each STAT protein to DNA binding remains unknown. In earlier studies we described the preferential binding of STAT2:1 heterodimers to a palindromic GAS-like sequence, suggesting that within this complex, STAT2 contributes to sequence-specific DNA binding activity (12.Ghislain J.J. Wong T. Nguyen M. Fish E.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, several residues in STATs that contribute to DNA binding, namely residues corresponding to arginine 378 (Arg378), valine-threonine (Val426-Thr427), histidine 431 (His431) and asparagine 460 (Asn460) in STAT1, glutamates 434 and 435 (Glu434-Glu435) and valines 461 and 462 (Val461-Val462) in STAT3 and valines 466 and 467 (Val466-Val467) in STAT5, are conserved in STAT2 (20.Horvath C.M.

Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that, in ISGF3-independent STAT2-containing complexes, STAT2 may contribute to DNA binding by virtue of its putative DNA-binding domain. In the present study we provide evidence that IFN-inducible ISGF3-independent STAT2-containing complexes contribute to IFN-inducible biologic responses in target cells. Specifically, we show that in cells where IFN-inducible ISGF3 activation is intact, it is possible to disrupt IFN-inducible transcriptional activation and ISG expression mediated by GAS-like gene elements, effected by STAT2:1-DNA interactions, resulting in blunted antiviral and antiproliferative responses. Using a panel of STAT2 mutants, we provide evidence that specific residues in the putative DNA-binding domain of STAT2 influence STAT2:1-DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation of ISGs.

For supershift experiments, 2 μg of antibody was incubated with extracts for 30 min at 4 °C prior to addition of DNA. Oligonucleotides—Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the ISRE of the human 2′,5′-OAS promoter and the GAS-like STAT2: 1-specific palindromic element (pIRE) were designed (12.Ghislain J.J.

For use in EMSAs these complementary oligonucleotides were Klenow (Amersham Biosciences) labeled with [α-32P]dATP (ICN). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells were untreated or treated with 5 ng/ml IFN alfacon-1 for 30 min. ChIP assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate). 1 μl of input material (collected prior to addition of antibody) and 5 μl of output material (purified product of ChIP) was analyzed by PCR using primers to the 6–16 promoter (ISRE (33.Huang M. Qian F. Hu Y. Ang C. Li Z. Wen Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), to the IRF-1 promoter (GAS-like pIRE) and to the β-actin gene (control). The following primers were used: 6–16 (5′-GGTGAAAGGCCTGTGTGCC and 5′-CAGCGAGTAAACGGTTCTCCG), IRF-1 (5′-GGACAAGGCGGAGTGAGAGGACA and 5′-TTGCCTCGACTAAGGAGTGGC), β-actin (5′-CGTGGCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGT and 5′-ACTGGCATCGTGATGGACTCCGGT). Genomic DNA harvested from 2fTGH cells and water was used as positive and negative PCR controls, respectively. PCR products were resolved in a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized using a Gel Doc apparatus (Bio-Rad). RNA Preparation, Complementary DNA Synthesis, and Real-time PCR—To harvest RNA, cells were either left untreated or treated with 5 ng/ml IFN alfacon-1 for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed and homogenized using Qiagen QIA-shredder columns and RNA isolation was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA in the presence of random primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 42 °C (Promega). Reaction components for real-time PCR were obtained from the LightCycler® FastStart Plus DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche) and the LightCylcer® instrument (Roche) and Relative Quantification Software were used for all reactions. The PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 0.5 μm of each primer and 5 μl of template cDNA (concentration 100 ng/μl). The following primer sets were employed: 6–16 (5′-TAAGAAAAAGTGCTCGGAGAGCTC and 5′-CCGACGGCCATGAAGGT), ISG15 (5′-TCCTGGTGAGGAATAACAAGGG and 5′-CTCAGCCAGAACAGGTCGTC), IRF-1 (5′-CTTCCACCTCTCACCAAGAAC and 5′-CCATCAGAGAAGGTATCAGGGC), and β-actin (5′-CGTGGCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGT and 5′-ACTGGCATCGTGATGGACTCCGGT). Standard curves were established for each primer set and both reference (β-actin) and target reactions were performed for each sample. Mutational Analysis of Conserved DNA-binding Domain of STAT2—The DNA binding activity of STAT1 has been characterized and mutagenesis studies have identified residues in STAT1 that are critical for DNA binding activity (22.Yang E. Henriksen M.A. Schaefer O. Zakharova N. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13455-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23.Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the crystal structure of STAT1 bound to DNA, using molecular modeling and visualization software (SYBYL, version 6.9, Tripos Inc.). Using SYBYL we imported the STAT1 RCSB Protein Data Bank coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1BF5) and rendered the protein to highlight the DNA-binding domain and examine key residues involved in mediating DNA binding. This approach allowed us to identify several residues that appear crucial for mediating DNA binding and for maintaining the structure of the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1). Specifically, Glu429 lies in the long loop between β8 and β9, that interacts with the minor groove and makes phosphate contacts with the major groove of the DNA molecule. This residue forms a hydrogen bond with His431, an interaction that contributes to the stability of this region. Similarly, Glu428 stabilizes this area by forming a hydrogen bond back onto itself. Another key segment is the region between β-sheet 11 and α-helix 6 wherein Asn460 is located. Asn460 directly forms a hydrogen bond to DNA and mediates specific recognition of the DNA sequence. Residues Val455-Val456 are also important for DNA binding as they lie within β-sheet 11 and provide stability for the loop containing Asn460. Each of these residues is conserved in STAT2 and occupies positions Glu426-Glu427, Val453-Val454, and Asn458. Based on crystal structure analysis, we infer that substitution of Glu426-Glu427 to alanines (AA) may disrupt DNA binding by reducing the rigidity and support of DNA-contacting loops. This mutation may abolish hydrogen bonds stabilizing the loop between β8 and β9. Additionally, mutation of one or both Val453-Val454 to isoleucines (II) may alter the structure of β-sheet 11, destabilizing the loop between β-sheet 11 and α-helix 6 and perhaps preventing Asn458 from making direct contact with the DNA molecule. A single Val454 to Ala mutation targets the second, more critical residue of this VV motif. Also, mutation of Asn458 to Ala may have a detrimental effect on DNA binding by impairing specific STAT-DNA interactions. Therefore, to assess the function of the conserved putative DNA-binding domain of STAT2, the following mutations were introduced into the STAT2 protein: E426A,E427A (EE-AA), V453I, V454I, V454A, V453I,V454I (VV-II), and N458A (Table I). cDNAs encoding the STAT2 mutants were introduced by stable transfection into U6A cells lacking STAT2 to generate a panel of cell lines expressing these mutant STAT2 proteins. A cDNA construct encoding intact STAT2 was also stably introduced into U6A cells, generating the U6A-2 cell line.Table ISTAT2 mutantsConsensus sequenceResidue changeMutation designationCell line designationVTEELEE → AAE426A,E427AU6A-2EE-AA(EE-AA)VVIIVV → IIV4531,V454IU6A-2VV-II(VV-II)VVIIVal → IleV453IU6A-2V453IVVIIVal → IleV454IU6A-2V454IVVIIVal → AlaV454AU6A-2V454ANAsn → AlaN458AU6A-2N458A Open table in a new tab IFN Alfacon-1 Treatment of U6A-2 Cells Induces GAS-driven Luciferase Activity—In earlier studies, we reported that treatment of cells with 5 ng/ml IFN alfacon-1 resulted in ISGF3-independent STAT2-containing complexes (9.Ghislain J.J. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12.Ghislain J.J. Wong T. Nguyen M. Fish E.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To establish a dosage appropriate for further studies, we treated U6A cells reconstituted with intact STAT2 (U6A-2) with varying doses of IFN alfacon-1 (data not shown). The data show that 0.5 ng/ml is sufficient for maximal levels of IFN-inducible STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Dose-response studies for IFN-inducible GAS-mediated transcriptional activation were performed and the results indicate a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity. Indeed, a dose of 5 ng/ml IFN alfacon-1 is required to achieve optimal GAS-driven transcriptional activity in U6A-2 cells (data not shown). Accordingly, to assess the relevance of IFN-inducible, GAS-binding ISGF3-independent STAT2-containing complexes, a dose of 5 ng/ml IFN was routinely used in all subsequent experiments. Mutations in the STAT2 DNA-binding Domain Do Not Disrupt IFN-inducible STAT Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Following introduction of the STAT2 cDNA constructs into U6A cells, Western blot analysis was performed to determine cellular levels of STAT proteins. All transfectants express comparable levels of both STAT1 and STAT2, with the exception of cells expressing the N458A form of STAT2, in which STAT2 levels are lower (Fig. 2). To confirm that the mutations introduced into STAT2 have not affected the ability of STAT2 to be inducibly phosphorylated upon IFN stimulation, lysates of either untreated or IFN-treated transfectants were prepared. Lysates from IFN-treated cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of STAT2. The data reveal that mutations in the putative DNA-binding domain of STAT2 do not interfere with IFN-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 (Fig. 2A). The extent of IFN-inducible STAT1 phosphorylation was also examined in the different transfectants. Studies have demonstrated that STAT2 is required for IFN-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting there is a sequential activation of STAT proteins at the IFN receptor (7.Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, STAT1 activation by IFN has been detected in STAT2-deficient cells (35.Mowen K. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, Western immunoblot analysis was performed to determine whether the mutations in the DNA-binding domain of STAT2 affected the ability of STAT1 to be tyrosine phosphorylated upon IFN stimulation (Fig. 2B). IFN-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in all transfectants, albeit more weakly in cells expressing the N458A STAT2 mutant. Interestingly, in U6A cells lacking STAT2, the extent of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was similar to that observed in other cell types. Cells Expressing the VV-II STAT2 Mutant Exhibit Diminished IFN-inducible Responses—To determine whether mutations in the putative DNA-binding domain of STAT2 have affected the biological outcome of IFN-inducible signaling, we examined IFN-inducible antiviral activity against EMCV in the different transfectants. U6A cells lacking STAT2 are completely unresponsive to the antiviral effects of IFN (Fig. 3A). By contrast, cells expressing intact STAT2 respond to IFN with the appropriate antiviral response. U6A-2EE-AA, U6A-2V453I, U6A-2V454I, U6A-2V454A, and U6A-2N458A cells are also able to mount a full antiviral response upon IFN stimulation (Fig. 3A). However, cells expressing the VV-II STAT2 mutant fail to mount a robust IFN-inducible antiviral response (Fig. 3A). Transfectants were also examined for IFN-inducible growth inhibitory responses using the cell proliferation assay. STAT2-deficient U6A cells do not exhibit a growth inhibitory response to IFN (Fig. 3B). In contrast, IFN treatment of U6A-2 cells expressing intact STAT2 results in growth inhibition (Fig. 3B). Cells expressing the EE-AA, V453I, V454I, V454A, and N458A mutant forms of STAT2, likewise exhibit normal levels of IFN-inducible growth inhibition (Fig. 3B). Similar to our results in the antiviral assays, cells expressing the VV-II STAT2 mutant are impaired in their ability to respond to the growth inhibitory effects of IFN (Fig. 3B). Together, these data suggest that the VV-II mutation disrupts STAT2-mediated signal transduction such that IFN-inducible antiviral and growth inhibitory responses are diminished. Cells Expressing the VV-II Mutant Form of STAT2 Exhibit Diminished IFN-inducible GAS-dependent Luciferase Activity— To examine IFN-inducible transcriptional activation in cells expressing the mutant STAT2 proteins, ISRE- and GAS-luciferase gene reporter assays were conducted. ISRE-luciferase or 8×GAS-luciferase constructs were introduced into the different cell types by transfection. Following a 6-h 5 ng/ml IFN alfacon-1 treatment, luciferase activity was measured. In U6A cells, IFN-stimulated STAT2-dependent luciferase activity mediated by ISRE or GAS elements was absent (Figs. 3, C and D). In cells expressing either the intact or any of the mutant forms of S"
https://openalex.org/W2005391460,"During the course of an inflammatory response, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) triggers endothelial cells to increase the expression levels of adhesion molecules that are pivotal for the rolling, adhesion, and transmigration of leukocytes over the endothelial cell wall. Here we show that TNFα, in addition, has a regulatory function in the biosynthesis of proper carbohydrate molecules on endothelial cells that constitute ligands for adhesion molecules on leukocytes. Our data show that TNFα induced an increase in the expression of β1,4-galactosyltransferase-1 (β4GalT-1) in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The β4GalT-1 mRNA up-regulation correlated with an increase in the Golgi expression and catalytic activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, an enhanced incorporation of galactose was observed in newly synthesized glycoproteins. Analysis of the molecular mechanism behind the up-regulation of β4GalT-1 showed that the increase in mRNA levels is due to an enhanced stability of the transcripts. These data strongly demonstrate that TNFα modulates the glycosylation of endothelial cells by a mechanism that directly enhances the stability of β4GalT-1 mRNA transcripts."

One form, containing the three domains, is secreted from the bacterial cytoplasm to the outer membrane, whereas the second form, which is cytoplasmic, only contains the central and the C-terminal domains. The secreted form was shown to be involved in survival under oxidative conditions. Although previous studies indicated that the central and the C-terminal domains display methionine sulfoxide reductase A and B activities, respectively, no function was described so far for the N-terminal domain. In the present study, the N-terminal domain of the PilB of Neisseria meningitidis was produced as a folded entity, and its biochemical and enzymatic properties have been determined. The data show that the N-terminal domain possesses a disulfide redox-active site with a redox potential in the range of that of thioredoxin. Moreover, the N-terminal domain, either as an isolated form or included in PilB, recycles the oxidized forms of the methionine sulfoxide reductases like thioredoxin.

The obligate human pathogens, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are the only two pathogenic members of the Neisseria family of Gram-negative bacteria. N. gonorrhoeae, which colonizes mucosal epithelia of the genitourinary tract, is the causative agent of the disease gonorrhea, whereas N. meningitidis, which colonizes the nasopharynx, is the cause of two serious human diseases, pyogenic meningitis and meningococcal septicemia. Like many bacterial pathogens, the ability of these Neisseriae to infect their host is conditioned by successive steps of interactions with host cells and by the survival of the bacteria in the host environment (for review see Refs. 1.Dehio C.

Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19.Stadtman E.R. Moskovitz J. Levine R.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In contrast, no role has been assigned so far to the N-terminal domain of PilB. Recently, two forms of PilB from N. gonorrhoeae have been characterized (3.Skaar E.P. Tobiason D.M. Quick J. Judd R.C. Weissbach H. Etienne F. Brot N. Seifert H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10108-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One is secreted from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane as an entire polypeptide composed of the three domains. The second one is a truncated cytoplasmic form corresponding to amino acids 196–521 and therefore lacks the N-terminal domain. This form is produced from an internal AUG initiation codon corresponding to Met-195 (Ref. 3.Skaar E.P. Tobiason D.M. Quick J. Judd R.C. Weissbach H. Etienne F. Brot N. Seifert H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10108-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, see also “Results”). The fact that the extracytoplasmic localization of PilB was shown to be required for survival in the presence of oxidative damage raises the question of the function of the N-terminal domain in the periplasm and of its relationship with the MsrA and MsrB activities. Comparison of the primary structure of the N-terminal domain with those of the known proteins in the public data bases shows no significant identity with any protein excepted one from Fusobacterium nucleatum (see Fig. 1). The only peculiar feature is the presence of a CXXC signature. In an attempt to identify the role of the N-terminal domain of PilB, a soluble form of the N. meningitidis domain of 143 amino acids, which only differs from its N. gonorrhoeae counterpart by four amino acids (see Fig. 1), has been overproduced and purified. Its biochemical and enzymatic properties have been determined. The results demonstrate that the N-terminal domain displays a disulfide reductase activity that is able to recycle Msr activities. In particular, the N. meningitidis MsrB activity is shown to be recycled with a catalytic efficiency similar to that observed with Trx1 from Escherichia coli (8.Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M.

Plasmid Constructions, Site-directed Mutageneses, Productions, and Purifications of the N-terminal Domain and of the Entire Form of PilB from N. meningitidis—Plasmid pETPilB was obtained by cloning the internal fragment of the pilB open reading frame synthesized by PCR (sequences of oligonucleotides not shown) using N. meningitidis Z2491 genomic DNA, kindly provided by Dr. M. K. Taha, between the NdeI and the SacI sites of the pET24c plasmid. To produce the N-terminal domain truncated after position 32, a deletion was done by NdeI digestion of the plasmid in which a second NdeI site has been introduced between the 100th and the 105th bp. Truncation at the C terminus after position 175 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the Gly-176 codon into a stop codon TTA. The resulting plasmid was named pETNterPilB. To produce a soluble form of PilB, a similar plasmid was used except that instead of introducing a stop codon at codon 176, the Met-195 codon was changed into an Ala. The resulting plasmid was named pET195PilB. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The E. coli strain used for N-terminal domain and entire PilB productions was BL21 (DE3) pLysS transformed with the pETNterPilB and pET195PilB plasmids, respectively. The overexpression of the N-terminal domain and of entire PilB was performed by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the culture medium at 0.6 A600. After 3 h of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in minimal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and sonicated. For the N-terminal domain and entire PilB, the supernatant was then precipitated at 70% ammonium sulfate saturation. The contaminating proteins were removed by exclusion size chromatography on ACA 54 gel (IBF) in buffer A. Purified fractions were then pooled and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A, followed by a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (0–1.0 m) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The two proteins were pure as checked by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The protein mass determined by electrospray mass spectrometry corresponded to that expected with no Met at the N terminus. The molecular concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 33,690 m–1·cm–1 for the N-terminal domain and 77,130 m–1·cm–1 for the entire PilB as deduced from the method of Scopes (20.Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Trx1 from E. coli and MsrA and MsrB domains from N. meningitidis were prepared following experimental procedures already published (8.Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cysteine contents of the N-terminal domain and of E. coli Trx1 were determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) under non-denaturing conditions in buffer A as described previously (14.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Oxidized Forms of the N-terminal Domain and of E. coli Trx1—The oxidation of the N-terminal domain and Trx1 was achieved by incubating a reduced N-terminal domain (300 μm) or reduced Trx1 (500 μm) with DTNB (1 mm) in degassed and He2-purged solution of buffer B (100 mm phosphate, pH 7) at room temperature for 10 min. Both oxidized forms were then isolated by gel filtration on Econo-Pac 10 DG Column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) equilibrated with buffer B. The oxidation states of the N-terminal domain and of Trx1 were checked by titration with DTNB. Fluorescence Properties of the N-terminal Domain under Oxidized and Reduced Forms—The fluorescence spectra of the reduced and oxidized N-terminal domains (10 μm) in buffer A were recorded on a spectrofluorometer (flx SAFAS) thermostated at 25 °C. Excitation spectra were recorded at maximum emission (347 nm), and emission spectra were recorded at maximum excitation (295 nm). Determination of the Rate of Reduction of Oxidized N-terminal Domain by DTT—The rate was determined by recording the change in fluorescence intensity at 347 nm at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The change in fluorescence intensity was recorded for 3 min after the addition of DTT at various concentrations (5–40 μm) to oxidized N-terminal domain (2 μm) in degassed buffer B. The apparent second-order rate constant was calculated from the measured pseudo-first-order rate constants by dividing kobs value by the concentration of DTT. Determination of the Redox Potential of the N-terminal Domain, the GSH/GSSG System—The change in fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength 295 nm) was measured at the wavelength of maximum emission (347 nm). Experiments were carried out in degassed and He2-purged buffer B, with 2 mm EDTA. Oxidized N-terminal domain (1 μm) was incubated at 30 °C in the presence of GSSG (0.1 mm) and varying concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) (0–180 mm) for 20 h before recording the fluorescence emission spectra. The equilibrium concentrations of GSH and GSSG were calculated according to Equations 1, 2, 3, [GSH]=[GSH] 0−2R[N−terminal domain] 0 (Eq. 1) [GSSG]=[GSSG] 0+R[N−terminal domain] 0 (Eq. 2) R=(F−Fox)/(Fred−Fox) (Eq. 3) where [GSH]0 and [GSSG]0 represent the initial concentrations of GSH and GSSG, respectively, R is the relative amount of reduced protein at equilibrium, [N-terminal domain]0 is the initial concentration of the N-terminal domain under the oxidized state, F is the fluorescence intensity, and Fox and Fred are the fluorescence intensities of the completely oxidized and reduced protein. The equilibrium constant Keq was estimated according to Equation 4, R=([GSH] 2/[GSSG])/(Keq+[GSH] 2/[GSSG]) (Eq. 4) from a non-linear regression analysis of the data. From the equilibrium constant and using the glutathione standard potential (E′0 GSH/GSSG = –0.240 V) (22.Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), the standard redox potential (E′0) was calculated with the Nernst equation (Equation 5), E0 ‘=E0GSH/GSSG ‘−(RT/nF)ln Keq (Eq. 5) in which F represents Faraday's constant (23,040.612 cal·mol–1·V–1), n is the number of electrons transferred (here n = 2), and RT is the product of the gas constant (1.987 cal·K–1·mol–1) and the absolute temperature. Redox Equilibrium between the N-terminal Domain and Trx1—Equilibrium reactions (250 μl) typically contained 15 μm each redox-active protein in degassed and He2-purged solution of buffer B with 2 mm EDTA. The reduced form of each protein (1 mm) was prepared immediately before use by the incubation of protein for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 50 mm DTT, followed by desalting on an Econo-Pac 10 DG column. Redox reactions between both proteins were initiated by mixing one protein in the reduced state and the other in the oxidized state. After 15 h of equilibration at 25 °C, each sample was quenched by the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid final. The oxidized and reduced forms of the proteins present in the samples were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C8 column (4.6 mm × 100 mm) using a gradient from 30 to 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 25 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at room temperature. Column effluent was monitored at 215 and 280 nm. The amounts of oxidized and reduced forms of each protein in the quenched equilibrium mixture were obtained from peak areas after integration of the chromatograms. Essentially identical results were obtained from analysis of chromatograms recorded at 215 and 280 nm, and the former was used in a subsequent analysis. The mechanism of thiol-disulfide exchange is described as a two-step reaction proceeding through a mixed disulfide intermediate (Equation 6). It is assumed that the mixed disulfide intermediate is not populated under standard conditions. The apparent concentration equilibrium constant, Keq, was calculated according to Equation 7, TrxSHSH+NterSS⇌TrxS−SSH HSNter⇌TrxSS+NterSHSH (Eq. 6) Keq=([TrxSS][NterSHSH])/([TrxSHSH][NterSS]) (Eq. 7) E0 ‘=E0Trx1 ‘−(RT/nF)ln Keq (Eq. 8) and the redox potential of the N-terminal domain (E′0) was then calculated using the Nernst equation (Equation 8), using the Trx1 standard potential E′0 Trx1 of –0.270 V at pH 7 and 25 °C (23.Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (here n = 2), F is Faraday's constant (23,040.612 cal·mol–1·V–1), and R is the gas constant (1.987 cal·K–1·mol–1). Stoichiometry of Met Formation—In the case of MsrA/B domains alone, the reaction mixture containing dl-Met-(R,S)-SO (100 mm) and MsrA/B (at two concentrations of 50 and 100 μm), in the absence or presence of stoichiometric concentration of N-terminal domain (i.e. 50 and 100 μm), was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min in buffer A. In the case of entire PilB, the reaction mixture containing l-Met-(R)-SO or l-Met-(S)-SO (200 μm) and PilB (at two concentrations of 50 and 100 μm), was incubated at 25 °C for 120 min in buffer A. Then, 250 μl of each reaction mixture was injected onto a Sephasil C18 column for Met quantification as already described (14.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Determination of the Kinetic Parameters—Msrs activities were determined with Ac-l-Met-(R,S)-SO-NHMe, which is a better substrate than Met-(R,S)-SO (8.Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), at a saturating concentration of 200 mm. The reaction mixture also contained MsrA (2 μm) or MsrB (1 μm), and N-terminal domains at various concentrations (10–800 μm). Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C by following the appearance of Ac-l-Met-NHMe. To do so, aliquots of 250 μl of the reaction mixture were removed at different times of incubation up to 2 min for MsrB and 3 h for MsrA, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). In each aliquot, Ac-l-Met-NHMe quantification was carried out by reverse phase chromatography as described previously (17.Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The concentration of Ac-l-Met-NHMe formed was plotted against the time, and the data were fit to a linear model to attain initial rates. The initial rate data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten relationship using least squares analysis to determine kcat and Km. Determination of pKa of Cysteine Residues with 2,2′-Dipyridyl Disulfide (2PDS)—Fast kinetic measurements were carried out on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics). Kinetic reactions were performed at 25 °C, under pseudo-first-order conditions at a constant ionic strength of 0.15 m over the pH range 6–10.5 (Tris 120 mm, imidazole 30 mm, acetic acid 30 mm). One syringe was filled with wild type or Cys to Ser mutated N-terminal domain, and the other was filled with 2PDS. The reaction was monitored at 343 nm with 6.2 μm N-terminal domain and 310 μm 2PDS. The release of pyridine-2-thione was quantified using extinction coefficient of 8080 m–1·cm–1 at 343 nm. The pseudo-first-order rate constants kobs were determined at each pH by fitting the absorbance A at 343 nm versus time t to Equation 9, A=a1(1−e−kobst)+c (Eq. 9) where a1 is the burst magnitude, and c represents the value of the ordinate intercept. The second-order kinetic constants k2 were calculated by dividing the kobs value by the concentration of 2PDS and then fitting to Equation 10, k2=kmin+k '(110(pKapp−pH)+1) (Eq. 10) in which kmin represents the second-order kinetic constant at pH 6, and k′ represents the second-rate constant for the thiolate form. In the case of C67S protein, kmin = 0. Production and Purification of the N-terminal Domain and of the Entire Form of PilB—The fact that PilB was shown to be secreted from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane of N. gonorrhoeae supported the presence of at least an N-terminal signal peptide. Therefore, the strategy to produce a soluble form of the N-terminal domain and of entire PilB should take in account this putative peptide. As indicated in Fig. 1, the N-terminal 31 amino acids are predicted to constitute a signal peptide using the SignalP software. Using the Network Protein Sequence Analysis web interface, an α helix between amino acids 4 and 22 is also predicted. Production of the N-terminal domain also required us to define where the truncation should be introduced between the C terminus of the N-terminal domain and the N terminus of the MsrA domain. For that purpose, the position of the truncation was based on the fact that 1) the MsrA domain was previously produced in a soluble form from a DNA construct in which a stop codon was introduced at a position corresponding to amino acid 195 (8.Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and 2) no secondary structural element is predicted after amino acid 171. Production of a soluble form of PilB in good yield required not only to remove the peptide signal but also to change the AUG codon corresponding to Met-195 into an Ala one. Indeed, when overexpressed in E. coli two forms of PilB were shown to be produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli i.e. one form corresponding to amino acids 33–521 and the other, produced in a higher yield, corresponding to amino acids 196–521 (data and SDS-PAGE, not shown). This result strongly suggested that the AUG codon of Met-195 can be used as an internal initiation codon as already postulated for N. gonorrhoeae PilB (3.Skaar E.P. Tobiason D.M. Quick J. Judd R.C. Weissbach H. Etienne F. Brot N. Seifert H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10108-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This is indeed the case. When an Ala codon was substituted for the Met-195 codon, only a form corresponding to amino acids 33–521 was produced and in a higher yield. For N-terminal domain production, two plasmidic constructs under T7 promoter were therefore built that took in account all the information described above and then were tested for protein production in E. coli. Only one construct corresponding to truncations at the N terminus after position 32 and at the C terminus after position 175 gave a high overexpression of the N-terminal domain. The reason why truncation done at position 194 gave a small production of protein remains unknown. Therefore, only the plasmidic construct that coded the N-terminal domain from amino acids 33 to 175 was used to produce the domain. Purification was achieved by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on ACA54, Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose. At the end of the purification process, 150 mg of pure protein were obtained from 1 liter of culture. The elution profile on gel filtration under native conditions was in agreement with a monomeric state (profile not shown). As expected from the primary structure (Fig. 1), DTNB titration revealed two Cys under denaturing and native conditions. The process used for purification of the entire PilB was similar, and ∼100 mg of entire PilB were obtained/liter of culture. Characterization of the Redox Properties of the N-terminal Domain—The two cysteines in the N-terminal domain are separated by only two amino acids (Fig. 1). Therefore, the fact that they are included in a signature found in disulfide oxidoreductases suggested that these cysteines were redox sensitive. The addition of GSSG or DTNB led to the loss of the two cysteines as proved by DTNB titration. Addition of DTT, then followed by gel filtration restored the thiol titration. These results indicated that the Cys residues, Cys-67 and Cys-70 are oxidized by GSSG or DTNB and form an intramolecular disulfide bond that is sensitive to reduction by DTT. It is known that proteins of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase family such as Trx show an increase in fluorescence emission intensity upon reduction of their active site disulfide bond. In the case of the Trx1 from E. coli, a 2.5-fold increase is observed, which was attributed essentially to the tryptophan located directly before the CXXC signature (24.Slaby I. Cerna V. Jeng M.F. Dyson H.J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3091-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the N-terminal domain (amino acids 33–175), there exist five tryptophans of which one is situated at position 66 also before the CXXC motif (Fig. 1). Therefore, it was expected that the N-terminal domain behaved like Trx1. As shown in Fig. 2, when the oxidized N-terminal domain was excited at 295 nm for the selective excitation of tryptophan, an addition of 1 mm DTT led to a 2.0-fold increase in the fluorescence emission intensity at 347 nm. This result suggested that, as observed for E. coli Trx1, the fluorescence emission of Trp-66 of the N-terminal domain is quenched by formation of the disulfide bond. By taking advantage of the fluorescence intensity change between oxidized and reduced N-terminal domains, the redox equilibrium constant Keq of the domain was determined based on the variation of the fluorescence message at various GSH/GSSG ratios. Thus, the oxidized N-terminal domain was incubated in the presence of 100 μm GSSG and increasing concentrations of GSH from 0 to 180 mm. The fraction of reduced N-terminal domain at equilibrium was measured by the intrinsic N-terminal domain fluorescence assuming no significant equilibrium concentration of N-terminal domain/glutathione mixed disulfide. After fitting the data by nonlinear regression according to Equation 4 (see “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 3), an equilibrium constant for the N-terminal domain/glutathione system of 0.54 ± 0.09 m was determined. A standard redox potential of –0.232 ± 0.004 V for the active site cysteines of the N-terminal domain at 30 °C and pH 7.0 (E′0N) was calculated from the Nernst equation (Equation 5) using a value of –0.240 V (22.Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) for the glutathione standard redox potential (E′0G). To confirm the result, we used another method based on the analysis of the direct protein-protein redox equilibrium between the N-terminal domain and the E. coli Trx1, which has a well established redox potential E′0 of –0.270 V (23.Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the redox equilibrium was indeed attained after incubation for 15 h, we checked with each protein pair that identical equilibrium constants were obtained irrespective of the redox state of the initial mixture. In both cases, the redox potential of the N-terminal domain (E′0N) was determined to be –0.227 ± 0.005 V at pH 7. This is in good agreement with the value determined using the GSH/GSSG system as a r"
https://openalex.org/W2052090157,"Epidemiological studies have correlated diets containing higher intakes of PUFA with lower rates of chronic metabolic diseases. The molecular mechanisms regulated by the consumption of PUFA were examined by using an integrative metabolism approach assaying the liver transcriptome and lipid-metabolome of mice fed a control diet, an arachidonate (AA)-enriched fungal oil, an eicosapentaenoic (EPA)/docosahexaenoic (DHA)-enriched fish oil, or a combination of the two oils. Hepatic gene transcription and fatty acid (FA) metabolism were significantly altered by diets enriched with AA, as revealed by global error assessment and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, respectively. SVD analysis of the lipid data, reinforced with transcriptomics, suggests that the chronic feeding of AA modulates molecular endpoints similar to those previously reported in the obesity-resistant SCD1-/- mouse, namely, genes involved in lipid oxidation/synthesis and the significant changes in FA metabolism stemming from a repressed SCD1 activity. Specifically, the total levels and FA composition of several phospholipid (PL) species were significantly changed, with phosphatidylcholine (PC) demonstrating the greatest alterations. Reduced PC levels were linked to decreased expression of enzymes in PC biosynthesis (choline kinase, -2.2-fold; glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, -2.0-fold). Alterations in PL-FA composition were related to decreased expression of FA biosynthetic genes [fatty acid synthetase, -3.7-fold; stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), -1.8-fold]. Lower hepatic SCD1 gene expression levels were reflected in various aspects of FA metabolism through increased concentrations of palmitic (fungal oil, +45%; combination, +106%) and stearic acids (fungal oil, +60%; combination, +63%) in PC. Importantly, an integrated approach showed that these effects were not attenuated by the addition of an EPA/DHA-enriched fish oil, thereby identifying a previously unrecognized and distinct role for AA in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism."

Intraperitoneal infusion of 400 μg of R-(+) nicotine kg-1 h-1 intraperitoneal for 21 days caused a 15-fold reduction in lung AdoMet although neither plasma nor liver were changed. Infusion of 4 and 400 μg kg-1 h-1 into immunosuppressed rats, beginning when rats were inoculated with P. carinii, caused 85 and 99.88% reductions, respectively, in P. carinii cysts at sacrifice 21 days later; P. carinii nuclei were reduced by 91.2 and >99.99%, respectively. This effect was reversed by concomitant administration of AdoMet with nicotine. Treatment with AdoMet alone increased infection intensity. We conclude that AdoMet is a critical and limiting nutrient for Pneumocystis thus can serve as a therapeutic target for PCP. Regarding the mechanism, nicotine treatment caused no change in rat lung activity of AdoMet synthesizing methionine ATP transferase activity nor was there any evidence of increased AdoMet utilization for methylation reactions. Except of a doubling of putrescine, nicotine treatment also did not change lung polyamine content. However, key polyamine anabolic and catabolic enzymes were upregulated, and there were corresponding changes in polyamine metabolic intermediates. We conclude that chronic nicotine treatment increases lung polyamine catabolic/anabolic cycling and/or excretion leading to increased AdoMet-consuming polyamine biosynthesis and depletion of lung AdoMet.

Hanson D.L. Dworkin M.S. Kaplan J.E. Ward J.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3Jones J.L. Hanson D.L. Dworkin M.S. Alderton D.L. Fleming P.L. Kaplan J.E. Ward J. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 48. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA1999: 1-22Google Scholar). However, all immunosuppressed persons are at risk including those treated with corticosteroids for rheumatic disease, cytotoxic agents for cancer, or immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplantation. PCP can also result from severe malnutrition. The rate of HIV infection associated with AIDS has declined in some developed countries because of specific prophylaxis and the wide use of effective anti-HIV drugs, but these medications are not routinely available for the vast majority of world populations where AIDS is rampant. PCP was thought to be infrequent in AIDS patients from developing countries, but recent data show that PCP occurs frequently in Africa (4Zar H.J. Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2004; 10: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Graham S.M. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2003; 36: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Fisk D.T. Meshnick S. Kazanjian P.H.

Recently the frequency of PCP cases, often associated with undiagnosed HIV, has increased (8Pulvirenti J. Herrera P. Venkataraman P. Ahmed N. AIDS Patient Care STDS. 2003; 17: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Even with access to good medical care, the mortality of PCP ranges from 10 to 40%, being higher in patients without AIDS. The two most effective drugs, pentamidine and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole, TMP-SMZ), have significant side effects (9Wilkin A. Feinberg J. Am. Fam. Physician. 1999; 60: 1699-1708PubMed Google Scholar) and there is evidence of developing resistance (10Kessl J.J. Hill P. Lange B.B. Meshnick S.R. Meunier B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Infect. 1997; 12: 79-97PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet is a critical cellular metabolic intermediate. It plays a pivotal role as methyl donor in a myriad of biochemical processes including methyl group transfers for the formation of phosphatidyl choline, regeneration of methionine, methylation of phospholipids, and methylation of other small molecules (16Lu S.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). AdoMet-mediated methylation is an important regulatory mechanism for proteins, DNA and RNA (17Ehrlich M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). AdoMet also interacts with folate metabolism and thus all the reactions involving folate (18Mato J.M. Corrales F.J. Lu S.C. Avila M.A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 19Eloranta T.O. Kajander E.O. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AdoMet is necessary for the synthesis of the essential polyamines spermidine and spermine (20Persson L. Holm I. Stjernborg L. Heby O. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 250: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Heby O. Persson L. Smith S.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 250: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). AdoMet is synthesized in a one-step condensation of methionine and ATP catalyzed by AdoMet synthetase (methionine ATP transferase, MAT, EC 2.5.1.6). Pneumocystis is highly unusual in lacking this enzymatic activity (22Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). With the exception of Pneumocystis, a Rickettsia (23Andersson J.O. Andersson S.G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1178-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Tucker A.M. Winkler H.H. Driskell L.O. Wood D.O. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3031-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and an aberrant protozoan (25Jeon T.J. Jeon K.W. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Jeon T.J. Jeon K.W. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), every other cell studied is able to synthesize AdoMet. Pneumocystis does require AdoMet and thus must obtain this key intermediate from its mammalian host. This requirement was first observed in culture and was supported by finding that infection with Pneumocystis causes ≥99% depletion of plasma AdoMet in an animal model of PCP (27Merali S. Vargas D. Franklin M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14958-14963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in patients with PCP (28Skelly M. Hoffman J. Fabbri M. Holzman R.S. Clarkson A.B. Merali S. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1267-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Reduction of plasma AdoMet is such an unusual occurrence that measurement of AdoMet has potential as a minimally invasive, sensitive and specific diagnostic method for PCP and the rapid recovery of plasma AdoMet after initiation of effective treatment may serve as a measure of response to therapy (28Skelly M. Hoffman J. Fabbri M. Holzman R.S. Clarkson A.B. Merali S. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1267-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of an asymmetric carbon atom at position 2 in the pyrrolidine ring, nicotine, 1-methyl-2-(3-pyridyl) pyrrolidine, exists as two optically active isomers. Nicotine produced by the tobacco plant is S(-) isomer, but, when burned in a cigarette, about 5% is pyrolytically converted to the R-(+) isomer (29Godin C.S. Crooks P.A. Toxicol. Lett. 1986; 31: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Regarding classical nicotine pharmacological effects, the S-(-) isomer is generally more potent (30Yildiz D. Ercal N. Armstrong D.W. Toxicology. 1998; 130: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On average, about 90% of cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lung and, since the smoke from a cigarette contains about 6–8 mg of nicotine, and a cigar about 8-fold more, smokers can absorb considerable amounts of nicotine (31Larson P. Haag H. Silvette H. Tobacco: Experimental and Clinical Studies. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1961Google Scholar). In man, the major metabolite of nicotine is cotinine (70–80%) (32Benowitz N.L. Jacob P. II I Clin. Pharmacol. Therap. 1994; 56: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cotinine can be further metabolized by AdoMet-mediated methylation (33Sato M. Crooks P.A. Drug Metab. Disp. 1985; 13: 348-353PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cundy K.C. Godin C.S. Crooks P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and N-methyl cotinine is a major urinary metabolite of nicotine (35Pool W.F. Houdi A.A. Damani L.A. Layton W.J. Crooks P.A. Drug Metab. Disp. 1986; 14: 574-579PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with guinea pig tissue showed this methylation to be dependent on aromatic azaheterocycle N-methyltransferase (36Godin C.S. Crooks P.A. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1986; 75: 949-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and to be specific for the R-(+) epimer. The nicotine Km is 14.2 μm (37Cundy K.C. Crooks P.A. Godin C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nicotine has many pharmacological effects including modifying spontaneous nerve activity, heart rate, brain excitation, and blood pressure. Although high nicotine dosage can cause convulsions, anti-diuretic effects, and contraception, moderate dosage has been used to treat various illnesses ranging from cardiovascular problems to infections (31Larson P. Haag H. Silvette H. Tobacco: Experimental and Clinical Studies. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1961Google Scholar). The most effective nicotine application to date is treatment of veterinary parasitic helminth diseases: 19 mg of nicotine kg-1 per os treats Fasciola, Taenia, and Ascaris infections (38Akubue P.I. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1966; 18: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The IC50 in vitro for various helminths ranges from 30 to 300 μm. Beyond veterinary application, nicotine and nicotine analogues were recently reported to be helpful for patients with Crohn's disease (39Fukada A. Saito H. Inui K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Thomas G.A. Rhodes J. Green J.T. Richardson C. Postgrad. Med. J. 2000; 76: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), attention deficient/hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (41Newhouse P.A. Potter A. Kelton M. Corwin J. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 268-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 42Mihailescu S. Drucker-Colin R. Acta Pharmacol.

Efforts are being made to identify nicotine analogues with useful activity, less addictive potential, and less toxicity (44Crooks P.A. Ayers J.T. Xu R. Sumithran S.P. Grinevich V.P. Wilkins L.H. Deaciuc A.G. Allen D.D. Dwoskin L.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1869-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 45Ayers J.T. Dwoskin L.P. Deaciuc A.G. Grinevich V.P. Zhu J. Crooks P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our interest in nicotine, AdoMet, and PCP began when we associated our findings that Pneumocystis requires AdoMet in culture and depletes plasma AdoMet in the rat model of PCP (22Merali S. Frevert U. Williams J.H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the results of a broad clinical study reporting a negative correlation between smoking and recurrent PCP (46Saah A.J. Hoover D.R. Peng Y. Phair J.P. Visscher B. Kingsley L.A. Schrager L.K. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 273: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and older work showing a dramatic, lung-specific AdoMet reduction in guinea pigs treated with nicotine (29Godin C.S. Crooks P.A. Toxicol. Lett. 1986; 31: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). From these associations, we developed the hypothesis that smoking protects against PCP by the action of nicotine causing a reduction in lung AdoMet. Here we report rat model data supporting this hypothesis and data suggesting the mechanism involved in the effect of nicotine on lung AdoMet. Chemicals and Supplies—Ultra-pure AdoMet, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (CHCA), spermidine, spermine, putrescine, and R-(+) nicotine were from Sigma-Aldrich. AccQ.Fluor reagent kits were from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). Urea, CHAPS, DTT, pharmalyte, glycerol, iodoacetamide, Immobiline Dry Strip (IPG), Plus One silver stain kits, and ExcelGel SDS XL 12–14 gels for two-dimensional separation were from Amersham Biosciences. Lyophilized trypsin powder was from Promega (Madison, WI). Pediatric suspension of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) was from Barre-National (Baltimore, MD). Dexamethasone sodium phosphate, 10 mg ml-1 for injection, was from Elkins-Sinn, Inc. (Cherry Hill, NJ). Cyanoacrylic surgical adhesive was from Henry Schein (Melville, NY) Rat PCP Model—Specific pathogen-free S.D. rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were housed in a barrier colony and maintained on multiple antibiotics to avoid other opportunistic infections, as previously described (48Merali S. Chin K. Grady R.W. Weissberger L. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The rats were also pretreated with a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) for 21 days to reduce any latent P. carinii infection. This was done by adding 25 ml of a pediatric suspension of TMP/SMZ to each liter of drinking water yielding final concentrations of 0.2 mg of trimethoprim ml-1 and 1.0 mg of sulfamethoxazole ml-1. After TMP/SMZ treatment, infusion pumps were implanted (see below) and delivered saline during the 7 days allowed for recovery before immunosuppression was begun by adding dexamethasone in the drinking water, 1.5 mg liter-1. Inoculation with P. carinii was by intratracheal instillation of a lung homogenate from animals with PCP. Before use for inoculation, lungs were tested for other pathogens by Gram-stained impression smears and by streaking on blood agar plates to detect colony-forming fungi or bacteria (48Merali S. Chin K. Grady R.W. Weissberger L. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Inoculation was 4 days after initiation of immunosuppression and was repeated after an additional 2 days. The animals were sacrificed 21 days after the first inoculation. The degree of PCP was determined by counting of cysts and trophozoites in stained smears of lung homogenate as previously described (48Merali S. Chin K. Grady R.W. Weissberger L. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Administration of Drugs by Infusion Pumps—Implantation and filling of pumps with 1.0-ml reservoirs and a nominal delivery rate of 0.15 ml day-1 (Veterinary Implant Products Division of Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Plano, TX) were as previously detailed (48Merali S. Chin K. Grady R.W. Weissberger L. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1442-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and briefly described here. Steam-sterilized, saline-charged pumps were inserted into subcutaneous pockets in the dorsal thorax area that had been formed by a probe inserted from an incision in the skin of the back. The delivery capillary tubing was tunneled under the skin and inserted into the peritoneum through a small opening in the ventral midline just posterior to the sternum. The capillary was secured in place with cyanoacrylic surgical adhesive (VetBond). Incisions were closed with wound clips. The pump reservoir was accessed by inserting the needle of a 26-gauge infusion set through the skin into the fill port; the flexible tubing of infusion sets helps avoid movement of the needle thereby preventing damage to the fill port. Pump solutions were changed as follows. An infusion set needle was inserted into the fill port and any remaining solution was withdrawn with an attached syringe. The volume remaining in the pump allowed delivery rate calculation and the manufacturer-reported delivery rate of ∼0.15 ml day-1 was confirmed. To add fresh solution, another infusion set was inserted and 3 ml of fresh solution was slowly injected into the pump flushing out any of the remaining old solution through the draining infusion set. The draining infusion set was then removed and 1.0 ml of fresh solution was injected into the pump as a refill. The 1.0-ml volume of the pump reservoir allowed continuous delivery for >6 days without adding solution and, since analysis of the nicotine remaining in the pumps after 6 days indicated less than a 1% loss by degradation, 2S. Merali, unpublished data. nicotine and saline solutions were replaced at 6-day intervals. Because AdoMet degrades rapidly, solutions containing AdoMet were replaced daily. At the time the pumps were implanted, the animals weighed 145–155 g. Immunosuppression by dexamethasone without P. carinii inoculation causes a typical weight drop to 120–130 grams after 4 weeks. P. carinii-inoculated animals typically weigh 90–100 g 21-days post-inoculation unless treated to suppress PCP. Nominal dose rates calculated at the beginning of the experiment are reported in “Results” although the dose rate can increase by as much as 20% by the end of the treatment period because of weight loss. AdoMet Measurement—The AdoMet contents of lung, liver, and plasma samples were measured by HPLC analysis using Waters AccQ. Fluor derivatizing reagent as previously reported (27Merali S. Vargas D. Franklin M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14958-14963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For biological samples, the limit of detection is 0.5 nmol and linearity extends to 5,000 nmol. All samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the coefficient of variation ranged from 5 to 17%, depending on the amount of AdoMet in the sample. Nicotine Measurement—Measurement of R-(+) nicotine in tissues and plasma was done using a modification of a published capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method (49Palmer M.E. Smith R.F. Chambers K. Tetler L.W. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The apparatus was a P/ACE MDQ system equipped with a photodiode array detector allowing electropherograms to be monitored at 257 and 205 nm. We used an amine capillary kit (Beckman, Inc.; 50 mm inner diameter × 60 cm total length, 50 cm to the detector window). Sample preparation involved adding 20 μl of 10% perchloric acid to 80 μl of lung homogenate to precipitate the proteins that were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were stored for up to 7 days at -20 °C before CZE analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were diluted 1:1 with water. The separation protocol was as follows: 2 min, 20 psi rinse using the kit “amine regenerator solution,” 2 min, 20 psi rinse with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), sample injection and separation using 25 kV in reverse polarity mode for 7 min at 25 °C. Specificity was assured by demonstrating that R-(+) nicotine was resolved from all other peaks in cell extracts. Instrument precision was monitored by making triplicate injections from a single pooled standard. Linearity was demonstrated using a series of standard solutions over a range of 0.10–20.00 pmol. Analytical Methods—Lung tissues (500 mg) from treated or normal lung were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and were crushed into a fine powder using mortar and pestle. The powder was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgSO4,) and sonicated at 40 watts and 70% duty cycle for about 2 min, then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. An aliquot of this lysate was used for Bio-Rad protein assay, and the protein from the rest of the lysate was used for the reaction mixture. Measurement of the AdoMet biosynthesis enzyme MAT was as previously described in (27Merali S. Vargas D. Franklin M. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14958-14963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Presumptive SSAT activity (pmol of acetylspermidine (mg of protein)-1 h-1), AdoMet DC activity and ODC activity were as described previously (50Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21017-21022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 51Tabib A. Morgan M.L.D. Polyamine Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology. 79. Humana Press Inc., 1998: 41-49Google Scholar, 52Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spermidine, spermine, putrescine, and N-1-acetylated spermidine were analyzed by HPLC using Waters' AccQ.Fluor derivatizing reagent as previously reported (53Merali S. Clarkson Jr., A.B. J. Chromatogr. B: Biomed. Appl. 1996; 675: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Preparation of Samples for Proteomics Studies—The lungs of two nicotine-treated (400 μgof R-(+) nicotine kg-1 h-1) and two saline-treated animals were washed aseptically three times with sterile saline then soaked for 15 min at 4 °C in saline. Proteins were extracted from 500 mg of aliquots of lung tissue as follows. After freezing with liquid nitrogen, tissue samples were ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen in the mortar. The frozen powder was added directly to 0.8 ml of cold lysis buffer (9.8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 15 mg ml-1 DTT, and 4% ampholytes) and sonicated at 40 watts and 70% duty cycle for about 2 min. The sonicate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove non-homogenized cartilage and other debris. A 10-μl aliquot of each lysate was used for a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Acetone with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 20 mm DTT was added to the balance to precipitate the proteins that were then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C. The acetone/trichloroacetic acid/DTT solution was poured off and enough lysis buffer added to obtain a protein concentration of 3 mg ml-1. The proteins were re-solubilized by sonication followed by shaking for 3 h at room temperature. After a final centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected for two-dimensional protein electrophoresis. First Dimension Electrophoresis-Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)—IEF was performed using a MultiPhor II system Amersham Biosciences following the manufacturer's instructions. Immobiline dry strip gels (18 cm) were hydrated overnight (∼16 h) in 350 μl of solution containing 2% CHAPS (w/v), 0.4% DTT (w/v), 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% carrier ampholytes solution (v/v), and 70 μg of sample protein. IEF was performed for 30 min at 150 V, 1 h at 300 V, 1.5 h at 1500 V, and 22.5 h at 3000 V to complete 70,000 VH. IEF focusing ranges were 4–7 and 4.5–5.5. Second Dimension Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)—Prior to second dimension separation, Immobiline dry strip gel strips were soaked for 15 min in 10 ml equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% DTT, and 0.001% bromphenol blue in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8) (54Wheeler D.L. Ness K.J. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3037-3042PubMed Google Scholar) and then soaked for 15 min in 10 ml of equilibration buffer containing 250 mg of iodoacetamide. Following the manufacturer's instructions, the Immobiline dry strip gel strips were placed on an Excel Gel SDS XL 12–14 (Amersham Biosciences) mounted in a Multiphor II electrophoresis unit connected to a Multi Temp III thermostatic circulator (Amersham Biosciences) set to 15 °C. Second dimension electrophoresis was run at 10 mA for 10 min, 20 mA for 20 min then at 40 mA for 1.5 h. The gels were silver-stained following the manufacturer's protocol. Image Analysis of Two-dimensional Gels—Monochrome scans of gels were made at 200 dpi (HP model C7710A scanner) and stored in tiff format for input into the Z3 proteomics software package (Compugen, Jamesburg, NJ). The software automatically detected spots and assigned them numbers. Gel to gel variation was reduced by combining three gels per Immobiline dry strip gel range from each animal to produce Raw Master Gels (RMGs). RMGs of the two animals from the treatment group and the two from the control group were combined to produce Master Reference Gels, which were used to create differential displays. The software identified all differentially expressed protein spots in nicotine-treated animals relative to saline-treated controls including those up-regulated, down-regulated, newly expressed, or no longer expressed. Predigestion Processing—Protein spots of interest were excised from the gel and destained by placing them in 1.5 ml of siliconized microcentrifuge tubes, washing with deionized water (500 μl, 6×), transferring into new 1.5-ml siliconized tubes, breaking into small pieces with a pipette tip (0.5–1 mm2) and incubating in 20 μl of fresh destaining solution (equal parts 30 mm potassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate) until the brownish color disappeared (1–2 min). The destaining solution was decanted, and the gel pieces washed with water (20 μl, 5–6×) until all traces of yellow disappeared. They were then incubated for 20 min in 20 μl of 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, washed with water (20 μl, 1×), and dehydrated with acetonitrile (30 μl, 2×) until opaque white. The gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge (30 min). In-gel Trypsin Digestion—Purification of tryptic peptides followed a published method (55Zhan X. Desiderio D.M. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A vial of 20 μg (833 pmol) of lyophilized trypsin powder was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm acetic acid and diluted to 16 ng μl-1 with 230 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. A 20–30-μl volume of trypsin solution (depending on the amount of dried gel in the sample) was added to each set of dried gel pieces. Digestion w"
https://openalex.org/W1972619197,"NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) is essential for bacterial growth and a potential target for antimicrobial drug discovery. Here we queried the role of 14 conserved amino acids of Escherichia coli LigA by alanine scanning and thereby identified five new residues within the nucleotidyltransferase domain as being essential for LigA function in vitro and in vivo. Structure activity relationships were determined by conservative mutagenesis for the Glu-173, Arg-200, Arg-208, and Arg-277 side chains, as well as four other essential side chains that had been identified previously (Lys-115, Asp-117, Asp-285, and Lys-314). In addition, we identified Lys-290 as important for LigA activity. Reference to the structure of Enterococcus faecalis LigA allowed us to discriminate three classes of essential/important side chains that: (i) contact NAD+ directly (Lys-115, Glu-173, Lys-290, and Lys-314); (ii) comprise the interface between the NMN-binding domain (domain Ia) and the nucleotidyltransferase domain or comprise part of a nick-binding site on the surface of the nucleotidyltransferase domain (Arg-200 and Arg-208); or (iii) stabilize the active site fold of the nucleotidyltransferase domain (Arg-277). Analysis of mutational effects on the isolated ligase adenylylation and phosphodiester formation reactions revealed different functions for essential side chains at different steps of the DNA ligase pathway, consistent with the proposal that the active site is serially remodeled as the reaction proceeds. NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) is essential for bacterial growth and a potential target for antimicrobial drug discovery. Here we queried the role of 14 conserved amino acids of Escherichia coli LigA by alanine scanning and thereby identified five new residues within the nucleotidyltransferase domain as being essential for LigA function in vitro and in vivo. Structure activity relationships were determined by conservative mutagenesis for the Glu-173, Arg-200, Arg-208, and Arg-277 side chains, as well as four other essential side chains that had been identified previously (Lys-115, Asp-117, Asp-285, and Lys-314). In addition, we identified Lys-290 as important for LigA activity. Reference to the structure of Enterococcus faecalis LigA allowed us to discriminate three classes of essential/important side chains that: (i) contact NAD+ directly (Lys-115, Glu-173, Lys-290, and Lys-314); (ii) comprise the interface between the NMN-binding domain (domain Ia) and the nucleotidyltransferase domain or comprise part of a nick-binding site on the surface of the nucleotidyltransferase domain (Arg-200 and Arg-208); or (iii) stabilize the active site fold of the nucleotidyltransferase domain (Arg-277). Analysis of mutational effects on the isolated ligase adenylylation and phosphodiester formation reactions revealed different functions for essential side chains at different steps of the DNA ligase pathway, consistent with the proposal that the active site is serially remodeled as the reaction proceeds. DNA ligases are grouped into two families, ATP-dependent ligases and NAD+-dependent ligases, according to their nucleotide substrate requirement. DNA ligases seal 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini by means of three nucleotidyl transfer reactions (1.Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In the first step, attack on the α phosphorus of ATP or NAD+ by ligase results in the release of pyrophosphate or NMN and the formation of a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate. In the second step, the AMP is transferred to the 5′ end of the 5′ phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form a DNA-adenylate intermediate. In the third step, ligase catalyzes attack by the 3′-OH of the nick on DNA-adenylate to join the two polynucleotides and release AMP. The ATP-dependent DNA ligases are found in bacteria, Archaea, and eukarya, whereas the NAD+-dependent enzymes are present only in bacteria and entomopox viruses (2.Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3.Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol.

All known bacterial species encode at least one highly conserved NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA), 1The abbreviations used are: LigA, NAD+-dependent DNA ligase; FOA, fluoroorotic acid. which is essential for growth, even when the bacterium encodes additional NAD+-dependent or ATP-dependent ligase enzymes (4.Petit M.A. Ehrlich S.D.

Therefore, LigA presents an attractive target for broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy predicated on blocking the reaction of LigA with NAD+ (6.Brötz-Oesterhelt H. Knezevic I. Bartel S. Lampe T.

Structure. 2004; 12: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The polynucleotide ligases and capping enzymes comprise a covalent nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, members of which catalyze transfer of a nucleoside monophosphate to the 5′ phosphorylated end of a polynucleotide via a covalent enzyme-lysyl-nucleoside monophosphate intermediate. Five signature motifs of the nucleotidyltransferase domain (motifs I, III, IIIa, IV, and V in Fig. 1) form the nucleotide-binding pocket (14.Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analyses of ATP-dependent DNA ligases, RNA ligases, and RNA capping enzymes have identified essential catalytic side chains within these motifs and begun to clarify their distinctive contributions at different steps along their respective reaction pathways (15.Sriskanda V.

In contrast, mutational analyses of NAD+-dependent ligases are less advanced, at least with respect to the nucleotidyltransferase domain. Previous studies of NAD+-dependent ligases have ascribed functions to individual domains of the LigA protein. All LigA enzymes consist of a central “ligase module” composed of an adenylyltransferase domain and an OB fold domain, which is flanked by a N-terminal domain (domain Ia) and several C-terminal modules, including a tetracysteine zinc-binding motif, a helix-hairpin-helix domain, and the BRCT domain (7.Singleton M.R. Håkansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. Structure. 1999; 7: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8.Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). An N-terminal fragment composed of the Ia and nucleotidyltransferase domains retains full ligase adenylylation activity with NAD+ but is unable to catalyze phosphodiester formation at a standard 5′-PO4 nick or at a pre-adenylated nick (3.Sriskanda V.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An instructive finding was that deletion of domain Ia abolished the reaction of LigA with NAD+ to form ligase-adenylate but had no effect on phosphodiester bond formation at a pre-adenylated nick (3.Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23.Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9685-9700Google Scholar); these results implicated domain Ia in recognition of the NAD+ substrate. Mutations of five individual amino acids within domain Ia either reduced or abolished sealing of a 5′-PO4 nick and adenylate transfer from NAD+, without affecting ligation of pre-formed DNA-adenylate. It was suggested that these five side chains comprise a binding site for the NMN moiety of NAD+ (3.Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23.Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9685-9700Google Scholar), a prediction borne out by the recently reported structure of the N-terminal domain of LigA bound to NMN (24.Gajiwala K. Pinko C. Structure. 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the nucleotidyltransferase domain of LigA (25.Luo J. Barany F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26.Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has highlighted essential roles for five amino acids: the motif I lysine (Lys-115 in Escherichia coli LigA), which is the site of covalent attachment of AMP to the enzyme (27.Gumport R.I. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); the motif I aspartate (Asp-117 in EcoLigA); the motif IV aspartate (Asp-285 in EcoLigA); and the motif V lysine (Lys-314 in EcoLigA). The essential residues above are denoted by “|” over the sequence alignment in Fig. 1. Several residues, found by alanine scanning to be nonessential for LigA function, are indicated by “+” above the sequence alignment in Fig. 1. Here we performed a new alanine scan of 14 residues of the nucleotidyl transferase domain of EcoLigA indicated by “?” in Fig. 1. The choice of positions to mutate was guided by side chain conservation and, in some cases, proximity to the covalently bound AMP in the crystal structure of the Thermus filiformis LigA-AMP adduct. Specific residues were targeted to test models of metal-dependent catalysis proposed by Lee et al. (8.Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) on the basis of the LigA-AMP structure. We report the identification of five new essential residues in EcoLigA, clarify structure-activity relationships at these and other essential positions by conservative mutagenesis, and analyze mutational effects on individual steps of the ligation pathway. We discuss our findings in light of the recently reported structure of Enterococcus faecalis LigA bound to NAD+ (24.Gajiwala K. Pinko C. Structure. 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ligase Mutants—Missense mutations were introduced into the pET-EcoLIG expression plasmid using the PCR-based two-stage overlap extension method as described previously (23.Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9685-9700Google Scholar). The entire ligA gene was sequenced in every case to confirm the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during PCR amplification and cloning. The expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Mutant and wild-type ligases were purified from the soluble lysates of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced BL21(DE3) cells by nickel-agarose chromatography, as described previously (23.Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9685-9700Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nick Ligation—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm NAD+, 1 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled nicked duplex DNA substrate, and aliquots of serial 2-fold dilutions of wild-type or mutant ligases were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. The specific activities of wild-type and mutant ligases were determined from the slopes of the titration curves in the linear range of enzyme dependence. The activities of the mutant ligases were normalized to the wild-type specific activity (defined as 100%). Ligase Adenylylation—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm [32P]adenylate-NAD (purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 8 pmol of wild-type or mutant LigA were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min. The reactions were quenched with SDS, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ligase-[32P]AMP adduct was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix imager. Ligation at a Pre-adenylated Nick—The nicked DNA-adenylate substrate is shown in Fig. 4. The 5′ adenylated 32P-labeled 18-mer strand (AppDNA) was prepared using Mycobacterium tuberculosis LigC (5.Gong C. Martins A. Bongiorno P. Glickman M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20594-20606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) as follows. Ten reaction mixtures (100 μl each) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 50 pmol of a singly nicked three-piece duplex DNA substrate containing a 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer strand at the nick, and 10 μg of MtuLigC were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were halted by adding EDTA to a concentration of 25 mm. The samples were pooled and then ethanolprecipitated. The pelleted material was resuspended in formamide, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then subjected to electrophoresis through an 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The 32P-labeled AppDNA strand, which was separated clearly from the 18-mer input pDNA strand, was located by autoradiography of the wet gel and then eluted from an excised gel slice. The 18-mer AppDNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The nicked DNA-adenylate substrate was formed by annealing the gel-purified AppDNA strand to the complementary 36-mer and a 3′-OH acceptor strand at a molar ratio of 1:4:4. AppDNA ligation reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 600 fmol nicked DNA-adenylate substrate, and 6 pmol of wild-type or mutant EcoLigA proteins were incubated at 22 °C. The sealing reactions were initiated by adding ligase. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified in Fig. 4 and quenched immediately with EDTA and formamide. The products were resolved by denaturing PAGE, and the extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a Fujix imager. Mutational Effects on LigA Function in Vivo in Yeast—NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments containing LigA mutant alleles were excised from their respective pET-based LigA plasmids and inserted into pYX1-His (CEN TRP1). In this vector, expression of ligA is under the control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. The pYX1-LIGA plasmids were transformed into a yeast cdc9Δ strain bearing a CEN URA3 CDC9 plasmid. Trp+ isolates were streaked on agar plates containing 0.75 mg/ml of 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA). Lethal mutations (–growth) were those that formed no FOA-resistant colonies at 18, 25, 30, or 37 °C. The viable cdc9Δ ligA yeast strains were tested for growth on YPD agar at 18, 25, 30, and 37 °C. “+++” indicates colony size indistinguishable from a cdc9Δ strain expressing wild-type LigA. Alanine Scanning Identifies LigA Residues Essential for Nick Joining in Vitro—Single alanine substitutions were introduced at 14 conserved positions in the nucleotidyltransferase domain of EcoLigA (Fig. 1). His10-tagged G118A, L119A, D138A, E143A, G172A, E173A, N198A, R200A, R208A, R277A, D283A, G286A, V288A, and K290A mutants were produced in E. coli and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography in parallel with wild-type EcoLigA (Fig. 2A). The extent of ligation of singly nicked 3′-OH/5′-PO4 DNA by wild-type EcoLigA and each mutant was gauged as a function of the input enzyme, and the specific activities were normalized to the wild-type value (defined as 100%). Our operational definition of an essential amino acid was one at which alanine substitution reduced nick-sealing activity to ≤10% of the wild-type level. By this criterion, Gly-118, Glu-173, Arg-200, Arg-208, and Arg-277 were deemed essential for ligation (Fig. 2B). Eight residues were judged to be nonessential for ligation in vitro (Fig. 2B). The L119A change flanking motif I had no impact on nick-joining activity. This leucine side chain was initially reported to line the AMP-binding pocket of TfiLigA and to make multiple van der Waals contacts with the ribose sugar of the covalently bound adenylate (8.Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has since been determined that the amino acid sequence used to build the TfiLigA structure contained numerous errors (including incorrect side chains, deleted amino acids, and extra amino acids in the nucleotidyltransferase domain), which the authors have recently rectified. In the revised version of the TfiLigA structure (Protein Data Bank 1V9P), the leucine corresponding to Leu-119 of EcoLigA makes no contact with the bound adenylate. (Henceforth, all references to the TfiLigA structure will be to the revised version.) The equivalent leucine side chain makes no contacts with NAD+ in the EfaLigA structure (24.Gajiwala K. Pinko C. Structure. 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The D138A change caused a modest reduction of ligase activity to 37% of wild-type LigA. The conserved Asp side chain is located on the surface of TfiLigA ∼15 Å from the bound AMP. The E143A mutation had little effect on ligation (52% of wild-type activity); this conserved glutamate is located on the surface of TfiLigA ∼17 Å away from the bound adenylate. The modest decrement in activity elicited by the G172A change in motif III (36% of wild-type nick joining) might reflect a subtle effect on the position of the vicinal Glu-173 side chain, which lines the AMP-binding pocket and is essential for EcoLigA catalysis. The N198A change reduced nick-joining activity to one-fourth of wild-type LigA. This conserved Asn side chain is located ∼9 Å away from the AMP phosphate in TfiLigA-adenylate and is 7–8 Å away from the NMN moiety of NAD+ in the EfaLigA structure. The D283A mutation had little impact on ligase activity (57% of wild-type), a finding that vitiates the model of Lee et al. (8.Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which proposes that this carboxylate side chain is required to coordinate an essential divalent cation cofactor during the step of phosphodiester formation. The G286A mutation in nucleotidyl transferase motif IV lowers nick-joining activity to 14% of wild-type; we suspect that the loss of activity reflects steric effects of the alanine methyl group on the conformation of the motif IV beta strand, especially the position of the vicinal Asp285 side chain, which is essential for EcoLigA activity (26.Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The V288A change in motif IV was benign (74% of wild-type activity). This conserved aliphatic side chain makes van der Waals contacts with the adenine base of AMP in TfiLigA and the adenine of NAD+ in EfaLigA (24.Gajiwala K. Pinko C. Structure. 2004; 12: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We conclude that such contacts are not important for EcoLigA function. The K290A change reduced nick-joining activity to 13% of the wild-type level. This conserved lysine side chain lines the adenosine-binding pocket of TfiLigA and makes van der Waals contacts with the N1 and C2 atoms of the adenine base. Although Lys-290 does not meet our criterion for essentiality, it probably does play a role in substrate binding (see “Discussion”). Effects of Alanine Mutations on EcoLigA Function in Vivo in Yeast—A deletion of the essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP-dependent DNA ligase Cdc9 can be complemented by expression of EcoLigA (26.Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Viability of the yeast cdc9Δ strain is contingent on maintenance of an extrachromosomal CDC9 gene on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Hence, cdc9Δ cells cannot grow on medium containing 5-FOA (a drug that selects against the URA3 CDC9 plasmid), but they can grow on 5-FOA if the cells have been transformed with a CEN TRP1 plasmid expressing wild-type EcoLigA under the control of the constitutive yeast TPI1 promoter. Here we tested, by the plasmid shuffle assay (26.Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whether the EcoLigA-Ala mutants were functional in yeast. We found that mutations of the five residues defined as essential for EcoLigA function in vitro (Gly-118, Glu-173, Arg-200, Arg-208, Arg-277) were all lethal in vivo, i.e. they were unable to support growth of cdc9Δ on 5-FOA at either 18, 25, 30, or 37 °C (Fig. 2B). Mutations of seven of the residues defined as nonessential for nick-joining activity in vitro were functional in cdc9Δ complementation in vivo. Only the least active of the nonessential mutants, K290A, with 13% of wild-type activity in vitro, was unable to complement growth of cdc9Δ. The viable cdc9Δ ligA-Ala strains L119A, D138A, E143A, G172A, N198A, D283A, and V288A grew as well as the wild-type cdc9Δ ligA strain on YPD agar medium at 18, 25, 30, and 37 °C, as gauged by colony size (not shown). The G286A strain grew as well as a wild-type ligA strain at 25 and 30 °C but formed smaller colonies at 37 °C (not shown). Structure-Activity Relationships at Essential Residues of EcoLigA—The present results, together with previous mutational data (26.Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), highlight eight individual non-glycine amino acids within the nucleotidyltransferase domain that are essential for EcoLigA activity in vitro: Lys-115, Asp-117, Glu-173, Arg-200, Arg-208, Arg-277, Asp-285, and Lys-314. To better evaluate the contributions of these residues to the DNA ligase reaction, we tested the effects of conservative substitutions whereby arginine was replaced by lysine and glutamine, glutamate by glutamine and aspartate, aspartate by asparagine and glutamate, and lysine by arginine and glutamine. Sixteen conservative EcoLigA mutants were produced in E. coli and purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography. The LigA polypeptide was the predominant species detected by SDS-PAGE, and the extents of purification were comparable for mutant and wild-type EcoLigA (Fig. 3A). The nick-joining and ligase adenylylation activities of the mutants were determined and normalized to the wild-type value (Fig. 3B). Conservative replacement of the motif I Lys-115 by either arginine or glutamine abolished nick-joining activity and the reaction with [32P]NAD+ to form the ligase-adenylate intermediate. These results highlight a strict requirement for lysine as the active site nucleophile. Replacing Asp-117 with asparagine abolished nick-joining activity (<0.1% of wild-type), and a glutamate substitution resulted in a minimal restoration of function (to 3% of wild-type). These data establish the requirement for a carboxylate residue at position 117, and we infer that there is a tight steric constraint that precludes accommodation of the extra methylene group of a glutamate. Previous studies showed that replacing the motif I Asp with alanine does not prevent the ligase adenylylation reaction with NAD+ (25.Luo J. Barany F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we find that the conservative D117N and D117E mutants retained 35 and 53% of wild-type adenylyltransferase activity, respectively. These findings point to an essential role of the conserved motif I aspartate during either step 2 or step 3 of the ligase pathway (25.Luo J. Barany F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). LigA nick-joining activity was abolished when the motif III Glu-173 side chain was replaced with either aspartate or glutamine. Thus, activity requires a carboxylate and a minimum distance from the main chain to the carboxylate that is met by glutamate but not aspartate. The E173D and E173Q mutants retained 13 and 54% of wild-type adenylyltransferase activity, respectively, signifying that an amide group suffices for the reaction of LigA with NAD+ to form ligase-adenylate, and the stringent requirement for a carboxylate is probably exerted at a downstream step of the ligation pathway. Conservative replacement of Arg-200 and Arg-208 with either lysine or glutamine failed to restore nick-joining activity. Changing Arg-277 to glutamine reduced nick joining to 1.8% of the wild-type level, similar to the R277A mutant, and there was only marginal restoration of activity with a lysine substitution (to 5.6% of wild-type). Thus a positive charge is not sufficient at positions 200, 208, or 277; rather, we posit that these side chains engage in bidentate hydrogen bonding or ionic contacts that are sustained uniquely by arginine. Arg-208 is apparently essential for the reaction of LigA with NAD+, insofar as the adenylyltransferase activity of the R208Q and R208K proteins was 0.1–2% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 3B). In contrast, Arg-200 plays a more complex role whereby adenylyltransferase activity is partially restored by a lysine (14% of wild-type) but not a glutamine (1% activity); but overall ligation requires an arginine. The effects of the R277Q and R277K changes on ligase adenylylation closely paralleled their impact on overall ligation. Replacing the essential motif IV Asp-285 side chain with asparagine abolished nick-joining activity (<0.1% of wild-type), and introducing a glutamate had minimal salutary effect (4% of wild-type). Thus, a carboxylate is required at position 285, and the extra methylene group of a glutamate side chain is not easily accommodated. The D285E and D285N mutants retained 6 and 23% of wild-type adenylyltransferase activity, respectively, signifying that, although an amide group at the proper distance from the main chain partially restores reactivity of LigA with NAD+, a carboxylate is required at a downstream step. Conservative substitution of the motif V Lys-314 side chain with glutamine abolished nick-joining activity and reduced adenylyltransferase to 3% of wild-type. Introducing an arginine increased ligation and adenylyltransferase activities to 5 and 13% of wild-type, respectively. Conservative Mutational Effects on EcoLigA Function in Vivo in Yeast—The conservative mutants were tested by plasmid shuffle for cdc9Δ complementation (Fig. 3B). The results underscore the theme that LigA mutations that abolish or severely depress nick-joining activity in vitro are lethal in vivo in yeast. The R227K mutant, which was the most active of the proteins in this collection (with 5.6% of wild-type ligase function), was able to sustain yeast growth on YPD medium at 25 and 30 °C, but not at 37 °C (scored as ts in Fig. 3B). The classical ligA-ts7 mutant strain of E. coli has a similar low residual level of strand-joining a"
