https://openalex.org/W1985098552,"NEILANDS1 has described the formation of coprohæm from iron and coproporphyrinogen in aqueous solution at physiological pH. Since uroporphyrinogen and coproporphyrinogen, rather than the porphyrins themselves, are now believed to be the true intermediates in the biosynthesis of hæm2 3, it would be tempting to postulate that protoporphyrinogen is the intermediate which reacts in vivo with iron to form protohæm. Further to test this hypothesis, we have incubated aqueous solutions of coproporphyrinogen, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin with ferrous salts under various conditions and have estimated the hæm formed spectrophotometrically as the pyridine hæmochrome."

These compounds consist of molecules of low water solubility bearing multiple functional groups, and they thus present difficulties when employed as substrates for investigations directed primarily at the enzymatic utilization of the acetylenic bond. With a view toward obtaining information on the utilization of this linkage it seemed desirable to employ simple acetylene derivatives as models and to obtain enzymes capable of using such model compounds. An effort was made to select compounds which were stable, water-soluble, available in high purity, and possessing a minimal number of functional groups. One of the simplest compounds which meets these criteria is acetylenedicarboxylic acid, the enzymatic utilization of which is the subject of the present report. An enzyme system metabolizing ADA’ was obtained by employing the enrichment culture technique for isolation of an organism with the ability to grow with ADA as the sole carbon source. A purified enzyme preparation obtained from the organism, identified as B species of Pseudomonas (3), catalyzes Reaction 1:"

Data on dates of appearance and shedding and the child's sge in each instance should also be collected. Such a census would contribute important information concerning the amount and kind of radiation received by the most sennitive section of any population, namely, the children. (C.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W1983153351,"DURING the course of other investigations, oxy-chlororaphin was found to inhibit strongly the growth of Streptomyces sp. 441. Chlororaphin (melting point 225° C. in nitrogen) was separated directly by centrifuging a five-day-old submerged culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa containing glycerol (Sierra, G., and Veringa, H. A., unpublished work). Yields as great as 0.53 gm./l. were obtained (considerably greater than the yield of 5–16 mgm./l. obtained from a 14-day-old glucose culture at 28° C. by Birkofer1). Crystalline oxy-chlororaphin was obtained by dissolving chlororaphin in acetone (discarding the insoluble fraction). After cooling in contact with the air, the solution yielded crystals of oxy-chlororaphin. Several recrystallizations in acetone were necessary to obtain the pure compound (melting point 242° C.)."

We have demonstrated an increased synthesis of hæm in vitro from glycine labelled with carbon-14, by means of adding inorganic copper to copper-deficient chicken blood."

It was not possible to obtain Chlorella-cell protein, readily, in acid solution. It was possible to break most of the cells by grinding mechanically with silica sand but this method is tedious and time-consuming. The latter point is important when it is necessary to measure physiological changes which proceed at a rapid rate."

https://openalex.org/W2052642644,IT has been shown by Birch1 that the main competitive effect in Drosophila pseudo-obscura is between larvae. Lewontin2 studied the larval viabilities of various strains of D. melanogaster mixed with a white-eyed stock and found that the viability of a genotype is partially dependent on the genotypes co-existing with it.

https://openalex.org/W2087390281,"IN dilute aqueous solution the oxidized prosthetic group of hæmoglobin and catalase, ferriprotoporphyrin (the ferric iron derivative of 1,3,5,8-tetramethyl-2,4-divinylporphine-6,7-dipropionic acid) may be affected by ionizing radiation at several places in its complex structure. Dale and Russell1 and Barron and Johnson2 observed spectroscopic changes which led them to conclude that the porphyrin ring was broken. In addition, Barron and Johnson found that in the absence of oxygen the spectrum was changed to that of a ferroprotoporphyrin. We have obtained spectroscopic evidence that a new compound is produced before the ring is broken, and that the vinyl side-chains play an important part in its formation. It is also found that hydrogen peroxide will produce this compound."
