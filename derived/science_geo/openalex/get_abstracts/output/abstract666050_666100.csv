https://openalex.org/W3119086885,"Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer mortality, and cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver. It is not clear whether liver immune tolerance mechanisms contribute to cancer outcomes. We report that liver metastases diminish immunotherapy efficacy systemically in patients and preclinical models. Patients with liver metastases derive limited benefit from immunotherapy independent of other established biomarkers of response. In multiple mouse models, we show that liver metastases siphon activated CD8+ T cells from systemic circulation. Within the liver, activated antigen-specific Fas+CD8+ T cells undergo apoptosis following their interaction with FasL+CD11b+F4/80+ monocyte-derived macrophages. Consequently, liver metastases create a systemic immune desert in preclinical models. Similarly, patients with liver metastases have reduced peripheral T cell numbers and diminished tumoral T cell diversity and function. In preclinical models, liver-directed radiotherapy eliminates immunosuppressive hepatic macrophages, increases hepatic T cell survival and reduces hepatic siphoning of T cells. Thus, liver metastases co-opt host peripheral tolerance mechanisms to cause acquired immunotherapy resistance through CD8+ T cell deletion, and the combination of liver-directed radiotherapy and immunotherapy could promote systemic antitumor immunity."

Thermogenic adipose tissues markedly improve glucose and lipid homeostasis in mouse models, although the extent to which brown adipose tissue (BAT) influences metabolic and cardiovascular disease in humans is unclear1,2. Here we retrospectively categorized 134,529 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography scans from 52,487 patients, by presence or absence of BAT, and used propensity score matching to assemble a study cohort. Scans in the study population were initially conducted for indications related to cancer diagnosis, treatment or surveillance, without previous stimulation. We report that individuals with BAT had lower prevalences of cardiometabolic diseases, and the presence of BAT was independently correlated with lower odds of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension. These findings were supported by improved blood glucose, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein values. The beneficial effects of BAT were more pronounced in individuals with overweight or obesity, indicating that BAT might play a role in mitigating the deleterious effects of obesity. Taken together, our findings highlight a potential role for BAT in promoting cardiometabolic health. Retrospective analysis of 18F-FDG PET/CT scans from over 50,000 patients reveals correlations between presence of brown adipose tissue and lower odds of having cardiometabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3120084484,"Despite recent advances in metagenomic binning, reconstruction of microbial species from metagenomics data remains challenging. Here we develop variational autoencoders for metagenomic binning (VAMB), a program that uses deep variational autoencoders to encode sequence coabundance and k-mer distribution information before clustering. We show that a variational autoencoder is able to integrate these two distinct data types without any previous knowledge of the datasets. VAMB outperforms existing state-of-the-art binners, reconstructing 29-98% and 45% more near-complete (NC) genomes on simulated and real data, respectively. Furthermore, VAMB is able to separate closely related strains up to 99.5% average nucleotide identity (ANI), and reconstructed 255 and 91 NC Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei sample-specific genomes as two distinct clusters from a dataset of 1,000 human gut microbiome samples. We use 2,606 NC bins from this dataset to show that species of the human gut microbiome have different geographical distribution patterns. VAMB can be run on standard hardware and is freely available at https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb ."
https://openalex.org/W3120205736,"The state of intermediate hyperglycemia is indicative of elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes1. However, the current definition of prediabetes neither reflects subphenotypes of pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes nor is predictive of future metabolic trajectories. We used partitioning on variables derived from oral glucose tolerance tests, MRI-measured body fat distribution, liver fat content and genetic risk in a cohort of extensively phenotyped individuals who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes2,3 to identify six distinct clusters of subphenotypes. Three of the identified subphenotypes have increased glycemia (clusters 3, 5 and 6), but only individuals in clusters 5 and 3 have imminent diabetes risks. By contrast, those in cluster 6 have moderate risk of type 2 diabetes, but an increased risk of kidney disease and all-cause mortality. Findings were replicated in an independent cohort using simple anthropomorphic and glycemic constructs4. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that pathophysiological heterogeneity exists before diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and highlights a group of individuals who have an increased risk of complications without rapid progression to overt type 2 diabetes. Clustering of patients with prediabetes using simple clinical features reveals six distinct groups with differing risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its associated complications."
https://openalex.org/W3118913605,"In multiple cancer types, high tumor mutational burden (TMB) is associated with longer survival after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The association of TMB with survival outside of the immunotherapy context is poorly understood. We analyzed 10,233 patients (80% non-ICI-treated, 20% ICI-treated) with 17 cancer types before/without ICI treatment or after ICI treatment. In non-ICI-treated patients, higher TMB (higher percentile within cancer type) was not associated with better prognosis; in fact, in many cancer types, higher TMB was associated with poorer survival, in contrast to ICI-treated patients in whom higher TMB was associated with longer survival."
https://openalex.org/W3120879514,"Current methods used for measuring amino acid side-chain reactivity lack the throughput needed to screen large chemical libraries for interactions across the proteome. Here we redesigned the workflow for activity-based protein profiling of reactive cysteine residues by using a smaller desthiobiotin-based probe, sample multiplexing, reduced protein starting amounts and software to boost data acquisition in real time on the mass spectrometer. Our method, streamlined cysteine activity-based protein profiling (SLC-ABPP), achieved a 42-fold improvement in sample throughput, corresponding to profiling library members at a depth of >8,000 reactive cysteine sites at 18 min per compound. We applied it to identify proteome-wide targets of covalent inhibitors to mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS)G12C and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). In addition, we created a resource of cysteine reactivity to 285 electrophiles in three human cell lines, which includes >20,000 cysteines from >6,000 proteins per line. The goal of proteome-wide profiling of cysteine reactivity across thousand-member libraries under several cellular contexts is now within reach. An improved workflow enables a 42-fold higher throughput of activity-based protein profiling."
https://openalex.org/W3119858057,"Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is a fundamental property of cancer; however, the origins of ITH remain poorly understood. We performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from 15 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), constructed a map of 45,048 PC cells, profiled the transcriptome states of tumor cell populations, incisively explored ITH of malignant PC cells and identified significant correlates with patient survival. The links between tumor cell lineage/state compositions and ITH were illustrated at transcriptomic, genotypic, molecular and phenotypic levels. We uncovered the diversity in tumor cell lineage/state compositions in PC specimens and defined it as a key contributor to ITH. Single-cell analysis of ITH classified PC specimens into two subtypes that were prognostically independent of clinical variables, and a 12-gene prognostic signature was derived and validated in multiple large-scale GAC cohorts. The prognostic signature appears fundamental to GAC carcinogenesis and progression and could be practical for patient stratification."
https://openalex.org/W3119714228,"Sustained pain is a major characteristic of clinical pain disorders, but it is difficult to assess in isolation from co-occurring cognitive and emotional features in patients. In this study, we developed a functional magnetic resonance imaging signature based on whole-brain functional connectivity that tracks experimentally induced tonic pain intensity and tested its sensitivity, specificity and generalizability to clinical pain across six studies (total n = 334). The signature displayed high sensitivity and specificity to tonic pain across three independent studies of orofacial tonic pain and aversive taste. It also predicted clinical pain severity and classified patients versus controls in two independent studies of clinical low back pain. Tonic and clinical pain showed similar network-level representations, particularly in somatomotor, frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. These patterns were distinct from representations of experimental phasic pain. This study identified a brain biomarker for sustained pain with high potential for clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W3119790133,"Breeding wheat with durable resistance to the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), a major threat to cereal production, is challenging due to the rapid evolution of pathogen virulence. Increased durability and broad-spectrum resistance can be achieved by introducing more than one resistance gene, but combining numerous unlinked genes by breeding is laborious. Here we generate polygenic Pgt resistance by introducing a transgene cassette of five resistance genes into bread wheat as a single locus and show that at least four of the five genes are functional. These wheat lines are resistant to aggressive and highly virulent Pgt isolates from around the world and show very high levels of resistance in the field. The simple monogenic inheritance of this multigene locus greatly simplifies its use in breeding. However, a new Pgt isolate with virulence to several genes at this locus suggests gene stacks will need strategic deployment to maintain their effectiveness. Combining fungal-resistance genes into a single cassette enables the generation of highly resistant wheat lines."
https://openalex.org/W3120617366,"De novo protein design has enabled the creation of new protein structures. However, the design of functional proteins has proved challenging, in part due to the difficulty of transplanting structurally complex functional sites to available protein structures. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to build de novo proteins tailored to accommodate structurally complex functional motifs. We applied the bottom-up strategy to successfully design five folds for four distinct binding motifs, including a bifunctionalized protein with two motifs. Crystal structures confirmed the atomic-level accuracy of the computational designs. These de novo proteins were functional as components of biosensors to monitor antibody responses and as orthogonal ligands to modulate synthetic signaling receptors in engineered mammalian cells. Our work demonstrates the potential of bottom-up approaches to accommodate complex structural motifs, which will be essential to endow de novo proteins with elaborate biochemical functions, such as molecular recognition or catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W3118836968,"Background Multiple studies have highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 and its particular effects on vulnerable sub-populations. Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. Methods The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9–12 of a national lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. Results There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. Conclusion Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit."

https://openalex.org/W3119556873,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness that spreads rapidly through human-to-human transmission. On March 5, the government of Palestine declared a state of emergency in order to curb the spread of the virus, a declaration that it extended for a fifth time on July 5 th . The degree to which a population complies with corresponding safety measures is surely affected by the people’s knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the disease. To explore this hypothesis, we gathered data from 1,731 Palestinians between April 19 th and May 1 st , 2020 through a KAP questionnaire. The participant pool represented a stratified sample of Palestinians living across a number of governorates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with 36.5% from Gaza and (63.5%) from the West Bank. Gender was almost equally distributed within the sample with (51%) men respondents and (49%) women respondent. The questionnaire included 17 questions about participants’ knowledge and awareness of COVID–19, 17 questions regarding the safety measures they had taken in the wake of the outbreak and 3 questions asking them to assess the efficacy of the government’s response to the pandemic. Our data shows that 79% of the respondents have good awareness about transmission of the virus, 55.6% were knowledgeable of the symptoms exhibited by an infected individual, 81% were aware of the preventative measures and 82% demonstrated awareness of the risk groups. Most participants complied with preventative measures (77%) and 62% the study participants agreed that stricter measures have to be enforced by the government to limit the spread of the virus. Our study revealed that younger participants and people with higher educational level demonstrated more awareness of the virus. Also, Women were reported to be more aware of preventative measures and to have complied more with good practices. We report that residents of the West Bank have complied more with the right practices when compared to residents of Gaza. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that health education programs aimed at improving the public’s understanding of COVID-19 are important in helping the population maintain appropriate practices and should be target people with lower educational level, and that findings such as those discussed in this report may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3119175664,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) relay information across cell membranes through conformational coupling between the ligand-binding domain and cytoplasmic signaling domain. In dimeric class C GPCRs, the mechanism of this process, which involves propagation of local ligand-induced conformational changes over 12 nm through three distinct structural domains, is unknown. Here, we used single-molecule FRET and live-cell imaging and found that metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) interconverts between four conformational states, two of which were previously unknown, and activation proceeds through the conformational selection mechanism. Furthermore, the conformation of the ligand-binding domains and downstream domains are weakly coupled. We show that the intermediate states act as conformational checkpoints for activation and control allosteric modulation of signaling. Our results demonstrate a mechanism for activation of mGluRs where ligand binding controls the proximity of signaling domains, analogous to some receptor kinases. This design principle may be generalizable to other biological allosteric sensors."
https://openalex.org/W3120299806,"Cellular plasticity describes the ability of cells to transition from one set of phenotypes to another. In melanoma, transient fluctuations in the molecular state of tumor cells mark the formation of rare cells primed to survive BRAF inhibition and reprogram into a stably drug-resistant fate. However, the biological processes governing cellular priming remain unknown. We used CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens to identify genes that affect cell fate decisions by altering cellular plasticity. We found that many factors can independently affect cellular priming and fate decisions. We discovered a new plasticity-based mode of increasing resistance to BRAF inhibition that pushes cells towards a more differentiated state. Manipulating cellular plasticity through inhibition of DOT1L before the addition of the BRAF inhibitor resulted in more therapy resistance than concurrent administration. Our results indicate that modulating cellular plasticity can alter cell fate decisions and may prove useful for treating drug resistance in other cancers. A genetic screen designed to capture modulators of single-cell state variability identifies a new mode of altering resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma that pushes cells toward a more differentiated state. Modulating cellular plasticity may provide a new avenue to overcome drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W3120550960,"Background Despite the joy of parenting, the burden of daily caregiving for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can be overwhelming and constant. Parents can expect to provide enduring care for their children with ASD. Given that the majority of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) remain in their family homes well into adulthood, often the need for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) is placed on parents. Providing ongoing support to adult children who have difficulty with completing ADLs can increase parental caregiving demands. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the ability of adults with ASD to perform ADLs with parental perceptions of caregiver burden. Methods Quantitative analysis of cross-sectional multi-state data gathered electronically using Qualtrics from 320 aging parents of adults with ASD was conducted. Regression models were fit to examine the association of ADL challenges with total caregiver burden and its four domains (emotional, financial, time dependence, and developmental). Results Parental perceptions of caregiver burden decreased, particularly time dependence and developmental burden, when adult children were less dependent in ADLs, even after adjusting for parental health and behavioral challenges. Conclusions Findings support the need for family-centered interventions to improve the capacity of adults with ASD to perform ADLs independently."
https://openalex.org/W3118755735,"The objective of this study was to compare acute effects of prolonged sitting, prolonged standing and sitting interrupted with regular activity breaks on vascular function and postprandial glucose metabolism. In a randomized cross-over trial, 18 adults completed: 1. Prolonged Sitting; 2. Prolonged Standing and 3. Sitting with 2-min walking (5 km/h, 10% incline) every 30 min (Regular Activity Breaks). Flow mediated dilation (FMD) was measured in the popliteal artery at baseline and 6 h. Popliteal artery hemodynamics, and postprandial plasma glucose and insulin were measured over 6 h. Neither raw nor allometrically-scaled FMD showed an intervention effect (p = 0.285 and 0.159 respectively). Compared to Prolonged Sitting, Regular Activity Breaks increased blood flow (overall effect of intervention p&lt;0.001; difference = 80%; 95% CI 34 to 125%; p = 0.001) and net shear rate (overall effect of intervention p&lt;0.001; difference = 72%; 95% CI 30 to 114%; p = 0.001) at 60 min. These differences were then maintained for the entire 6 h. Prolonged Standing increased blood flow at 60 min only (overall effect of intervention p&lt;0.001; difference = 62%; 95% CI 28 to 97%; p = 0.001). Regular Activity Breaks decreased insulin incremental area under the curve (iAUC) when compared to both Prolonged Sitting (overall effect of intervention P = 0.001; difference = 28%; 95% CI 14 to 38%; p&lt;0.01) and Prolonged Standing (difference = 19%; 95% CI 4 to 32%, p = 0.015). There was no intervention effect on glucose iAUC or total AUC (p = 0.254 and 0.450, respectively). In normal-weight participants, Regular Activity Breaks induce increases in blood flow, shear stress and improvements in postprandial metabolism that are associated with beneficial adaptations. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour messages should perhaps focus more on the importance of frequent movement rather than simply replacing sitting with standing."

https://openalex.org/W3118888028,"Introduction While chest x-rays (CXRs) represent a cost-effective imaging modality for developing countries like Pakistan, their utility for the prognostication of COVID-19 has been minimally explored. Thus, we describe the frequency and distribution of CXR findings, and their association with clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods All adult (≥ 18 years) patients presenting between 28 th February-31 st May to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, who were COVID-19 positive on RT-PCR with CXR done on presentation, were included. A CXR Severity Score (CXR-SS) of 0–8 was used to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection on CXR, with a score of 0 being negative and 1–8 being positive. The patients’ initial CXR-SS and their highest CXR-SS over the hospital course were used for analysis, with cut-offs of 0–4 and 5–8 being used to assess association with clinical outcomes. Results A total of 150 patients, with 76.7% males and mean age 56.1 years, were included in this study. Initial CXR was positive in 80% of patients, and 30.7% of patients had an initial CXR-SS between 5–8. The mortality rate was 16.7% and 30.6% patients underwent ICU admission with intubation (ICU-Int). On multivariable analysis, initial CXR-SS (1.355 [1.136–1.616]) and highest CXR-SS (1.390 [1.143–1.690]) were predictors of ICU-Int, and ICU-Int was independently associated with both initial CXR-SS 5–8 (2.532 [1.109–5.782]) and highest CXR-SS 5–8 (3.386 [1.405–8.159]). Lastly, age (1.060 [1.009–1.113]), initial CXR-SS (1.278 [1.010–1.617]) and ICU-Int (5.047 [1.731–14.710]), were found to be independent predictors of mortality in our patients. Conclusion In a resource-constrained country like Pakistan, CXRs may have valuable prognostic utility in predicting ICU admission and mortality. Additional research with larger patient samples is needed to further explore the association of CXR findings with clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3120848577,"In the twenty-first century, ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded their ranges and impact across the US. With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program. Here, we present niche models produced through citizen science tick collections over two years. Despite obvious limitations with citizen science collections, the models are consistent with previously-predicted species ranges in California that utilized more than thirty years of traditional surveillance data. Additionally, citizen science allows for an expanded understanding of I . pacificus distribution in Oregon and Washington. With the potential for rapid environmental changes instigated by a burgeoning human population and rapid climate change, the development of tools, concepts, and methodologies that provide rapid, current, and accurate assessment of important ecological qualities will be invaluable for monitoring and predicting disease across time and space."
https://openalex.org/W3118920626,"Although aquatic macroinvertebrates and freshwater fishes are important indicators for freshwater quality assessments, the morphological identification to species-level is often impossible and thus especially in many invertebrate taxa not mandatory during Water Framework Directive monitoring, a pragmatism that potentially leads to information loss. Here, we focus on the freshwater fauna of the River Sieg (Germany) to test congruence and additional value in taxa detection and taxonomic resolution of DNA barcoding vs. morphology-based identification in monitoring routines. Prior generated morphological identifications of juvenile fishes and aquatic macroinvertebrates were directly compared to species assignments using the identification engine of the Barcode of Life Data System. In 18% of the invertebrates morphology allowed only assignments to higher systematic entities, but DNA barcoding lead to species-level assignment. Dissimilarities between the two approaches occurred in 7% of the invertebrates and in 1% of the fishes. The 18 fish species were assigned to 20 molecular barcode index numbers, the 104 aquatic invertebrate taxa to 113 molecular entities. Although the cost-benefit analysis of both methods showed that DNA barcoding is still more expensive (5.30–8.60€ per sample) and time consuming (12.5h), the results emphasize the potential to increase taxonomic resolution and gain a more complete profile of biodiversity, especially in invertebrates. The provided reference DNA barcodes help building the foundation for metabarcoding approaches, which provide faster sample processing and more cost-efficient ecological status determination."
https://openalex.org/W3119359267,"Memory impairment has been associated with chronic Chagas disease (CD), a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . In degenerative diseases, memory loss has been associated with increased oxidative stress, revealed as enhanced lipid peroxidation, in the cerebral cortex. Benznidazole (Bz), a trypanocidal drug efficient to reduce blood parasite load in the acute and chronic phases of infection, showed controversial effects on heart disease progression, the main clinical manifestation of CD. Here, we evaluated whether C57BL/6 mice infected with the Colombian type I T . cruzi strain present memory deficit assessed by (i) the novel object recognition task, (ii) the open field test and (iii) the aversive shock evoked test, at 120 days post infection (dpi). Next, we tested the effects of Bz therapy (25mg/Kg/day, for 30 consecutive days) on memory evocation, and tried to establish a relation between memory loss, parasite load and oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS). At 120 dpi, T . cruzi -infected mice showed memory impairment, compared with age-matched non-infected controls. Bz therapy (from 120 to 150 dpi) hampered the progression of habituation and aversive memory loss and, moreover, reversed memory impairment in object recognition. In vehicle-administered infected mice, neuroinflammation was absent albeit rare perivascular mononuclear cells were found in meninges and choroid plexus. Bz therapy abrogated the infiltration of the CNS by inflammatory cells, and reduced parasite load in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. At 120 and 150 dpi, lipid peroxidation was increased in the hippocampus and cortex tissue extracts. Notably, Bz therapy reduced levels of lipid peroxidation in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, in experimental chronic T . cruzi infection Bz therapy improved memory loss, in association with reduction of parasite load and oxidative stress in the CNS, providing a new perspective to improve the quality of life of Chagas disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W3119077243,"Introduction In a meta-analysis of international studies, 17% of admitted patients in psychiatric hospitals had exhibited violent behavior toward others. Reported data from studies in Germany were considerably lower until recent years. However, studies examining only single hospitals, as well as the quality of the data itself, have raised questions as to the validity of these findings. Indeed, a debate currently exists as to whether there has, in fact, been an increase of violent incidents in German mental institutions. Methods In a group of 10 hospitals serving about half the population of the Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg with 11 million inhabitants, the Staff Observation Aggression Scale–Revised (SOAS-R) was introduced into patients’ electronic charts as part of routine documentation. Data recording was strongly supported by staff councils and unions. A completed data set is now available for the year 2019. For one hospital, data are available since 2006. Due to some doubts with respect to fully covering self-directed aggression, we restricted the analysis to aggression toward others and toward objects. Results In 2019, 17,599 aggressive incidents were recorded in 64,367 admissions (1,660 staying forensic psychiatric inpatients included). 5,084 (7.90%) of the admitted cases showed aggressive behavior toward others. Variation between hospitals was low to modest (SD = 1.50). The mean SOAS-R score was 11.8 (SD between hospitals 1.20%). 23% of the incidents resulted in bodily harm. The percentage of patients showing violent behavior was highest among patients with organic disorders (ICD-10 F0) and lowest among patients with addictive or affective disorders (F1, F3, F4). Forensic psychiatry had the highest proportion of cases with aggressive behavior (20.54%), but the number of incidents per bed was lower than in general adult psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry (indicating a lower risk for staff). In the hospital with longer-term recordings available, an increase could be observed since 2010, with considerable variation between years. Conclusions This is the most robust estimate of the frequency of violent incidents in German psychiatric hospitals thus far. The incidence is about half of what has been reported internationally, probably due to sample selection bias in previous studies and a relatively high number of hospital beds in Germany. Available data suggest an increase of violent incidents over the last ten years; however, it is unclear to which extent this is due to increased reporting."

Monologic oral production was measured using the same narrative picture description task in pre- and post-tests. The learners followed the “Imitation of English Monologues” game 30 minutes each time, twice a week, for 20 weeks. The oral production was measured using six indices: the mean words per T-unit and lexical density (i.e., complexity), the mean repairs and errors per 100 words (i.e., accuracy), speech rate and the mean length of pauses (i.e., fluency). The paired sample t -tests showed that the participants produced more complex monologic speech, had significantly fewer errors, and increased speech rate, but the mean repairs and mean length of pauses remained unchanged. The unchanged repairs and pauses could be possibly due to the non-proceduralized linguistic knowledge in oral production, which may require a more extended period of treatment. Our study showed positive effects of using a digital game-based language learning mobile application on the improvement of complexity, accuracy, and fluency of English language learners in China’ monologic oral production with varying effects."

https://openalex.org/W3120042123,"A network of myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal in the corpus of the stomach serves as its “pacemaker”, continuously generating a ca 0.05 Hz electrical slow wave, which is transmitted to the brain chiefly by vagal afferents. A recent study combining resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with concurrent surface electrogastrography (EGG), with cutaneous electrodes placed on the epigastrium, found 12 brain regions with activity that was significantly phase-locked with this gastric basal electrical rhythm. Therefore, we asked whether fluctuations in brain resting state networks (RSNs), estimated using a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach, might be synchronized with the stomach. In the present study, in order to determine whether any RSNs are phase-locked with the gastric rhythm, an individual participant underwent 22 scanning sessions; in each, two 15-minute runs of concurrent EGG and rsfMRI data were acquired. EGG data from three sessions had weak gastric signals and were excluded; the other 19 sessions yielded a total of 9.5 hours of data. The rsfMRI data were analyzed using group ICA; RSN time courses were estimated; for each run, the phase-locking value (PLV) was computed between each RSN and the gastric signal. To assess statistical significance, PLVs from all pairs of “mismatched” data (EGG and rsfMRI data acquired on different days) were used as surrogate data to generate a null distribution for each RSN. Of a total of 18 RSNs, three were found to be significantly phase-locked with the basal gastric rhythm, namely, a cerebellar network, a dorsal somatosensory-motor network, and a default mode network. Disruptions to the gut-brain axis, which sustains interoceptive feedback between the central nervous system and the viscera, are thought to be involved in various disorders; manifestation of the infra-slow rhythm of the stomach in brain rsfMRI data could be useful for studies in clinical populations."
https://openalex.org/W3120736262,"The obstacle to optimal utilization of biogas technology is poor understanding of biogas microbiomes diversities over a wide geographical coverage. We performed random shotgun sequencing on twelve environmental samples. Randomized complete block design was utilized to assign the twelve treatments to four blocks, within eastern and central regions of Kenya. We obtained 42 million paired-end reads that were annotated against sixteen reference databases using two ENVO ontologies, prior to β-diversity studies. We identified 37 phyla, 65 classes and 132 orders. Bacteria dominated and comprised 28 phyla, 42 classes and 92 orders, conveying substrate’s versatility in the treatments. Though, Fungi and Archaea comprised 5 phyla, the Fungi were richer; suggesting the importance of hydrolysis and fermentation in biogas production. High β-diversity within the taxa was largely linked to communities’ metabolic capabilities. Clostridiales and Bacteroidales , the most prevalent guilds, metabolize organic macromolecules. The identified Cytophagales , Alteromonadales , Flavobacteriales , Fusobacteriales , Deferribacterales , Elusimicrobiales , Chlamydiales , Synergistales to mention but few, also catabolize macromolecules into smaller substrates to conserve energy. Furthermore, δ-Proteobacteria , Gloeobacteria and Clostridia affiliates syntrophically regulate P H2 and reduce metal to provide reducing equivalents. Methanomicrobiales and other Methanomicrobia species were the most prevalence Archaea , converting formate, CO 2(g) , acetate and methylated substrates into CH 4(g) . Thermococci , Thermoplasmata and Thermoprotei were among the sulfur and other metal reducing Archaea that contributed to redox balancing and other metabolism within treatments. Eukaryotes, mainly fungi were the least abundant guild, comprising largely Ascomycota and Basidiomycota species. Chytridiomycetes , Blastocladiomycetes and Mortierellomycetes were among the rare species, suggesting their metabolic and substrates limitations. Generally, we observed that environmental and treatment perturbations influenced communities’ abundance, β-diversity and reactor performance largely through stochastic effect. Understanding diversity of biogas microbiomes over wide environmental variables and its’ productivity provided insights into better management strategies that ameliorate biochemical limitations to effective biogas production."
https://openalex.org/W3120769257,"Here we look into the spread of aerosols indoors that may potentially carry viruses. Many viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2, are known to spread via airborne and air-dust pathways. From the literature data and our research on the propagation of fine aerosols, we simulate herein the carryover of viral aerosols in indoor air. We demonstrate that a lot of fine droplets released from an infected person’s coughing, sneezing, or talking propagate very fast and for large distances indoors, as well as bend around obstacles, lift up and down over staircases, and so on. This study suggests equations to evaluate the concentration of those droplets, depending on time and distance from the source of infection. Estimates are given for the safe distance to the source of infection, and available methods for neutralizing viral aerosols indoors are considered."
https://openalex.org/W3118496208,"Applying computer vision techniques to distinguish between spontaneous and posed smiles is an active research topic of affective computing. Although there have been many works published addressing this problem and a couple of excellent benchmark databases created, the existing state-of-the-art approaches do not exploit the action units defined within the Facial Action Coding System that has become a standard in facial expression analysis. In this work, we explore the possibilities of extracting discriminative features directly from the dynamics of facial action units to differentiate between genuine and posed smiles. We report the results of our experimental study which shows that the proposed features offer competitive performance to those based on facial landmark analysis and on textural descriptors extracted from spatial-temporal blocks. We make these features publicly available for the UvA-NEMO and BBC databases, which will allow other researchers to further improve the classification scores, while preserving the interpretation capabilities attributed to the use of facial action units. Moreover, we have developed a new technique for identifying the smile phases, which is robust against the noise and allows for continuous analysis of facial videos."
https://openalex.org/W3118941520,"Background Irrational prescription of drugs can lead to high cost of treatment thus limiting access to essential medicines. We assessed the affordability and appropriateness of prescriptions written for diabetic patients in Eastern Uganda. Methods We collected secondary data from the health management information system registers of patients who attended the outpatient medical clinic at Mbale regional referral hospital from January 2019 to December 2019. The average cost of the prescriptions was calculated and adjusted odds ratios for predictors for unaffordability estimated using logistic regression. Computed scores for indicators of rational drug prescription were used to assess the extent of rational prescribing. Results The median cost per prescription was USD 11.34 (IQR 8.1, 20.2). Majority of the diabetic patients (n = 2462; 94.3%, 95% CI: 93.3–95.1%) could not afford the prescribed drugs. Predictors for unaffordability were if a prescription contained: ≥ 4 medicines (AOR = 12.45; 95% CI: 3.9–39.7); an injectable (AOR = 5.47; 95%CI: 1.47–20.32) and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus with other comorbidities (AOR = 3.36; 95%CI: 1.95–5.78). Having no antidiabetic drug prescribed was protective for non-affordability (AOR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.24–0.61). The average number of drugs per prescription was 2.8. The percentage prescription of drugs by generic name and from the essential medicine and health supplies list of Uganda were (6160/7461; 82.6%, 96% CI: 81.7%-83.4%) and (6092/7461; 81.7%, 95% CI: 80.8%-82.5%) respectively against WHO standard of 100%. Conclusion The majority of diabetic patients (94.3%) in Eastern Uganda cannot afford to buy prescribed medicines. The government should therefore ensure that essential medicines are readily accessible in public health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3120647251,"Zika virus (ZIKV) has been detected in blood, urine, semen, cerebral spinal fluid, saliva, amniotic fluid, and breast milk. In most ZIKV infected individuals, the virus is detected in the blood to one week after the onset of symptoms and has been found to persist longer in urine and semen. To better understand virus dynamics, a prospective cohort study was conducted in Brazil to assess the presence and duration of ZIKV and related markers (viral RNA, antibodies, T cell response, and innate immunity) in blood, semen, saliva, urine, vaginal secretions/menstrual blood, rectal swab and sweat. The objective of the current manuscript is to describe the cohort, including an overview of the collected data and a description of the baseline characteristics of the participants. Men and women ≥ 18 years with acute illness and their symptomatic and asymptomatic household contacts with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test for ZIKV in blood and/or urine were included. All participants were followed up for 12 months. From July 2017 to June 2019, a total of 786 participants (284 men, 502 women) were screened. Of these, 260 (33.1%) were enrolled in the study; index cases: 64 men (24.6%), 162 (62.3%) women; household contacts: 12 men (4.6%), 22 (8.5%) women. There was a statistically significant difference in age and sex between enrolled and not enrolled participants (p<0.005). Baseline sociodemographic and medical data were collected at enrollment from all participants. The median and interquartile range (IQR) age was 35 (IQR; 25.3, 43) for men and 36.5 years (IQR; 28, 47) for women. Following rash, which was one of the inclusion criteria for index cases, the most reported symptoms in the enrollment visit since the onset of the disease were fever, itching, arthralgia with or without edema, non-purulent conjunctivitis, headache, and myalgia. Ten hospitalizations were reported by eight patients (two patients were hospitalized twice) during follow up, after a median of 108 days following symptom onset (range 7 to 266 days) and with a median of 1.5 days (range 1 to 20 days) of hospital stay. A total of 4,137 visits were performed, 223 (85.8%) participants have attended all visits and 37 (14.2%) patients were discontinued."
https://openalex.org/W3119946439,"This study assessed the efficiency of Genomic selection (GS) or genome‐wide selection (GWS), based on Regularized Quantile Regression (RQR), in the selection of genotypes to breed autogamous plant populations with oligogenic traits. To this end, simulated data of an F 2 population were used, with traits with different heritability levels (0.10, 0.20 and 0.40), controlled by four genes. The generations were advanced (up to F 6 ) at two selection intensities (10% and 20%). The genomic genetic value was computed by RQR for different quantiles (0.10, 0.50 and 0.90), and by the traditional GWS methods, specifically RR-BLUP and BLASSO. A second objective was to find the statistical methodology that allows the fastest fixation of favorable alleles. In general, the results of the RQR model were better than or equal to those of traditional GWS methodologies, achieving the fixation of favorable alleles in most of the evaluated scenarios. At a heritability level of 0.40 and a selection intensity of 10%, RQR (0.50) was the only methodology that fixed the alleles quickly, i.e., in the fourth generation. Thus, it was concluded that the application of RQR in plant breeding, to simulated autogamous plant populations with oligogenic traits, could reduce time and consequently costs, due to the reduction of selfing generations to fix alleles in the evaluated scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3120550193,"The application of reclaimed asphalt pavement has been widely encouraged due to its significant economic and environmental benefits. However, it is necessary to add rejuvenators to ensure its performance. Currently, bio-oil-based regenerants have attracted attention owing to their advantages of renewability and cost savings. The purpose of this paper is to study the use of recycled vegetable oil waste (R-oil) and recycled polyethylene particles for the regeneration and modification of aged asphalt. Physical, rheological, and chemical tests were used to figure out their influence on the pavement performance of aged asphalt. According to the physical test indices (penetration, softening point, and ductility), the performance of the rejuvenated asphalt was better than that of virgin asphalt. The workability and low-temperature performance of the rejuvenated asphalt were basically the same as those of virgin asphalt, and its fatigue and high-temperature performance were better. Infrared spectroscopy showed that R-oil diluted the high-polarity sulfoxide base of aged asphalt. Gel permeation chromatography showed that its molecular weight dispersion was better than that of aged asphalt. Therefore, R-oil and polyethylene can improve the pavement performance and chemical properties of aged asphalt."
https://openalex.org/W3119702808,"Constraints related to sample preparation are some of the primary obstacles to widespread deployment of molecular diagnostics for rapid detection of trace quantities (≤10 3 CFU/mL) of food-borne pathogens. In this research, we report a sample preparation method using a novel handheld electroflotation system to concentrate and recover dilute quantities (10 2 −10 3 CFU/mL) of Escherichia coli (E . coli) 25922 in artificially contaminated samples for reliable, rapid detection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). To protect suspended cells from shear stresses at bubble surfaces, a non-ionic surfactant (Pluronic-F68) and flocculant (chitosan oligosaccharide) were used to aggregate cells and reduce their surface hydrophobicity. Effective conditions for recovery were determined through multifactorial experiments including various concentrations of Pluronic-F68 (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 g L -1 ), chitosan oligosaccharide (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 g L -1 ), bacteria (10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 CFU/mL E . coli 25922), recovery times (10, 15 and 20 minutes), and degrees of turbulent gas flux (“high” and “low”). The automated electroflotation system was capable of concentrating effectively all of the bacteria from a large sample (380 mL 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer containing 10 2 CFU/mL E . coli ) into a 1 mL recovered fraction in less than 30 minutes. This enabled detection of bacterial contaminants within 2 hours of collecting the sample, without a specialized laboratory facility or traditional enrichment methods, with at least a 2–3 order of magnitude improvement in detection limit compared to direct assay with LAMP."
https://openalex.org/W3119935043,"Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is the most prevalent endocrine disorder of older equids. To date, key research areas likely to have the greatest impact on equine health have not been identified. In human medicine, public and patient involvement is widely used to inform research agendas. This study aimed to engage with veterinary surgeons and horse owners to identify evidence gaps (‘uncertainties’) and prioritise these into a list of the 10 most important PPID research questions. The James Lind Alliance (JLA) Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) Framework was adapted. Questions about the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of PPID were gathered via an online survey targeting veterinary surgeons and horse owners with experience of PPID. Thematic analysis was used to form a longlist of collated indicative research questions (CIRQs), defined by the JLA as true ‘evidence uncertainties’ when not answered by a published, clinically relevant, up-to-date systematic review. In an interim prioritisation survey, questions were ranked by weighted scores creating a shortlist of 25 that were taken forward to the PSP workshop, where participants reached a consensus on the top 10. Useable responses containing ≥1 question were received from 524 respondents (92.6% owners, n = 485; 7.4% veterinary surgeons, n = 39). After screening for relevance, 1,260 individual questions were included in thematic analysis, resulting in 47 CIRQs. Interim prioritisation votes for the CIRQs were received from 360 respondents. The top 10 questions prioritised at the PSP workshop focused on long-term prognosis, diagnostic accuracy, efficacy of pergolide treatment, alternative treatment/management strategies and potential treatment options for poor responders to pergolide. The quantity of questions generated indicates an extensive number of uncertainties regarding the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of PPID. The top 10 research questions will help to inform key areas for evidence synthesis and knowledge translation, and to direct future research into areas most important to end users involved in caring for and treating animals with PPID."
https://openalex.org/W3118373759,"Background This study aimed to establish a traumatic hemorrhagic shock (THS) model in swine and examine pathophysiological characteristics in a dry-heat environment. Methods Forty domestic Landrace piglets were randomly assigned to four study groups: normal temperature non-shock (NS), normal temperature THS (NTHS), desert dry-heat non-shock (DS), and desert dry-hot THS (DTHS) groups. The groups were exposed to either normal temperature (25°C) or dry heat (40.5°C) for 3 h. To induce THS, anesthetized piglets in the NTHS and DTHS groups were subjected to liver trauma and hypovolemic shock until death, and piglets in the NS and DS groups were euthanized at 11 h and 4 h, respectively. Body temperature, blood gas, cytokine production, and organ function were assessed before and after environmental exposure at 0 h and at every 30 min after shock to death. Hemodynamics was measured post exposure and post-shock at 0 h and at every 30 min after shock to death. Results Survival, body temperature, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and cardiac output were significantly different for traumatic hemorrhagic shock in the dry-heat groups compared to those in the normal temperature groups. Lactic acid and IL-6 had a marked increase at 0.5 h, followed by a progressive and rapid increase in the DTHS group. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the combined action of a dry-heat environment and THS leads to higher oxygen metabolism, poorer hemodynamic stability, and earlier and more severe inflammatory response with higher mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3119337378,"A quantitative analysis of the panel data of 21 districts in Chongqing City in the Three Gorges Reservoir region from 1998 to 2015 was conducted to determine the influence of China’s focused poverty reduction policy in terms of causal inference. Specifically, the effects of this policy at the initial phase of execution through break-point regression; the impacts of this policy during the implementation period by using an instrumental variable panel regression; and comparative studies of the policy impacts by using the generalized synthetic control method. The outcomes showed that: (1) China’s state policy for specific poverty mitigation has a substantial impact on reducing poverty, which has been observed from the start of the enactment, namely, peasants' net income per capita from 2011 to 2013 increased by 13.9%, as compared to that during 2008–2010. Meanwhile, the net earnings of each farmer grew by 22% from 2011 to 2015 throughout the implementation phase of the policy, as opposed to that in 1998–2010. (2) Economic behavior in the marketplace and agricultural output figure of impoverished regions has significantly improved farmers' individual net income. (3) The comparative study further proves that the poverty mitigation policy has the effect of reducing poverty. Based on these findings, it is proposed that China should increase investment to consolidate its poverty alleviation policy in the most poverty-stricken areas, activate rural markets and develop agricultural production at the local level to accelerate poverty reduction in the region. The method of causal inference was utilized as an innovative method to study China’s focused poverty reduction policy for both immediate and permanent effects. It is the first time to use the generalized integrated control method, which is a causal inference frontier method, to further verify the effectiveness of poverty reduction policies."
https://openalex.org/W3046236677,"Distributed Systems architectures are becoming the standard computational model for processing and transportation of information, especially for Cloud Computing environments. The increase in demand for application processing and data management from enterprise and end-user workloads continues to move from a single-node client-server architecture to a distributed multitier design where data processing and transmission are segregated. Software development must considerer the orchestration required to provision its core components in order to deploy the services efficiently in many independent, loosely coupled—physically and virtually interconnected—data centers spread geographically, across the globe. This network routing challenge can be modeled as a variation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm for optimum route selection using Algorithmic Information Theory. The Kelly criterion for a Shannon-Bernoulli process is used to generate a reliable quantitative algorithm to find a near optimal solution tour. The algorithm is then verified by comparing the results with benchmark heuristic solutions in 3 test cases. A statistical analysis is designed to measure the significance of the results between the algorithms and the entropy function can be derived from the distribution. The tested results shown an improvement in the solution quality by producing routes with smaller length and time requirements. The quality of the results proves the flexibility of the proposed algorithm for problems with different complexities without relying in nature-inspired models such as Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony, Cross Entropy, Neural Networks, 2opt and Simulated Annealing. The proposed algorithm can be used by applications to deploy services across large cluster of nodes by making better decision in the route design. The findings in this paper unifies critical areas in Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics that many researchers have not explored and provided a new interpretation that advances the understanding of the role of entropy in decision problems encoded in Turing Machines."
https://openalex.org/W3119022627,"Sensory stimuli endow animals with the ability to generate an internal representation. This representation can be maintained for a certain duration in the absence of previously elicited inputs. The reliance on an internal representation rather than purely on the basis of external stimuli is a hallmark feature of higher-order functions such as working memory. Patterns of neural activity produced in response to sensory inputs can continue long after the disappearance of previous inputs. Experimental and theoretical studies have largely invested in understanding how animals faithfully maintain sensory representations during ongoing reverberations of neural activity. However, these studies have focused on preassigned protocols of stimulus presentation, leaving out by default the possibility of exploring how the content of working memory interacts with ongoing input streams. Here, we study working memory using a network of spiking neurons with dynamic synapses subject to short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. The formal model is embodied in a physical robot as a companion approach under which neuronal activity is directly linked to motor output. The artificial agent is used as a methodological tool for studying the formation of working memory capacity. To this end, we devise a keyboard listening framework to delineate the context under which working memory content is (1) refined, (2) overwritten or (3) resisted by ongoing new input streams. Ultimately, this study takes a neurorobotic perspective to resurface the long-standing implication of working memory in flexible cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3120235862,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common genetic disorder that results in a proliferating and enlarging cyst and ultimately leads to loss of kidney function. Because an enlarged cyst is a primary factor for limited kidney function, the large cyst is surgically removed by laparoscopic deroofing or sclerosant. This a relatively nascent treatment method entails complications and sometimes fail due to the cyst fluid refilling and infection. This study proposes using a more stable and effective polidocanol foam with glycerol and Rose Bengal (GRP form) to prevent cyst regeneration and irritation, which is caused by the required body movement during the treatment. Specifically, the foam retention time and viscosity were increased by adding glycerol up to 10% (w/v). The GRP form inhibited cellular proliferation and disrupted cellular junctions, e-cadherin, and cyst formation, demonstrated by the LDH, Live and Dead, and re-plating culture assays. The GRP foam was shown to be a safe and effective treatment as a commercial grade polidocanol foam form by an in vivo study in which subcutaneously injected mice injected with commercial 3% polidocanol, and the GRP foam showed no difference in inflammation. Thus, this study provides an advanced polidocanol form by adding glycerol and Rose-Bengal to help existing sclerotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3120505292,"Fluoride pollution in water has attracted widespread concern worldwide. In this study, an Artemia eggshell-zirconium (Aes-Z) nanocomposite has been used for fluoride removal. Material characterization results showed that nano-ZrO 2 was immobilized on the inner surface of the Artemia eggshell, and there was no pore blockage on the composite material. Various parameters influencing on the fluoride removal, including treatment time, composite dosage, pH, initial fluoride concentration, and other anions, were analyzed. The removal efficiency of the composite material was better than that of the single zirconia material. The removal percentage of fluoride reached 93% in 30 min with an initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg/L and a nanocomposite dosage of 8.0 g/L. The composite material had a high removal efficiency for fluoride in the pH region 4.0–10.0. The adsorption of fluoride was not influenced by the common anions (e.g., Cl - , SO 4 2- , and NO 3 - ) in water. The regeneration revealed that the Aes-Z composite material could be reused and remove fluoride effectively in four cycles. The pseudo-second-order rate model adequately represented the adsorption kinetics of the Aes-Z composite material. A possible, defluoridation mechanism of the Aes-Z composite material was also proposed. This study demonstrates that Aes-Z is a promising adsorbent material for fluoride removal."
https://openalex.org/W3120682942,"Background The Columbia classification is widely used for diagnosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In practice, we occasionally encounter segmental glomerular lesions unclassified as Columbia classification. We analyzed the clinical implication of unclassified segmental lesions comparing with Columbia-classified FSGS. Methods A retrospective cohort study from 13 local hospitals in Japan. From 172 biopsy cases diagnosed with FSGS or minimal change disease (MCD)/FSGS spectrum with unclassified segmental lesions, adult patients with nephrotic syndrome who received immunosuppressive therapies were included. The cases are classified by pathology, i.e., typical FSGS lesions sufficiently classified into subgroups of Columbia classification: collapsing (COL), tip (TIP), cellular (CEL), perihilar (PH), and not otherwise specified (NOS), and unclassified by the Columbia classification into three subgroups: “endothelial damage,”; “simple attachment,”; and “minor cellular lesion,”. The response to immunosuppressive treatment and 30% decline of eGFR were compared. Results Among 48 eligible cases, all were Japanese, 34 were typical FSGS; 13 TIP, 15 CEL, 6 NOS, and no COL or PH cases. Fourteen were unclassified cases: endothelial damage (n = 6), simple attachment (n = 5), and minor cellular lesion (n = 3). The median age of overall patients was 60 years old and the median of eGFR and urinary protein creatinine ratio was 51.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 and 7.35, respectively. They received similar therapeutic regimen. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant difference in treatment response between typical FSGS and unclassified cases. Evaluating among the subgroups, endothelial damage, simple attachment and minor cellular lesion showed similar treatment response to TIP or CEL. No significant difference was also observed in the 30% decline of eGFR. Conclusions Japanese adult patients with nephrotic syndrome showing unclassified segmental lesions as Columbia classification may be equivalent clinical impact as Columbia classification of FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W3118384108,"Background The 2013–2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak remains the largest on record, resulting in the highest mortality and widest geographic spread experienced in Africa. Ghana, like many other African nations, began screening travelers at all entry points into the country to enhance disease surveillance and response. This study aimed to assess the challenges of screening travelers for EVD at border entry in northern Ghana. Design and methods This was an observational study using epidemiological weekly reports (Oct 2014-Mar 2015) of travelers entering Ghana in the Upper East Region (UER) and qualitative interviews with 12 key informants (7 port health officers and 5 district directors of health) in the UER. We recorded the number of travelers screened, their country of origin, and the number of suspected EVD cases from paper-based weekly epidemiological reports at the border entry. We collected qualitative data using an interview guide with a particular focus on the core and support functions (e.g. detection, reporting, feedback, etc.) of the World Health Organization’s Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system. Quantitative data was analyzed based on travelers screened and disaggregated by the three most affected countries. We used inductive approach to analyze the qualitative data and produced themes on knowledge and challenges of EVD screening. Results A total of 41,633 travelers were screened, and only 1 was detained as a suspected case of EVD. This potential case was eventually ruled out via blood test. All but 52 of the screened travelers were from Ghana and its contiguous neighbors, Burkina Faso and Togo. The remaining 52 were from the four countries most affected by EVD (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali). Challenges to effective border screening included: inadequate personal protective equipment and supplies, insufficient space or isolation rooms and delays at the border crossings, and too few trained staff. Respondents also cited lack of capacity to confirm cases locally, lack of cooperation by some travelers, language barriers, and multiple entry points along porous borders. Nonetheless, no potential Ebola case identified through border screening was confirmed in Ghana. Conclusion Screening for Ebola remains sub-optimal at the entry points in northern Ghana due to several systemic and structural factors. Given the likelihood of future infectious disease outbreaks, additional attention and support are required if Ghana is to minimize the risk of travel-related spread of illness."
