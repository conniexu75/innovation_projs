Heightened platelet reactivity, however, is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and enhanced potential for thrombotic events. We now show gut microbes, through generation of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), directly contribute to platelet hyperreactivity and enhanced thrombosis potential. Plasma TMAO levels in subjects (n > 4,000) independently predicted incident (3 years) thrombosis (heart attack, stroke) risk. Direct exposure of platelets to TMAO enhanced sub-maximal stimulus-dependent platelet activation from multiple agonists through augmented Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Animal model studies employing dietary choline or TMAO, germ-free mice, and microbial transplantation collectively confirm a role for gut microbiota and TMAO in modulating platelet hyperresponsiveness and thrombosis potential and identify microbial taxa associated with plasma TMAO and thrombosis potential.

Cardiovascular arterial thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, are a leading cause of disability and mortality. Platelet activation, aggregation, and the subsequent generation of an occlusive intra-arterial thrombus are essential steps in atherothrombotic disease, and enhanced platelet reactivity is associated with both the extent of end organ injury and adverse prognosis (Frossard et al., 2004Frossard M.

Platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis risk are enhanced in the setting of numerous conditions associated with atherosclerotic heart disease, such as hyperlipidemia, oxidant stress, and hyperglycemia (Podrez et al., 2007Podrez E.A.

Understanding the mechanisms through which platelets become hyperresponsive and more prone to clot formation is therefore of considerable importance (Jennings, 2009Jennings L.K.

The past decade has witnessed a rapidly growing awareness of the involvement of gut microbial organisms in the development of numerous cardiometabolic phenotypes (Bäckhed et al., 2004Bäckhed F.

For example, recent studies reveal participation of gut microbes in a metaorganismal pathway that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis (Wang et al., 2011Wang Z. Klipfell E. Bennett B.J.

Chem. 2015; 290: 5647-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, specific trimethylamine (TMA)-containing dietary nutrients, such as phosphatidylcholine, choline, and carnitine, can be used by gut microbes as a carbon fuel source. A waste product produced is TMA, which is carried via the portal circulation to the liver, where it is rapidly converted by a family of enzymes, host hepatic flavin monooxygenases (FMOs), into TMA N-oxide (TMAO) (Wang et al., 2011Wang Z. Klipfell E. Bennett B.J. Koeth R. Levison B.S. Dugar B. Feldstein A.E. Britt E.B. Fu X. Chung Y.M. et al.Gut flora metabolism of phosphatidylcholine promotes cardiovascular disease.Nature. 2011; 472: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar). Animal model studies show direct provision of TMAO within the diet is pro-atherogenic, and similarly, provision of its dietary precursors (e.g., choline, carnitine, gamma butyrobetaine) also accelerates atherosclerosis development, but only in the setting of intact gut microbiota and TMA/TMAO generation (Wang et al., 2011Wang Z.

Recent studies involving genetic manipulation of FMO3, the major FMO responsible for converting TMA into TMAO (Bennett et al., 2013Bennett B.J. de Aguiar Vallim T.Q. Wang Z. Shih D.M. Meng Y. Gregory J. Allayee H. Lee R. Graham M.

Moreover, an obligatory role for gut microbes in TMAO generation in humans was affirmed by two distinct studies involving ingestion of either isotope-labeled phosphatidylcholine or isotope-labeled carnitine as a tracer before versus following exposure to an oral cocktail of poorly absorbed antibiotics to suppress intestinal microbes (Tang et al., 2013Tang W.H.

Finally, an association between plasma TMAO levels and both the extent of coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden and CVD risks has been observed in multiple distinct clinical studies (Wang et al., 2011Wang Z.

Insights into the mechanisms through which the meta-organismal pathway responsible for TMAO production are associated with enhanced CVD risks have thus far focused on the involvement of TMAO and FMO3 in atherosclerotic plaque development, altered sterol and glucose metabolism, and changes in macrophage phenotype (Wang et al., 2011Wang Z.

The involvement of gut microbes and TMAO in modulation of platelet function and thrombosis risks in vivo has not yet been reported. We previously reported an association between plasma levels of TMAO and incident risk for the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events in a cohort of sequential stable subjects (n = 4,007) presenting to a cardiology clinic for elective diagnostic cardiac evaluations and for whom adjudicated longitudinal follow-up (3 year) for incident development of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, death, or need for revascularization were collected (Tang et al., 2013Tang W.H. Wang Z. Levison B.S. Koeth R.A. Britt E.B. Fu X. Wu Y. Hazen S.L. Intestinal microbial metabolism of phosphatidylcholine and cardiovascular risk.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar). Initially, we therefore sought to reanalyze the clinical dataset and test whether an association between plasma levels of TMAO and incident risk for thrombotic events (MI or stroke) was observed. Plasma TMAO levels within the cohort showed a large dynamic range (0.06 to 312 μM; Figure 1A). TMAO showed a dose-dependent association with increased cumulative burden of incident thrombotic events as illustrated by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses (Figure 1A). Importantly, the association between TMAO and incident thrombosis risk was observed even following adjustments for CVD history, traditional CVD risk factors, renal function, and medication use (fourth quartile level versus first quartile, adjusted 1.64-fold risk, p < 0.001; Figure 1A). The robust association observed between increasing TMAO levels and incident risk of thrombotic events in subjects served as impetus for further studies aimed at testing the hypothesis that TMAO may directly modulate platelet function. Initially, platelet-rich plasma was isolated from healthy volunteers with low levels of TMAO (all in first quartile, < 2.4 μM), and the effect of physiologically relevant levels of exogenous TMAO (100 μM versus vehicle) on platelet activation by the agonist ADP, as monitored by platelet aggregometry, was examined. While inter-individual variations in the magnitude of the effect of TMAO on platelet responsiveness to ADP stimulation was seen (Figure S1), overall, a leftward shift (p < 0.0001) in the dose-response curve in the presence of high TMAO levels was observed (Figure 1B, left). Upon further examination, the enhancing effect of TMAO on platelet function was seen to be more generalizable, since similar results were observed using washed human platelets briefly incubated in the presence versus absence of TMAO (100 μM) and varying doses of thrombin instead of ADP as agonist (Figure 1B, right). Next, we examined the effect of TMAO on platelet adhesion to collagen, a highly thrombogenic component of the sub-endothelium (Furie and Furie, 2008Furie B. Furie B.C. Mechanisms of thrombus formation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 938-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Platelets within whole blood were fluorescently labeled, and adherence to the collagen surface of a microfluidic device under physiological shear forces was monitored in real time by microscopy, as described in the Experimental Procedures. Figure 1C shows representative images of the collagen-coated biochip under flow with whole blood from a typical subject at initial (t = 0) and subsequent 1-min interval periods of exposure and illustrates the visible increase in fluorescent platelet adhesion noted in the presence of TMAO. Computer image-assisted quantification of adherent platelets was employed, and cumulative data from multiple subjects (n = 11) are shown in Figure 1D. TMAO significantly (p < 0.0001) increased platelet adhesion within whole blood to immobilized collagen under physiological shear force. In the absence of collagen coating (± TMAO), platelet adhesion to the biochip surface was negligible (Figure 1D). Cumulatively, the above data demonstrate that physiological levels of TMAO directly enhance platelet responsiveness to multiple distinct agonists (ADP, thrombin, and collagen). Since the enhancing effect of TMAO on platelet responsiveness is both rapid and direct, we reasoned that we should be able to induce a relatively acute rise in plasma TMAO levels within the physiologically observed range and simultaneously enhance in vivo thrombosis potential. To test this, plasma TMAO levels in mice were raised using intraperitoneal (i.p.) TMAO injection (versus normal saline), and we quantified in vivo thrombosis potential using a carotid artery injury (FeCl3) model using fluorescently tagged platelets and intravital microscopy (we aimed to perform the thrombosis model when plasma TMAO was ∼100 μM, as described in the Experimental Procedures). Figure 1E shows representative images of thrombus development within the internal carotid artery at various time points following FeCl3 injury in a representative mouse injected with either TMAO or vehicle (normal saline). At the time of the carotid artery injury (2 hr following TMAO i.p. injection), a >10-fold increase in plasma TMAO was observed that is well within the (patho)physiological range observed in humans (Figure 1E; 93.0 ± 12.5 μM versus 7.2 ± 0.5 μM TMAO in TMAO versus vehicle, respectively; p < 0.001; n ≥ 5 per group). As can be seen in Figure 1E, the rate of fluorescent thrombus formation is increased by TMAO. Further, the occlusion time, monitored by direct visualization of when platelets cease to pass downstream of the growing thrombus, is significantly (p < 0.001) shorter in TMAO-injected mice (Figure 1F). Under resting conditions, platelets maintain a low intracellular cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) level as they circulate through healthy vessels. However, at sites of vessel injury, platelets are rapidly activated by stimulus-dependent mobilization of [Ca2+]i, a precursor to thrombus formation and hemostasis (Rink and Sage, 1990Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Calcium signaling in human platelets.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, Furie and Furie, 2008Furie B. Furie B.C. Mechanisms of thrombus formation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 938-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). To explore how TMAO influences platelet [Ca2+]i, washed platelets from healthy donors were loaded with Fura 2-AM, a calcium-selective dye, to permit real time monitoring of [Ca2+]i at rest and following stimulus-dependent activation. Pre-incubation with TMAO showed no effect on resting platelet [Ca2+]i (Figure 2A). However, exposure to physiological levels of TMAO enhanced sub-maximal thrombin-evoked augmentation of platelet [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 2A and 2B). In parallel studies TMAO similarly increased a sub-maximal ADP-triggered (1 μM) rise in platelet [Ca2+]i (Figures S2A and S2B). The stimulatory effect of TMAO on platelet responsiveness to agonist was observed to occur rapidly, since only brief exposure (10 min) to TMAO significantly enhanced stimulus triggered rise in [Ca2+]i (data not shown) and platelet aggregation (Figure S2C). To determine whether TMAO affects the release of Ca2+ from platelet stores or the entry of Ca2+ from extracellular media, we first examined [Ca2+]i in Fura 2-AM loaded platelets incubated with sub-maximal thrombin dose in media in the absence of free Ca2+ (and 0.1 mM EGTA was added to the medium) in the presence versus absence of TMAO. As seen in Figure 2C (left), under these conditions, platelet activation in the presence of TMAO resulted in an initial several-fold enhancement in the rise of [Ca2+]i, indicating an intracellular source of Ca2+ is sufficient for TMAO-induced augmentation in the stimulus-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i. With sustained incubation in media containing excess Ca2+ chelator, platelet [Ca2+]i eventually plummets, consistent with depletion of intracellular stores triggering plasma membrane Ca2+ channel opening. Subsequent addition of excess Ca2+ to the external media reveals a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, but no significant effect of TMAO on Ca2+ entry rate from the extracellular pool (Figures 2C and 2D). Finally, TMAO was seen to augment inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathways in platelets with either sub-maximal thrombin (Figure 2E) or ADP (Figure 2F) as agonists by quantifying inositol phosphate levels.Figure S2Characterization of TMAO Effect on ADP-Induced Ca2+ Mobilization, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) The effect of TMAO on ADP-dependent elevation in platelet cytosolic Ca2+ was determined in Fura-2 loaded washed human platelets.

Demonstration of a direct effect of TMAO on platelet function suggests that gut microbiota and specific dietary nutrients that enhance TMAO generation should similarly modulate platelet function and thrombosis potential in vivo. To explore this possibility, mice were placed on a chemically defined diet comparable to normal chow (0.08% total choline) versus the same chemically defined diet supplemented with either TMAO (0.12%) or choline (1%). In addition, the effect of gut microbial suppression with a cocktail of oral broad-spectrum, poorly absorbed antibiotics (ABS) (Wang et al., 2011Wang Z. Klipfell E. Bennett B.J. Koeth R. Levison B.S. Dugar B. Feldstein A.E. Britt E.B. Fu X. Chung Y.M. et al.Gut flora metabolism of phosphatidylcholine promotes cardiovascular disease.Nature. 2011; 472: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar) was examined with both diets (Figure 3). After 6 weeks, platelet-rich plasma was isolated from mice, platelet responsiveness to ADP stimulation was determined using ex vivo platelet aggregometry, and TMAO levels were quantified. Figure 3A shows a representative tracing from the platelet aggregometry studies of a mouse from each dietary group using 1 μM ADP as agonist, while data in Figure 3B represent scatterplots and cumulative statistical analyses of percent maximal aggregation results at the sub-maximal ADP dose as an agonist for each of the dietary ± ABS groups of mice. Examination of plasma TMAO revealed elevated levels in mice provided dietary supplementation with either choline or TMAO. In parallel, ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by ADP stimulation was significantly increased in these groups (Figure 3B). Moreover, the enhancing effect of dietary choline on platelet aggregation was suppressed in mice receiving oral ABS, which markedly reduces plasma TMAO levels (Figures 3A and 3B). Importantly, provision of ABS to the TMAO supplemented group did not have a significant effect on either plasma TMAO levels or platelet aggregation (Figure 3B). Figure 3C illustrates parallel independent studies examining platelet activation in response to different concentrations of ADP or different agonists (collagen or arachidonic acid). Notably, TMAO supplementation similarly enhanced ex vivo platelet aggregometry responses to sub-maximal levels of each of the agonists examined (Figure 3C). In further studies the impact of dietary choline, TMAO, and gut microbiota on in vivo thrombosis potential was examined using the carotid artery FeCl3 injury model using an overall study design identical to that used for the ex vivo platelet aggregometry studies above (Figure 3D). Consistently, in vivo thrombosis potential, as monitored by time to blood flow cessation in the carotid artery following FeCl3 injury, was shortened (indicating a more pro-thrombotic phenotype) in mice with heightened TMAO levels (choline or TMAO supplemented diet groups) (Figure 3D). Importantly, the effect of dietary choline on in vivo thrombosis was inhibited by concurrent oral ABS administration, which suppresses the gut microbiota and TMAO levels (Figure 3D; TMAO levels in Figure 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2295326929,"Developing technologies for efficient and scalable disruption of gene expression will provide powerful tools for studying gene function, developmental pathways, and disease mechanisms. Here, we develop clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) to repress gene expression in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). CRISPRi, in which a doxycycline-inducible deactivated Cas9 is fused to a KRAB repression domain, can specifically and reversibly inhibit gene expression in iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiac progenitors, cardiomyocytes, and T lymphocytes. This gene repression system is tunable and has the potential to silence single alleles. Compared with CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn), CRISPRi gene repression is more efficient and homogenous across cell populations. The CRISPRi system in iPSCs provides a powerful platform to perform genome-scale screens in a wide range of iPSC-derived cell types, dissect developmental pathways, and model disease."
https://openalex.org/W2295845209,"Sequential activation of neurons is a common feature of network activity during a variety of behaviors, including working memory and decision making. Previous network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and modifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recur- rent network can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual memory- guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through feedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural sequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network architectures."
https://openalex.org/W2293303303,"Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) have been implicated in cognition and mood; however, it remains unknown how these cells behave in vivo. Here, we have used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of young abGCs in awake behaving mice. We find that young adult-born neurons fire at a higher rate in vivo but paradoxically exhibit less spatial tuning than their mature counterparts. When presented with different contexts, mature granule cells underwent robust remapping of their spatial representations, and the few spatially tuned adult-born cells remapped to a similar degree. We next used optogenetic silencing to confirm the direct involvement of abGCs in context encoding and discrimination, consistent with their proposed role in pattern separation. These results provide the first in vivo characterization of abGCs and reveal their participation in the encoding of novel information."
https://openalex.org/W2293146851,"Interactions between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are critical for learning and memory. Hippocampal activity during awake sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events is important for spatial learning, and hippocampal SWR activity often represents past or potential future experiences. Whether or how this reactivation engages the PFC, and how reactivation might interact with ongoing patterns of PFC activity, remains unclear. We recorded hippocampal CA1 and PFC activity in animals learning spatial tasks and found that many PFC cells showed spiking modulation during SWRs. Unlike in CA1, SWR-related activity in PFC comprised both excitation and inhibition of distinct populations. Within individual SWRs, excitation activated PFC cells with representations related to the concurrently reactivated hippocampal representation, while inhibition suppressed PFC cells with unrelated representations. Thus, awake SWRs mark times of strong coordination between hippocampus and PFC that reflects structured reactivation of representations related to ongoing experience."

Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by overexpression of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC (OSKM) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K.

Their ability to contribute to all tissues makes iPSCs attractive for disease modeling and for regenerative medicine. Recently, it was reported that the differentiation propensity of iPSCs reflects the tissue of origin, such that neural-derived iPSCs more readily differentiate into neurons, and blood-cell-derived iPSCs are biased toward the hematopoietic lineage (Bar-Nur et al., 2011Bar-Nur O.

Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). This tissue of origin memory has been shown to be associated with differences in epigenetic features. Residual DNA methylation marks were found at promoters in early iPSCs, presumably stably silencing genes that act in specifying lineages other than the donor cell type (Kim et al., 2010Kim K. Doi A.

Early passage iPSCs obtained from different cell types were also found to have distinct gene expression profiles. Some of the distinguishing genes appeared to show residual cell-of-origin-specific transcription, which was interpreted to reflect memory of the transcriptional status in founder cells (Polo et al., 2010Polo J.M.

Chromosomes can be subdivided into topologically associated domains (TADs), structural units within which sequences preferentially contact each other (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F.

TADs serve to physically restrain interactions of enhancers with their target gene promoters (Nora et al., 2012Nora E.P. Lajoie B.R. Schulz E.G. Giorgetti L. Okamoto I. Servant N.

TAD organization is relatively stable during development, but contacts within TADs can dynamically change between cell types (Phillips-Cremins et al., 2013Phillips-Cremins J.E. Sauria M.E. Sanyal A.

While some enhancer-promoter contacts seem tissue invariant, others are specifically established during differentiation, contributing to tissue-specific transcription programs (de Laat and Duboule, 2013de Laat W. Duboule D. Topology of mammalian developmental enhancers and their regulatory landscapes.Nature. 2013; 502: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S. Huntley M.H.

To what degree this is also true for higher levels of structural chromatin organization is not fully understood yet, but some TADs switch between genomic neighborhoods, or compartments, in a cell-type-dependent manner (Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R. Jung I. Selvaraj S. Shen Y. Antosiewicz-Bourget J.E. Lee A.Y. Ye Z. Kim A. Rajagopal N.

The genome of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), for example, uniquely brings together distal chromosomal regions that are densely packed with pluripotency factors, which creates a configuration proposed to contribute to maintenance of pluripotency (de Wit et al., 2013de Wit E. Bouwman B.A. Zhu Y. Klous P. Splinter E. Verstegen M.J. Krijger P.H. Festuccia N. Nora E.P. Welling M. et al.The pluripotent genome in three dimensions is shaped around pluripotency factors.Nature. 2013; 501: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the pluripotency genes Nanog and Oct4 make specific long-range interactions in ESC and iPSCs, which are lost during differentiation (Apostolou et al., 2013Apostolou E. Ferrari F. Walsh R.M. Bar-Nur O. Stadtfeld M. Cheloufi S. Stuart H.T. Polo J.M. Ohsumi T.K.

Klf4 organizes long-range chromosomal interactions with the oct4 locus in reprogramming and pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, little is known to what extent the overall 3D genome of somatic cells and their iPS derivatives differ, how stable such differences are, and how similar the 3D configurations of iPSC and ESC genomes are. Here we show that somatic cell reprogramming is accompanied by massive changes in genome topology, which, irrespective of the cell type of origin, converge on the 3D structure of the pluripotent genome. Despite this, distinct topological features separate early passage iPSCs according to their cell type of origin, and these differences seem to be acquired during reprogramming in a founder-cell-dependent manner. To study how reprogramming of somatic cells affects nuclear organization, we used reprogrammable, OSKM-inducible, mice (Carey et al., 2010Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Beard C. Hanna J. Jaenisch R. Single-gene transgenic mouse strains for reprogramming adult somatic cells.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We generated three independent iPS cell lines each from four different founder cell types, i.e., pre-B cells, bone-marrow-derived macrophages (MΦ), neural stem cells (NSCs), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure 1A). iPSCs were established after picking of doxy-independent colonies at day 20 of reprogramming (15 days of reprogramming in the presence of doxy + 5 days without doxy) and were expanded for an additional 3 passages or 20 passages to obtain early (p3) and late (p20) passage iPS lines, respectively. Both p3 and p20 passage iPSC lines showed characteristic ESC-like morphology, expressed markers of pluripotency, as shown by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and could be maintained in a transgene-independent manner (Figures 1B, 2A , and S1A). Furthermore, p3 iPSCs derived from each cell type gave rise to chimeras upon blastocyst injection (Figure 1C). Importantly, embryoid bodies (EBs) obtained from the various p3 iPSC lines showed a differentiation bias toward the cell type of origin (Figure S1B). EBs derived from pre-B-iPSCs and MΦ-iPSCs showed higher expression of the hematopoietic-associated genes Cd45, Cd41, Itgam (Mac-1), and Hoxb4, while the neuronal-associated genes Nestin and Pax6 were more highly expressed in EBs derived from NSC-iPSCs. In contrast, the endoderm associated gene Sox7 showed no such a bias (Figure S1C). The blood and neural origin bias was lost in p20 iPSCs (Figure S1D). These findings confirm the tissue-of-origin memory of early passage iPSCs described previously (Bar-Nur et al., 2011Bar-Nur O. Russ H.A. Efrat S. Benvenisty N.

Clusters and expression difference range (color gradient) are shown. See also Figure S2. To systematically compare the transcriptomes of the four founder cell types and of their iPSC derivatives, we performed genome-wide expression analysis. Pre-Bs, NSCs, MΦs, and MEFs had highly divergent transcription profiles yet were very similar between biological duplicates (Figure 2B). We identified 13,880 unique genes that were differentially expressed (at an FDR of 0.01) by the four cell types. Reprogramming of the four somatic cells resulted in loss of tissue-specific expression programs and yielded transcriptomes that highly correlated between all iPS lines and strongly corresponded to an ESC-like expression pattern (Figures 2A and 2B). Similarly, active enhancer profiles, as defined by histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) were also very different between founder cells (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W.

Although expression profiles in both p3 and p20 iPSCs were highly correlated, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the transcription profiles revealed that p3 passage iPSCs derived from the same cell of origin clustered together (Figure 2F). Indeed, 1717 unique genes were differentially expressed (FDR of 0.05) between p3 iPSCs derived from different founders. This indicated that the cell type of origin left a mark on transcription in fully reprogrammed p3 passage iPSCs. In contrast, p20 iPSCs showed clearly reduced gene expression clustering (Figure S2A) and only two genes with reproducibly founder-dependent differential expression (FDR of 0.05). This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that iPSCs transiently retain cell-type-of-origin differences in gene expression (Kim et al., 2010Kim K. Doi A. Wen B. Ng K. Zhao R. Cahan P. Kim J. Aryee M.J. Ji H. Ehrlich L.I. et al.Epigenetic memory in induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2010; 467: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, Polo et al., 2010Polo J.M.

Shioda T. et al.Cell type of origin influences the molecular and functional properties of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). To further understand transcriptional differences and similarities between p3 passage iPSCs derived from different cell types, we performed k-means clustering and identified seven clusters of genes in p3 iPSCs (Figure 2G). To determine whether their differential expression echoed previously established transcription patterns in the cells of origin, we calculated the correlation in expression on a gene-by-gene basis between founders and iPSCs. For p3 iPSCs the expression of genes in most clusters showed little correlation with that of the founders, with the exception of cluster 2 (Figures 2G and S2B) (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In agreement, Gene Ontology analysis using Webgestalt (Zhang et al., 2005Zhang B. Kirov S. Snoddy J. WebGestalt: an integrated system for exploring gene sets in various biological contexts.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W741-W748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) only showed a clear enrichment of functional categories for cluster 2, namely for genes involved in the immune system and collagen (Figure S2C). Consistent with this annotation, genes in this cluster are highly expressed in MΦ-p3 iPSCs and in MEF-p3 iPSCs but not in NSC-derived iPSCs. Vice versa, when we clustered genes according to tissue-specific expression patterns in the founders, we also found no indications for systematic memory of cell-type-specific expression programs in the corresponding p3 and p20 iPSCs (Figure S2D). Furthermore, when we selected tissue-specific genes based on their >4-fold higher expression in one of the founding somatic cell lines compared the other three, we found that none of the genes maintained this difference in transcriptional output in the corresponding iPSCs. Only when we lowered the threshold for differential expression among iPSCs to 1.4-fold, a small number of genes (22) were reproducibly scored across all lineages (16 for MΦ, 5 for pre-B, 1 for MEF, and 0 for NSC) as having a founder-specific expression profile. Collectively, this showed that overall cell-type-specific expression programs were efficiently erased and replaced by ESC-like transcription programs during reprogramming. In addition, reproducible cell-type-of-origin-specific gene expression patterns exist in p3 iPSCs, although only for one gene cluster this is related to a founder-specific gene expression program. The remaining founder-dependent gene expression patterns in p3 iPSCs appear reproducibly acquired during reprogramming, possibly as a consequence of cell-type-specific reprogramming events. To investigate how nuclear organization changes during reprogramming, we used a frequently cutting restriction enzyme (DpnII) to generate genome-wide Hi-C contact maps for each of the four founder cell types and their respective p3 and p20 iPSC derivatives. We prepared Hi-C data from two to three independent clones (with the exception of the NSC founder, from which only one Hi-C library was created), which we combined for each cell type, resulting in Hi-C maps based on 39-72M valid reads (Table S1). We first compared the overall chromosome organization of the different cell types by partitioning the genome into regions of 300kb and plotting all interactions between these regions as a heatmap and a correlation heatmap (Figure 3A; Table S2). As expected, most interactions occurred in cis and at close distance, although many long-range contacts beyond the level of TADs can be observed. Closer inspection of the heatmaps revealed clear differences in genome folding between the different somatic cell types. Reprogramming erased many of these tissue-specific configurations and created a 3D genome that was highly similar between all iPS lines. Previous Hi-C studies have shown that chromosomal regions can be segregated into two main nuclear compartments (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L. Williams L. Imakaev M. Ragoczy T. Telling A. Amit I. Lajoie B.R. Sabo P.J. Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4868) Google Scholar). Regions within the same compartment preferentially interacted with each other and were highly enriched for, respectively, active (compartment A) or inactive chromatin (compartment B) (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L. Williams L. Imakaev M. Ragoczy T. Telling A. Amit I. Lajoie B.R. Sabo P.J. Dorschner M.O. et al.Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.Science. 2009; 326: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4868) Google Scholar). We found that the distribution of genomic regions between these compartments differed strongly between the somatic lines (Figures 3A–3C), with 28% of the genome located in a different compartment in at least one of the founders. This percentage is not very different from the 36% of the genome that was found to change compartments during in vitro differentiation (Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R. Jung I. Selvaraj S. Shen Y. Antosiewicz-Bourget J.E. Lee A.Y. Ye Z. Kim A. Rajagopal N. Xie W. et al.Chromatin architecture reorganization during stem cell differentiation.Nature. 2015; 518: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Genes tissue specifically residing in the A compartment showed increased expression levels in the corresponding cell type, while those tissue specifically located in the B compartment showed reduced transcriptional output as compared with that in the other tissues (Figure S3). An example of such a gene (Ly6d) with tissue-specific activity and corresponding nuclear location in pre-B cells is shown in Figure 3D. For every cell type of origin, reprogramming efficiently erased the tissue-specific division of genomic regions over the A and B compartments and induced a compartment structure that is very similar to what is found in ESCs (Figures 3A–3C). Already in p3 passage iPSCs, 99.9% of the genome resided in identical compartments, which increased to 99.95% in p20 iPSCs. For example, Sox2 was found to be expressed and located in the active compartment in NSCs, but inactive and located in the B compartment in the other somatic cell types. Reprogramming induced the expression of endogenous Sox2 and relocated the gene to the active compartment in iPSCs derived from pre-B, MΦ, and MEF (Figure 3E). Genes that switched compartments during reprogramming changed their expression levels more often than genes that did not switch compartments (Figure 3F), with genes relocating from B to A showing an overall increase in expression, and vice versa, genes switching from A to B showing an overall reduction in expression in iPSCs. A similar, albeit more subtle, correlation between expression changes and compartment switching was observed before during in vitro differentiation (Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R. Jung I. Selvaraj S. Shen Y. Antosiewicz-Bourget J.E. Lee A.Y. Ye Z. Kim A. Rajagopal N. Xie W. et al.Chromatin architecture reorganization during stem cell differentiation.Nature. 2015; 518: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that somatic founder cells generally structure their chromosomes very differently, but reprogramming induces these differences to disappear and genomes to adopt an ESC-like higher order structure (Figure 3C). Thus, independently of the somatic founder cell type, reprogramming into iPSCs leads to a convergence of the 3D genomes to an ESC-like topology. The pluripotent genome was previously found to have some unique topological features (de Wit et al., 2013de Wit E. Bouwman B.A. Zhu Y. Klous P. Splinter E. Verstegen M.J. Krijger P.H. Festuccia N.

https://openalex.org/W2293256782,"Children's vegetable consumption falls below current recommendations, highlighting the need to identify strategies that can successfully promote better acceptance of vegetables. Recently, experimental studies have reported promising interventions that increase acceptance of vegetables. The first, offering infants a high variety of vegetables at weaning, increased acceptance of new foods, including vegetables. The second, offering an initially disliked vegetable at 8 subsequent meals markedly increased acceptance for that vegetable. So far, these effects have been shown to persist for at least several weeks. We now present follow-up data at 15 months, 3 and 6 years obtained through questionnaire (15 mo, 3y) and experimental (6y) approaches. At 15 months, participants who had been breast-fed were reported as eating and liking more vegetables than those who had been formula-fed. The initially disliked vegetable that became accepted after repeated exposure was still liked and eaten by 79% of the children. At 3 years, the initially disliked vegetable was still liked and eaten by 73% of the children. At 6 years, observations in an experimental setting showed that children who had been breast-fed and children who had experienced high vegetable variety at the start of weaning ate more of new vegetables and liked them more. They were also more willing to taste vegetables than formula-fed children or the no or low variety groups. The initially disliked vegetable was still liked by 57% of children. This follow-up study suggests that experience with chemosensory variety in the context of breastfeeding or at the onset of complementary feeding can influence chemosensory preferences for vegetables into childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2293408387,"Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) is a clinically pleiotropic gene associated with schizophrenia and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS). To gain insight about the neurobiology of TCF4, we created an in vivo model of PTHS by suppressing Tcf4 expression in rat prefrontal neurons immediately prior to neurogenesis. This cell-autonomous genetic insult attenuated neuronal spiking by increasing the afterhyperpolarization. At the molecular level, using a novel technique called iTRAP that combined in utero electroporation and translating ribosome affinity purification, we identified increased translation of two ion channel genes, Kcnq1 and Scn10a. These ion channel candidates were validated by pharmacological rescue and molecular phenocopy. Remarkably, similar excitability deficits were observed in prefrontal neurons from a Tcf4+/tr mouse model of PTHS. Thus, we identify TCF4 as a regulator of neuronal intrinsic excitability in part by repression of Kcnq1 and Scn10a and suggest that this molecular function may underlie pathophysiology associated with neuropsychiatric disorders."

However, recent work suggests that learning is possible even when this most fundamental assumption is not met. We used novel reward-guided learning paradigms in two fMRI studies to show that humans deploy separable learning mechanisms that operate in parallel. While behavior was dominated by precise contingent learning, it also revealed hallmarks of noncontingent learning strategies. These learning mechanisms were separable behaviorally and neurally. Lateral orbitofrontal cortex supported contingent learning and reflected contingencies between outcomes and their causal choices. Amygdala responses around reward times related to statistical patterns of learning. Time-based heuristic mechanisms were related to activity in sensorimotor corticostriatal circuitry. Our data point to the existence of several learning mechanisms in the human brain, of which only one relies on applying known rules about the causal structure of the task."
https://openalex.org/W2294591031,"Malaria elimination efforts are hampered by the lack of sensitive tools to detect infections with low-level parasitemia, usually below the threshold of standard diagnostic methods, microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays such as the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are well suited for field use as they do not require thermal cyclers to run the test. However, the use of specialized equipment, as described by many groups, reduces the versatility of the LAMP technique as a simple tool for use in endemic countries. In this study, the use of the malachite green (MG) dye, as a visual endpoint readout, together with a simple mini heat block was evaluated for the detection of malaria parasites. The assay was performed for 1 hour at 63°C and the results scored by 3 independent human readers. The limit of detection of the assay was determined using well-quantified Plasmodium spp. infected reference samples and its utility in testing clinical samples was determined using 190 pre-treatment specimens submitted for reference diagnosis of imported malaria in the United States. Use of a simplified boil and spin methods of DNA extraction from whole blood and filter paper was also investigated. We demonstrate the accurate and sensitive detection of malaria parasites using this assay with a detection limit ranging between 1–8 parasites/μL, supporting its applicability for the detection of infections with low parasite burden. This assay is compatible with the use of a simple boil and spin sample preparation method from both whole blood and filter papers without a loss of sensitivity. The MG-LAMP assay described here has great potential to extend the reach of molecular tools to settings where they are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2294582511,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1α) is the primary regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and was recently found to be highly expressed within the intestinal epithelium. PGC1α is decreased in the intestinal epithelium of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but its role in pathogenesis is uncertain. We now hypothesize that PGC1α protects against the development of colitis and helps to maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier. We selectively deleted PGC1α from the intestinal epithelium of mice by breeding a PGC1α(loxP/loxP) mouse with a villin-cre mouse. Their progeny (PGC1α(ΔIEC) mice) were subjected to 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis for 7 days. The SIRT1 agonist SRT1720 was used to enhance PGC1α activation in wild-type mice during DSS exposure. Mice lacking PGC1α within the intestinal epithelium were more susceptible to DSS colitis than their wild-type littermates. Pharmacologic activation of PGC1α successfully ameliorated disease and restored mitochondrial integrity. These findings suggest that a depletion of PGC1α in the intestinal epithelium contributes to inflammatory changes through a failure of mitochondrial structure and function as well as a breakdown of the intestinal barrier, which leads to increased bacterial translocation. PGC1α induction helps to maintain mitochondrial integrity, enhance intestinal barrier function, and decrease inflammation."

Nevertheless, there exist populations of wild colonies of European honey bees that are persisting without being treated with miticides. We hypothesized that the persistence of these wild colonies is due in part to their habits of nesting in small cavities and swarming frequently. We tested this hypothesis by establishing two groups of colonies living either in small hives (42 L) without swarm-control treatments or in large hives (up to 168 L) with swarm-control treatments. We followed the colonies for two years and compared the two groups with respect to swarming frequency, Varroa infesttion rate, disease incidence, and colony survival. Colonies in small hives swarmed more often, had lower Varroa infestation rates, had less disease, and had higher survival compared to colonies in large hives. These results indicate that the smaller nest cavities and more frequent swarming of wild colonies contribute to their persistence without mite treatments."

In the present study, we found that RNF6 was overexpressed in various leukemia cells and that it accelerated leukemia cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of RNF6 delayed tumor growth in xenografts. To find out the mechanism of RNF6 overexpression in leukemia, we designed a series of truncated constructs of RNF6 regulatory regions in the luciferase reporter system. The results revealed that the region between −144 and −99 upstream of the RNF6 transcription start site was critical and that this region contained a PBX1 recognition element (PRE). PBX1 modulated RNF6 expression by binding to the specific PRE. When PRE was mutated, RNF6 transcription was completely abolished. Further studies showed that PBX1 collaborated with PREP1 but not MEIS1 to modulate RNF6 expression. Moreover, RNF6 expression could be suppressed by doxorubicin, a major anti-leukemia agent, via down-regulating PBX1. This study thus suggests that RNF6 overexpression in leukemia is under the direction of PBX1 and that the PBX1/RNF6 axis can be developed as a novel therapeutic target of leukemia.

Data from clinical trials suggest that other medications can increase the risk of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis. Here we utilized a mouse model to study the effect of asparaginase treatment on dexamethasone-induced osteonecrosis. Mice receiving asparaginase along with dexamethasone had a higher rate of osteonecrosis than those receiving only dexamethasone after 6 weeks of treatment (44% vs. 10%, P = 0.006). Similarly, epiphyseal arteriopathy, which we have shown to be an initiating event for osteonecrosis, was observed in 58% of mice receiving asparaginase and dexamethasone compared to 17% of mice receiving dexamethasone only (P = 0.007). As in the clinic, greater exposure to asparaginase was associated with greater plasma exposure to dexamethasone (P = 0.0001). This model also recapitulated other clinical risk factors for osteonecrosis, including age at start of treatment, and association with the systemic exposure to dexamethasone (P = 0.027) and asparaginase (P = 0.036).

https://openalex.org/W2294807626,"Analysis of the neural code for sensory-motor latency in smooth pursuit eye movements reveals general principles of neural variation and the specific origin of motor latency. The trial-by-trial variation in neural latency in MT comprises a shared component expressed as neuron-neuron latency correlations and an independent component that is local to each neuron. The independent component arises heavily from fluctuations in the underlying probability of spiking, with an unexpectedly small contribution from the stochastic nature of spiking itself. The shared component causes the latency of single-neuron responses in MT to be weakly predictive of the behavioral latency of pursuit. Neural latency deeper in the motor system is more strongly predictive of behavioral latency. A model reproduces both the variance of behavioral latency and the neuron-behavior latency correlations in MT if it includes realistic neural latency variation, neuron-neuron latency correlations in MT, and noisy gain control downstream of MT."

https://openalex.org/W2295632024,"Background 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS/ME) is a complex multisystem disease of unknown aetiology which causes debilitating symptoms in up to 1% of the global population. Although a large cohort of genes have been shown to exhibit altered expression in CFS/ME patients, it is currently unknown whether microRNA (miRNA) molecules which regulate gene translation contribute to disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that changes in microRNA expression in patient leukocytes contribute to CFS/ME pathology, and may therefore represent useful diagnostic biomarkers that can be detected in the peripheral blood of CFS/ME patients.


Methods 
miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CFS/ME patients and healthy controls was analysed using the Ambion Bioarray V1. miRNA demonstrating differential expression were validated by qRT-PCR and then replicated in fractionated blood leukocyte subsets from an independent patient cohort. The CFS/ME associated miRNA identified by these experiments were then transfected into primary NK cells and gene expression analyses conducted to identify their gene targets.


Results 
Microarray analysis identified differential expression of 34 miRNA, all of which were up-regulated. Four of the 34 miRNA had confirmed expression changes by qRT-PCR. Fractionating PBMC samples by cell type from an independent patient cohort identified changes in miRNA expression in NK-cells, B-cells and monocytes with the most significant abnormalities occurring in NK cells. Transfecting primary NK cells with hsa-miR-99b or hsa-miR-330-3p, resulted in gene expression changes consistent with NK cell activation but diminished cytotoxicity, suggesting that defective NK cell function contributes to CFS/ME pathology.


Conclusion 
This study demonstrates altered microRNA expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CFS/ME patients, which are potential diagnostic biomarkers. The greatest degree of miRNA deregulation was identified in NK cells with targets consistent with cellular activation and altered effector function."

Using Twitter data collected for a generic assessment of social media data in ecological monitoring we investigated a sample of what we denote biodiversity observations with species determination requests (N = 191). These entail images posted as messages on the micro-blog service Twitter. As we show, these frequently trigger conversations leading to taxonomic determinations of those observations. All analysed Tweets were posted with species determination requests, which generated replies for 64% of Tweets, 86% of those contained at least one suggested determination, of which 76% were assessed as correct. All posted observations included or linked to images with the overall image quality categorised as satisfactory or better for 81% of the sample and leading to taxonomic determinations at the species level in 71% of provided determinations. We claim that the original message authors and conversation participants can be viewed as implicit or embryonic citizen science communities which have to offer valuable contributions both as an opportunistic data source in ecological monitoring as well as potential active contributors to citizen science programmes."

A chld-1/GUN4 mutant with elevated PPIX has a light-dependent up-regulation of GUN4, implicating this protein in light-dependent sensing of PPIX, with the suggestion that GUN4 reduces PPIX-generated singlet oxygen, O2(a1Δg), and subsequent oxidative damage (Brzezowski, P., Schlicke, H., Richter, A., Dent, R.

Starch accumulates in the chloroplast during the day as a final step in photosynthetic carbon assimilation. This transitory starch is mobilized during the night to fulfil the metabolic requirements of the plant in the absence of photosynthesis (1.Stitt M. Zeeman S.C. Starch turnover: pathways, regulation and role in growth.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2012; 15: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In addition, the starch is stored long-term in the storage organs of some species, such as seed endosperm or tubers, and provides carbon skeletons and energy to support some phases of growth, such as germination or sprouting processes (2.Zeeman S.C.

In contrast, the N-terminal region carries a sequence specific for each SS, varying both in size and amino acid sequence. This region is absent from GSs. The N-terminal region of SSs does not seem to be involved in catalysis, but it may alter some of the catalytic properties of these enzymes (7.Imparl-Radosevich J.M. Keeling P.L. Guan H.

Our group showed previously that SS4 is involved in a process that has not been well characterized: the initiation of the starch granule (9.Roldán I. Wattebled F. Mercedes Lucas M. Delvallé D. Planchot V. Jiménez S. Pérez R. Ball S. D'Hulst C. Mérida A. The phenotype of soluble starch synthase IV defective mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana suggests a novel function of elongation enzymes in the control of starch granule formation.Plant J. 2007; 49: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). SS4 controls the number of starch granules synthesized in the chloroplast. Its elimination determines the accumulation of only one (or in some cases two) granules/chloroplasts (9.Roldán I. Wattebled F. Mercedes Lucas M. Delvallé D. Planchot V. Jiménez S. Pérez R. Ball S. D'Hulst C. Mérida A. The phenotype of soluble starch synthase IV defective mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana suggests a novel function of elongation enzymes in the control of starch granule formation.Plant J. 2007; 49: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10.D'Hulst C. Mérida Á Essential Reviews in Experimental Biology Volume 5: The Synthesis and Breakdown of Starch.in: Tetlow I.J. Society for Experimental Biology, London2012: 55-76Google Scholar). We also found that the hilum (starch granule core) of the starch granules synthesized in plants that lack SS4 activity is different from the hilum observed in WT plants. This difference indicates that SS4 participates in the formation of the primer required for the de novo synthesis of a starch granule (10.D'Hulst C. Mérida Á Essential Reviews in Experimental Biology Volume 5: The Synthesis and Breakdown of Starch.in: Tetlow I.J. Society for Experimental Biology, London2012: 55-76Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that SS4 is not present in soluble form in the plastidial stroma. Instead, it is associated with the thylakoid membranes. SS4 interacts with fibrillins 1a and 1b (FBN1) proteins and seems to be associated with plastoglobules close and physically attached to thylakoids. Both this localization and the interaction with the fibrillins are mediated by the N-terminal portion of SS4 (11.Gámez-Arjona F.M. Raynaud S. Ragel P. Mérida A. Starch synthase 4 is located in the thylakoid membrane and interacts with plastoglobule-associated proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 80: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the N-terminal part of SS4 is specific to this class of SSs. It is a long segment, containing 543 amino acids in the case of Arabidopsis SS4 (At4g18240), and is well conserved among all of the SS4 proteins from different species sequenced to date. The main feature of the SS4 N terminus is the presence of a long coiled-coil region (9.Roldán I. Wattebled F. Mercedes Lucas M. Delvallé D. Planchot V. Jiménez S. Pérez R. Ball S. D'Hulst C. Mérida A. The phenotype of soluble starch synthase IV defective mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana suggests a novel function of elongation enzymes in the control of starch granule formation.Plant J. 2007; 49: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the function of the different domains present in the N-terminal part of SS4. We show that the coiled-coil region of the protein is necessary for the interaction with the FBN1 protein and the localization of SS4. We also show that SS4 forms a dimer in vivo. The interaction between SS4 monomers occurs via a region distinct from the coiled-coil domains that is highly conserved among the SS4 proteins of different species. We discuss the potential implications of SS4 dimerization in starch metabolism. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in soil pots in a greenhouse under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 22 °C and 250 micro-Einsteins m−2 s−1 light intensity. Arabidopsis thaliana WT ecotype Col-0, ss4-1 mutant (9.Roldán I. Wattebled F. Mercedes Lucas M. Delvallé D. Planchot V. Jiménez S. Pérez R. Ball S. D'Hulst C. Mérida A.

The cDNAs used for transitory expression of the different truncated versions of the AtSS4 protein in N. benthamiana were cloned using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The different fragments were amplified using the oligonucleotides shown in supplemental Table S1. The sequenced fragments were cloned into the pDONR207 plasmid (Invitrogen) via a BP clonase reaction. The stop codon was eliminated to allow C terminus translational fusion of the fragment with GFP (pEarleyGate 103) (12.Earley K.W. Haag J.R. Pontes O. Opper K. Juehne T. Song K. Pikaard C.S. Gateway-compatible vectors for plant functional genomics and proteomics.Plant J. 2006; 45: 616-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) for protein localization. Similar translational fusions were performed to attach FBN1b or the different fragments of AtSS4 to the N terminus of YFP (pXNGW-(nYFP)) or the C terminus of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP, pXCGW-(cCFP)) for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (13.Yuan L. Gu R. Xuan Y. Smith-Valle E. Loqué D. Frommer W.B. von Wirén N. Allosteric regulation of transport activity by heterotrimerization of Arabidopsis ammonium transporter complexes in vivo.Plant Cell. 2013; 25: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An overlapping PCR strategy was employed to clone fragments C, D, and CR to fuse the AtSS4 chloroplast transit peptide (CTP) with the sequence of interest and to clone the AtSS4 protein without the conserved region (CR, AtSS4_WOCR) (see the oligos in supplemental Table S1). In the case of AtSS4_WOCR, 135 bp (from 1411 to 1545 bp of the AtSS4 cDNA sequence) were eliminated. The procedures for cloning cDNAs encoding FBN1b, the full-length SS4 protein, and its N- and C-terminal segments were described previously (11.Gámez-Arjona F.M. Raynaud S. Ragel P. Mérida A. Starch synthase 4 is located in the thylakoid membrane and interacts with plastoglobule-associated proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 80: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The complete cDNA of the Brachypodium dystachion SS4 (BdSS4) (Bradi2g18810.1) was synthesized from the total RNA extracted from seeds. The primers were designed to contain the attB sequences (supplemental Table S1) compatible with the Gateway system. The stop codon was eliminated to allow further C-terminal translational fusions. The sequenced PCR product was cloned into pDNOR207 (Invitrogen) via the BP clonase reaction. The sequence was then cloned into different pEntry vectors via LR reactions. The binary vector pCTAPi (14.Rohila J.S. Chen M. Cerny R. Fromm M.E.

The cDNA fragments encoding AtSS4 and its truncated versions without the CTP (fragments A, B, C, D, and E and the C terminus; see schematic in Fig. 11) were amplified by PCR (supplemental Table S1) and inserted into the pET45b(+) expression vector (Novagen) at the BamHI-XhoI sites. The cDNA fragment encoding the AtSS4 protein without the CR and CTP was cloned into the pDON207 vector via a BP clonase reaction and then transferred to the pDEST17 vector via an LR clonase reaction. Both the pET45b(+) and pDEST17 vectors introduce a His5 tail at the N terminus of the cloned fragments. Recombinant clones were transformed into ΔglgCAP BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells lacking endogenous GS activity (15.Morán-Zorzano M.T. Alonso-Casajús N. Muñoz F.J. Viale A.M. Baroja-Fernández E.

Bent A.F. Floral dip: a simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed plants were selected for their herbicide (BASTA) resistance. Transgene expression was analyzed in 19 resistant plants selected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis using specific primers for the BdSS4 sequence. Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis leaves using TRIsure reagents (Bioline Ltd., London, UK) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. First-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed as described previously (17.Gámez-Arjona F.M. Li J. Raynaud S. Baroja-Fernández E. Muñoz F.J. Ovecka M. Ragel P.

The specific primers used for amplifying BdSS4 were BdSS4_qRTPCR_F (5′-CCGACCCACTTAATGGGGCTAAT-3′) and BdSS4_qRTPCR_R (5′-GCATGTTCCAATGCCTGAAGACG-3′). The primers used amplify UBQ10, a housekeeping gene, were UBQF (5′-GATCTTTGCCGGAAAACAATTGGAGGATGGT-3′) and UBQR (5′-CGACTTGTCATTAGAAAGAAAGAGATAACAG-3′). Three transgenic Arabidopsis lines with different levels of BdSS4 expression (line 16 with low levels and lines 17 and 19 with high levels) were selected for further characterization. Corresponding transgene vectors were electroporated into A. tumefaciens strain C58 (18.Wood D.W. Setubal J.C. Kaul R. Monks D.E. Kitajima J.P. Okura V.K. Zhou Y. Chen L. Wood G.E. Almeida Jr., N.F.

The agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana leaves was assessed as described previously (11.Gámez-Arjona F.M. Raynaud S. Ragel P. Mérida A. Starch synthase 4 is located in the thylakoid membrane and interacts with plastoglobule-associated proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 80: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A DM6000 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a ×63 oil immersion objective and a ×20 objective was used to detect protein localization based on GFP fusion expression or protein-protein interaction in BiFC assays performed in N. benthamiana mesophyll cells. GFP or YFP/CFP expression and chlorophyll autofluorescence imaging was performed by exciting the cells with an argon laser at 488 nm and detecting fluorescence emissions at 500–525 nm and 630–690 nm, respectively. Aliquots of overnight cultures (0.5 ml) were transferred to 50 ml Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Cultures were incubated at 25 °C until they reached an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm. Cultures were induced to express SS4 polypeptides by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 90 min. Bacterial cells from induced cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), and resuspended in 100 mm Tricine buffer (pH 8.0), supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were sonicated (Branson digital sonifier, 90 s, 20% intensity, 4 °C) and then centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant constituted the crude extract. The reaction was performed in a final volume of 200 μl containing 100 mm Tricine (pH 8.0), 25 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 m sodium citrate, 10 mg/ml amylopectin, and 5 mm ADP-glucose. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of E. coli crude extracts obtained as described above. At 0 min (t0), 100 μl of the reaction was boiled for 10 min to stop the reaction. The rest of the assay was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 10 min. The ADP produced in the reaction was determined by HPLC using a Partisil 10 SAX column and a photodiode array detector. The starch content of Arabidopsis leaves was determined as described by Szydlowski et al. (19.Szydlowski N. Ragel P. Raynaud S. Lucas M.M. Roldán I. Montero M. Muñoz F.J. Ovecka M. Bahaji A. Planchot V. Pozueta-Romero J. D'Hulst C. Mérida A. Starch granule initiation in Arabidopsis requires the presence of either class IV or class III starch synthases.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 2443-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The pET45b(+) and pDEST15 vectors containing the SS4-D fragment and plasmid pGEX-4T2, which allows the expression of GST protein, were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (Invitrogen). The in vitro pulldown assay was performed as described previously (11.Gámez-Arjona F.M. Raynaud S. Ragel P. Mérida A. Starch synthase 4 is located in the thylakoid membrane and interacts with plastoglobule-associated proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 80: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The SS4-C and E fragments were expressed in E. coli cells as described above. An aliquot of the crude protein extract (200 μl) was analyzed using a Superose 6 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.0) on an ÄKTA Purifier chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were recollected and analyzed on immunoblots probed with an anti-His5 antibody(Penta His HRP-conjugated kit, Qiagen). To determine the apparent molecular weight of the SS4-C and SS4-E fragments, a calibration curve was created by injecting 0.5 ml of gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad), under the same conditions as above and determining the elution volumes of the markers. We previously described an interaction between the N-terminal part of SS4 (NtSS4) and FBN1 (11.Gámez-Arjona F.M. Raynaud S. Ragel P. Mérida A. Starch synthase 4 is located in the thylakoid membrane and interacts with plastoglobule-associated proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 80: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragment contains two well differentiated regions. The first region includes four long coiled-coil domains predicted by the MultiCoil program that comprise residues 194–260, 275–347, 358–407, and 438–465 of Arabidopsis SS4 (see schematic in Fig. 1). The second region comprises a highly conserved sequence among all SS4 proteins sequenced to date. This CR does not form a coiled-coil structure. It extends from amino acids 471–515 of Arabidopsis SS4. To define the specific region of SS4 involved in the interaction with FBN1, we transiently co-transformed different truncated versions of YFP-tagged NtSS4 and CFP-tagged FBN1b into N. benthamiana leaves and analyzed the possible interactions using BiFC assays. First, we found that elimination of the CR (fragment 1) did not affect the interaction between SS4 and FBN1b. Thus, CR was not involved in the interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 1, A–C). A SS4 fragment containing the two first coiled-coil domains (CC1 and CC2, fragment 2) could interact with FBN1b (Fig. 1, D–F), but subsequent elimination of CC2 (fragment 3) abolished the interaction with FBN1b (Fig. 1, G–I). This analysis indicated that the interaction between SS4 and FBN1 required the long coiled-coil domains in the N-terminal part of SS4 and that the CR was not involved in this interaction. Arabidopsis SS4 is not soluble in the stroma of the chloroplast. Instead, it is located at specific spots associated with the thylakoid membranes (11.Gámez-Arjona F.M. Raynaud S. Ragel P. Mérida A. Starch synthase 4 is located in the thylakoid membrane and interacts with plastoglobule-associated proteins in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2014; 80: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19.Szydlowski N. Ragel P. Raynaud S. Lucas M.M. Roldán I. Montero M. Muñoz F.J. Ovecka M. Bahaji A. Planchot V. Pozueta-Romero J. D'Hulst C. Mérida A. Starch granule initiation in Arabidopsis requires the presence of either class IV or class III starch synthases.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 2443-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), most likely because of its interaction with FBN1s proteins, which are localized on the surface of the plastoglobules. To ascertain the involvement of the long coiled-coil region in the localization pattern of SS4, we fused fragments 1, 2, and 3 to GFP and analyzed their pattern of localization in transiently transformed N. benthamiana leaves. Eliminating the CR did not affect the localization pattern determined previously for the full-length SS4 protein or NtSS4 fragment (Fig. 2, A–C). Eliminating CC3 and CC4 modified the localization pattern of the fused protein. It was detected both as specific spots and in soluble form in the plastidial stroma (Fig. 2, D–F). Finally, eliminating CC2, CC3, and CC4 completely modified the localization pattern of the fused protein because it was detected in soluble form in the stroma (Fig. 2, G–I). These data indicated that the coiled-coil domains present in the N-terminal part of the protein determined the localization pattern of SS4. Coiled-coil domains are also predicted in SS4 proteins from other plant sources, such as Solanum tuberosum and B. distachyon (Fig. 3). However, the degree of sequence conservation in these domains is lower than that observed in the C-terminal part of the proteins. To determine whether the SS4 from a phylogenetically distant species, such as Brachypodium, can complement the ss4 mutation in Arabidopsis, we cloned the cDNA encoding the full-length Brachypodium SS4 protein and transformed it into the ss4-1 Arabidopsis mutant lacking the SS4 protein (9.Roldán I. Wattebled F. Mercedes Lucas M. Delvallé D. Planchot V. Jiménez S. Pérez R. Ball S. D'Hulst C. Mérida A. The phenotype of soluble starch synthase IV defective mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana suggests a novel function of elongation enzymes in the control of starch granule formation.Plant J. 2007; 49: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We selected two lines with high levels of Brachypodium SS4 expression (lines 17 and 19 in Fig. 4A) and one line with negligible levels of Brachypodium SS4 expression (line 16). Fig. 4 shows that the ss4 mutation was complemented successfully in lines 17 and 19. These lines reverted the low growth rate (Fig. 4B) and low starch accumulation levels (Fig. 4C) observed in the ss4 mutant plants. In addition, the Brachypodium SS4 expression pattern in Nicotiana leaves was the same as observed for the Arabidopsis protein (Fig. 5). These data indicate that the Brachypodium SS4 protein could function in Arabidopsis. Thus, the coiled-coil domain functions were conserved in both proteins.Figure 4Complementation of the Arabidopsis ss4-1 mutant with the Brachypodium SS4 protein. cDNA encoding the Brachypodium SS4 full-length protein was expressed in the Arabidopsis ss4-1 mutant under a 35S constitutive promoter.

Therefore, we analyzed whether one SS4 polypeptide could interact with another SS4 polypeptide in vivo. The BiFC assay of transiently transformed N. benthamiana leaves showed that SS4 interacted with other SS4 polypeptides (Fig. 6, A–C). This interaction seems to be common in SS4 proteins from other species because we also observed interactions between Brachypodium SS4 polypeptides in Nicotiana leaves (Fig. 7). This interaction also occurred between a full-length SS4 polypeptide and the NtSS4 fragment (from Met1 to Tyr543 and containing the coiled-coil domains and the CR; Fig. 6, D–F) but not with the C terminus of SS"
https://openalex.org/W2299286270,"Introduction Biomarkers indicating trait, progression and prediction of pathology and symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) often lack specificity or reliability. Investigating biomarker variance between individuals and over time and the effect of confounding factors is essential for the evaluation of biomarkers in PD, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Materials and Methods IGF-1 serum levels were investigated in up to 8 biannual visits in 37 PD patients and 22 healthy controls (HC) in the longitudinal MODEP study. IGF-1 baseline levels and annual changes in IGF-1 were compared between PD patients and HC while accounting for baseline disease duration (19 early stage: ≤3.5 years; 18 moderate stage: >4 years), age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and common medical factors putatively modulating IGF-1. In addition, associations of baseline IGF-1 with annual changes of motor, cognitive and depressive symptoms and medication dose were investigated. Results PD patients in moderate (130±26 ng/mL; p = .004), but not early stages (115±19, p>.1), showed significantly increased baseline IGF-1 levels compared with HC (106±24 ng/mL; p = .017). Age had a significant negative correlation with IGF-1 levels in HC (r = -.47, p = .028) and no correlation in PD patients (r = -.06, p>.1). BMI was negatively correlated in the overall group (r = -.28, p = .034). The annual changes in IGF-1 did not differ significantly between groups and were not correlated with disease duration. Baseline IGF-1 levels were not associated with annual changes of clinical parameters. Discussion Elevated IGF-1 in serum might differentiate between patients in moderate PD stages and HC. However, the value of serum IGF-1 as a trait-, progression- and prediction marker in PD is limited as IGF-1 showed large inter- and intraindividual variability and may be modulated by several confounders."
https://openalex.org/W2299292532,"Arsenic is one of the most common metalloid contaminants in groundwater and it has both acute and chronic toxicity affecting multiple organs. Details of the mechanism of arsenic toxicity are still lacking and profile studies at metabolic level are very limited. Using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), we first generated metabolomic profiles from the livers of arsenic-treated zebrafish and identified 34 significantly altered metabolite peaks as potential markers, including four prominent ones: cholic acid, glycylglycine, glycine and hypotaurine. Combined results from GC/MS, histological examination and pathway analyses suggested a series of alterations, including apoptosis, glycogenolysis, changes in amino acid metabolism and fatty acid composition, accumulation of bile acids and fats, and disturbance in glycolysis related energy metabolism. The alterations in glycolysis partially resemble Warburg effect commonly observed in many cancer cells. However, cellular damages were not reflected in two conventional liver function tests performed, Bilirubin assay and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) assay, probably because the short arsenate exposure was insufficient to induce detectable damage. This study demonstrated that metabolic changes could reflect mild liver impairments induced by arsenic exposure, which underscored their potential in reporting early liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2295020690,"Background Morphine induces myocardial preconditioning (M-PC) via activation of mitochondrial large conductance Ca2+-sensitive potassium (mKCa) channels. An upstream regulator of mKCa channels is protein kinase A (PKA). Furthermore, mKCa channel activation regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics and thereby prevents opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Here, we investigated in the rat heart in vivo whether 1) M-PC is mediated by activation of PKA, and 2) pharmacological opening of the mPTP abolishes the cardioprotective effect of M-PC and 3) M-PC is critically dependent on STAT3 activation, which is located upstream of mPTP within the signalling pathway. Methods Male Wistar rats were randomised to six groups (each n = 6). All animals underwent 25 minutes of regional myocardial ischemia and 120 minutes of reperfusion. Control animals (Con) were not further treated. Morphine preconditioning was initiated by intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg morphine (M-PC). The PKA blocker H-89 (10 μg/kg) was investigated with and without morphine (H-89+M-PC, H-89). We determined the effect of mPTP opening with atractyloside (5 mg/kg) with and without morphine (Atr+M-PC, Atr). Furthermore, the effect of morphine on PKA activity was tested in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes. In further experiments in isolated hearts we tested the protective properties of morphine in the presence of STAT3 inhibition, and whether pharmacological prevention of the mPTP-opening by cyclosporine A (CsA) is cardioprotective in the presence of STAT3 inhibition. Results Morphine reduced infarct size from 64±5% to 39±9% (P<0.05 vs. Con). H-89 completely blocked preconditioning by morphine (64±9%; P<0.05 vs. M-PC), but H-89 itself had not effect on infarct size (61±10%; P>0.05 vs. Con). Also, atractyloside abolished infarct size reduction of morphine completely (65±9%; P<0.05 vs. M-PC) but had no influence on infarct size itself (64±5%; P>0.05 vs. Con). In isolated hearts STAT3 inhibitor Stattic completely abolished morphine-induced preconditioning. Administration of Stattic and mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A reduced infarct size to 31±6% (Stat+CsA, P<0.05 vs. Con). Cyclosporine A alone reduced infarct size to 26±7% (CsA P<0.05 vs. Con). In cardiomyocytes, PKA activity was increased by morphine. Conclusion Our data suggest that morphine-induced cardioprotection is mediated by STAT3-activation and inhibition of mPTP, with STA3 located upstream of mPTP. There is some evidence that protein kinase A is involved within the signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2294634467,"Accuracy of taxonomic identifications is crucial to data quality in online repositories of species occurrence data, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which have accumulated several hundred million records over the past 15 years. These data serve as basis for large scale analyses of macroecological and biogeographic patterns and to document environmental changes over time. However, taxonomic identifications are often unreliable, especially for non-vascular plants and fungi including lichens, which may lack critical revisions of voucher specimens. Due to the scale of the problem, restudy of millions of collections is unrealistic and other strategies are needed. Here we propose to use verified, georeferenced occurrence data of a given species to apply predictive niche modeling that can then be used to evaluate unverified occurrences of that species. Selecting the charismatic lichen fungus, Usnea longissima, as a case study, we used georeferenced occurrence records based on sequenced specimens to model its predicted niche. Our results suggest that the target species is largely restricted to a narrow range of boreal and temperate forest in the Northern Hemisphere and that occurrence records in GBIF from tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere do not represent this taxon, a prediction tested by comparison with taxonomic revisions of Usnea for these regions. As a novel approach, we employed Principal Component Analysis on the environmental grid data used for predictive modeling to visualize potential ecogeographical barriers for the target species; we found that tropical regions conform a strong barrier, explaining why potential niches in the Southern Hemisphere were not colonized by Usnea longissima and instead by morphologically similar species. This approach is an example of how data from two of the most important biodiversity repositories, GenBank and GBIF, can be effectively combined to remotely address the problem of inaccuracy of taxonomic identifications in occurrence data repositories and to provide a filtering mechanism which can considerably reduce the number of voucher specimens that need critical revision, in this case from 4,672 to about 100."
https://openalex.org/W2293642207,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are expressed in rod photoreceptors and open in response to direct binding of cyclic nucleotides. We have previously shown that potentiation of CNGA1 channels by transition metals requires a histidine in the A′ helix following the S6 transmembrane segment. Here, we used transition metal ion FRET and patch clamp fluorometry with a fluorescent, noncanonical amino acid (3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (Anap)) to show that the potentiating transition metal Co2+ binds in or near the A′ helix. Adding high-affinity metal-binding sites to the membrane (stearoyl-nitrilotriacetic acid (C18-NTA)) increased potentiation for low Co2+ concentrations, indicating that the membrane can coordinate metal ions with the A′ helix. These results suggest that restraining the A′ helix to the plasma membrane potentiates CNGA1 channel opening. Similar interactions between the A′ helix and the plasma membrane may underlie regulation of structurally related hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and voltage-gated potassium subfamily H (KCNH) channels by plasma membrane components.

CNG channels are structurally similar to hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and voltage-gated potassium subfamily H (KCNH) channels (1.Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N.

The Eag family of K+ channels in Drosophila and mammals.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). They are composed of four subunits forming around the central ion-conducting pore (Fig. 1A). Each subunit has a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD), which is connected to the channel pore by a C-linker region (Fig. 1B) (9.Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Structural basis for modulation and agonist specificity of HCN pacemaker channels.Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar).

Although structural rearrangements of the CNBD have been extensively studied, rearrangements of the C-linker are less well understood. The C-linker is the site of virtually all of the intersubunit interactions in the C-terminal region. It is composed of several α helices, the most N-terminal of which is the A′ helix, directly following the S6 transmembrane segment (Fig. 1B) (9.Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Structural basis for modulation and agonist specificity of HCN pacemaker channels.Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Based on the structure of the isolated C-linker and CNBD of HCN2, the A′ helix is thought to run nearly parallel to the membrane near the cytosolic surface. The first evidence that the A′ helix plays a role in channel gating came from studies of transition metal ion effects on CNGA1 (rod) and CNGA2 (olfactory) channels. Micromolar concentrations of transition metals were found to potentiate activation of rod channels, increasing the currents in response to partial agonists and subsaturating concentrations of full agonists (10.Gordon S.E.

Interactions between divalent cations and the gating machinery of cyclic GMP-activated channels in salamander retinal rods.J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This effect was localized to a single histidine at position 420 in the A′ helix of CNGA1 channels (10.Gordon S.E. Zagotta W.N. A histidine residue associated with the gate of the cyclic nucleotide-activated channels in rod photoreceptors.Neuron. 1995; 14: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Similarly, a nearby histidine in the A′ helix of CNGA2 channels (equivalent to 417 in CNGA1) was required for transition metal inhibition in these channels (13.Gordon S.E. Zagotta W.N. Localization of regions affecting an allosteric transition in cyclic nucleotide-activated channels.Neuron. 1995; 14: 857-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The high apparent affinity for transition metal indicates that multiple ligands must coordinate metal ions to produce potentiation. Intersubunit coordination by multiple His-420 residues, however, cannot easily explain the high affinity for transition metal, as the x-ray crystal structure of the tetrameric C-linker and the CNBD of HCN2 shows these residues to be ∼30 Å apart (9.Zagotta W.N.

Structural basis for modulation and agonist specificity of HCN pacemaker channels.Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Whether His-420 interacts directly with the transition metal and what other ligands are involved remain unclear. One powerful method for measuring structural dynamics in proteins is transition metal ion Förster resonance energy transfer, or tmFRET (14.Horrocks Jr., W.D. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L.

Accurate high-throughput structure mapping and prediction with transition metal ion FRET.Structure. 2013; 21: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In tmFRET, a transition metal ion (Ni2+, Co2+, or Cu2+) serves as a FRET acceptor for a nearby fluorescent donor whose emission overlaps with the absorption of the metal ion. As a result, FRET between the fluorescent donor and the metal ion acceptor is observed as a quenching of donor fluorescence when the donor is near the metal. The degree of quenching is the FRET efficiency, which reports the distance between donor and acceptor. When compared with traditional FRET, tmFRET measures shorter distances (∼10–20 Å), does not have orientation dependence, and allows metal to bind reversibly to engineered binding sites within proteins or the membrane. In addition, different metals with varied absorption properties can be used to report different distance ranges, depending upon the amount of overlap with the fluorophore emission. A promising approach for specific labeling of channels is amber codon suppression to incorporate a fluorescent noncanonical amino acid. One such noncanonical amino acid is 3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (Anap), which is only slightly larger than a tryptophan residue (Fig. 1C) and has fluorescence in the visible range (Fig. 1D) (22.Chatterjee A.

Soc. 2009; 131: 12921-12923Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The size, fluorescent properties, and spectral overlap with the transition metal ion Co2+ (Fig. 1D), make Anap well suited for tmFRET measurements within ion channel proteins (24.Zagotta W.N. Gordon M.T. Senning E.N. Munari M.A. Gordon S.E. Measuring distances between TRPV1 and the plasma membrane using a noncanonical amino acid and transition metal ion FRET.J. Gen. Physiol. 2016; 147: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we combined tmFRET with patch clamp fluorometry (PCF) to study the mechanism of metal potentiation. We tested the hypothesis that, in CNGA1 channels, the A′ helix coordinates metal ions with a membrane-resident ligand. Using PCF, we measured metal binding with Anap fluorescence and simultaneously controlled and measured the channel function with patch clamp recording. We found that Co2+ quenched the fluorescence of Anap incorporated into a site in the A′ helix (position 417). The degree of quenching indicated that Co2+ binds close to Anap on the A′ helix. tmFRET between Co2+ and Anap at position 417 was not observed in H420Q channels, suggesting that Co2+ ions bind directly to His-420. Additionally, adding high-affinity metal ion-binding sites to the membrane enhanced potentiation in a His-420-dependent manner, supporting our hypothesis that a Co2+-binding site on the membrane participates in coordination. Taken together, these results indicate that restraining the A′ helix at His-420 near the membrane promotes channel opening. The bovine CNGA1 channel with a C-terminal YFP was cloned into the pGEMHE plasmid optimized for oocyte expression (25.Trudeau M.C. Zagotta W.N. Dynamics of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent inhibition of rod cyclic nucleotide-gated channels measured by patch-clamp fluorometry.J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C-terminal YFP constructs were used for all fluorescence experiments. Standard site-directed mutagenesis PCR techniques were used to make Q417tag and H420Q constructs. All regions that were subject to PCR were sequenced for verification (GENEWIZ, Seattle, WA). Channel RNA was transcribed in vitro from linearized DNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra transcription kit (Ambion, Thermo Fisher). Defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes, as described previously (26.Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W.

To express Anap aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and Anap tRNA, oocyte nuclei were injected with pAnap plasmid DNA (13-nl injection of 50 ng/μl; obtained from Addgene) (22.Chatterjee A. Guo J. Lee H.S. Schultz P.G. A genetically encoded fluorescent probe in mammalian cells.J. Am. Chem.

Dynamics of internal pore opening in KV channels probed by a fluorescent unnatural amino acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 8272-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For Anap incorporation, oocytes were incubated with l-Anap methyl ester (l-Anap-ME; 30 μm from 3 mm stock solution in EtOH stored at −20 °C; AsisChem, Waltham, MA) in the bath after injection until recording. Inside-out patches were excised from oocytes between 2 and 7 days after injection. The pipette (300–800 kilohms) and bath solutions each contained: 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2. Currents were recorded using EPC10 amplifier and PATCHMASTER software (HEKA Elektronik). For electrophysiology experiments in Figs. 2, 3, and 6, patches were held for ∼10 min before data acquisition to allow for run-up of currents. Currents with saturating ligand (1 mm cGMP or 16 mm cAMP) were leak-subtracted using identical voltage protocols in the absence of ligand to remove leak and any endogenous currents. For stearoyl-nitrilotriacetic acid (C18-NTA) experiments, oocytes were preincubated with 3 μm Co2+-C18-NTA (Toronto Research Chemicals (28.Gordon S.E. Senning E.N. Aman T.K. Zagotta W.N.

Some patches instead were directly perfused with 3 μm Co2+-C18-NTA; no differences were seen for the two application strategies of C18-NTA, and so the datasets were combined.

Anap was excited using epifluorescence with a Lambda SC SmartShutter controller (Sutter Instruments) and 376/30 nm excitation filter and 485/40 nm emission filter, and YFP was excited with 490/10 nm excitation filter and 535/30 nm emission filter. YFP fluorescence was used to focus on the patch. Before Anap image acquisition, patches were given five 1-s prebleaching exposures to remove a fast-decaying background signal, (see supplemental Fig. S1). Anap in channels was then imaged with 100-ms exposures using an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics) and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). To analyze patch fluorescence, a region of interest was drawn around the patch, and then background was subtracted using a similar region of interest in an area of the pipette not containing the patch. For quenching experiments, 100–1000-ms exposures were used, and fluorescence was normalized to a control image. Patches were only used if currents were >1 nA and patches did not contain any yolk granules, which were fluorescent. Only ∼5–10% of patches fulfilled these requirements. l-Anap-ME was dissolved at 100 nm in a buffer used for electrophysiology. Spectra were acquired with a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer with FluorEssence software (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). For the Anap emission spectrum, the excitation wavelength was 360 nm with a 5-nm slit width, and emission was measured in 1-nm increments from 425 to 600 nm. For the Anap excitation spectrum, emission was measured at 490 nm (5-nm slit window) and excited from 260 to 450 nm (2-nm slit window). Co2+ absorption spectrum is of Co2+ coordinated by two histidines in a peptide and was previously published (29.Puljung M.C. Zagotta W.N.

For comparisons across multiple conditions, a two-way analysis of variance was computed using Origin software. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using IgorPro. It has been shown previously that several transition metal ions potentiate opening of CNGA1 channels, greatly increasing the current with the partial agonist cAMP or subsaturating concentrations of the full agonist cGMP (10.Gordon S.E.

For fluorescence experiments, we used CNGA1 channels fused to a C-terminal YFP (25.Trudeau M.C. Zagotta W.N. Dynamics of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent inhibition of rod cyclic nucleotide-gated channels measured by patch-clamp fluorometry.J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the transition metal Co2+, which was shown to be an optimal FRET acceptor for Anap (24.Zagotta W.N. Gordon M.T. Senning E.N. Munari M.A. Gordon S.E. Measuring distances between TRPV1 and the plasma membrane using a noncanonical amino acid and transition metal ion FRET.J. Gen. Physiol. 2016; 147: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We characterized potentiation by Co2+ by measuring CNGA1 currents in response to saturating concentrations of the partial agonist cAMP (16 mm) relative to the full agonist cGMP (1 mm) (IcAMP/IcGMP). Inside-out excised patches were held at a holding potential of 0 mV, and current was driven through open channels using steps to ±60 mV. In wild-type CNGA1 (CNGA1-WT) channels, saturating cAMP (Fig. 2A, top, red traces) elicited only a small fraction of current when compared with saturating cGMP (Fig. 2A, top, green traces). With the addition of 1–10 μm Co2+, however, the cAMP-activated current increased relative to the cGMP-activated current in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, top, blue traces). The increase of cAMP-activated current reversed upon removal of Co2+ from the bath and the addition of EDTA (data not shown). These results are summarized in Fig. 2B (white bars), where 1, 3, and 10 μm Co2+ increased IcAMP/IcGMP relative to that measured in EDTA. The extent of potentiation with 10 μm Co2+ is consistent with previous reports of CNGA1-WT channel potentiation with Ni2+ (10.Gordon S.E. Zagotta W.N. A histidine residue associated with the gate of the cyclic nucleotide-activated channels in rod photoreceptors.Neuron. 1995; 14: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, Co2+ potentiation of CNGA1-WT channels without and with C-terminal YFP was indistinguishable (IcAMP/IcGMP = 38.6 ± 5.1% without and 35.4 ± 3.1% with C-terminal YFP), and was combined in the CNGA1-WT condition. We conclude that Co2+ is an adequate transition metal for examination of metal potentiation in CNGA1 channels. We have previously shown that a histidine on the A′ helix at position 420 is required for metal potentiation (10.Gordon S.E. Zagotta W.N. A histidine residue associated with the gate of the cyclic nucleotide-activated channels in rod photoreceptors.Neuron. 1995; 14: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We tested whether the mutation of this residue (H420Q) eliminated potentiation by Co2+. As shown in Fig. 2A (bottom traces), no potentiation was observed with three Co2+ concentrations for CNGA1-H420Q channels. IcAMP/IcGMP was slightly elevated in CNGA1-H420Q when compared with CNGA1-WT channels, but no potentiation was measured with the addition of Co2+ (Fig. 2B, gray bars). The effect of Co2+ on IcAMP/IcGMP current was significantly greater for CNGA1-WT versus CNGA1-H420Q channels (two-way analysis of variance significant interaction: F(3, 58) = 60.07, p < 0.01). These results indicate that His-420 is necessary for potentiation by Co2+ ions. To test whether His-420 represents part of the binding site for Co2+, we used tmFRET to determine whether the potentiating Co2+ would quench a fluorophore near His-420 on the A′ helix. This approach requires the specific labeling of the A′ helix with a fluorophore. To do this, we incorporated the fluorescent noncanonical amino acid, Anap (Fig. 1C), at position 417 using amber codon suppression (23.Lee H.S. Guo J. Lemke E.A. Dimla R.D. Schultz P.G. Genetic incorporation of a small, environmentally sensitive, fluorescent probe into proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 12921-12923Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The nuclei of Xenopus oocytes were injected with plasmid DNA encoding an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl tRNA synthetase pair developed previously for Anap (pAnap) (22.Chatterjee A. Guo J. Lee H.S.

Dynamics of internal pore opening in KV channels probed by a fluorescent unnatural amino acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 8272-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We also injected cRNA encoding CNGA1 with a TAG codon at position 417 (CNGA1-Q417tag) into the cytoplasm of these same oocytes. The oocytes were then cultured in medium containing l-Anap-ME, a cell-permeable form of Anap. We tested whether Anap incorporated at position 417 on the A′ helix expressed as functional, cyclic nucleotide-activated channels with properties similar to wild-type channels. Fig. 3B shows examples of currents from inside-out patches activated by 1 mm cGMP. CNGA1-WT channels produced large (∼5–30 nA) currents (Fig. 3B, top left; Fig. 3C, left column, circles). When expressing CNGA1-Q417tag alone (without pAnap), no cyclic nucleotide-activated current was detected (Fig. 3B, top right; Fig. 3C, second column). In addition, no cyclic nucleotide-activated current was detected when pAnap was coexpressed with CNGA1-Q417tag, but l-Anap-ME was omitted from the culture medium (Fig. 3B, left bottom; Fig. 3C, third column). In contrast, coexpression of CNGA1-Q417tag and pAnap in oocytes cultured in l-Anap-containing medium produced robust, cyclic nucleotide-activated currents (Fig. 3B, bottom right; Fig. 3C, right column). These data indicate that l-Anap was specifically incorporated at position 417 and that the l-Anap-incorporated channels were functional (CNGA1-Q417Anap channels). Although mean current amplitude from CNGA1-Q417Anap channels was reduced by ∼80% when compared with CNGA1-WT channels (Fig. 3C, black bars), many patches had large currents. Additionally, we measured the cGMP dependence of CNGA1-Q417Anap channels (Fig. 3D) and found that it was not different from CNGA1-WT channels (average EC50 at +60 mV for cGMP: CNGA1-WT, 45.4 ± 4.0 μm, n = 5 versus CNGA1-Q417tag, 55.1 ± 4.8 μm, n = 5, p > 0.05). We conclude that CNGA1-Q417Anap channels behave similarly to CNGA1-WT channels. To determine whether Anap fluorescence from patches was sufficient for PCF, we examined the fluorescent properties of CNGA1 channels with Anap in inside-out patches. We used channels fused to a C-terminal YFP to find and focus on the patch. We observed YFP fluorescence in patches expressing CNGA1-WT and CNGA1-Q417Anap (Fig. 4A, middle). Interestingly, fluorescence in the Anap color channel was observed in patches from cells cultured with l-Anap-ME in the medium but not injected with pAnap or CNGA1 cRNA (supplemental Fig. S1). This nonspecific fluorescence has also been reported for mammalian cells culture"

Therefore, cell supplementation therapy is possible cartilage repair method. However, few studies have verified the efficacy and safety of cell supplementation therapy. The current study assessed the effect of exercise on early the phase of cartilage repair following cell supplementation utilizing mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) intra-articular injection. An osteochondral defect was created on the femoral grooves bilaterally of Wistar rats. Mesenchymal stromal cells that were obtained from male Wistar rats were cultured in monolayer. After 4 weeks, MSCs were injected into the right knee joint and the rats were randomized into an exercise or no-exercise intervention group. The femurs were divided as follows: C group (no exercise without MSC injection); E group (exercise without MSC injection); M group (no exercise with MSC injection); and ME group (exercise with MSC injection). At 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the injection, the femurs were sectioned and histologically graded using the Wakitani cartilage repair scoring system. At 2 weeks after the injection, the total histological scores of the M and ME groups improved significantly compared with those of the C group. Four weeks after the injection, the scores of both the M and ME groups improved significantly. Additionally, the scores in the ME group showed a significant improvement compared to those in the M group. The improvement in the scores of the E, M, and ME groups at 8 weeks were not significantly different. The findings indicate that exercise may enhance cartilage repair after an MSC intra-articular injection. This study highlights the importance of exercise following cell transplantation therapy."

To understand the molecular basis underlying the response to fasting, Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 was used to analyze the liver transcriptome of fasting large yellow croakers. A total of 54,933,550 clean reads were obtained and assembled into 110,364 contigs. Annotation to the NCBI database identified a total of 38,728 unigenes, of which 19,654 were classified into Gene Ontology and 22,683 were found in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Comparative analysis of the expression profiles between fasting fish and normal-feeding fish identified a total of 7,623 differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05), including 2,500 upregulated genes and 5,123 downregulated genes. Dramatic differences were observed in the genes involved in metabolic pathways such as fat digestion and absorption, citrate cycle, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the similar results were also found in the transcriptome of skeletal muscle. Further qPCR analysis confirmed that the genes encoding the factors involved in those pathways significantly changed in terms of expression levels. The results of the present study provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic response of the large yellow croaker to fasting as well as identified areas that require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2292984041,"This paper addresses how to determine a sufficient frame (sampling) rate for an optical motion tracking system using passive reflective markers. When using passive markers for the optical motion tracking, avoiding identity confusion between the markers becomes a problem as the speed of motion increases, necessitating a higher frame rate to avoid a failure of the motion tracking caused by marker confusions and/or dropouts. Initially, one might believe that the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate estimated from the assumed maximal temporal variation of a motion (i.e. a sampling rate at least twice that of the maximum motion frequency) could be the complete solution to the problem. However, this paper shows that also the spatial distance between the markers should be taken into account in determining the suitable frame rate of an optical motion tracking with passive markers. In this paper, a frame rate criterion for the optical tracking using passive markers is theoretically derived and also experimentally verified using a high-quality optical motion tracking system. Both the theoretical and the experimental results showed that the minimum frame rate is proportional to the ratio between the maximum speed of the motion and the minimum spacing between markers, and may also be predicted precisely if the proportional constant is known in advance. The inverse of the proportional constant is here defined as the tracking efficiency constant and it can be easily determined with some test measurements. Moreover, this newly defined constant can provide a new way of evaluating the tracking algorithm performance of an optical tracking system."
https://openalex.org/W2293969449,"With the emergence of the Web of Data, there is a need of tools for searching and exploring the growing amount of semantic data. Unfortunately, such tools are scarce and typically require knowledge of SPARQL/RDF. We propose here PepeSearch, a portable tool for searching semantic datasets devised for mainstream users. PepeSearch offers a multi-class search form automatically constructed from a SPARQL endpoint. We have tested PepeSearch with 15 participants searching a Linked Open Data version of the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises for non-trivial challenges. Retrieval performance was encouragingly high and usability ratings were also very positive, thus suggesting that PepeSearch is effective for searching semantic datasets by mainstream users. We also assessed its portability by configuring PepeSearch to query other SPARQL endpoints."
https://openalex.org/W2295566422,"We used Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) of individual species of two taxonomic groups (plants and birds) in order to reconstruct the climatic distribution of Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) in Mexico and to analyze their boundaries with other terrestrial ecosystems. The reconstruction for TDFs’ distribution was analyzed considering the prediction and omission errors based upon the combination of species, obtained from the overlap of individual models (only plants, only birds, and all species combined). Two verifications were used: a primary vegetation map and 100 independent TDFs localities. We performed a Principal Component (PCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) to evaluate the variation in the environmental variables and ecological overlap among ecosystems. The modeling strategies showed differences in the ecological patterns and prediction areas, where the “all species combined” model (with a threshold of ≥10 species) was the best strategy to use in the TDFs reconstruction. We observed a concordance of 78% with the primary vegetation map and a prediction of 98% of independent locality records. Although PCA and DA tests explained 75.78% and 97.9% of variance observed, respectively, we observed an important overlap among the TDFs with other adjacent ecosystems, confirming the existence of transition zones among them. We successfully modeled the distribution of Mexican TDFs using a number of bioclimatic variables and co-distributed species. This autoecological niche approach suggests the necessity of rethinking the delimitations of ecosystems based on the recognition of transition zones among them in order to understand the real nature of communities and association patterns of species."

Although much funding has been invested in front line community-based organisations (CBO), there was no equal investment in evaluations. This study was set up to compare children aged 9-13 years old, randomly sampled from two South African provinces, who had not received CBO support over time (YC) with a group of similarly aged children who were CBO attenders (CCC). YC baseline refusal rate was 2.5% and retention rate was 97%. CCC baseline refusal rate was 0.7% and retention rate was 86.5%. 1848 children were included-446 CBO attenders compared to 1402 9-13 year olds drawn from a random sample of high-HIV prevalence areas. Data were gathered at baseline and 12-15 months follow-up. Standardised measures recorded demographics, violence and abuse, mental health, social and educational factors. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that children attending CBOs had lower odds of experiencing weekly domestic conflict between adults in their home (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.09, 0.32), domestic violence (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.08, 0.62), or abuse (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.05, 0.25) at follow-up compared to participants without CBO contact. CBO attenders had lower odds of suicidal ideation (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18, 0.91), fewer depressive symptoms (B = -0.40; 95% CI -0.62, -0.17), less perceived stigma (B = -0.37; 95% CI -0.57, -0.18), fewer peer problems (B = -1.08; 95% CI -1.29, -0.86) and fewer conduct problems (B = -0.77; 95% CI -0.95, -0.60) at follow-up. In addition, CBO contact was associated with more prosocial behaviours at follow-up (B = 1.40; 95% CI 1.13, 1.67). No associations were observed between CBO contact and parental praise or post-traumatic symptoms. These results suggest that CBO exposure is associated with behavioural and mental health benefits for children over time. More severe psychopathology was not affected by attendance and may need more specialised input."
https://openalex.org/W2294425874,"The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is responsible for the downstream expression of over 60 genes that regulate cell survival and metabolism in hypoxic conditions as well as those that enhance angiogenesis to alleviate hypoxia. However, under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase 2, and subsequently degraded, with a biological half-life of less than five minutes. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting HIF-1α degradation through short hairpin RNA silencing of PHD-2 in the setting of diabetic wounds and limb ischemia. Treatment of diabetic mouse fibroblasts with shPHD-2 in vitro resulted in decreased levels of PHD-2 transcript demonstrated by qRT-PCR, higher levels of HIF-1α as measured by western blot, and higher expression of the downstream angiogenic genes SDF-1 and VEGFα, as measured by qRT-PCR. In vivo, shPHD-2 accelerated healing of full thickness excisional wounds in diabetic mice compared to shScr control, (14.33 ± 0.45 days vs. 19 ± 0.33 days) and was associated with an increased vascular density. Delivery of shPHD-2 also resulted in improved perfusion of ischemic hind limbs compared to shScr, prevention of distal digit tip necrosis, and increased survival of muscle tissue. Knockdown of PHD-2 through shRNA treatment has the potential to stimulate angiogenesis through overexpression of HIF-1α and upregulation of pro-angiogenic genes downstream of HIF-1α, and may represent a viable, non-viral approach to gene therapy for ischemia related applications."
https://openalex.org/W2294871508,"Autoantibodies directed against endogenous proteins including contractile proteins and endothelial antigens are frequently detected in patients with heart failure and after heart transplantation. There is evidence that these autoantibodies contribute to cardiac dysfunction and correlate with clinical outcomes. Currently, autoantibodies are detected in patient sera using individual ELISA assays (one for each antigen). Thus, screening for many individual autoantibodies is laborious and consumes a large amount of patient sample. To better capture the broad-scale antibody reactivities that occur in heart failure and post-transplant, we developed a custom antigen microarray technique that can simultaneously measure IgM and IgG reactivities against 64 unique antigens using just five microliters of patient serum. We first demonstrated that our antigen microarray technique displayed enhanced sensitivity to detect autoantibodies compared to the traditional ELISA method. We then piloted this technique using two sets of samples that were obtained at our institution. In the first retrospective study, we profiled pre-transplant sera from 24 heart failure patients who subsequently received heart transplants. We identified 8 antibody reactivities that were higher in patients who developed cellular rejection (2 or more episodes of grade 2R rejection in first year after transplant as defined by revised criteria from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation) compared with those who did have not have rejection episodes. In a second retrospective study with 31 patients, we identified 7 IgM reactivities that were higher in heart transplant recipients who developed antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) compared with control recipients, and in time course studies, these reactivities appeared prior to overt graft dysfunction. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the autoantibody microarray technique outperforms traditional ELISAs as it uses less patient sample, has increased sensitivity, and can detect autoantibodies in a multiplex fashion. Furthermore, our results suggest that this autoantibody array technology may help to identify patients at risk of rejection following heart transplantation and identify heart transplant recipients with AMR."
https://openalex.org/W2295687539,"Background In service to its core mission of improving the health and well-being of veterans, Veterans Affairs (VA) leadership is committed to supporting research best practices in the VA. Recognizing that the behavior of researchers is influenced by the organizational climates in which they work, efforts to assess the integrity of research climates and share such information with research leadership in VA may be one way to support research best practices. The Survey of Organizational Research Climate (SOuRCe) is the first validated survey instrument specifically designed to assess the organizational climate of research integrity in academic research organizations. The current study reports on an initiative to use the SOuRCe in VA facilities to characterize the organizational research climates and pilot test the effectiveness of using SOuRCe data as a reporting and feedback intervention tool. Methods We administered the SOuRCe using a cross-sectional, online survey, with mailed follow-up to non-responders, of research-engaged employees in the research services of a random selection of 42 VA facilities (e.g., Hospitals/Stations) believed to employ 20 or more research staff. We attained a 51% participation rate, yielding more than 5,200 usable surveys. Results We found a general consistency in organizational research climates across a variety of sub-groups in this random sample of research services in the VA. We also observed similar SOuRCe scale score means, relative rankings of these scales and their internal reliability, in this VA-based sample as we have previously documented in more traditional academic research settings. Results also showed more substantial variability in research climate scores within than between facilities in the VA research service as reflected in meaningful subgroup differences. These findings suggest that the SOuRCe is suitable as an instrument for assessing the research integrity climates in VA and that the tool has similar patterns of results that have been observed in more traditional academic research settings. Conclusions The local and specific nature of organizational climates in VA research services, as reflected in variability across sub-groups within individual facilities, has important policy implications. Global, “one-size-fits-all” type initiatives are not likely to yield as much benefit as efforts targeted to specific organizational units or sub-groups and tailored to the specific strengths and weaknesses documented in those locations."
https://openalex.org/W2293096627,"Alcohol-dependence is a chronic disease with a dramatic and expensive social impact. Previous studies have indicated that the blockade of two monoaminergic receptors, α1b-adrenergic and 5-HT2A, could inhibit the development of behavioral sensitization to drugs of abuse, a hallmark of drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors in rodents. Here, in order to develop a potential therapeutic treatment of alcohol dependence in humans, we have blocked these two monoaminergic receptors by a combination of antagonists already approved by Health Agencies. We show that the association of ifenprodil (1 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (1 mg/kg) (α1-adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists marketed as Vadilex ® and Periactine ® in France, respectively) blocks behavioral sensitization to amphetamine in C57Bl6 mice and to alcohol in DBA2 mice. Moreover, this combination of antagonists inhibits alcohol intake in mice habituated to alcohol (10% v/v) and reverses their alcohol preference. Finally, in order to verify that the effect of ifenprodil was not due to its anti-NMDA receptors property, we have shown that a combination of prazosin (0.5 mg/kg, an α1b-adrenergic antagonist, Mini-Press ® in France) and cyproheptadine (1 mg/kg) could also reverse alcohol preference. Altogether these findings strongly suggest that combined prazosin and cyproheptadine could be efficient as a therapy to treat alcoholism in humans. Finally, because α1b-adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors blockade also inhibits behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants, opioids and tobacco, it cannot be excluded that this combination will exhibit some efficacy in the treatment of addiction to other abused drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2294422040,"Obesity is a major risk factor to develop heart failure, in part due to possible lipotoxic effects of increased intramyocardial (MYCL) and/or local or paracrine effects of pericardial (PERI) lipid accumulation. Recent evidence suggests that MYCL is highly dynamic and might rather be a surrogate marker for disturbed energy metabolism than the underlying cause of cardiac dysfunction. On the other hand, PERI might contribute directly by mechanic and paracrine effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that PERI rather than MYCL is associated with myocardial function.To avoid potential confounding of metabolic disease 31 metabolically healthy subjects (age: 29±10yrs; BMI: 23±3kg/m2) were investigated using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. MYCL and PERI, as well as systolic and diastolic left ventricular heart function were assessed. Additionally, anthropometric data and parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism were analyzed. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Linear regression model was used to show individual effects of PERI and MYCL on myocardial functional parameters.Correlation analysis with parameters of systolic heart function revealed significant associations for PERI (Stroke Volume (SV): R = -0.513 p = 0.001; CardiacIndex (CI): R = -0.442 p = 0.014), but not for MYCL (SV: R = -0.233; p = 0.207; CI: R = -0.130; p = 0.484). No significant correlations were found for E/A ratio as a parameter of diastolic heart function. In multiple regression analysis CI was negatively predicted by PERI, whereas no impact of MYCL was observed in direct comparison.Cardiac fat depots impact left ventricular heart function in a metabolically healthy population. Direct comparison of different lipid stores revealed that PERI is a more important predictor than MYCL for altered myocardial function."

A 96-well microplate coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG was incubated with the methanol extracts of Chaihu samples and a mouse anti-SSa monoclonal antibody, and a Eu3+-labeled SSa-human serum albumin conjugate was used as the tracer. The established competitive TRFIA showed a good fourth order polynomial fitting from 0.01 to 10.0 μg/mL for standard SSa sample with a detection limit of 0.006 μg/mL. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of the assay were 7.3% and 8.9%, respectively, and the average SSa recovery was 119.2%. For samples of Chaihu extract, the results of this assay showed a good correlation with those by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay established previously. This TRFIA system is ultrasensitive for detecting SSa with a wide detection range and a good stability and represents the first attempt of using TRFIA for quality evaluation of the crude drug of Chaihu."

Then, Dun1 forkhead-associated (FHA) domain recognizes a diphosphothreonine motif in hyperphosphorylated Rad53 kinase that facilitates Rad53-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the Dun1 kinase (14Pike B.L.

Finally, Dun1 promotes RNR function through multiple mechanisms. Dun1 hyperphosphorylates the Crt1 transcriptional repressor, which is released from the promoter regions of RNR2–4 genes resulting in transcriptional derepression (18Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. The DNA replication and damage checkpoint pathways induce transcription by inhibition of the Crt1 repressor.Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Genotoxic stress also increases Rnr1 protein levels through a Rad53-dependent but Dun1-independent transcriptional RNR1 activation mechanism (19Tsaponina O. Barsoum E. Aström S.U. Chabes A. Ixr1 is required for the expression of the ribonucleotide reductase Rnr1 and maintenance of dNTP pools.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7e1002061Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, after DNA damage or during S phase, the Mec1/Rad53/Dun1 signaling cascade relieves Sml1 inhibition of RNR by promoting Sml1 phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and degradation by the 26S proteasome (20Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R.

Finally, another checkpoint-dependent mechanism facilitates redistribution of Rnr2 and Rnr4 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where Rnr1 resides, in response to genotoxic stress (24Yao R. Zhang Z.

In this case, Dun1 kinase promotes Rnr2-Rnr4 heterodimer dissociation from its nuclear anchor protein Wtm1, and in the meantime prevents Rnr2-Rnr4 nuclear import by phosphorylating its importer protein Dif1 targeting it for degradation (17Lee Y.D.

S. cerevisiae is widely used as a model organism to study the response of eukaryotic cells to iron deficiency. Upon iron depletion, yeast Aft1 transcription factor activates the expression of genes encoding high-affinity iron transport systems and Cth2, an RNA-binding protein that facilitates the coordinated degradation of many mRNAs encoding proteins implicated in iron-consuming pathways (37Martínez-Pastor M.

Biol. 2011; 31: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated that Aft1 does not directly perceive intracellular or environmental iron concentration. Instead Aft1 activity is inhibited by an iron-compound synthesized by the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis core and exported to the cytoplasm (43Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. Transcription of the yeast iron regulon does not respond directly to iron but rather to iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.J. Biol.

Mutants defective in components of the mitochondrial ISC biogenesis core activate Aft1-dependent responses to iron deficiency, whereas no activation is observed in cells defective in components of the cytoplasmic iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, responsible for delivering iron-sulfur cofactors to other iron-dependent proteins (43Chen O.S.

During the past years, we have used S. cerevisiae to characterize RNR regulation by iron availability. We have demonstrated that the Cth2 RNA-binding protein specifically interacts with the WTM1 transcript and facilitates its degradation (46Sanvisens N. Bañó M.C. Huang M. Puig S. Regulation of ribonucleotide reductase in response to iron deficiency.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The resulting decrease in Wtm1 protein abundance promotes Rnr2-Rnr4 relocalization to the cytoplasm and dNTP synthesis (46Sanvisens N. Bañó M.C. Huang M. Puig S. Regulation of ribonucleotide reductase in response to iron deficiency.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have reported that, in response to iron deficiency, Dun1 checkpoint kinase induces degradation of the Rnr1 inhibitor protein Sml1, promoting RNR activity (47Sanvisens N. Romero A.M. An X. Zhang C. de Llanos R. Martínez-Pastor M.T. Bañó M.C. Huang M. Puig S. Yeast Dun1 kinase regulates ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor Sml1 in response to iron deficiency.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 3259-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we uncover novel mechanisms that eukaryotic cells utilize to optimize RNR function when iron bioavailability diminishes. We show that the Dun1 checkpoint kinase contributes to Rnr2-Rnr4 redistribution to the cytoplasm when iron bioavailability is limited. Furthermore, we decipher that Dun1 modulates Rnr2-Rnr4 subcellular localization during iron deficiency by phosphorylating specific Dif1 residues. In this study, we have used dun1Δ (dun1::KanMX4), fet3Δfet4Δ (fet3::URA3, fet4::KanMX4), and fet3Δfet4Δdun1Δ (fet3::URA3, fet4::KanMX4, dun1::KanMX4) S. cerevisiae strains derived from wild-type BY4741 (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0) and dif1Δ (dif1::KanMX4) derived from wild-type Y300 (MATa, can1–100, ade2-1, his3–11,15, leu2–3,112, trp1–1, ura3-1, lys12). Yeast precultures were incubated overnight at 30 °C in synthetic complete SC medium lacking uracil (SC-ura), tryptophan (SC-trp), or leucine (SC-leu), and then reinoculated in SC at A600 nm = 0.35. To regulate iron availability yeast cells were incubated between 6 and 8 h in SC (iron-sufficient conditions) or SC supplemented with 100 μm Fe2+-specific chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid disodium (BPS) (iron-deficient conditions) before processing. Treatment with either 0.04% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or 0.2 m hydroxyurea (HU) was performed during the last 2 h of SC incubation. Plasmids expressing different DIF1 alleles were constructed as previously described (27Wu X. Huang M.

Cells were analyzed in an Axioskop 2 microscope (Zeiss) and images captured with a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). In all cases, more than 200 cells from at least 3 independent experiments were scored as cells with a predominantly nuclear signal, localization in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, or a predominantly cytoplasmic signal. Average and S.D. were represented. Total protein extracts were obtained by using glass beads disruption in 20% trichloroacetic acid as described (48An X. Zhang Z. Yang K. Huang M.

Protein extracts from an equal number of cells were separated in SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Ponceau S staining was used to assess protein transfer and loading. Epitope-tagged 3Myc-Dif1 protein was detected with monoclonal mouse anti-c-myc antibody (9E10, Roche Applied Science).

https://openalex.org/W2295564407,"Recent reports have shown that cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) are expressed in pancreatic β cells, where they induce cell death and cell cycle arrest by directly inhibiting insulin receptor activation. Here, we report that CB1Rs regulate the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and cell cycle regulator cyclin D2 in pancreatic β cells. Treatment of MIN6 and βTC6 cells with a synthetic CB1R agonist, WIN55,212-2, led to a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 and cyclin D2, in turn inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Additionally, genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of CB1Rs after injury in mice led to increased levels of Bcl-2 and cyclin D2 in pancreatic β cells. These findings provide evidence for the involvement of Bcl-2 and cyclin D2 mediated by CB1Rs in the regulation of β-cell survival and growth, and will serve as a basis for developing new therapeutic interventions to enhance β-cell function and growth in diabetes."

These images included a set of 140kVp polychromatic images and the default 70keV monochromatic images. Using the standard Gemstone Spectral Imaging (GSI) viewer on an advanced workstation (AW4.6,GE Healthcare), an optimal energy level (in keV) for obtaining the best contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the artery could be automatically obtained. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), CNR and objective image quality score (1-5) for these 3 image sets (140kVp, 70keV and optimal energy level) were obtained and, statistically compared. The image quality score consistency between the two observers was also evaluated using Kappa test.The optimal energy levels for obtaining the best CNR were 62.58±2.74keV.SNR and CNR from the 140kVp polychromatic, 70keV and optimal keV monochromatic images were (16.44±5.85, 13.24±5.52), (20.79±7.45, 16.69±6.27) and (24.9±9.91, 20.53±8.46), respectively. The corresponding subjective image quality scores were 1.97±0.82, 3.24±0.75, and 4.47±0.60. SNR, CNR and subjective scores had significant difference among groups (all p<0.001). The optimal keV monochromatic images were superior to the 70keV monochromatic and 140kVp polychromatic images, and there was high agreement between the two observers on image quality score (kappa>0.80).Virtual monochromatic images at approximately 63keV in dual-energy spectral CT pulmonary angiography yielded the best CNR and highest diagnostic confidence for imaging bronchial arteries."

In this manuscript we have constructed the 3D surface using 2D Computerized Tomography (CT) scan contours. The fracture part of the cranial vault are reconstructed using GC1 rational cubic Ball curve with three free parameters, later the 2D contours are flipped into 3D with equidistant z component. The constructed surface is represented by contours blending interpolant. At the end of this manuscript a case report of parietal bone fracture is also illustrated by employing this method with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) illustration."
https://openalex.org/W2294830053,"The minimum dose required to cause infection of Romney and Suffolk sheep of the ARQ/ARQ or ARQ/ARR prion protein gene genotypes following oral inoculation with Romney or Suffolk a sheep Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-derived or cattle BSE-derived agent was investigated using doses ranging from 0.0005g to 5g. ARQ/ARQ sheep which were methionine (M) / threonine (T) heterozygous or T/T homozygous at codon 112 of the Prnp gene, dosed ARQ/ARR sheep and undosed controls did not show any evidence of infection. Within groups of susceptible sheep, the minimum effective oral dose of BSE was found to be 0.05g, with higher attack rates following inoculation with the 5g dose. Surprisingly, this study found no effect of dose on survival time suggesting a possible lack of homogeneity within the inoculum. All clinical BSE cases showed PrPd accumulation in brain; however, following cattle BSE inoculation, LRS involvement within Romney recipients was found to be significantly lower than within the Suffolk sheep inoculated group which is in agreement with previous reports."
https://openalex.org/W2386806034,"Rab GTPases are critical regulators of membrane trafficking. The canonical view is that Rabs are soluble in their inactive GDP-bound form, and only upon activation and conversion to their GTP-bound state are they anchored to membranes through membrane insertion of a C-terminal prenyl group. Here we demonstrate that C-terminal prenylation is not required for Rab13 to associate with and traffic on vesicles. Instead, inactive Rab13 appears to associate with vesicles via protein-protein interactions. Only following activation does Rab13 associate with the plasma membrane, presumably with insertion of the C-terminal prenyl group into the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2293244152,"Fundamental to the potential utilisation of heart rate variability (HRV) indices as a prognostic tool is the reproducibility of these measures. The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate the reproducibility of 24-hour derived HRV indices in a clinical paediatric population. Eighteen children (10 boys; 12.4 ± 2.8 years) with mild to moderate Cystic Fibrosis (CF; FVC: 83 ± 12% predicted; FEV1: 80 ± 9% predicted) and eighteen age- and sex-matched controls (10 boys; 12.5 ± 2.7 years) wore a combined ECG and accelerometer for two consecutive days. Standard time and frequency domain indices of HRV were subsequently derived. Reproducibility was assessed by Bland-Altman plots, 95% limits of agreement and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). In both groups, there was no systematic difference between days, with the variables demonstrating a symmetrical, homoscedastic distribution around the zero line. The time domain parameters demonstrated a good to excellent reproducibility irrespective of the population considered (ICC: 0.56 to 0.86). In contrast, whilst the frequency domain parameters similarly showed excellent reproducibility in the healthy children (ICC: 0.70 to 0.96), the majority of the frequency domain parameters illustrated a poor to moderate reproducibility in those with CF (ICC: 0.22 to 0.43). The exceptions to this trend were the normalised LF and HF components which were associated with a good to excellent reproducibility. These findings thereby support the utilisation of time and relative frequency domain HRV indices as a prognostic tool in children with CF. Furthermore, the present results highlight the excellent reproducibility of HRV in healthy children, indicating that this may be a useful tool to assess intervention effectiveness in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2302236701,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plays an important role in ocular development. Previous studies found that retinoic acid could influence the metabolism of scleral remodeling by promoting retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to secrete secondary signaling factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether retinoic acid affected secretion of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and to explore the signaling pathway of retinoic acid in cultured acute retinal pigment epithelial 19 (ARPE-19) cells.The effects of ATRA (concentrations from 10-9 to 10-5 mol/l) on the expression of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) in ARPE-19 cells were examined at the mRNA and protein levels using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot assay, respectively. The effects of treating ARPE-19 cells with ATRA concentrations ranging from 10-9 to 10-5 mol/l for 24 h and 48 h or with 10-6mol/l ATRA at different times ranging from 6h to 72h were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The contribution of RARβ-induced activation of ARPE-19 cells was confirmed using LE135, an antagonist of RARβ.RARβ mRNA levels significantly increased in the ARPE-19 cells treated with ATRA for 24h and 48h. These increases in RARβ mRNA levels were dose dependent (at concentrations of 10-9 to 10-5 mol/l) with a maximum effect observed at 10-6 mol/l. There were no significant changes in the mRNA levels of RARα and RARγ. Western blot assay revealed that RARβ protein levels were increased significantly in a time-dependent manner in ARPE-19 cells treated with 10-6 mol/l ATRA from 12 h to 72 h, with a marked increase observed at 24 h and 48 h. The upregulation of RARβ and the ATRA-induced secretion in ARPE-19 cells could be inhibited by the RARβ antagonist LE135.ATRA induced upregulation of RARβ in ARPE-19 cells and stimulated these cells to secrete BMP-2 and MMP-2."
https://openalex.org/W2295787383,"We explore a new method for identifying leaders and followers, LF, in repeated games by analyzing an experimental, repeated (50 rounds) game where Row player shifts the payoff between small and large values–a type of “investor” and Column player determines who gets the payoff–a type of “manager”. We found that i) the Investor (Row) most often is a leading player and the manager (Column) a follower. The longer the Investor leads the game, the higher is both player’s payoff. Surprisingly however, it is always the Manager that achieves the largest payoff. ii) The game has an efficient cooperative strategy where the players alternate in receiving a high payoff, but the players never identify, or accept, that strategy. iii) Under the assumption that the information used by the players is closely associated with the leader- follower sequence, and that information is available before the player’s decisions are made, the players switched LF- strategy primarily as a function of information on the Investor’s investment and moves and secondly as a function of the Manager’s payoff."
https://openalex.org/W2295531029,"Motor deficits are linked to a range of negative physical, social and academic consequences. Haptic robotic interventions, based on the principles of sensorimotor learning, have been shown previously to help children with motor problems learn new movements. We therefore examined whether the training benefits of a robotic system would generalise to a standardised test of ‘pen-skills’, assessed using objective kinematic measures [via the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool, CKAT]. A counterbalanced, cross-over design was used in a group of 51 children (37 male, aged 5–11 years) with manual control difficulties. Improved performance on a novel task using the robotic device could be attributed to the intervention but there was no evidence of generalisation to any of the CKAT tasks. The robotic system appears to have the potential to support motor learning, with the technology affording numerous advantages. However, the training regime may need to target particular manual skills (e.g. letter formation) in order to obtain clinically significant improvements in specific skills such as handwriting."
https://openalex.org/W2296765310,"The tumor suppressors Retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 are frequently inactivated in liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) or infections with Hepatitis B or C viruses. Here, we discovered a novel role for Rb and p53 in xenobiotic metabolism, which represent a key function of the liver for metabolizing therapeutic drugs or toxins. We demonstrate that Rb and p53 cooperate to metabolize the xenobiotic 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC). DDC is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (Cyp)3a enzymes resulting in inhibition of heme synthesis and accumulation of protoporphyrin, an intermediate of heme pathway. Protoporphyrin accumulation causes bile injury and ductular reaction. We show that loss of Rb and p53 resulted in reduced Cyp3a expression decreased accumulation of protoporphyrin and consequently less ductular reaction in livers of mice fed with DDC for 3 weeks. These findings provide strong evidence that synergistic functions of Rb and p53 are essential for metabolism of DDC. Because Rb and p53 functions are frequently disabled in liver diseases, our results suggest that liver patients might have altered ability to remove toxins or properly metabolize therapeutic drugs. Strikingly the reduced biliary injury towards the oxidative stress inducer DCC was accompanied by enhanced hepatocellular injury and formation of HCCs in Rb and p53 deficient livers. The increase in hepatocellular injury might be related to reduce protoporphyrin accumulation, because protoporphrin is well known for its anti-oxidative activity. Furthermore our results indicate that Rb and p53 not only function as tumor suppressors in response to carcinogenic injury, but also in response to non-carcinogenic injury such as DDC."
https://openalex.org/W2295350482,"Disease prioritization exercises have been used by several organizations to inform surveillance and control measures. Though most methodologies for disease prioritization are based on expert opinion, it is becoming more common to include different stakeholders in the prioritization exercise. This study was performed to compare the weighting of disease criteria, and the consequent prioritization of zoonoses, by both health professionals and students in Switzerland using a Conjoint Analysis questionnaire. The health professionals comprised public health and food safety experts, cantonal physicians and cantonal veterinarians, while the student group comprised first-year veterinary and agronomy students. Eight criteria were selected for this prioritization based on expert elicitation and literature review. These criteria, described on a 3-tiered scale, were evaluated through a choice-based Conjoint Analysis questionnaire with 25 choice tasks. Questionnaire results were analyzed to obtain importance scores (for each criterion) and mean utility values (for each criterion level), and the latter were then used to rank 16 zoonoses. While the most important criterion for both groups was “Severity of the disease in humans”, the second ranked criteria by the health professionals and students were “Economy” and “Treatment in humans”, respectively. Regarding the criterion “Control and Prevention”, health professionals tended to prioritize a disease when the control and preventive measures were described to be 95% effective, while students prioritized a disease if there were almost no control and preventive measures available. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy was the top-ranked disease by both groups. Health professionals and students agreed on the weighting of certain criteria such as “Severity” and “Treatment of disease in humans”, but disagreed on others such as “Economy” or “Control and Prevention”. Nonetheless, the overall disease ranking lists were similar, and these may be taken into consideration when making future decisions regarding resource allocation for disease control and prevention in Switzerland."
