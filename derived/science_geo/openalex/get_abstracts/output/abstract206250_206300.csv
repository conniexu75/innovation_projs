https://openalex.org/W2055697421,WEAVER1 has shown that autumnal application of gibberellin prolongs dormancy of Vitis vinifera shoots in the following spring. We2 recently reported that application of gibberellic acid in late summer and autumn delayed leaf-fall of several woody species; further observations on these plants this spring have shown that in many of them dormancy was prolonged. Thus this unexpected response to gibberellins may not be uncommon.

https://openalex.org/W995121481,"On the basis of physical and synthetic evidence, Gawron et al. (2, 3) have concluded that the P-carboxyl group in nn-isocitric lactone is cis to the cr-carboxyl group. Since the stereochemistry of the a-carbon of natural d-isocitrate had been previously elucidated by Greenstein et a2. (4, 5) and shown to correspond to the Lo configuration, Gawron et al. (2, 3), referring to the pcarboxyl group of d-isocitrate as a substituent similar to the P-hydroxyl group of threonine, assigned to D,' configuration to the P-carbon of d-isocitrate. The structure proposed by these authors has recently been confirmed by means of crystallographic studies on naturally occurring isocitrate (6). In discussing the biochemical implications of the absolute configuration of natural d-isocitrate, Gawron et al. (2, 3) have pointed out that such a structure is only compatible with a tram mechanism of addition of water across the double bond of cis-aconitate, and suggested a modification of the scheme proposed by Speyer and Dickman"

https://openalex.org/W2110316923,Genetic change of Neisseria meningitidis is elicited by deoxyribonucleate preparations obtained from N. sicca. Such interspecific transformation is effected not only by deoxyribonucleate obtained from cells by conventional methods but also by crude deoxyribonucleate-containing slime which accumulates without experimental intervention in some cultures incubated for a period as short as 44 hours.

https://openalex.org/W2075512039,GALLOPet al. 1have recently reported the presence of ester-like links in several soluble collagens. We had also found such links in commercial acid-precursor pigskin gelatin and bovine hide corium collagen.

https://openalex.org/W2034579564,"IT was discovered some years ago that there is a substantial decrease in the residual (non-fatty) dry weight of the head and thorax of tsetse flies in the course of starvation1. Subsequent analysis of flies (Glossina swynnertoni Aust.) collected in the field at different stages of the hunger cycle showed that the thoracic residual dry weight decreases by as much as 0.25 mgm. towards the end of the hunger cycle (unpublished work). The findings suggest the existence of a non-fatty food reserve, and since neither glycogen nor reducing sugars could be demonstrated in amounts sufficient to account for these changes in weight, a study of the free amino-acids was undertaken in an attempt to identify the substances responsible."

https://openalex.org/W2047145920,"PERSISTENCE of herpes virus in cells cultured in vitro might provide a suitable model for investigating the phenomenon of latent herpes infection in humans. During a study on the interaction between herpes virus and HeLa cells, it was observed that an extensive cytopathic effect eventually resulted from inoculation of a monolayer culture with the HFEM strain of herpes virus1,2. A few isolated cells sometimes survived, however, and if growth medium containing antiviral serum was added, colonies grew from these surviving cells, leading eventually to a large population. These recovered cells were apparently healthy and grew as well as the original HeLa cells: there were no gross morphological differences such as those described by Vogt and Dulbecco3, who studied cells recovered after poliomyelitis infection."

By such sensitivity, species of Salmonella can be distinguished2 and the degree of sensitivity is used for typing strains of S. typhi 3,4,5 and strains of other bacteria6."

https://openalex.org/W2073997642,"THE action of the polysaccharide-synthesizing enzyme dextransucrase has been described previously in terms of pH1 and the effect of various alternate receptors2,3. We have now examined the dependence of rate of reaction on the concentration of enzyme. The results are interpreted on the basis of adsorption kinetics4, where the substrate (sucrose) and acceptor are adsorbed simultaneously on adjacent sites of the enzyme. This is followed by glucosyl transfer from sucrose to acceptor. No reaction occurs between bound sucrose and acceptor in solution, and there is no separate hydrolytic step prior to the transfer of the glucosyl group."
