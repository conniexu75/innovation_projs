https://openalex.org/W1998844870,"Individual protein-binding sites within the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain and kappa light chain gene enhancers were altered, making it possible to examine the functional role of the sites during transcription. The E motifs, which bind factors that are present in many if not all cells, mostly behave as transcriptional activating sites. The only known heavy chain enhancer site that binds a lymphocyte-specific factor, the ""octamer"" site, plays a critical role in transcription but only in a truncated form of the enhancer. In the full enhancer, no one site is crucial because of an apparent functional redundancy. The site in the kappa enhancer that binds a factor specific to mature B cells, kappa B, was crucial to the constitutive activity of the enhancer in B cells. This factor is also inducible in pre-B cells, and the site was necessary for inducibility of the kappa enhancer. Thus, the sites defined by protein binding are important for the functional activity of immunoglobulin enhancers, with the sites that bind proteins restricted in their cellular distribution playing the most important roles."
https://openalex.org/W1498131948,"Systematically synthesized derivatives of ML-9, 1-(5-chloronaphthalenesulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine, were found to inhibit both Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent and -independent smooth muscle myosin light chain kinases with a similar concentration dependence, and their inhibitions were of the competitive type with respect to ATP. Moreover, ML-9 as well as ATP or ADP exhibited an effective protection to inactivation of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase by the nucleotide affinity label 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, suggesting that ML-9 binds at or near the ATP-binding site on the kinase molecule. These derivatives, which were structurally unrelated to ATP and exhibited more hydrophobic properties detected by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, exhibited more potent inhibition toward smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, indicating that the hydrophobic properties of these derivatives positively correlated well with their potencies of inhibiting the catalytic activity for the enzyme. These findings suggest that the ATP-binding site at the active center of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase is located in a hydrophobic environment. The potent vaso-relaxing effect of ML-9 on rabbit vascular strips and on saponin-treated skinned smooth muscle cells was discussed in relation to the in vivo inhibition by this drug of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2021181211,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of two transcription units of the AS-C and shown that their potential protein coding regions share two principal domains of homology. Both domains are conserved within the myc protein family, and one of them is highly homologous with the consensus for protein tyrosine kinase substrates. We show in addition that at least one of these domains is shared with other transcription units within the AS-C, some of which were not previously known. We suggest that the AS-C encodes several homologous polypeptides, which represent a subset of a larger gene family. We propose that each member of the family functions at an equivalent stage of a unique morphogenetic operation involving the segregation of individual neural lineages from the epidermal anlage."
https://openalex.org/W1591438776,"Subtilisin E, an alkaline serine protease of Bacillus subtilis 168, is first produced as a precursor, pre-pro-subtilisin, which consists of a signal peptide for protein secretion (pre-sequence) and a peptide extension of 77 amino acid residues (pro-sequence) between the signal peptide and mature subtilisin. When the entire coding region for pre-pro-subtilisin E was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector, active mature subtilisin E was secreted into the periplasmic space. When the pre-sequence was replaced with the E. coli OmpA signal peptide, active subtilisin E was also produced. When the OmpA signal peptide was directly fused to the mature subtilisin sequence, no protease activity was detected, although this product had the identical primary structure as subtilisin E as a result of cleavage of the OmpA signal peptide and was produced at a level of approximately 10% of total cellular protein. When the OmpA signal peptide was fused to the 15th or 44th amino acid residue from the amino terminus of the pro-sequence, active subtilisin was also not produced. These results indicate that the pro-sequence of pre-pro-subtilisin plays an important role in the formation of enzymatically active subtilisin. It is proposed that the pro-sequence is essential for guiding appropriate folding of the enzymatically active conformation of subtilisin E."

https://openalex.org/W1605921103,"Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with thrombin are known to synthesize prostacyclin at least in part from arachidonate released by phospholipase A2, an enzyme directly activated by calcium. In this study, thrombin stimulation of Quin 2-loaded HUVEC caused rapid and dose-dependent rises in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+i) levels which preceded a similarly dose-dependent rise in prostacyclin production measured as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) by radioimmunoassay (ED50 = 0.6-0.7 units/ml for all three effects). Thrombin induced these effects in the absence of extracellular calcium (EGTA) or in the presence of either 8-bromo-cAMP or the calmodulin inhibitor W7. Thrombin inactivated with either diisopropyl fluorophosphate or D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone was inactive. In contrast, Quin 2-loaded cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells failed to respond to thrombin, although stimulation with trypsin elevated IP3 and Ca2+i levels and increased 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production. Restimulation of HUVEC with thrombin or histamine 5 min after an initial stimulation with thrombin (2 units/ml for 5 min) failed to induce a second rise in either IP3 or Ca2+i levels or further production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, whereas restimulation with ionomycin in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium elevated Ca2+i levels and induced further 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production. However, if the initial stimulation with thrombin was terminated by addition of D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone within 10-60 s, restimulation with a second dose of thrombin induced second rises in both IP3 and Ca2+i levels and additional 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production that were greatest when the initial thrombin stimulus was briefest. These results are consistent with the conclusion that IP3 acts as a second messenger by which thrombin elevates Ca2+i levels and initiates prostacyclin synthesis in HUVEC and that in vivo endothelial cells may be stimulated multiple times to synthesize prostacyclin if each period of stimulation is brief."

https://openalex.org/W1492411340,"Glycoproteins bearing a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue attached by an O-glycosidic linkage to the polypeptide chain (Holt, G. D., and Hart, G. W. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8049-8057) have been found to be enriched in the nuclear and soluble fractions of rat liver. Our goal was to determine the localization and membrane topography of proteins bearing O-linked GlcNAc using galactosyltransferase and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as membrane-impermeant probes. Latency of the enzyme mannose-6-phosphatase was used to quantitatively confirm the intactness of the nuclear envelope during incubations with galactosyltransferase or WGA. The O-linked GlcNAc residues of nuclei were fully accessible to modification by galactosyltransferase under conditions where the nuclear envelope mannose-6-phosphatase was 70% latent. Addition of detergent destroyed the permeability barrier but did not increase galactosylation of the O-linked GlcnAc. The major polypeptides bearing O-linked GlcNAc residues on nuclei were peripheral rather than integral membrane proteins with apparent molecular masses ranging from 210 to 54 kDa. The proteins were also detected on sealed nuclei using conjugates of WGA. WGA-rhodamine labeled intact nuclei when examined by immunofluorescence; WGA-peroxidase was used to identify the nuclear glycoproteins after transfer to nitrocellulose. WGA-ferritin selectively labels the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces of the nuclear pore complex when examined by electron microscopy. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that proteins bearing cytoplasmically oriented O-linked GlcNAc are components of the nuclear pore complex, thereby raising the possibility that cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic glycoproteins are involved in the assembly or functioning of the nuclear pore."
https://openalex.org/W1542837635,"We have identified a Factor VIII (FVIII) binding domain residing within the amino-terminal 272 amino acid residues of the mature von Willebrand Factor (vWF) subunit. Two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis showed direct binding of purified human FVIII to purified human vWF. After proteolytic digestion of vWF with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (SP), FVIII binding was seen only with the amino-terminal SP fragment III and not with the carboxyl-terminal SP fragment II. A monoclonal anti-vWF antibody (C3) partially blocked FVIII binding to vWF and SP fragment III. FVIII also bound to vWF which had been adsorbed to polystyrene beads. This binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by whole vWF, SP fragment III, and by monoclonal antibody C3. Binding could not be inhibited by SP fragment I, which contains the middle portion of the vWF molecule, or by reduced and alkylated whole vWF. SP fragment II caused only minimal inhibition. Trypsin cleavage of SP fragment III produced a monomeric 35-kDa fragment containing the amino-terminal 272 amino acid residues of vWF. This fragment reacted with monoclonal antibody C3 and inhibited the binding of FVIII to vWF in a dose-dependent manner. These studies demonstrate that a major FVIII binding site resides within the amino-terminal 272 amino acid residues of vWF."
https://openalex.org/W2165751324,"We have examined the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the Krüppel (Kr) protein, a gap gene product, during Drosophila embryogenesis. Antibodies directed against the Kr protein revealed patterns of nuclear staining that represent subpatterns of Kr transcript accumulation in particular tissues. This indicates that the distribution of Kr protein is not a direct response to Kr mRNA accumulation, and that Kr protein expression requires a second level of control in addition to spatially regulated transcription. Our data provide evidence for posttranscriptional control that may involve an intron present in the 5′ region of one of the two Kr transcripts. The intron-containing transcript is the only potential source of new Kr protein synthesis after gastrulation. The finding of late and transient patterns of Kr activity in several tissues, such as the developing nervous system, amnion serosa, and muscle precursor cells suggests that Kr activity may be required in several developmental processes after segmentation has been completed."

https://openalex.org/W1560918162,"Incubation of purified rat brain Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II for 2 min in the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin (CaM), Mg2+, and ATP converted the kinase from a completely Ca2+-dependent kinase to a substantially Ca2+-independent form with little loss of total activity. Subsequent addition of EGTA to the autophosphorylation reaction enhanced further autophosphorylation of the kinase which was associated with a suppression of total kinase activity to the Ca2+-independent value. Protein phosphatase 1 rapidly increased the suppressed total activity back to the control value and slowly decreased the Ca2+-independent activity. Kinetic analysis showed that the kinase not previously autophosphorylated had a Km for the synthetic peptide syntide-2 of 7 microM and Vmax of 9.8 mumol/min/mg when assayed in the presence of Ca2+ and CaM. The partially Ca2+-independent species, assayed in the presence of EGTA, had a Km of 21 microM and Vmax of 6.0. In the presence of Ca2+ and CaM the Km decreased and the Vmax increased to approximately control nonphosphorylated values. The completely Ca2+-independent form generated by sequential autophosphorylation first in the presence of Ca2+ and then EGTA had similar kinetic parameters to the partially independent species when assayed in the presence of EGTA, but addition of Ca2+ and CaM (up to 1 mg/ml) had little effect. These results suggest that separate autophosphorylation sites in the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II are associated with formation of Ca2+-independent activity and suppression of total activity."

https://openalex.org/W2076704773,"The nucleotide sequence of soybean lipoxygenase-2 cDNA has been determined, and the complete amino acid sequence of the enzyme has been deduced. Limited direct amino acid sequence data for lipoxygenase-2 protein support this assignment and exclude mRNA representing lipoxygenase-1 and -3. Lipoxygenase 2 has a molecular weight of 97,036 and contains 865 amino acid residues, in contrast to the isozymes, lipoxygenase-1 and -3, which are known to contain 838 and 859 amino acid residues, respectively. Despite significant differences in behavior between these three isozymes, the amino acid sequences of lipoxygenase-1 and -3 are 81 and 74% identical to lipoxygenase-2, respectively. A region of 40 amino acid residues containing a cluster of six histidines and two tyrosines, which is highly conserved in all three isozymes, is discussed as a possible iron-binding region."

https://openalex.org/W2075390465,"We examined the function of clathrin, a cytoplasmic protein associated with coated pits and vesicles, by introducing monoclonal antibodies into living cells and determining their effects on membrane transport. When anti-clathrin heavy chain antibodies were used, the following effects were observed: clathrin became aggregated in the cytoplasm, the number of coated pits on the plasma membrane was reduced, and adsorbtive endocytosis of Semliki Forest virus and fluid-phase endocytosis were decreased by 40%-50%. No change in transport of newly synthesized influenza hemagglutinin to the plasma membrane was observed. The results indicated that clathrin in CV-1 cells is involved in fluid-phase uptake and receptor-mediated endocytosis, but not in constitutive transport within the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1990840519,"Human peripheral blood eosinophils, cells often associated with allergic and parasitic diseases, were maintained in vitro for at least 14 days when they were cocultured with bovine endothelial cells and for at least 7 days when cultured with either bovine or human endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium. The cocultured eosinophils became hypodense and generated about three times as much leukotriene C4 upon activation with calcium ionophore and killed about three times as many antibody-coated larvae of Schistosoma mansoni as freshly isolated normodense eosinophils. That these cells can be maintained in vitro by coculture with endothelial cells, and the surprising finding that the cocultured eosinophils have biochemical, cytotoxic, and density properties similar to those of eosinophils in patients with allergic and other disorders, will facilitate investigation of the regulation and role of these cells in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1510706283,"The 1818-base pairs cDNA encoding a form of rat liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase designated UDP-GTr-3 was sequenced and found to encode a protein of 530 amino acids (Mr = 60,522). Characteristic sequences include a signal peptide and a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane anchoring region. There were no potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. Transcription and translation of the cDNA in vitro showed that the encoded protein was synthesized as a precursor and was cleaved when dog pancreatic microsomes were present during translation. Cleaved UDPGTr-3 was intrinsically associated with the added membranes, whereas uncleaved polypeptide remained in the supernatant upon fractionation of the translation mixture. UDPGTr-3 and a related phenobarbital-inducible form of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (designated UDPGTr-2) were both expressed in COS cells and their capacities to glucuronidate 13 commonly used substrates were analyzed. Whereas both enzymes glucuronidated the endogenous steroids testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and beta-estradiol, only UDPGTr-2 was active towards the foreign chemical substrates, chloramphenicol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl, and 4-methylumbelliferone. Neither enzyme was active towards estrone, androsterone and substrates typical of 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible forms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. Steady-state levels of UDPGTr-3 and UDPGTr-2 mRNAs were highest in the liver and were barely detectable in kidney, lung, testis, and small intestinal mucosa. These data show that at least two forms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase found predominantly in the liver have evolved to glucuronidate the same endogenous steroid substrates and that the phenobarbital-inducible form also has some activity towards foreign compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1536730458,"This paper describes the structural and biochemical characterization of talin, a protein localized to various cellular sites where bundles of actin filaments attach to the plasma membrane. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the protein has a molecular mass of 225,000 +/- 5,000 daltons. Hydrodynamic measurements at protein concentrations less than 0.72 mg/ml indicate a monomeric protein with a native molecular mass of 213,000 +/- 15,000 daltons. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate self-association at protein concentrations of 0.72 mg/ml and higher. The data suggest that this self-association is a simple monomer:dimer equilibrium over the range of concentrations observed. At low protein concentrations where talin is a monomer, the Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient vary with ionic strength. Under low ionic strength conditions (5-20 mM NaCl), talin has a Stokes radius of 6.5 nm and a sedimentation value of 9.4, suggesting an asymmetric globular molecule; whereas under high ionic strength conditions (200 mM NaCl), the Stokes radius increases to 7.7 nm and the sedimentation coefficient decreases to 8.8, suggesting a more elongated protein. This conformation change is confirmed by electron microscopy which reveals a more globular protein at low ionic strength which unfolds to become an elongated flexible molecule as the ionic strength is increased to physiological and higher levels. The amino acid composition of talin indicates a low level of aromatic residues, consistent with its relatively low extinction coefficient, talin has an isoelectric point between pH 6.7 and 6.8 based on isoelectric focusing. The detailed purification of talin is described."

The purified enzymes were homogeneous as judged by disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme from S. ureae has a molecular weight of 305,000, while that of B. sphaericus has a molecular weight of 340,000. Each is probably composed of eight subunits identical in molecular weight. The S. ureae enzyme showed a high substrate specificity in the oxidative deamination reaction acting on L-phenylalanine, while that of B. sphaericus acted on L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. The enzymes had lower substrate specificities in the reductive amination reaction acting on alpha-keto acids. The Sporosarcina enzyme acted on phenylpyruvate, alpha-ketocaproate, alpha-keto-gamma-methylthiobutyrate and rho-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.

https://openalex.org/W1581158372,"Abstract A GTP-binding protein serving as the specific substrate of islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, was partially purified from human leukemic (HL-60) cells that had been differentiated into neutrophil type. The partially purified protein, referred to as GHL, predominantly consisted of at least two polypeptides with molecular masses of 40,000 daltons (alpha) and 36,000 or 35,000 daltons (beta). The structure was similar to Gi or Go previously purified from rat brain as an alpha beta gamma-heterotrimeric IAP substrate (Katada, T., Oinuma, M., and Ui, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8182-8191), although the existence of the gamma of GHL was unclear. The 40,000-dalton polypeptide contained the site for IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and the binding site for guanine nucleotide with a high affinity. The 36,000- and 35,000-dalton polypeptides were cross-reacted with the affinity-purified antibody raised against the beta of brain Gi and Go. Limited proteolysis with trypsin and immunoblot analyses with the use of the affinity-purified antibodies raised against the alpha of brain Gi or Go indicated that the alpha of GHL was different from the alpha of Gi or Go. Kinetics of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding to GHL was also quite different from that to brain Gi or Go. Incubation of GHL with GTP gamma S resulted in a resolution into GTP gamma S-bound alpha and beta(gamma) thus purified had abilities to inhibit a membrane-bound adenylate cyclase activity and to associate with the alpha of brain IAP substrate in a fashion similar to the beta gamma of brain IAP substrates, suggesting that there were no significant differences in the biological activities between the beta(gamma) of GHL and those of Gi or Go. Physiological roles of the new GTP-binding protein, GHL, purified from the neutrophil-like cells in receptor-mediated signal transduction are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1515441502,"Identification of lysyl residue(s) in human plasma antithrombin required for binding of heparin was approached using chemical modification with the amino-group reagent pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Modification of antithrombin with limiting amounts of reagent yields an average incorporation of the phosphopyridoxyl label into 1 lysine/protein molecule (Pecon, J. M., and Blackburn, M. N. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 935-938). Fractionation of the labeled antithrombin by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose separated a phosphopyridoxylated antithrombin species devoid of heparin binding from modified protein which retained affinity for heparin. To generate peptide maps of the two antithrombin species, the proteins were reductively denatured, S-carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Fractionation of the tryptic digests by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography indicated one peak in the chromatogram of the non-heparin-binding species to be clearly different when compared to the chromatogram of the heparin-binding species. The sequence of the unique peptide, determined by automated Edman degradation, was Thr-Ser-Asp-Gln-Ile-His-Phe-Phe-Phe-Ala-Lys-Leu-Asn-Cys-Arg. This peptide corresponds to a tryptic fragment including residues 115-129 in the sequence of antithrombin, with the modified residue identified as Lys-125. Additionally, phosphopyridoxylation of antithrombin in the presence of added heparin indicated that several other lysyl residues were protected from modification. Identification of this critical lysine for heparin binding strongly supports previous data which indicate that the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin is located at the NH2 terminus within one of the disulfide cross-linked loops of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1527208115,"When 125I-labeled nicked diphtheria toxin bound to Vero cells was exposed to pH less than 5.0, a small fraction was reduced to yield A- and B-fragments. The pH required for reduction correlates well with that required to induce intoxication, and the amount of A-fragment released was of the same order as that required to intoxicate the cells. Conditions that protect cells against intoxication, such as acidification of the cytosol, treatment with anion transport inhibitors, or treatment with anti-diphtheria toxin antibodies, prevented the reduction of the interfragment disulfide in cell-bound toxin. In vitro, thioredoxin reduced nicked diphtheria toxin only at pH 5.0 and lower, and the reduction was inhibited by anti-toxin antibodies. This indicates that a conformational change in the toxin, necessary for reduction by the thioredoxin system, is prevented by the antibodies. Reduction by glutathione and cysteine was most efficient at neutral pH and was not inhibited by anti-toxin. The results are consistent with the possibility that cell-mediated reduction of the interfragment disulfide is a measure of the entry of fragment A into the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1489809680,"Interaction between the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase was detected with a variety of techniques including polyethylene glycol precipitation, ultracentrifugation, and centrifugal gel filtration on a Sepharose 6B column. The interaction was specific in that citrate synthase, cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase did not interact with alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. The interaction was not inhibited by either 0.1 M KCl or 0.4 M (NH4)2SO4, but was completely prevented by 5% glycerol. A new method for the preparation of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase resulted in an enzyme having a protein subunit composition similar to that of classical complex I preparation. Evidence is given for the existence of ternary complexes containing NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase-alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex-NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase-alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex-succinate thiokinase. These data suggest that a part of the citric acid cycle may be located in the vicinity of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase. These complexes may facilitate the transport of metabolites among these enzymes without their equilibrating with the whole compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1543904028,"Pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase was homogeneously purified from crude extract of Euglena gracilis. The Mr of the enzyme was estimated to be 309,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme migrated as a single protein band with Mr of 166,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the enzyme consists of two identical polypeptides. The absorption spectrum of the native enzyme exhibited maxima at 278, 380, and 430 nm, and a broad shoulder was observed around 480 nm; the maximum at 430 nm was eliminated by reduction of the enzyme with dithionite. Reduction of the enzyme with pyruvate and CoA and reoxidation with NADP+ were proved from changes of absorption spectra. The enzyme contained 2 molecules of FAD and 8 molecules of iron. It was also indicated that the enzyme was thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent. The enzyme was oxygen-sensitive, and the reaction was affected by the presence of oxygen. Pyruvate was the most active substrate, but the enzyme was slightly active for 2-oxobutyrate, 3-hydroxypyruvate, and oxalacetate, but not for glyoxylate and 2-oxoglutarate. The native electron acceptor was NADP+, whereas NAD+ was completely inactive. Methyl viologen, benzyl viologen, FAD, and FMN were utilized as artificial electron acceptors, whereas spinach and Clostridium ferredoxins were inactive. Pyruvate synthesis by reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA with NADPH as the electron donor occurred by the reverse reaction of the enzyme. The enzyme also catalyzed a pyruvate-CO2 exchange reaction and electron-transfer reaction from NADPH to other electron acceptors like methyl viologen. These results indicate that pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase in E. gracilis is clearly distinct from either the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex or pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1593287105,"Swine granulosa cells respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the insulin-like growth factor, IGF-I (somatomedin C), with synergistic increases in progesterone production. This facilitative interaction was not attributable to decreased catabolism of progesterone to 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one, but rather to enhanced pregnenolone biosynthesis observed in response to provision of 25-hydroxycholesterol as exogenous sterol substrate. The latter evidence of increased functional cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity was accompanied by augmented incorporation of [35S]methionine into specific immunoisolated components of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage apparatus, viz. cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin. The synergism between FSH and IGF-I could be sustained over 4 days of serum-free monolayer culture. Under these conditions, compactin, a competitive inhibitor of de novo endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, suppressed stimulated progesterone production by approximately equal to 50%. However, synergism was not expressed at the levels of [14C]acetate incorporation into nonsaponifiable lipids or endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity per se. Conversely, exogenous sterol substrate provided in the form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-borne cholesterol increased the absolute magnitude of the combined actions of IGF-I and FSH by 3-6-fold. This increase in steroidogenesis in response to LDL was associated with enhanced surface binding, internalization, and degradation of [125I] iodo-LDL. In addition, when granulosa cells were incubated with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL, FSH and IGF-I synergistically augmented the intracellular accumulation of [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl ester and the production of [3H]progesterone. Moreover, FSH and IGF-I coordinately increased the total mass of free and esterified cholesterol contained in granulosa cells. We conclude that FSH and IGF-I can augment absolute rates of progestin biosynthesis by granulosa cells by activating dual mechanisms: stimulation of functional cholesterol side chain cleavage activity and enhancement of effective cellular uptake and utilization of low-density lipoprotein-borne sterol substrate."

The purification procedure employed ion exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, affinity chromatography, and gel filtration. Molecular weight determinations demonstrated that the enzyme was a dimer of Mr 105,000 +/- 2,000 with apparently identical Mr 49,000 +/- 1,500 subunits. Amino acid composition of S. solfataricus enzyme was determined and found to be significantly higher in tryptophan content than the malic enzyme from Escherichia coli. In addition to the NAD(P)-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of L-malate, S. solfataricus malic enzyme was able to catalyze the decarboxylation of oxalacetate. The enzyme absolutely required divalent metal cations and it displayed maximal activity at 85 degrees C and pH 8.0 with a turnover number of 376 s-1. The enzyme showed classical saturation kinetics and no sigmoidicity was detected at different pH values and temperatures. At 60 degrees C and in the presence of 0.1 mM MnCl2, the Michaelis constants for malate, NADP, and NAD were 18, 3, and 250 microM, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1575139236,"In purified preparations of human erythrocyte GTP-binding proteins, we have identified a new substrate for pertussis toxin, which has an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa by silver and Coomassie Blue staining. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the 43-kDa protein is inhibited by Mg2+ ion and this inhibition is relieved by the co-addition of micromolar amounts of guanine nucleotides. GTP affects the ADP-ribosylation with a K value of 0.8 microM. Addition of a 10-fold molar excess of purified beta gamma subunits (Mr = 35,000 beta; and Mr = 7,000 gamma) of other GTP-binding proteins results in a significant decrease in the pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the 43-kDa protein. Treatment of the GTP-binding proteins with guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) and 50 mM MgCl2 resulted in shifting of the 43-kDa protein from 4 S to 2 S on sucrose density gradients. Immunoblotting analysis of the 43-kDa protein with the antiserum A-569, raised against a peptide whose sequence is found in the alpha subunits of all of the known GTP-binding, signal-transducing proteins (Mumby, S. M., Kahn, R. A., Manning, D. R., and Gilman, A. G. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 265-259) showed that the 43-kDa protein is specifically recognized by the common peptide antiserum. A pertussis toxin substrate of similar molecular weight was observed in human erythrocyte membranes, bovine brain membranes, membranes made from the pituitary cell line GH4C1, in partially purified GTP-binding protein preparations of rat liver, and in human neutrophil membranes. Treatment of neutrophils with pertussis toxin prior to preparation of the membranes resulted in abolishment of the radiolabeling of this protein. From these data, we conclude that we have found a new pertussis toxin substrate that is a likely GTP-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1656224656,"The synergistic effect of type A (virginiamycin M (VM)) and type B (virginiamycin S (VS)) synergimycins and their antagonistic effect against erythromycin (a 14-membered macrolide) for binding to the large ribosomal subunit (50 S) have been related. This investigation has now been extended to 16-membered macrolides (leucomycin A3 and spiramycin) and to lincosamides (lincomycin). A dissociation of VS-ribosome complexes was induced as well by 16-membered macrolides as by lincosamides. The observed dissociation rate constant of VS-ribosome complexes was identified with the kappa-vs in the case of 16-membered macrolides, but linearly related to lincomycin concentration, suggesting a direct binding of the latter antibiotic to VS-ribosome complexes and the triggering of a conformational change of particles entailing VS release. Two different mechanisms were also involved in the VM-promoted reassociation to ribosomes of VS previously displaced by either macrolides or lincosamides. By binding to lincosamide-ribosome complexes, VM induced a conformational change of ribosomes resulting in higher affinity for VS and lower affinity for lincosamides. On the contrary, an incompatibility for a simultaneous binding of VM and 16-membered macrolides to ribosomes was observed. These results have been interpreted by postulating specific (nonoverlapping) and aspecific (overlapping) antibiotic binding sites at the peptidyltransferase domain. All the kinetic constants of five antibiotic families (type A and B synergimycins, 14- and 16-membered macrolides, and lincosamides) and a topological model of peptidyltransferase are presently available."
https://openalex.org/W1562338124,"Cyanase is an inducible enzyme in Escherichia coli that catalyzes bicarbonate-dependent decomposition of cyanate to ammonia and bicarbonate. Previous studies provided evidence that carbamate is an initial product and that the kinetic mechanism is rapid equilibrium random (bicarbonate serving as substrate as opposed to activator); the following mechanism was proposed (Anderson, P. M. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 2282-2888; Anderson, P. M., and Little, R. M. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 1621-1626). (formula; see text) Direct evidence for this mechanism was obtained in this study by 1) determining whether CO2 or HCO3- serves as substrate and is formed as product, 2) identifying the products formed from [14C]HCO3- and [14C] OCN-, 3) identifying the products formed from [13C] HCO3- and [12C]OCN- in the presence of [18O]H2O, and 4) determining whether 18O from [18O]HCO3- is incorporated into CO2 derived from OCN-. Bicarbonate (not CO2) is the substrate. Carbon dioxide (not HCO3-) is produced in stoichiometric amounts from both HCO3- and OCN-. 18O from [18O]H2O is not incorporated into CO2 formed from either HCO3- or OCN-. Oxygen-18 from [18O]HCO3- is incorporated into CO2 derived from OCN-. These results support the above mechanism, indicating that decomposition of cyanate catalyzed by cyanase is not a hydrolysis reaction and that bicarbonate functions as a recycling substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1486314591,"Glioma C62B cells, incubated for 18 h with either an unsaturated (arachidonate or oleate) or saturated (palmitate or stearate) radioactive fatty acid, incorporated label into most species of cellular glycerolipids. Treatment of prelabeled C62B cells with 1 mM acetylcholine (ACh) resulted in an accumulation of radioactive phosphatidate irrespective of which fatty acid was used as a label. However, only in cells prelabeled with unsaturated fatty acids were increases in radioactive fatty acids observed. When exogenous radioactive arachidonate was added to C62B cells in the presence of 1 mM ACh, there was a rapid, selective, and transiently enhanced incorporation of label (several times the control) into phosphatidylinositol (PI). The ACh-enhanced incorporation into PI was not preceded by enhanced incorporation of label into sn-1,2-diacylglycerol or phosphatidate but was followed by an increased labeling of polyphosphoinositides. Similarly, incorporation of oleate into PI was enhanced by ACh. In contrast, ACh did not enhance the incorporation of label into any glycerolipids when saturated fatty acids were used. C62B cells, incubated with [2-3H]inositol for 18 h selectively incorporated label into phosphoinositides. Stimulation of [2-3H]inositol-labeled cells with 1 mM ACh in the presence of 25 mM LiCl resulted in a rapid accumulation of radioactive inositol phosphates (mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates) and glycerophosphoinositol. The accumulation of inositol trisphosphates preceded that of inositol monophosphate and glycerophosphoinositol, while the accumulation of glycerophosphoinositol paralleled the time required for the ACh-stimulated esterification of arachidonate. These results suggest that ACh stimulates activation of a phospholipase C in C62B cells and release of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate. There is subsequent activation of phospholipase A2, which in turn liberates arachidonate from PI. The resulting lyso PI is either rapidly reesterified with unsaturated fatty acid to resynthesize PI, or further deacylated to yield glycerophosphoinositol."
https://openalex.org/W2022424206,"The slower and more economical contraction of smooth muscle as compared to that of skeletal muscle may relate to the arrangement of its contractile apparatus. Because the arrangement of the contractile apparatus determines the manner in which a single smooth muscle cell shortens, shortening of a contracting cell was examined by tracking of marker bead movements on the cell surface by means of digital video microscopy. Smooth muscle cells were observed to freely shorten in a unique corkscrew-like fashion with a pitch of 1.4 cell lengths (that is, the length change required for one complete rotation of cell) at a rate of 27 degrees per second. Corkscrew-like shortening was interpreted in terms of a structural model in which the contractile apparatus or cytoskeleton (or both) are helically oriented within the cell. Such an arrangement of these cytoarchitectural elements may help to explain in part the contractile capabilities of smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1500643225,"The synthesis of histones and nonhistone nuclear proteins was studied during the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum. Contrary to the commonly accepted idea of a tight coupling of histone biosynthesis and DNA replication during the somatic cell cycle we found that 40% of total histone synthesis takes place in the G2 period in the complete absence of DNA synthesis. The core histones exhibit a maximum of synthesis during S-phase. The synthesis of histones H2A and H2B continues during the G2 period, but synthesis of H4 and H3 is restricted to the S-phase of the cell cycle. Experiments with hydroxyurea demonstrated that the synthesis of H4 and H3 is completely dependent on unperturbed DNA synthesis, whereas synthesis of H2A and H2B is independent from DNA synthesis during the entire cell cycle. This implicates significant differences between the arginine-rich histones H4 and H3 and the moderately lysine-rich histones H2A and H2B with respect to the control mechanisms of their synthesis, the metabolic stability, and the function for chromatin structure. The nonhistone nuclear proteins are synthesized throughout the cell cycle with a broad maximum in the early G2 period. The cell cycle pattern of synthesis of H1 rather resembles the pattern of the nonhistone proteins than of core histones."
https://openalex.org/W1578749261,"The mammalian aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the first two sequential steps in lysine degradation in the major saccharopine pathway (Markovitz, P. J., Chuang, D. T., and Cox, R. P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11643-11646). We show here that limited proteolysis of the highly purified synthase from bovine liver with elastase, chymotrypsin, and papain resulted in separation of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase activities as judged by activity stainings of the polyacrylamide gel. Enzyme assays showed no loss of the two activities after digestions with these proteases. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis disclosed the presence of two limit polypeptides in the elastolytic digests, i.e. fragment A (Mr = 62,700) and fragment B (Mr = 49,200). These fragments were apparently derived from the same polypeptide (Mr = 115,000) of the parent synthase. The reductase and dehydrogenase activities of the elastase-digested synthase were completely resolved by DEAE-Bio-Gel column chromatography. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that fragment A and fragment B were associated with reductase and dehydrogenase activities, respectively. The bovine synthase showed Mr = 420,000 in sedimentation equilibrium, confirming a tetrameric structure for the enzyme. The above results establish that the reductase and dehydrogenase domains of the aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase are separately folded and functionally independent of each other."
https://openalex.org/W1544781085,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) induces rapid and transient conversion of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) from a soluble to a particulate-bound form in GH4C1 rat pituitary cells. Ionomycin (200 nM), a calcium ionophore, had no effect by itself on the subcellular distribution of protein kinase C. However, pretreatment of the cells with 200 nM ionomycin inhibited by greater than 50% the ability of TRH to cause translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the particulate cell fraction. Inhibition by ionomycin required that the cells be incubated with the ionophore for at least 10 s before TRH addition. Ionomycin pretreatment did not alter the kinetics of TRH-induced protein kinase C redistribution. Incubation of the cells with 43 mM potassium prior to TRH addition almost completely reversed the inhibition induced by ionomycin. We propose that the mechanism by which ionomycin attenuates TRH action on protein kinase C may involve the capacity of the ionophore to empty the intracellular calcium reservoir which normally releases calcium into the cytosol in response to TRH. Our result provides evidence that the rise in intracellular calcium, which accompanies diacylglycerol formation following TRH action on polyphosphatidylinositide hydrolysis, may be required to achieve maximal conversion of protein kinase C to its presumed active, membrane-bound form in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1674029742,"Most of the electrical potential-driven 22Na+ uptake in toad bladder membrane vesicles can be blocked by the diuretic amiloride. Analysis of the amiloride inhibition curve indicates the presence of two pathways with low and high affinities to the diuretic (Garty, H. (1984) J. Membr. Biol. 82, 269-279). The selectivity of these pathways to amiloride was explored by comparing the inhibition curve of this diuretic with those of 10 of its structural analogues. The relative potencies of various amiloride-like compounds as blockers of the flux component with high affinity to amiloride were in good agreement with the structure-activity relationships elucidated from transepithelial short-circuit current measurements. Thus, this pathway is most probably the apical Na+-specific channel. The other pathway with lower affinity to the diuretic was relatively insensitive to modifications of the amiloride molecule, and the structure-activity relationships measured for the inhibition of this pathway were different from those reported for any other amiloride-blockable process. Other experiments have established that the Na+ flux with low affinity to amiloride is electrogenic and is not mediated by a Na+/H+ or Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, Na+-hexose cotransporter, or the Na+/K+-ATPase. The data indicate that tracer flux measurements in toad bladder membrane vesicles monitor, in addition to the well-characterized apical Na+ channels, another amiloride-blockable electrogenic Na+ transporter. This pathway could be responsible for the basolateral amiloride-blockable Na+ conductance recently observed in nystatin-treated bladders (Garty, H., Warncke, J., and Lindemann, B. (1987) J. Membr. Biol. 95, 91-103)."
https://openalex.org/W2098147334,"The ability of rat mesangial cells to synthesize 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC), also known as platelet activating factor (PAF), was studied in mesangial cell cultures originating from isolated rat glomeruli. In response to the phospholipase A2 agonist A23187 mesangial cells synthesized PAF primarily via an acetyltransferase utilizing either [3H]lyso-PAF or [3H]acetate/[3H]acetyl-CoA substrates. The major PAF species synthesized was 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-GPC. PAF was also synthesized from 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-3-glycerol, indicating the presence of a CDP-cholinephosphotransferase. Mesangial cells incorporated [3H]lyso-PAF to 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC. Subsequent stimulation with A23187 (2 microM) resulted in formation and release of [3H]PAF following 3 h, and this was associated with concomitant decrements in intracellular 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC and [3H]lyso-PAF levels, indicating a precursor-product relationship among these alkyl ether lipids. Mesangial cells rapidly converted exogenous [3H]PAF to [3H]lyso-PAF and 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC, and this process was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (10 microM). The demonstration of PAF activation-inactivation pathways in mesangial cells may be of importance in regulating their function and in glomerular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1525903822,"The interaction of histamine with an H1 receptor on human endothelial cells evokes production of the lipid mediator prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and is accompanied by tachyphylaxis of this H1 receptor response (Baenziger, N. L., Fogerty, F. J., Mertz, L. F., and Chernuta, L. F. (1981) Cell 24, 915-923). We have explored the affected cells' capability for subsequent metabolic degradation of histamine molecules. Human vascular endothelial cells and skin fibroblasts exhibit a two-stage histamine degradation sequence whose participants are an enzyme native to the cells themselves and one provided from an extracellular source. Initially, the cells' endogenous histamine N-methyltransferase activity mediates conversion of cell-associated [3H]histamine to tele-methylhistamine with retention of this intermediate metabolite. Subsequently, in the presence of exogenous diamine oxidase derived from fetal calf serum or human placenta, cell-associated tele-methyl-histamine is further converted to the end product methylimidazoleacetic acid. After an initial lag phase lasting 3-6 min, the cell-associated radioactivity accumulates as methylimidazoleacetic acid at a linear rate substantially enhanced over that without diamine oxidase. The entire sequence is blocked by the histamine methyltransferase inhibitor homodimaprit. Accumulation of [3H]histamine metabolites by endothelial cells is saturable both with respect to exogenous diamine oxidase and to histamine. Thus this metabolic pathway is carried out at the level of the individual cell by means of binding sites or receptors for the substrate and for the distal degradative enzyme, diamine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1681019703,"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein constituent of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL). To examine apoA-I processing and secretion, the human apoA-I gene (2.2-kilobase PstI-PstI fragment) linked to the mouse metallothionein promoter was transfected by electroporation into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts along with the plasmid pSV2 neo, which confers neomycin resistance. Transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance and screened for the ability to produce apoA-I by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the absence of lipids in the medium, selected 3T3 cells secreted apoA-I, mainly in the proprotein form, at density greater than 1.25 g/ml. Following incubation of cells with lipids, and subsequent washing with lipid-free medium, apoA-I was recovered in the HDL region (1.063-1.21 g/ml) as well as in the 1.21 g/ml infranatant. Examination of the HDL fraction by electron microscopy revealed round particles, 10-21 nm in diameter. These data indicate that human apoA-I secreted by transfected 3T3 fibroblasts can assemble into lipoprotein particles under the appropriate conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1493572921,"Abstract The rat core-specific lectin (CSL) or mannan-binding protein is synthesized and secreted by rat hepatocytes and H-4-II-E hepatoma cells. Prior to secretion proline and lysine residues with collagen-like sequences undergo hydroxylation and subsequent glycosylation of hydroxylysine to produce glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine. Hydroxylation and subsequent glycosylation are inhibited by alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl (Colley, K. J., and Baenziger, U. U. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10290-10295). We have used alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl to investigate the role of hydroxylation and glycosylation on interchain disulfide bond formation, assembly of subunits into high molecular weight complexes, attainment of carbohydrate and lipid binding ability, and secretion. Formation of disulfide-bonded dimers and trimers in the endoplasmic reticulum, assembly into high molecular weight complexes in the Golgi, and attainment of carbohydrate binding activity occur in either the presence or absence of these post-translational modifications. The mature fully processed form of the CSL binds hydrophobic matrices and is secreted at a slow, but linear, rate. Inhibition of proline and lysine hydroxylation and hydroxylysine glycosylation prevents CSL secretion and attainment of binding activity for hydrophobic matrices. Secretion of the lectin, although slow, appears to be an active process and may be related to the capacity to interact with membranes and/or lipids. Other proteins known to contain collagen-like sequences such as acetylcholinesterase, pulmonary surfactant apoproteins, and C1q also interact with lipids and/or membranes. The collagen-like domains of these proteins may also play a role in promoting such interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1929148761,"Incubation of embryonic chick chondrocytes with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine analogue, led to a dose-dependent inhibition of [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan. In the absence of exogenous L-glutamine, a maximal inhibition of 50-60% was achieved with DON concentrations greater than or equal to 1 microgram/ml (6 microM); the ED50 was approximately 0.2 microM. This inhibitory effect could be partially restored by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of either exogenous L-glutamine or M-glucosamine. The quantitative changes were due neither to inhibition of protein core synthesis nor to undersulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains. Rather, the proteoglycan synthesized in the presence of DON contained substantially fewer (approximately 50% of control) and smaller (10-15% of control, on the average) chondroitin sulfate chains as well as a paucity of keratan sulfate chains. The result of these structural changes was a proteoglycan with significantly lower molecular weight, buoyant density, and anionic charge. In spite of these modifications, the altered proteoglycan synthesized in the presence of DON was secreted normally and retained the ability to interact with exogenous hyaluronic acid and link proteins. The results of our experiments also indicate that DON substantially diminished the pool of hexosamine precursors required for glycosaminoglycan synthesis. We conclude that this decrease was responsible for the molecular alterations described above; and these, in turn, can account for the morphological changes previously seen in cartilage matrix synthesized in the presence of DON."

https://openalex.org/W1513425368,"(NH4)2SO4 was found to activate adenylate cyclase in Dictyostelium discoideum membranes. The effect of (NH4)2SO4 on the enzyme was observed after pretreatment of membranes but could not be observed if the salt was added to the assay mixture. Activation was seen when membranes were pretreated with 0.16 M (NH4)2SO4 and was maximal at 0.6-1.0 M. The maximal activation of the enzyme was observed within 3 min of pretreatment and was not readily reversible. The effect was specific for the NH+4 ion since pretreatment of membranes with other NH+4 salts could activate the enzyme, whereas pretreatment with NaCl or KCl could not. Pretreatment of plasma membranes with (NH4)2SO4 eliminated the sensitivity of the enzyme to the inhibitory effect of guanine nucleotides. (NH4)2SO4 pretreatment also significantly attenuated the inhibition by guanine nucleotides of cAMP binding to its plasma membrane receptor. The effect of (NH4)2SO4 on GTP inhibition of cAMP binding to its receptor was even more dramatic when the salt was present in the binding assay. (NH4)2SO4 also increased the ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin of a 39,000-Da membrane protein. The data support the hypothesis that (NH4)2SO4-induced changes in adenylate cyclase and the cAMP receptor are due to an alteration of a putative G protein."
https://openalex.org/W1534289219,"A key step in the cellular differentiation of Dictyostelium is the degradation of glycogen to provide the precursors for synthesis of the structural end products of development. We have found that the enzyme that initiates this degradative pathway, glycogen phosphorylase (1,4-alpha-D-glucan:orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1), is developmentally regulated and exists as two forms. During the time course of development, previously undescribed activity, the form, decreases, whereas that of the a form increases. The b form is inactive unless 5'-AMP is included in the reaction mixture. The mechanism of activation by 5'-AMP is by 40-fold increase in the affinity of the phosphorylase for its substrates. Both forms were purified to homogeneity. They have identical subunit molecular weights of 90,000 and both exist as dimer under non-denaturing conditions. The two forms are also identical with respect to salt inhibition, optimum temperature for activity, and pH optimum. They differ in their elution from DE52-cellulose, affinity constants, thermal stability, affinity for 5'-AMP-Sepharose, and their peptide maps. Attempts to demonstrate interconversion of the two activities by kinase-directed phosphorylation have been unsuccessful. We report here on the existence, the developmental regulation, the purification to homogeneity, and some of the physical and kinetic properties of both the 5'-AMP-dependent and -independent forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1516572288,"The role of Mg2+ in the GTP hydrolytic cycle was investigated by using purified subunits (G alpha and G beta, gamma) of the GTP-binding protein isolated from Bufo marinus rod outer segments (ROS). Mg2+ markedly stimulated the rate of GTP and guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma-s) binding to G alpha. This effect was especially striking in the presence of very small quantities of illuminated ROS disc membranes. GTP hydrolysis could occur in the absence of Mg2+, and Mg2+ increased the rate of GTP hydrolysis only about 50%. These data indicate that Mg2+ plays a fundamental role in amplification of the photon signal by markedly stimulating the rate of formation of GTP X G alpha complexes by very small amounts of illuminated rhodopsin while producing only a modest increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Following hydrolysis of GTP, GDP X G alpha could reassociate with illuminated or unilluminated ROS disc membranes in the presence or absence of Mg2+. In the absence of guanine nucleotides, release of GDP from G alpha bound to illuminated disc membranes was detected in the presence or absence of Mg2+. Moreover, Mg2+ did not affect the rate of GDP release from membrane-bound G alpha. Illumination of B. marinus crude ROS disc membrane preparations markedly reduced pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of a 39,000 Mr (G alpha) protein in the presence but not in the absence, of Mg2+. Moreover, extensive dialysis of illuminated (but not unilluminated) crude ROS disc membranes against a Mg2+-containing buffer caused a marked reduction in the subsequent ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, even when Mg2+ was not present during the ADP-ribosylation step. This reduction was reversed by the addition of GDP or a GDP analogue (but not GMP or hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogues) during the ADP-ribosylation step. Dialysis of crude ROS disc membrane preparations (illuminated or unilluminated) against a Mg2+ -free buffer did not reduce the subsequent ADP-ribosylation of G alpha. These data indicate that Mg2+, in the presence of photolysed rhodopsin, can stimulate the release of GDP from crude preparations of ROS disc membranes. Four lines of evidence suggest that G alpha and G beta, gamma have Mg2+-binding site(s). When stored at 4 degrees C, in the absence of glycerol, G beta, gamma was more stable in the absence than in the presence of Mg2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

We have now shown that the mutant is defective in the proteolytic processing of a second lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucosidase. Digestion of the HMW-426 alpha-mannosidase and beta-glucosidase precursors with endoglycosidase H revealed that the majority of oligosaccharide side chains on both precursors were sensitive to cleavage by this enzyme, indicating that both precursors fail to reach the Golgi apparatus. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that these two mutant precursors accumulated inside the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The alpha-mannosidase precursor is conformationally altered, as evidenced by its abnormal protease susceptibility, suggesting that altered conformation is responsible for a generalized defect in transport of lysosomal protein precursors from the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1480694305,"Abstract We identify the cyanogenic substrate for horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a conjugated enamine and explore this unusual reaction using alpha-aminocinnamate (RH) as follows. 1) HRP catalyzes the oxidation of RH by O2 (and its peroxidation by H2O2 to form R-R) to produce, simultaneously, CN- and benzaldehyde cyanohydrin. 2) RH is transient and must be generated in situ. The properties of the cyanogenic reaction of HRP are independent of the method of preparation of RH (whether this be condensation of NH3 with phenylpyruvate, enzymatic hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine, or oxidation of L-phenylalanine by L-amino acid oxidase). 3) The oxidation of RH is a free radical chain reaction initiated by HRP Compounds I and II (I (or II) + RH----R. + II (or HRP], propagated by RO2. (R. + O2----RO2., RO2. + RH----R. + RO2H), and terminated by recombination reactions such as 2R.----R2 and RO2.----R' + HO2. followed by R. + HO2.----RH + O2. KMnO4 and K3Fe(CN)6 can substitute for HRP. 4) The proximal precursor of CN- and cyanohydrin is postulated to be RO2H (phi-CH(-O2H)-CCO2-(= NH]. These results explain why cyanide is generated from the synergistic action of HRP and L-amino acid oxidase on aromatic L-amino acids and O2 and suggest that the requirement for a beta-aryl substituent on the enamine originates in the reaction of RH with HRP, or of R with O2, rather than the imine/enamine tautomerization of the L-amino acid oxidase product."
