https://openalex.org/W2037653294,"We have adopted Drosophila tissue culture cells as a host system for studying the structure and function of mammalian transcription factors. These cells provide an Sp1-deficient background and have been used in a complementation assay to identify functional domains of human transcription factor Sp1. The SV40 early promoter, which contains six Sp1 binding sites (GC boxes), is induced up to 500-fold in Drosophila cells by the expression of Sp1, whereas promoters with fewer sites are activated less efficiently. Analysis of Sp1 mutants reveals multiple distinct regions outside of the DNA binding domain that are responsible for mediating transcriptional activation. The two most active domains, which appear to be functionally redundant with one another, consist of an unusual structure with a very low charge density, but a strikingly high glutamine content. A number of other sequence-specific transcription factors, such as the Drosophila zeste protein and several homeodomain proteins, contain glutamine-rich stretches, and we propose that these glutamine-rich domains represent a novel structural motif for transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2094872845,"Binding of the human transcription factor Jun/AP-1 to a conserved 8 bp nucleotide sequence (TRE) is responsible for increased transcription of different cellular genes in response to tumor promoters, such as TPA, and serum factors. Enhanced Jun/AP-1 activity in TPA-stimulated cells is regulated by two different mechanisms: a posttranslational event acting on pre-existing Jun/AP-1 molecules, and transcriptional activation of jun gene expression leading to an increase in the total amount of Jun/AP-1. Induction of jun transcription in response to TPA is mediated by binding of Jun/AP-1 to a high-affinity AP-1 binding site in the jun promoter region. Site-specific mutagenesis of this binding site prevents TPA induction and trans-activation by Jun/AP-1. These results clearly demonstrate that jun transcription is directly stimulated by its own gene product. This positive regulatory loop is likely to be responsible for prolonging the transient signals generated by activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1987897953,"The c-Jun and c-fos proto-oncogenes encode proteins that form a complex which regulates transcription from promoters containing AP-1 activation elements. c-Jun has specific DNA binding activity, while c-Fos has homology to the putative DNA binding domain of c-Jun. Following in vitro translation, c-Jun binds as a homodimer to the AP-1 DNA site, while c-Fos fails to dimerize and displays no apparent affinity for the AP-1 element. Cotranslated c-Jun and c-Fos proteins bind 25 times more efficiently to the AP-1 DNA site as a heterodimer than does the c-Jun homodimer. These experiments suggest that in growth factor-stimulated cells c-Jun binds DNA as a dimer with c-Fos as its natural partner. However, overexpression of c-Jun protein in the absence of c-Fos may result in formation of aberrant homodimeric transcription complexes, which could abrogate the normal mechanisms controlling gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2037753946,"Three members of the Jun/AP-1 family have been identified in mouse cDNA libraries: c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D. We have compared the DNA binding properties of the Jun proteins by using in vitro translation products in gel retardation assays. Each protein was able to bind to the consensus AP-1 site (TGACTCA) and, with lower affinity, to related sequences, including the cyclic AMP response element TGACGTCA. The relative binding to the oligonucleotides tested was similar for the different proteins. The Jun proteins formed homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the family, and they were bound to the AP-1 site as dimers. When Fos translation product was present, DNA binding by Jun increased markedly, and the DNA complex contained Fos. The C-terminal homology region of Jun was sufficient for DNA binding, dimer formation, and interaction with Fos. Our general conclusion is that c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D are similar in their DNA binding properties and in their interaction with Fos. If there are functional differences between them, they are likely to involve other activities of the Jun proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1525792717,"Two major lysosomal membrane glycoproteins with apparent Mr approximately 120,000 were purified from chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. These glycoproteins are major sialoglycoproteins containing polylactosaminoglycan and represent approximately 0.1-0.2% of total cell proteins. A monoclonal antibody specific to one of the glycoproteins and polyclonal antibodies specific to the other glycoprotein were obtained. Immunoelectron microscopic examination of HeLa cells revealed that these two glycoproteins mainly reside in lysosomes and multivesicular bodies. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that a number of different cell lines express these glycoproteins. However, the apparent molecular weights differed between cell lines; this probably represents differences in the amount of polylactosaminoglycan expressed by each cell line. As shown in the following paper (Fukuda, M., Viitala, J., Matteson, J., and Carlsson, S. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18920-18928) one of the glycoproteins is very homologous to that of a mouse counterpart, m-lamp-1. The human form of this glycoprotein is therefore named human lamp-1 (h-lamp-1), while the other glycoprotein, to which the monoclonal antibody was made, is called human lamp-2 (h-lamp-2). Pulse-chase labeling experiments detected that h-lamp-1 and h-lamp-2 are produced first as precursor forms of 87.5 and 84 kDa, and treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo-H) or endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F (endo-F) reduced their molecular masses to 39.5 and 41.5 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that h-lamp-1 has 18 N-linked saccharides and h-lamp-2 16, based on the results of partial digestions with endo-F. These results indicate that the two lysosomal membrane glycoproteins are extensively modified by N-glycans, and some of these were found to have polylactosaminyl repeats and sialic acid. Human lamp-1 and lamp-2, therefore, serve as good models for understanding polylactosaminoglycan formation and the biosynthesis and processing of polylactosaminoglycan-containing glycoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W2001330542,"Potassium channels in neurons are linked by guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins to numerous neurotransmitter receptors. The ability of Go, the predominant G protein in the brain, to stimulate potassium channels was tested in cell-free membrane patches of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Four distinct types of potassium channels, which were otherwise quiescent, were activated by both isolated brain G0 and recombinant Go alpha. Hence brain Go can couple diverse brain potassium channels to neurotransmitter receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1657138111,"In the present studies, we have purified a novel small Mr GTP-binding protein, designated as smg p21, to near homogeneity from bovine brain crude membranes, isolated the complementary DNA (cDNA) of this protein from a bovine brain cDNA library, determined the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, and characterized the kinetic properties. The cDNA of smg p21 has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 184 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 20,987. The Mr of purified smg p21 is estimated to be about 22,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Homology search indicates that smg p21 is a novel protein with the consensus amino acid sequences for GTP/GDP-binding and GTPase domains but shares about 55% amino acid sequence homology with the human c-Ha-ras protein. Moreover, smg p21 has the same putative effector domain as the Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras proteins at the same position and the same consensus C-terminal sequence as in these ras proteins. Consistent with these structural properties, smg p21 binds specifically [35S] guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), GTP, and GDP with a Kd value for GTP gamma S of about 40 nM. smg p21 binds about 0.7 mol of GTP gamma S/mol of protein. [35S]GTP gamma S-binding to smg p21 is inhibited by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide.smg p21 hydrolyzes GTP to liberate Pi with a turnover number of about 0.007 min-1. These kinetic properties of smg p21 are similar to those of the c-ras proteins. These results suggest that smg p21 is a novel GTP-binding protein exerting action(s) similar or antagonistic to that (those) of the ras proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1484742225,"The sulfated polysaccharides in the body wall of the sea cucumber occur as three fractions that differ markedly in molecular mass and chemical composition. The fraction containing a high molecular mass component has a high proportion of fucose and small amounts of galactose and amino sugars, whereas another fraction contains primarily a sulfated fucan. The third fraction (F-2), which represents the major portion of the sea cucumber-sulfated polysaccharides, contains approximately equimolar quantities of glucuronic acid, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose, and has a sulfate content higher than that in the other two fractions. The structure of fraction F-2 was examined in detail. This polysaccharide has an unusual structure composed of a chondroitin sulfate-like core, containing side chain disaccharide units of sulfated fucopyranosyl linked to approximately half of the glucuronic acid moieties through the O-3 position of the acid. These unusual fucose branches obstruct the access of chondroitinases to the chondroitin sulfate core of F-2. However, after partial acid hydrolysis, which removes the sulfated fucose residues from the polymer, fraction F-2 is degraded by chondroitinases into 6-sulfated and nonsulfated disaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1516065974,"The T cell antigen receptor is composed of at least seven chains derived from six different gene products. Upon stimulation, several chains can be phosphorylated. Two of these, CD3-gamma and CD3-epsilon are phosphorylated on serine residues. In addition, a 21-kDa nonglycosylated receptor component is phosphorylated, upon activation, on tyrosine residues. We have referred to this phosphoprotein as p21 because we have previously not been able to assign the tyrosine phosphorylation to any of the described receptor subunits (Samelson, L. E., Patel, M. D., Weissman, A. M., Harford, J. B., and Klausner, R. D. (1986) Cell 46, 1083-1090). In this paper, we demonstrate that it is the 16-kDa zeta chain which is the tyrosine phosphorylated subunit, and thus the p21 nomenclature can be replaced. This phosphorylation results in a shift of the apparent Mr of zeta to 21 kDa. Proof that p21 is tyrosine phosphorylated zeta was afforded by a number of approaches. Specific anti-zeta antibodies directly precipitated phospho-p21. Metabolically labeled protein corresponding to p21 could only be observed after activation. When this 21-kDa band was isolated after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reanalyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, its migration was identical with that of zeta. Furthermore, peptide mapping of metabolically labeled p21 (after gel isolation and dephosphorylation) showed it to be indistinguishable from p21. Thus, one of the early events of T cell activation is the tyrosine phosphorylation of the zeta chain of the T cell antigen receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2003148658,"The fidelity of protein biosynthesis in any cell rests on the accuracy of aminoacylation of tRNA. The exquisite specificity of this reaction is critically dependent on the correct recognition of tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. It is shown here that the relative concentrations of a tRNA and its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are normally well balanced and crucial for maintenance of accurate aminoacylation. When Escherichia coli Gln-tRNA synthetase is overproduced in vivo, it incorrectly acylates the supF amber suppressor tRNA(Tyr) with Gln. This effect is abolished when the intracellular concentration of the cognate tRNA(Gln2) is also elevate. These data indicate that the presence of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and the cognate tRNAs in complexed form, which requires the proper balance of the two macromolecules, is critical in maintaining the fidelity of protein biosynthesis. Thus, limits exist on the relative levels of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases within a cell."

https://openalex.org/W1600112913,"The present study was undertaken to determine the mechanism by which phorbol ester stimulates eicosanoid synthesis in endothelial cells. We observed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) actively stimulated eicosanoid synthesis over a prolonged period of time, and the stimulatory effect was abolished by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. Western blot was employed to test the hypothesis that PMA elicited sustained eicosanoid synthesis via the stimulation of de novo synthesis of prostaglandin G/H synthase (cyclooxygenase, EC 1.14.99.1). Treatment of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in an enhancement of the 70-kDa immunoreactive prostaglandin G/H synthase band over the control cells treated with medium alone. The enhancement was abolished by cycloheximide. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were then metabolically labeled with L-[35S]methionine, and the effect of PMA on methionine incorporation was evaluated by immunoblotting. PMA increased the synthetic rate of prostaglandin G/H synthase over the control cells. By pulse-chase experiments, we further showed that prostaglandin G/H synthase has a rapid turnover rate (t1/2 less than 10 min) in control cells, and PMA had no effect on the enzyme turnover. Our data indicate that PMA increases the synthesis of prostaglandin G/H synthase which is required for circumventing the autoinactivation of prostaglandin G/H synthase and hence permit sustained conversion of arachidonic acid into eicosanoids."
https://openalex.org/W2003239166,"Two genome rearrangements involving 11- and 55-kilobase DNA elements occur during the terminal differentiation of an Anabaena photosynthetic vegetative cell into a nitrogen-fixing heterocyst. The xisA gene, located on the nifD 11-kilobase DNA element, was inactivated by recombination between the chromosome and a copy of the xisA gene that was mutated by inserting an antibiotic gene cassette. Site-directed inactivation of the Anabaena xisA gene blocked rearrangement of the 11-kilobase element and nitrogen fixation, but did not affect rearrangement of the 55-kilobase element, heterocyst differentiation, or heterocyst pattern formation."

https://openalex.org/W1491121781,"A Drosophila melanogaster gene for a basement membrane procollagen chain was recently identified from the sequence homology of the carboxyl (NC1) end of the polypeptide that it encodes with the corresponding domain of human and murine collagens IV (Blumberg, B., MacKrell, A. J., Olson, P. F., Kurkinen, M., Monson, J. M., Natzle, J. E., and Fessler, J. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5947-5950). This gene is at chromosome location 25C. Here we report the complete 6-kilobase cDNA sequence coding for a chain of 1775 amino acids, as well as the genomic structure. The gene is composed of nine relatively large exons separated by eight relatively small introns. This organization is different from the multiple small exons separated by large introns reported for mouse and human type IV collagens (Kurkinen, M., Bernard, M. P., Barlow, D. P., and Chow, L. T. (1985) Nature 317, 177-179. Sakurai, Y., Sullivan, M., and Yamada, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6654-6657. Soininen, R., Tikka, L., Chow, L., Pihlajaniemi, T., Kurkinen, M., Prockop, D. J., Boyd, C. D., and Tryggvason, K. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 1568-1572). Drosophila and human alpha 1(IV) procollagen chains share not only polypeptide domains near their amino and carboxyl ends for making specialized, intermolecular junctional complexes, but also 11 of 21 sites of imperfections of the collagen triple helix. However, neither the number nor the nature of the amino acids in these imperfections appear to have been conserved. These imperfections of the helical sequence may be important for the supramolecular assembly of basement membrane collagen. The 9 cysteine residues of the Drosophila collagen thread domain are arranged as several variations of a motif found in vertebrate collagens IV only near their amino ends, in their 7 S junctional domains. The relative positions of these cysteine residues provide numerous opportunities for disulfide bonding between molecules in both parallel and antiparallel arrays. There is a pseudorepeat of one-third of the thread length, and there are numerous possibilities for disulfide-linked microfibrils and networks. We propose that collagen microfibrils, stabilized by disulfide segment junctions, are a versatile ancestral form from which specialized collagen fibers and networks arose."
https://openalex.org/W1525000857,"Manduca sexta larvae respond to bacterial challenge by synthesizing a set of antibacterial hemolymph proteins. We have purified and sequenced three members of a family of cecropin D-like bactericidal peptides and isolated a cDNA clone complementary to a closely related bactericidin. Results obtained by Northern hybridization and RNase protection analysis showed that the increased synthesis of bactericidins is due to induction of their mRNA levels and that the synthesis of these peptides is not strictly tissue-specific, in contrast to previous beliefs. Although fat body was a richer source, the relative amounts of bactericidin mRNA were significant in seven other tissues examined."
https://openalex.org/W1494803482,"We have chemically synthesized the gene encoding bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and cloned it into a plasmid vector. This gene was then used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to produce the human bFGF gene and a gene coding for an analog in which serine residues were substituted for the cysteine residues at positions 70 and 88. All three constructs were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and the proteins purified. The recombinant human and bovine bFGFs exhibited the potent mitogenic activity toward both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which characterizes natural bFGF. The serine-70,88 analog and natural sequence bovine and human forms were equally active in all assays. Sulfhydryl titration of the purified recombinant bovine bFGF in 4.8 M guanidine hydrochloride indicated the presence of approximately two free sulfhydryl groups. This was consistent with the sequence analysis of peptides derived from trypsin digestion, which suggests that cysteines 70 and 88 exist in free sulfhydryl form while cysteines 26 and 93 form a disulfide bond. Circular dichroism shows that the protein has little ordered structure but is folded into a rigid tertiary configuration. Carboxymethylation of the free sulfhydryl groups resulted in no change in the mitogenic activity or conformation. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that, for tissue-derived bFGF, at least 2 of the 4 cysteines in the molecule are not involved in a disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1596823808,"Expression of cloned alpha and beta subunit genes of Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 C-phycocyanin in Escherichia coli led to the production of large amounts of apophycocyanin. The apophycocyanin was purified to homogeneity and shown to be an alpha beta monomer. The reactivity of the apoprotein toward a number of open chain and cyclic tetrapyrroles was examined. Phycocyanobilin (PCB), phycoerythrobilin, and biliverdin all formed covalent adducts with apophycocyanin in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. Mesobiliverdin, bilirubin, PCB dimethyl ester, protoporphyrin IX, and hemin did not react with the apoprotein. None of these tetrapyrroles reacted with 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, cysteine, or reduced glutathione under the same conditions. The adduct with PCB was investigated in greater detail. Its visible absorption spectrum, with a maximum at 646 nm, is more similar to that of allophycocyanin than phycocyanin. Two PCBs are bound per alpha beta monomer when the reaction is performed with excess bilin. While tryptic digestion of the adduct generates numerous bilin peptides, amino acid analysis of these chromopeptides revealed that PCB reacted specifically at alpha-Cys-84 and beta-Cys-82, two of the three cysteinyl residues that serve as the attachment sites for PCB in native phycocyanin. The major bilin peptides arising from in vitro adduct formation at each of these sites differed both in chromatographic behavior and in spectroscopic properties from the corresponding PCB peptides isolated from tryptic digests of native C-phycocyanin."
https://openalex.org/W1593255542,"Branched long-chain fatty acids of the iso and anteiso series are synthesized in many bacteria from the branched-chain alpha-keto acids of valine, leucine, and isoleucine after their decarboxylation followed by chain elongation. Two distinct branched-chain alpha-keto acid (BCKA) and pyruvate decarboxylases, which are considered to be responsible for primer synthesis, were detected in, and purified in homogenous form from Bacillus subtilis 168 strain by procedures including ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on ion exchange, reversed-phase, and gel absorption columns. The chemical and catalytic properties of the two decarboxylases were studied in detail. The removal of BCKA decarboxylase, using chromatographic fractionation, from the fatty acid synthetase significantly reduced its activity. The synthetase activity was completely lost upon immunoprecipitation of the decarboxylase. The removal of pyruvate decarboxylase by the above two methods, however, did not affect any activity of the fatty acid synthetase. Thus, BCKA decarboxylase, but not pyruvate decarboxylase, is essential for the synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. The very high affinity of BCKA decarboxylase toward branched-chain alpha-keto acids is responsible for its function in fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1590469201,"The interaction in vivo of 125I-labeled tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) with the rat liver and the various liver cell types was characterized. Intravenously injected 125I-t-PA was rapidly cleared from the plasma (t1/2 = 1 min), and 80% of the injected dose associated with the liver. After uptake, t-PA was rapidly degraded in the lysosomes. The interaction of 125I-t-PA with the liver could be inhibited by preinjection of the rats with ovalbumin or unlabeled t-PA. The intrahepatic recognition site(s) for t-PA were determined by subfractionation of the liver in parenchymal, endothelial, and Kupffer cells. It can be calculated that parenchymal cells are responsible for 54.5% of the interaction of t-PA with the liver, endothelial cells for 39.5%, and Kupffer cells for only 6%. The association of t-PA with parenchymal cells was not mediated by a carbohydrate-specific receptor and could only be inhibited by an excess of unlabeled t-PA, indicating involvement of a specific t-PA recognition site. The association of t-PA with endothelial cells could be inhibited 80% by the mannose-terminated glycoprotein ovalbumin, suggesting that the mannose receptor plays a major role in the recognition of t-PA by endothelial liver cells. An excess of unlabeled t-PA inhibited the association of 125I-t-PA to endothelial liver cells 95%, indicating that an additional specific t-PA recognition site may be responsible for 15% of the high affinity interaction of t-PA with this liver cell type. It is concluded that the uptake of t-PA by the liver is mainly mediated by two recognition systems: a specific t-PA site on parenchymal cells and the mannose receptor on endothelial liver cells. It is suggested that for the development of strategies to prolong the half-life of t-PA in the blood, the presence of both types of recognition systems has to be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2052331812,"The class II (Ia) major histocompatibility complex antigens are a family of integral membrane proteins whose expression is limited to certain cell types, predominantly B lymphocytes, macrophages, and thymic epithelial cells. In B cells, Ia expression is both developmentally regulated and responsive to external stimuli. The differentiation of early B stem cells to mature B lymphocytes is accompanied by the appearance of cell surface Ia antigens; the transition to plasma cells results in loss of class II gene expression. In Ia-expressing B cells, the T cell-derived lymphokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) increases such expression by an as yet undefined mechanism. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression was cis-activated by a region of the Ia A alpha k gene in a B lymphoma line, but not in a myeloma line. A nuclear protein that bound to two sites within this region, upstream from previously described transcription elements, was found in normal spleen cells. This binding activity was also found in spleen extracts from athymic mice, which lack T lymphocytes, and in Ia-positive B lymphocyte tumor cell lines, demonstrating that it is a B cell protein. Further analysis showed the activity to be undetectable in an Ia-negative pre-B cell line and in three plasmacytoma cell lines that are Ia negative. IL-4 treatment of normal and athymic mouse spleen cells greatly increased the binding of this nuclear protein to these two sites, concomitant with increased MHC class II gene transcription. Thus, B cells contain a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity whose level is influenced both by IL-4 and by differentiation signals."
https://openalex.org/W1482881562,"Maltase-glucoamylase (MGA) was immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of brush border membranes of the human small intestinal mucosa. Electrophoretic analysis of the precipitates under denaturing conditions revealed a single polypeptide of Mr = 335,000 in the presence or absence of reducing agents. Cross-linking of brush border membranes with the homobifunctional reagent dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) did not result in considerable changes in the electrophoretic pattern of MGA. In contrast, aminopeptidase N, used in these studies as a control glycoprotein of the brush border membrane revealed dimeric structures of its single subunit in the presence of dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate). These data suggest that MGA is expressed in the human small intestinal brush border as a monomeric polypeptide. The biosynthesis of MGA was studied by pulse-labeling of human intestinal biopsy specimens or mucosal explants in organ culture. Continuous labeling with [35S]methionine for 30 min revealed a single polypeptide high mannose precursor of Mr = 285,000 (MGAh) which matures after 4 h of labeling to the Mr = 335,000 as judged by the susceptibility of these two forms to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Owing to the absence of pancreatic secretions in the culture medium and the isolation of an identical species from nonlabeled mucosa, this result indicates that the Mr = 335,000 does not undergo an in situ extracellular cleavage by intraluminal proteases. Further, biosynthetically labeled, intracellularly cleaved polypeptides corresponding to the high mannose precursor or mature forms of MGA were not detected. The mature form of MGA (MGAm) bears in addition to N-linked glycans also O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides. In fact, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F treatment of MGAm followed by chemical deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid revealed approximately 35,000 daltons of O-linked sugars. Furthermore, MGAm as well as its N-linked sugars-depleted form bound to Helix pomatia lectin which has specificity toward Gal-GalNAc structures. In addition, the data were suggestive of a post-translational O-glycosylation of the molecule since (i) the high mannose precursor of MGA did not bind to H. pomatia lectin and (ii) its endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H or endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F form displayed an apparent molecular weight similar to that obtained upon endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F/trifluoromethanesulfonic acid deglycosylation. Finally, pulse-chase experiments revealed a relatively slow rate of post-translational processing of MGA in comparison to aminopeptidase N.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2049909535,"The induction of immunoglobulin kappa light chain expression in 70Z/3 pre-B cells treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) requires the activation of the B cell-specific factor NF-kappa B, which binds to the kappa enhancer motif, GGGACTTTCC. This sequence alone can function as a tissue-specific enhancer for LPS-induced gene expression. A potent inhibitor of B lymphopoiesis [transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)] was used to explore the mechanisms in the activation of kappa transcription by LPS and by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). TGF-beta inhibited LPS-induced kappa transcription but not the activation and in vitro binding of NF-kappa B. This indicates that NF-kappa B activation, while necessary, is not sufficient for LPS-induced kappa transcription. TGF-beta had no effect on IFN-gamma-induced kappa transcription, and NF-kappa B was not activated by IFN-gamma. These results reveal that LPS and IFN-gamma activate transcription through different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1591641472,"IL2-PE40 is a chimeric protein composed of human interleukin 2 (IL2) genetically fused to the amino terminus of a modified form of pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). Internalization of IL2 via the individual p55 and p70 subunits of the IL2 receptor was studied using IL2-PE40 on several mouse and human cell lines expressing either the p55, the p70, or both IL2 receptor subunits. Internalization was assessed by measuring inhibition of protein synthesis caused by the toxin moiety of IL2-PE40. The results demonstrate that IL2 internalization is mediated by either the p55 receptor subunit or by the p70 subunit but is much more efficient when high affinity receptors composed of both subunits are present. IL2-PE40 is a powerful reagent for studying IL2 receptor interactions and for analyzing pathways of the immune response and its regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1523608977,"Abstract We have isolated and characterized a 2.5-kilobase pairs genomic DNA fragment which includes the 5'-flanking region and the first and second exons of the human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I gene. The major transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension analysis and is 235 base pairs (bp) upstream from the AUG translational start codon in liver and 234 bp upstream in the intestine. TATA box-like and CAT box-like sequences and two GC box sequences are present in the intestine 30, 108, 220, and 440 bp upstream, respectively, from the transcriptional start site. Fragments of 570 bp (-487 to +71) and 2.15 kilobase pairs (-2067 to +99) containing the 5'-flanking region of the apoA-I gene were fused upstream to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. These constructs, designated pA-I(0.6)CAT and pA-I(2.2)CAT, respectively, were introduced into human oral epithelial cells (KB), mouse NIH 3T3 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human hepatoma cells (Hep G2), human duodenal epithelial cells (Hutu 80), and human colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2) by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. When compared with control vectors, highly efficient CAT expression of both the pA-I(0.6)CAT and pA-I(2.2)CAT constructs were observed only in cells derived from the liver (Hep G2) and intestine (Caco-2), which is consistent with the tissue specificity of expression of the native gene. Analysis of deletion mutants of the human apoA-I 5'-flanking region revealed that: 1) the region from -250 to -199 bp, from -487 to -413 bp, and -1021 to -691 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site contain sequences required for maximum gene expression; and 2) the regions from -2067 to -1476 bp and -199 to -80 bp contain the sequences required for tissue-specific repression of apoA-I gene expression in non-apoA-I producing cells."

To search for possible fatty acid acylation of the Rh polypeptide, intact human erythrocytes were incubated with [3H]palmitic acid prior to preparation of membranes and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Several membrane proteins were labeled, but none corresponded to the glycophorins or membrane proteins 1-8. An Mr = 32,000 band was prominently labeled on Rh (D)-negative and -positive erythrocytes and could be precipitated from the latter with anti-D. No similar protein was labeled on membranes from Rhmod erythrocytes, a rare phenotype lacking Rh antigens. Labeling of the Rh polypeptide most likely represents palmitic acid acylation through thioester linkages. The 3H label was not extracted with chloroform/methanol, but was quantitatively eluted with hydroxylamine and co-chromatographed with palmitohydroxamate and free palmitate by thin layer chromatography. The fatty acid acylations occurred independent of protein synthesis and were completely reversed by chase with unlabeled palmitate. It is concluded that the Rh polypeptide is fatty acid-acylated, being a major substrate of an acylation-deacylation mechanism associated with the erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1496756293,"The palmitoylation site of the membrane glycoprotein E1 of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) has been identified by chemical analysis of an acylpeptide. 3H-Palmitoylated E1 isolated from SFV grown in baby hamster kidney cells was digested with chymotrypsin and the resulting peptides subjected to high performance liquid chromatography on a wide-pore column. The 3H-acylated peptide fraction peaked at above 60% 2-propanol in the eluent, indicating its hydrophobic character. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a molecular weight of about Mr = 6000 for the radiolabeled peptide. Manual sequencing of this material by the 4-N,N'-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate/phenylisothiocyanate procedure on solid phase revealed the amino-terminal sequence Ala-Ala-Ser-His-Ser-Asn-Val-Val-Phe-Pro. The same peptide also labels with [35S]cysteine. Comparison with the deduced amino acid sequence of E1 revealed that the palmitoylated peptide contains at least 43 amino acid residues, and thus includes the membrane spanning region down to the only cysteine residue five positions up from the carboxyl terminus of E1. Since [3H]palmitic acid was cleaved from E1 with thiol reagents, and since the peptide labels with [14C]iodoacetamide only after the release of fatty acids by hydroxylamine treatment, cysteine in position 433 represents the palmitoylation site in SFV E1."
https://openalex.org/W1573937882,"MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, selected for resistance to adriamycin (AdrR), exhibit the phenotype of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous studies have shown that resistance in AdrR MCF-7 cells is associated with several biochemical changes that are similar to those induced in rat hyperplastic nodules, preneoplastic liver lesions which display broad spectrum resistance to carcinogens and hepatotoxins. In this report, we show that these changes in the AdrR MCF-7 cells are also associated with the development of cross-resistance to the procarcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BP) and are associated with a marked defect in the conversion of BP to its cytotoxic, carcinogenic metabolites by AdrR cells. Since aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase is the principle enzyme activity which converts benzo(a)pyrene to toxic hydroxylated forms, the regulation of cytochrome P-450IA1 expression, the gene encoding this enzyme activity in MCF-7 cells, was examined. Incubation with 100 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) for 24 h results in a marked increase in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in wild type (WT) but not AdrR MCF-7 cells. The alteration in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase expression in the AdrR cells is not overcome by incubation either with higher concentrations of TCDD (1 microM) or for longer periods of time (4 days). Northern blot analysis indicates that this defect in AdrR MCF-7 cells involves a regulatory defect at the level of P-450IA1 RNA. Following transfection of a construct containing the normal mouse P-450IA1 promoter fused to a reporter gene (bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) into WT and AdrR MCF-7 cells, TCDD induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in WT MCF-7 cells only. Furthermore, TCDD also induces both DT-diaphorase and UDP-glucuronyltransferase activities in WT, but not AdrR cells. These data suggest that the defect in the AdrR MCF-7 cells is not due to a structural P-450IA1 gene mutation, but rather involves a product regulating the polycyclic hydrocarbon-inducible expression of several drug-metabolizing enzyme activities. This defect in the AdrR MCF-7 cells is also associated with the development of resistance to ellipticine, an anticancer agent which is converted to more toxic hydroxylated species by aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase or a similar mixed function oxidase. The WT and AdrR MCF-7 cells represent a useful model to study the regulation of the P-450IA1 gene in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555927869,"Polysialoglycoproteins (PSGP), a class of glycoproteins containing oligo(poly)sialylglycan chains, are the major glycoprotein components in cortical alveoli of a number of Salmonidae fish eggs. Lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, egg PSGP (PSGP(Sn)) differs from rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, egg PSGP (PSGP(Sg)) in its sialic acid composition; the former contains both N-acetyl- and N-glycolyl-D-neuraminic acid residues, designated Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, while the latter contains only Neu5Gc residues. Fragmentation analysis of oligo(poly)sialyl chains in lake trout PSGP(Sn) has established that there are two distinct types of oligo(poly)sialyl structures in this PSGP molecule, namely alpha-2,8-linked oligo/poly(Neu5Ac) and alpha-2,8-linked oligo/poly(Neu5Gc). No hybrid structure having both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc residues in the fragment oligosialic acids was detected. These two distinct PSGP preparations from eggs of lake trout and rainbow trout have been used to compare their immunoreactivity with anti-polysialyl antibodies (H.46) and sensitivity to a bacteriophage-derived (Escherichia coli K1F) endo-N-acetylneuraminidase (Endo-N). H.46 was found to cross-react only with lake trout PSGP(Sn) in immunodiffusion assays but not with rainbow trout PSGP(Sg), indicating that H.46 is a specific probe for alpha-2,8-linked poly(Neu5Ac) but not for poly(Neu5Gc). In contrast, Endo-N was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of both alpha-2,8-linked poly (Neu5Ac) and poly(Neu5Gc), so that this enzyme can be used as a diagnostic reagent for detecting both types of polysialic acids. H.46 was used in indirect immunofluorescence experiments to localize PSGP(Sn) in cortical alveoli isolated from lake trout eggs."
https://openalex.org/W1528270154,"The role of diacylglycerol (DG) as a source of arachidonic acid during gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation of gonadotropin secretion was analyzed in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. An inhibitor of DG lipase (RHC 80267, RHC) caused dose-dependent blockade of GnRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. The DG lipase inhibitor did not alter gonadotropin responses to arachidonic acid, and addition of arachidonic acid reversed its inhibition of GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH release. In [3H]arachidonic acid-prelabeled cells, incubation with RHC increased the accumulation of [3H]DG. These results suggest that DG lipase participates in GnRH action and that arachidonic acid mobilization from DG is involved in the mechanism of gonadotropin release. Gonadotropin responses to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate and dioctanoyl glycerol were not altered by RHC, and the addition of these activators of protein kinase C (Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent enzyme) did not prevent the inhibition of GnRH-induced gonadotropin release by RHC. Activation of phospholipase A2 by melittin increased LH and FSH secretion, whereas blockade of this enzyme by quinacrine reduced GnRH-stimulated hormone release. However, RHC did not diminish the gonadotropin response to melittin. The inhibitory actions of RHC and quinacrine were additive and were reversed by concomitant treatment with arachidonic acid. Ionomycin also increased LH and FSH release, and the gonadotropin responses to the ionophore were unaltered by RHC but were reduced by quinacrine. Incubation of cells in Ca2+-depleted (+/- [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid) medium reduced but did not abolish the LH and FSH releasing activity of GnRH. Treatment with RHC also reduced the gonadotropin responses to GnRH under Ca2+-depleted conditions. These observations indicate that RHC inhibition of GnRH action is not due to nonspecific actions on Ca2+ entry, protein kinase C activation and actions, nor phospholipase A2 enzyme activity. The results of this study provide further evidence for an extracellular Ca2+-independent mechanism of GnRH action, and suggest that GnRH causes mobilization of arachidonic acid by two distinct lipases, namely, phospholipase A2 and DG lipase, during stimulation of gonadotropin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1578612053,"The D2-dopamine receptor from bovine anterior pituitary has been purified approximately 33,000-fold to apparent homogeneity by sequential use of affinity chromatography on immobilized carboxymethyleneoximinospiperone-Sepharose, Datura stramonium lectin-agarose, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purification yields a single polypeptide band of Mr approximately 120,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed by labeling with radioiodinated Bolton-Hunter reagent, Coomassie Blue, or silver staining. The purified D2 receptor preparations display a specific activity of approximately 5.3 nmol of [3H]spiperone bound per mg of protein. In detergent solutions, the purified receptor has a KD for [3H]spiperone of 5-8 nM; however, after reinsertion of the purified protein into phospholipid vesicles, a KD of approximately 160 pM is obtained, similar to that found for the receptor in crude membrane preparations. Several lines of evidence document that this polypeptide contains the ligand binding site as well as the functional activity of the D2 receptor. The Mr approximately 120,000 peptide can be covalently labeled by the affinity probe, 125I-bromoacetyl-N-(p-aminophenethyl)spiperone, with the pharmacological specificity expected of a D2-dopamine receptor. Agonist and antagonist ligands compete for [3H]spiperone binding to purified receptors in phospholipid vesicles with a rank order of potency and selectivity typical of a D2-dopamine receptor. Moreover, when reinserted into phospholipid vesicles with purified brain Gi/Go, the purified D2 receptors mediate the agonist stimulation of 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding to brain G-proteins with a typical D2-dopaminergic order of potency. These data suggest that we have purified an intact functional D2-dopamine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1587990155,"The specific activity of subtilisin E, an alkaline serine protease of Bacillus subtilis, was substantially increased by optimizing the amino acid residue at position 31 (Ile in the wild-type enzyme) in the vicinity of the catalytic triad of the enzyme. Eight uncharged amino acids (Cys, Ser, Thr, Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, and Phe) were introduced at this site, which is next to catalytic Asp32, using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and were prepared from the periplasmic space. Only the Val and Leu substitutions gave active enzyme, and the Leu31 mutant was found to have a greatly increased activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. The other six mutant enzymes showed a marked decrease in activity. This result indicates that a branched-chain amino acid at position 31 is essential for the expression of subtilisin activity and that the level of the activity depends on side chain structure. The purified Leu31 mutant enzyme was analyzed with respect to substrate specificity, heat stability, and optimal temperature. It was found that the Leu31 replacement caused a prominent 2-6-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) due to a larger kcat for peptide substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1562185119,"We have labeled the nucleoside triphosphate-binding domain of Escherichia coli rho factor with the ATP affinity analog [3H]pyridoxal 5′-diphospho-5′-adenosine (PLP-AMP). PLP-AMP completely inactivates the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of rho upon incorporation of 3 mol of reagent/mol of hexameric rho protein. Although the potency of PLP-AMP is enhanced when an RNA substrate such as poly(C) is present, the stoichiometry for inhibition remains the same as in the absence of poly(C). The nucleotide substrate ATP competes very effectively for the binding site and protects against PLP-AMP inactivation. A domain of rho called N2, which comprises the distal two-thirds of the molecule (residues 152-419) and encompasses the region proposed to bind ATP, is labeled specifically in the presence of poly(C). Amino acid sequence analysis of the single [3H]PLP-AMP labeled proteolytic fragment showed Lys181 to be the site of modification, suggesting that this residue normally interacts with the gamma-phosphoryl of bound ATP. These results agree with our proposed tertiary structure for the ATP-binding domain of rho that places this lysine residue in a flexible loop above a hydrophobic nucleotide-binding pocket comprised of several parallel beta-strands, similar to adenylate kinase, F1-ATPase, and related ATP-binding proteins. Parallel studies of rho structure and function by site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification support this interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W1537593003,"We have examined the role of lysyl residues in the binding of fd gene 5 protein to a nucleic acid polymer. The lysyl residues of the protein were chemically modified to form N epsilon, N epsilon-dimethyllysyl derivatives containing 13C-enriched methyl groups. The 13C NMR spectrum of the modified protein was studied as a function of pH and salt concentration. Differences in the local magnetic environment of the six dimethyllysyl amino groups allowed all six 13C resonances to be resolved for samples in the pH range 8.5-9.0 at less than 50 mM ionic strength. One of the dimethylamino resonances was split at low pH, indicating that the two methyl groups were nonequivalent and that the corresponding lysyl residue (either Lys-3 or Lys-7) might be involved in an ion-pairing interaction. Specific lysyl residues were protected from methylation when the protein was bound to poly(rU). The level of protection of individual lysyl residues was quantitated using peptide mapping and sequencing of gene 5 protein labeled with 3H and 14C radioactive labels. Lysines 24, 46, and 69 showed significant protection (33-52%) from methylation in the protein-polynucleotide complex, suggesting that these 3 residues form part of the nucleic acid-binding site. The alpha-amino group of Met-1 was relatively unreactive in both the free and bound protein, which indicated that the amino terminus is not as exposed in solution as in the crystal structure (Brayer, G.D., and McPherson, A. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 169, 565-596)."
https://openalex.org/W1563885878,"A chimeric plasminogen activator (t-PA/scu-PA-s), consisting of amino acids 1-263 of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and 144-411 of single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA), was previously shown to maintain the enzymatic properties of scu-PA but to have only partially acquired the fibrin affinity of t-PA, possibly as a result of steric interaction between the functional domains of t-PA and scu-PA (Nelles, L., Lijnen, H. R., Collen, D., and Holmes, W.E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10855-10862). Therefore, we now have constructed an extended chimeric t-PA/scu-PA protein, consisting of amino acids 1-274 of t-PA and 138-411 of scu-PA, which thus has an additional sequence of 17 residues in the region joining the two proteins. The highly purified extended chimeric protein (t-PA/scu-PA-e) was found to have similar specific activity on fibrin film (65,000 IU/mg), kinetic constants for the activation of plasminogen (Km = 1 microM, k2 = 0.0026 s-1), fibrin affinity (50% binding at a fibrin concentration of 3.3 g/liter), and fibrin specificity of clot lysis in a plasma environment (50% lysis in 2 h with 8 nM of the chimer) as the previously characterized chimeric protein (t-PA/scu-PA-s). Thus, unexpectedly, the fibrin affinity of t-PA is also only partially expressed in this extended chimeric protein. Therefore, the NH2-terminal chains (A-chains) of the plasmin-generated two-chain derivatives t-PA/tcu-PA-e, t-PA/tcu-PA-s, and of t-PA were isolated. These A-chain structures of the chimers were found to have lost most of their fibrin affinity, whereas the fibrin affinity of the A-chain of native t-PA was maintained. Differential reactivity of the A-chain structures of both chimeric molecules with monoclonal antibodies directed against the A-chain of t-PA suggested that they were conformationally altered. Sequential fibrin binding experiments with t-PA/scu-PA-e and t-PA/scu-PA-s yielded 45 +/- 8 (n = 11) and 43 +/- 5% (n = 8), respectively, binding in the first cycle and 44 +/- 7 (n = 11) and 27 +/- 10% (n = 8), respectively, binding in the second cycle. This suggests that the low affinity of the chimeric molecules for fibrin is not due to the occurrence of subpopulations of molecules with different fibrin affinity but, instead, to a uniformly decreased fibrin affinity in all molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1523394670,"The spontaneous reconstitution of lipid-protein complexes was examined by mixing bacteriorhodopsin or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase with preformed, unilamellar bilayers of pure dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. Spontaneous insertion of these proteins into vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine was facilitated by resonicating the vesicles at 4 degrees C. The property of resonicated vesicles that led to spontaneous reconstitution could be annealed by melting the bilayers, which slowed down reconstitution. The overall process of reconstitution consisted, however, of two steps. There was an initial insertion of proteins into a small portion of vesicles followed by subsequent fusion between protein-free vesicles and vesicles containing lipid-protein complexes. The first step appeared to proceed rapidly in all vesicles in a gel phase, whether or not they were resonicated or whether or not resonicated vesicles were annealed. The rate of the second step was sensitive to these treatments. The membrane proteins also inserted into preformed vesicles in a liquid crystalline phase, but this step was slower than for vesicles in a gel phase. Fusion between protein-free and protein-containing vesicles in a liquid crystalline phase was extremely slow. The data show that the spontaneous insertion of pure membrane proteins into preformed vesicles can be a facile event and that the overall reconstitution of membrane proteins into preformed unilamellar vesicles may be simpler to achieve than has been appreciated."

Previously reported values of the native molecular weight, determined by gel filtration, have ranged from 9,000 to 12,000. Thus, the native structure is likely a dimer (or larger aggregate) of identical subunits with the three disulfide bonds present occurring as intrachain links. Secondary structure predictions suggest a helical structure at the amino terminus. A comparison of the Er-1 amino acid sequence with known protein sequences did not reveal any significant similarities."
https://openalex.org/W1589810475,"Intermediate filaments have been proposed, via phosphorylation by protein kinase C, to be involved in sustained contraction of smooth muscle. We examined the effect of angiotensin II on the phosphorylation of the intermediate filament protein, vimentin, in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II induced phosphorylation of a Triton X-100- and high salt-insoluble protein with a molecular weight of 58,000. This protein was identified as vimentin based on its specific interaction with anti-vimentin antibody as detected by immunoblot analysis. Angiotensin II-induced phosphorylation of vimentin was time- and dose-dependent. Phosphorylation was detectable at 15 s, peaked at 2 min after angiotensin II stimulation, and gradually declined to a new plateau which was sustained for at least 30 min. The threshold, half-maximal and maximal concentrations of angiotensin II that stimulated vimentin phosphorylation were 0.01, 0.1, and 10 nM, respectively. The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, stimulated vimentin phosphorylation to the same extent as angiotensin II, whereas the protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, had only marginal effects on this reaction. Pretreatment of the cells with [ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid attenuated angiotensin II- and ionomycin-induced vimentin phosphorylation to the same extent. Down-regulation of protein kinase C induced by prolonged treatment of the cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not inhibit angiotensin II-induced vimentin phosphorylation. These results indicate that angiotensin II stimulates vimentin phosphorylation via a Ca2+-dependent, protein kinase C-independent mechanism in vascular smooth muscle cells and suggest that cytoskeletal proteins are major targets for angiotensin II-induced phosphorylation events."
https://openalex.org/W1602635727,"Nicotinamide 1,N6-ethenoadenine dinucleotide (etheno-NAD, epsilon-NAD), a fluorescent analogue of NAD, was able to serve as a substrate for the bacterial toxin-catalyzed epsilon-ADP ribosylation of signal-transducing G-proteins. Pertussis toxin and transducin were used as a model system to characterize this reaction. Similar to ADP ribosylation using NAD as substrate, the epsilon-ADP ribosylation occurs at the carboxyl-terminal 5-kDa tryptic fragment of the T alpha subunit of transducin with the same labeling stoichiometry; however, the rate of labeling is slightly slower. epsilon-NAD competes with NAD as a substrate which suggests that the epsilon-ADP ribosylation occurs at Cys-347 of the T alpha subunit. The biochemical effects of epsilon-ADP ribosylation on transducin are similar to those of ADP ribosylation and include inhibition of the GTPase and [3H]Gpp(NH)p-binding activities. The epsilon-ADP-ribosylated transducin exhibits a fluorescent spectrum which resembles that of epsilon-ADP with an excitation maximum at 292 nm and an emission maximum of 413 nm. Removal of the amino-terminal peptide of epsilon-ADP-ribosylated T alpha with either Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or trypsin results in a decrease in the emission intensity. This result suggests that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal peptides of the T alpha molecule may interact with each other as suggested previously (Hingorani, V. N., and Ho, Y.-K. (1987) FEBS Lett. 220, 15-22). epsilon-NAD should prove to be a useful fluorescent substrate for future studies of the ADP ribosylation reaction in biological systems."

F., and Clark, W. R. (1987) Nature 330, 71-72). We have examined the effect of extracellular Ca2+ on the inositol phosphate response to antigen by CTL. In Ca2+-containing medium relevant antigen-bearing target cells and the mitogen concanavalin A induce a rapid accumulation of inositol phosphates in CTL. In the presence of 4 mM EGTA the antigen- and mitogen-stimulated increases in inositol mono-, bis-, and tris-phosphates cannot be detected, even with 10 mM LiCl added. Abrogation of the inositol phosphate response occurs whether CTL are preincubated in EGTA or EGTA is added with the stimulus. The results indicate that the killing of certain target cells by murine CTL may be independent of the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol pathway. Furthermore, since Ca2+-independent cytolysis remains antigen-specific, the data strongly support the existence of additional T cell receptor-mediated second messenger pathway(s) in CTL."
https://openalex.org/W1676040214,"Ascorbic acid and Mg-ATP were found to regulate norepinephrine biosynthesis in intact secretory vesicles synergistically and specifically, using the model system of isolated bovine chromaffin granules. Dopamine uptake into chromaffin granules was shown to be unrelated to the presence of Mg-ATP and ascorbic acid at external dopamine concentrations of 7.5 and 10 mM. Under these conditions of dopamine uptake, norepinephrine biosynthesis was enhanced 5-6-fold by Mg-ATP and ascorbic acid compared to control experiments with dopamine only. Furthermore, norepinephrine formation was enhanced approximately 3-fold by ascorbic acid and Mg-ATP together compared to norepinephrine formation in granules incubated with either substance alone. The action of Mg-ATP and ascorbic acid together was synergistic and independent of dopamine content of chromaffin granules as well as of dopamine uptake. The apparent Km of norepinephrine formation for external ascorbic acid was 376 microM and for external Mg-ATP was 132 microM, consistent with the larger amounts of cytosolic ascorbic acid and ATP that are available to chromaffin granules. Other physiologic reducing agents were not able to increase norepinephrine biosynthesis in the presence or absence of Mg-ATP. In addition, maximum enhancement of norepinephrine biosynthesis occurred only with the nucleotide ATP and the cation magnesium. The mechanism of the effect of ascorbic acid and Mg-ATP on norepinephrine biosynthesis was investigated and appeared to be independent of a positive membrane potential. The effect was also not mediated by direct action of ADP, ATP, or magnesium on the activity of soluble or particulate dopamine beta-monooxygenase. These data indicate that Mg-ATP and ascorbic acid specifically and synergistically co-regulate dopamine beta-monooxygenase activity in intact chromaffin granules, independent of substrate uptake. Although the mechanism is not known, the data are consistent with the possibility that the chromaffin granule ATPase mediates these effects."
https://openalex.org/W1552715673,"Abstract Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) inhibits DNA polymerase activity of the intact multifunctional DNA polymerase alpha complex by binding at either of two sites which can be distinguished on the basis of differential substrate protection. One site (PLP site 1) corresponds to an important nucleotide-binding site which is distinct from the DNA polymerase active site and which appears to correspond to the DNA primase active site while the second site (PLP site 2) corresponds to the dNTP binding domain of the DNA polymerase active site. A method for the enzymatic synthesis of high specific activity [32P]PLP is described and this labeled PLP was used to identify the binding sites described above. PLP inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha activity was shown to involve the binding of only a few (one to two) molecules of PLP/molecule of DNA polymerase alpha, and this label is primarily found on the 148- and 46-kDa subunits although the 63-, 58-, and 49-kDa subunits are labeled to a lesser extent. Labeling of the 46-kDa subunit by [32P]PLP is the only labeling on the enzyme which is blocked or even diminished in the presence of nucleotide alone, and, therefore, this 46-kDa subunit contains PLP site 1. Labeling of the 148-kDa subunit is enhanced in the presence of template-primer, suggesting that this subunit undergoes a conformational change upon binding template-primer. Furthermore, labeling of the 148-kDa subunit is the only labeling on the enzyme which can be specifically blocked only by the binding of both template-primer and the correct dNTP in a stable ternary complex. Therefore, the 148-kDa subunit contains PLP site 2, which corresponds to the dNTP binding domain of the DNA polymerase active site."
https://openalex.org/W1552886023,"Conformational states of the ribosomal 5 S RNA molecule and its associated protein L1a in the yeast RNA-protein (RNP) complex were determined using controlled RNase T1 digestion in conjunction with fluorescence probes, ethidium bromide and bisanilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid. Fluorescence measurements indicated that the RNA molecule in the RNP complex appeared to exhibit a slightly lower degree of secondary structure than that in the free form. Controlled digestion of the intact RNP complex with RNase T1 resulted in an initial increase in ethidium fluorescence followed by a gradual decrease. In free RNA, a similar profile, except that a larger increase in ethidium fluorescence at the initial stage of digestion, was observed. During digestion of the RNP complex, increases in bisanilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence and in light scattering were observed. These findings implied that as regions of the 5 S RNA molecule were perturbed, hydrophobic regions in the protein became exposed. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the digestion products revealed a temporal appearance of discrete RNA fragments. Sequence analysis of these fragments generated information about the structural arrangement of the RNA molecule within the RNP complex. Results from the present investigation indicate that interactions between the 5 S RNA and protein L1a can stabilize functionally relevant conformations of the components that are individually labile. Properties of the separated components also suggest that special conditions, such as those suggested by Steitz et al. (Steitz, J. A., Berg, C., Hendrick, J. P., LaBranche-Chabot, H., Metspalu, A., Rinke, J., and Yario, T. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 545-556) may be involved for these components to associate during ribosomal assembly."
